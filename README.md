# SinergIA - La Uni처 en la Diversitat

## Project Summary
SinergIA is a multi-agent system designed to enhance the performance of language models through the integration of diverse expert agents. The project focuses on fine-tuning language models using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and evaluating their performance on the MedQA benchmark, which is a medical question-answering dataset. It also includes a user interface for interaction and visualization of results.

## Installation
### Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nilsduran/PIA.git
```
### Requirements
It is recommended to run the project in a virtual environment. 
```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv-stable
.\.venv-stable\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Include AI Studio API as an Environment Variable
To use the AI Studio API, you need to add the API key as an environment variable.
```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Execution
Per executar el sistema de conversa, utilitzeu el seg체ent comandament:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Benchmarks
Executing the benchmarks may take a couple of hours, depending on the number of questions and how many different model configurations you want to test.
For the MedQA LangGraph benchmark evaluation, use:
```bash
python langgraph_benchmark.py
```
For the performance evaluation of the fine-tuned LoRA language models, use:
```bash
python benchmarking.py
```
