Cis atracurium is preferred over atracurium due to advantage of:,Rapid onset,Sho duration of action,No histamine release,Less cardiodepressant,"Cis atracurium is a stereoisomer of Atracurium and is responsible for most pharmacological propeies. Unlike atracurium, cisatracurium does not produce a consistent dose dependent increase in plasma histamine. Another advantage of cis atracurium is that it produce less laudanosine. Atracurium triggers dose dependent histamine release that becomes significant at dose above 5mg/kg. The release is dose dependent such that with increasing dose administered at the same rate there is greater propensity for eliciting histamine release resulting in bronchospasm and hemodynamic instability.",C
What is the most common organism that causes infected abdominal aoic aneurysms (AAAs)?,Escherichia coli,Bacteroides,Salmonella,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"There are four different causes of an infected aneurysm. (1) Mycotic aneurysms involve a septic embolus from the hea infecting an aery. (2) Microbial aeritis involves bacteria infecting an athero- sclerotic aery to cause aneurysmal degeneration (80% of infected aneurysms). (4) Traumatic pseudoaneurysm that has concomitant bacterial inoculation. Salmonella causes 40% of all aneurysmal infections, with most others being caused by Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Blood cultures are positive in only 50% of cases.",C
The most common site of fracture neck of femur that causes avascular necrosis is,Sub-capital,Interochanteric,Trans-cervical,Basal,"A i.e. Subcapital Malunion is rarest complication of fracture neck femur (almost not seen) because intracapsular fracture neck femur almost never unite unless thay are anatomically reduced and stabliy fixed. Most common complications of intracapsular fracture neck femur are nonunioin & fixation failure (more common in most series of displaced fractures) and avascular necrosis (more common in most series of undisplaced fractures). Shoening is seen in almost all cases of nonunion & AVN. Chances of avascular necrosis (AVN) and nonunion increases as the fracture site becomes more proximal Q. The more proximal the fracture located the worse the prognosis. Chances of AVN & nonunion (or worseness of prognosis) in decreasing order is Subcapital Q > transcervical > basal > interochanteric Transphyseal > transcervical > cervicotrochanteric > interochanteric (in children) Complications of Hip Fractures Intracapsular Fracture Neck Femur Extracapsular Fracture Interochanteric Femur Most - Non union (in MalunionQ common displaced fracture) - Avascular (Osteo) necrosis (in undisplaced fracture) Least common MalunionQ NonunionQ Nonunion is second most common complication (after avascular necrosis) of undisplaced fracture neck femurQ. The probable causes of nonunion in fracture neck femur are - - Cambium layer of periosteum which produce callus is missing. There fore femoral neck must heal direct endosteal healing only. There is no contact with soft tissues which could promote callus formation. Precarious blood supply: by tearing the ascending cervical branches or retinacular vessels the injury deprives head of its main blood supplyQ. Synol fluid interfere with fracture healing as it prevents clotting of fracture hematoma and release angiogenic inhibiting factors. - Inadequate reduction and improper immobilization. * It is impoant to note that avascular necrosis and nonunion are independent events, because AVN is based on vascular supply of femoral head, whereas nonunion is based on the healing process. So AVN can occur even in united fractures. * Femoral neck fractures should unite by 6 months. If there is no evidence of healing or patient continued to have pain at 3 - 6 months after surgery then a delayed (3 months) or non union ( 6 months) should be contemplated. * AVN is a late complication and ischemic collapse usually occur with in 2 -years of fracture. According to anatomical location of fracture neck femur the chances of AVN & nonunion in decreasing order are: subcapital (transepiphyseal in children) > TranscervicalQ > Basicervical. - Temponade effect of intracapsular hematoma causing floating of both fracture ends and making reduction difficult.",A

A 58 year old male presents with hematuria. He s diagnosed of having bladder cancer which extends muscle deep. The best treatment is -,Intravesical Chemotherapy,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy,Radiotherapy,Tranurethral resection,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy Management of bladder cancero Cystoscopy and transurethral resection or biopsy# initially, any pt. with hematuria is examined by cystoscopy and any tumor seen is removed by transurethral resection (if possible) or biopsied.o Further treatment decisions are made after tumor staging on histology. Such decisions are based on tumor stage (TNM), grade, size, multiplicity, and recurrence patterno First see the staging (TNM)o The primary bladder cancer is staged according to the depth of invasion into the bladder wall or beyond The urothelial basement membrane separates superficial bladder cancers into Ta (noninvasive) and T1 (invasive) tumors. The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3. If the tumor involves contiguous structures such as the prostate, the vagina, the uterus, or the pelvic sidewall, the tumor is classified as stage T4.# Tis Ca in situ# Ta Ca confined to mucosa# T1 Ca confined to submucosa# T2 Muscle invasion# T3 perivescical fat invasion# T4 invasion of adjacent structures (prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abd. wall)o Now the histological grading.# There are 3 histological gradeso Grade I, II & IIIo There is a strong correlation between tumor grading and tumor recurrence progression and survival.Treatment options for bladder cancersCancer stageInitial treatment optionsTisComplete TUR followed by intravesical BCGTa (single, low-to- moderate grade, not recurrent)Complete TURTa (large, multiple, high grade, or recurrent)Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo-or immunologyT1Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo- or immunotherapy or radical cystectomyT2-T4Radical cystectomyNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cytectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapyConcomitant chemotherapy and irradiationAny T, N+, M+Systemic chemotherapy followed by selective surgery orirradiationo Intravesical therapy : Common agents used for intravesical therapy are# Mitomycin C# Thiotepa# BCGo Among these agents, BCG is the most effective.o The patient in question has T1 stage (Tumor upto submucosa)",B

"A patient presented to emergency ward with massive upper gastrointestinal bleed. On examination, he has mild splenomegaly. In the absence of any other information available, which of the following is the most appropriate therapeutic modality ?",Intravenous propranolol,Intravenous vasopressin,Intravenous pantoprazole,Intravenous somatostatin,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Intravenous pantoprozole Maingot states ""Because all sources of upper G.I. bleeding involves a disruption of mucosa, pharmacological inhibition of gastric acid secretion is provided empirically? So if the diagnosis of the patient with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding cannot be confirmed endoscopically the patient should be given any gastric acid inhibitor (either H2 blocker or P.P.I.). This is also justified as 80% of bleeding is from non-variceal source (peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophagitis) In the question the clinical features of the patient indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer. Variceal bleeding due to poal hypeension is very unlikely in the absence of moderate or massive splenomegaly (presence of mild splenomegaly is not enough evidence for variceal bleeding). So the most appropriate therapy in this case is pantoprozole whether you give it empirically or as a therapy for most likely clinical diagnosis Also know, In case of variceal bleeding somatostatin is more effective than vasopressin in control of bleeding.",C

Epidural narcotic is preferred over epidural Local anaesthetic for analgesia because -,Less respiratory depression,No retention of urine,No motor paralysis,Less dose required,"Epidural narcotics did not cause sympathetic depression or bladder dysfunction, and analgesia was segmental. The ideal opioid must cross the dura rapidly and enter the spinal cord, where it should bind with strong affinity to the opioid receptors in the substantia gelatinosa. Complications of epidural opioids even at these reduced doses still include nausea and vomiting (30-40%), sedation, respiratory depression (1%), as with parenteral routes, but to these can be added pruritus (10-50%) and urinary retention (5-40%). Pruritus is not due to histamine release but may respond to antihistamines; it will always respond to a small dose of naloxone without reducing analgesia. motor block , autonomic block not seen with epidural opioid",C

These functions include blood pressure, hea rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. Causes Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes. Autonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the hea, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils. Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with: Alcohol abuse Diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves Guillain Barre syndrome or other diseases that inflame nerves HIV/AIDS Inherited nerve disorders Multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Surgery or injury involving the nerves Symptoms Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on the nerves affected. They might include: Dizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure (ohostatic hypeension). Urinary problems, such as difficulty staing urination, incontinence, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder, which can lead to urinary tract infections. Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems in men. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heaburn, all due to changes in digestive function. Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there. Sweating abnormalities, such as sweating too much or too little, which affect the ability to regulate body temperature.

Regarding urinary bladder stone one is Not true ?,Common in Paediatric pt in tropics than that of non tropical areas,Uric acid stones are dropped from above,Jack stone is due to urea splitting bacteria,Commonly distal passage obstruction cause stone,"Answer is 'b' i.e. Uric acid stones are dropped from above It is the oxalate stones that are usually dropped from above (i.e. formed in the kidney and dropped in the bladder through ureter). Uric acid stones are mostly formed within the bladder. In general most of the bladder calculi are formed within the bladder itself. Only some stones are formed in the kidney and pass into the bladder, where they grow by additional deposition of crystals. Etiology for Bladder calculi Bladder outlet obstruction is the most common cause of vesical calculi in adults. Other causes are - neurogenic bladder leading to urinary stasis - a foreign body eg. Foley catheter and forgotten DJ stent, which serve as nidi for stones. - bladder diveicula Bladder stones are commonly seen in older men (>50 yrs.) usually because of bladder outlet obstruction In the Western world bladder stones are rare in pediatric population but bladder stones are endemic in children in underdeveloped nations (in Noh Africa, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia i.e. found near the tropics). This is because of low-protein, high carbohydrate diet and chronic dehdyration. These are usually ammonium urate stones. Common vesical stones are Uric acid stones & Struvite stones Other less common stone types are Oxalate stones Cystein stones Struvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones. Struvite stones are composed of ammonium, magnesium and calcium phosphates and occurs in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, eg. proteus.

Gall blader stone formation in influenced by AJE -,Clofibrate therapy,Hyperalimentation,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Hypercholesterolemia,"Hyper alimentation - decreases gall bladder motility, promotes stasis
Primary biliary cirrhosis - decreases bile salt secretion into bile
Clofibrate therapy - increases biliary cholesterol
thus these factors predispose to cholesterol stone formation.

Predisposing factors for cholesterol gall stone formation are
1. Demographic/genetic factors

Prevalence highest in North American Indians, Chilean Indians and Chilean Hispanics, greater in Northern Europe and North America than in Asia, lowest in Japan; familial disposition; hereditary aspects.

2. Obesity

Normal bile acid pool and secretion but increased biliary secretion of cholesterol

3.    Weight loss

Mobilization of tissue cholesterol leads to increased biliary cholesterol secretion while enterohepatic circulation of bile acid is increased

4. Female sex hormones

Estrogens stimulate hepatic lipoprotein receptors, increases uptake of dietary cholesterol, and increase biliary cholesterol secretion
Natural estrogens, other estrogens, and oral contraceptives lead to decreased bile salt secretion and decreased conversion of cholesterol to cholesteryl esters.

5. Increasing age

Increased biliary secretion of cholesterol, decreased size of bile acid pool, decreased secretion of bile salts.

6. Gallbladder hypomotility leading to stasis and formation of sludge

Prolonged parenteral nutrition
Fasting
Pregnancy
Drugs such as octreotide

7. Clofibrate therapy

Increased biliary secretion of cholesterol

8.    Decreased bile acid secretion

Primary biliary cirrhosis
Genetic defect of the CYP7A1 gene

9.    Decreased phospholipid secretion

Genetic defect of the MDR3 gene

10. Miscellaneous

The nerve fibers which are most sensitive to local anesthetic belong to ----- group,A,B,C,D,"Classification of peripheral nerves is impoant in determining the sequence of local anesthetic blockade. B fibers are the most sensitive. Dilation of cutaneous blood vessels is often the first sign of local anesthetic onset. C fibers and A-d are next-in sensitivity. They result in the inability to feel cool sensations such as an alcohol wipe. Next-in sensitivity are the A-g, A-b, and A-a fibers, which result in the loss of sensation, pressure, proprioception, and finally motor paralysis. Local anesthetic concentration must be adequate to block nerve fibers.

The fact that the infant was born at all is due to the body's ability to utilize fatty acids provided to it. However, all processes dependent upon de novo fatty acid biosynthesis are affected. The lungs, in paicular, require surfactant, a lipoprotein substance secreted by alveolar type II cells, to function properly. Surfactant lowers alveolar surface tension, facilitating gas exchange. It contains significant amounts of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Palmitate is the major end product of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Acetyl CoA carboxylase formation of malonyl CoA is the first step of fatty acid synthesis. Biotin deficiency cannot be the problem because pyruvate carboxylase in gluconeogenesis is not affected.

It is performed with the use of heavily T2-weighted MR pulse sequences. On heavily weighted T2 sequences, stationary or slow-flowing fluid within the bile and pancreatic ducts appear very bright relative to the low signal intensity produced by adjacent solid tissues.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a noninvasive technique for evaluating the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and the pancreatic duct.
Unlike conventional endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP does not require contrast material to be administered into the ductal system. Thus, the morbidity associated with endoscopic procedures and contrast materials is avoided. However, MRCP does not currently allow any intervention to be performed, such as stone extraction, stent insertion, or biopsy.
The technique is performed with the use of heavily T2-weighted MR pulse sequences. These had the effect of making stationary or slow-flowing fluid within the bile and pancreatic ducts to appear very bright relative to the low signal intensity produced by adjacent solid tissues.
Pulse sequences used in MRCP are RARE (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) and HASTE (half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo)
MRCP has established a role in the investigation of many biliary disorders, serving as a non-invasive alternative to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",D

However, there are several factors that can be optimized by the surgeon. Decreasing the bacterial inoculum and virulence by limiting the patient's prehospital stay, clipping the operative site in the operating room, administering perioperative antibiotics (within a 24-hour period surrounding operation) with an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum, treating remote infections, avoiding breaks in technique, using closed drainage systems (if needed at all) that exit the skin away from the surgical incision, and minimizing the duration of the operation have all been shown to decrease postoperative infection. Making a wound less orable to infection requires attention to basic Halstedian principles of hemostasis, anatomic dissection, and gentle handling of tissues as well as limiting the amount of foreign body and necrotic tissue in the wound. Although they are the most difficult factors to influence, host defense mechanisms can be improved by optimizing nutritional status, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.",B

Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following surgeries except ?,Cochlear implant,Microlaryngeal surgery,Vitreoretinal surgery,Exentration operation,"Exentration operation One major problem with N20 is that it will exchange with N2 in any air containing cavity in the body. Moreover, because of their differential blood : gas paition coefficients, nitrous oxide will enter the cavity faster than nitrogen escapes, thereby increasing the volume and/or pressure in the cavity. Examples of air collections that can be expanded by nitrous oxide are : - Pneumothorax - Air embolus - Obstructed middle ear - Obstructed loop of bowel - lntracranial air - A pulmonary (bleep) Nitrous oxide should be avoided in these clinical settings: Now lets move on to the options Nitrous oxide in vitreoretinal surgery The use of nitrous oxide anaesthesia in patients with an intraocular gas bubble is potentially sight threatening. Patients who have vitreoretinal surgery often have a gas bubble deliberately left within the eyes as it helps keep the retina attached while adhesions develop. Filtered room air, Sulfur hexqfluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases. By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N20 replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N20 the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: ? - Serous otitis media - Disaiculation of stapes - Impaired hearing N20 anaesthesia is hazadrous to hearing iu patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Microlaryngeal surgery CO2and (Nd : YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia. The CO2 laser can penetrate an endotracheal tube and ignite a fire. Nitrous oxide suppos combustion just like 02 and and may ignite fire.",D

This lesion needs to be fixed immediately.With continuing negative pressure in the chest, each breath sucks more of the abdominal contents into the chest and increases the likelihood of vascular compromise of the herniated viscera. While the diaphragm is easily fixed from the left chest, this injury should be approached from the abdomen. The possibility of injury below the diaphragm after sufficient blunt injury to rupture the diaphragm mandates examination of the intra-abdominal solid and hollow viscera; adequate exposure of the diaphragm to allow secure repair is possible from this approach.",C

Which anaesthetic agent increases intracranial tension among the following,Thiopentone,Propofol,Lignocaine,Sevoflurane,All inhalational anaesthetics directly act on cerebral blood vessels→vasodilatation→increase cerebral blood flow→ increase intracranial tension,D
Ketamine contraindicated in all except?,Head injury,Hypeension,Asthma,Glaucoma,"Ans. is `c' i.e., Asthma Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol&etomidate, which have cerebroprotectiveeffect, therefore ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, intracranial space occupying lesions and for neuroanaesthesia. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the aerial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT. Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant &vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and hea rate-Cardiac 02 demand is increased. Ketamine is contraindicated in aoic aneurysm, hypeensive and ischemic hea disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the hea to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur. As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation, it is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia. Ketamine increases intra-ocular tension - Contraindicated in glaucoma & open eye surgery. It is a potent bronchodilator and relieves bronchospasm - Intravenous anesthetic agent of choice in asthmatic (inhalational anaesthetic agent of choice in asthmatics is halothane) It increases uterine tone and intensity of uterine contraction - agent of choice in patients with obstetric haemorrhage and flaccid uterus. Injection of ketamine is not painful (all other i.v. inducing agents cause pain on injection).",C

Compensatory mechanisms during acute hemorrhage include,Decreased cerebral and coronary blood flow,Decreased myocardial contractility,Renal and splanchnic vasodilation,Increased respiratory rate,"Acute hemorrhage triggers the potent vasopressor activity of both angiotensin and vasopressin to increase blood flow to the heart and brain via selective vasoconstriction of the skin, kidneys, and splanchnic organs. Adrenergic discharge also results in selective vasoconstriction of skin, renal, and splanchnic vessels. Myocardial contractility and heart rate are increased, with a resultant increased cardiac output. Hyperventilation is the typical response to the metabolic (lactic) acidosis associated with hemorrhagic shock and hypoperfusion. Aldosterone release, with subsequent increased renal sodium resorption, is mediated by angiotensin II and ACTH, which prevents further intravascular depletion.",D

The following are impoant in maintenance of normal fecal continence except -,Anorectal angulation,Rectal innervation,Internal sphincter,Haustral valve,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Haustral valve Normal fecal continence requires - adequate rectal wall compliance to accommodate the fecal bolus. appropriate neurogenic control of the pelvic floor and sphincter mechanism, and - functional internal and external sphincter muscles At rest the puborectalis muscle creates a 'sling' around the distal rectum, forming a relatively acute angle (Anorectal angle). Anorectal angle distributes intraabdominal forces onto the pelvic floor and play an impoant role in the continence mechanism. At the time of defecation, this angle straightens, allowing the downward force to be applied along the axis of the rectum and anal canal. The internal & external sphincters are tonically active at rest. - the internal sphincter is responsible for most of the resting, involuntary sphincter force - the external sphincter is responsible for voluntary sphincter force. Both the internal and external sphincters are innervated by pudendal nerve. Finally, the hemorrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically blocking the anal canal. Thus impaired continence may result from : - poor rectal compliance - injury to internal and/or external sphincter or puborectalis, or - nerve damage or neuropathy",D

Action of scoline is potentiated by?,Nitrous oxide,Sevoflurane,Isoflurane,Halothane,"Ans. A. Nitrous oxide. (Ref. Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428; Miller 7th/pg. 867)Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428 ..............'The mean dose of scoline producing 95% blockade (ED95) at the adductor pollicis is 0.30 to 0.35 mg/kg with opioid- nitrous oxide anesthesia. In the absence of nitrous oxide, the ED95 is increased to 0.5 mg/kg"".DEPOLARIZING DRUGS: SUCCINYLCHOLINENeuromuscular Effects# depolarizes presynaptic, postsynaptic, and extrajunctional receptors.# Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis is manifest, some disorganized muscular activity is observed frequently (""fasciculations"") and is probably a result of depolarization of the nerve terminal produced by activation of presynaptic receptors.# In some muscles, like the masseter and to a lesser extent the adductor pollicis, a sustained increase in tension that may last for several minutes can be observed (spasm).Characteristics of Depolarizing Blockade# After injection of succinylcholine, single-twitch height is decreased. However, the response to high-frequency stimulation is sustained: minimal train-of-four and tetanic fade is observed. The block is antagonized by nondepolarizing agents so that the ED95 is increased by a factor two if a small dose of nondepolarizing drug is given before.# Succinylcholine blockade is potentiated by inhibitors of acetyl cholinesterase, such as neostigmine and edrophonium.# Phase II Block: After administration of 7 to 10 mg/kg, or 30 to 60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, train- of-four and tetanic fade become apparent. Neostigmine or edrophonium can antagonize this block, which has been termed ""nondepolarizing,"" ""dual,"" or ""Phase II block."" The onset of Phase II block coincides with tachyphylaxis, as more succinylcholine is required for the same effect.Pharmacology of Succinylcholine# Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase (also called pseudocholinesterase), with an elimination half-life of <1 minute in patients. Because of the rapid disappearance of succinylcholine from plasma, the maximum effect is reached quickly.# Plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced by some anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine) so that the duration of succinylcholine given after neostigmine, but not after edrophonium, is increased.Side Effects# Sinus bradycardia with nodal or ventricular escape beats.- Anaphylaxis# Fasciculations- Muscle Pains# increases intragastric pressure- Hyperkalemia# increases intraocular Pressure & ICP Clinical Uses# to facilitate tracheal intubation (adult dose of 1.0 mg/kg; Children are slightly more resistant to succinylcholine than adults, and doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg are required to facilitate intubation. In infants, 2 to 3 mg/kg may be required. Precurarization is not necessary in patients younger than 10 years).# ""rapid sequence induction"" ( patient with full stomach and possibility of aspiration).# Succinylcholine, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, is the only effective intramuscular neuromuscular blocking agent in children with difficult intravenous access and provides adequate intubating conditions in about 4 minutes. However, this route of administration should not be the method of choice.Additional Educational points:Sevoflurane:# Fast induction and emergence# Rapid changes in depth can be achieved.# Acceptability is good by pediatric patients (agent of choice for induction in children).# Hepatic blood flow is maintained.# Does not cause sympathetic stimulation and airway irritation even during rapid induction.# Amount of fluoride liberated is safe for kidney and liver.# Degraded by sodalime - hence not recommended for use in closed circuit.",A

True about Aoic transection:,Most commonly due to deceleration injury,High moality,Surgery definitive treatment,All,"Ans. is all Blunt Aoic injury * Main pathophysiological cause is sudden deceleration with creation of a shear force between the fixed and relatively mobile segment of aoa. The classic examples are frontal collision in motor vehicle injury or a fall from height. Most common site is --> proximal descending thoracic aoa Investigation - Spiral CT scan is used for screening, and if mediastinal hematoma found, an aoography or CT angiography is done to clearly define the site and extent of injury. Aoography is the gold standard imaging modality. - CT angiography is rapidly becoming an imaging modality that rivals aoography and as technology improves may soon replace aoography as the imaging modality of choice. Management The traditional management is prompt surgical repair of the injured aoic segmenet. However in some patients a purposeful delay or even non-operative management is done. Patients with associated severe head injury or other complex multisystem injury are unable to tolerate the aoic repair and reconstructive surgery. Use of early blood pressure control and afterload reduction conves these cases from urgent to delayed cases, and can be repaired next day or several days later and can be transferred to higher centres with expes. Non-operative management can be tried in minimal blunt aoic injury (such as small intimal flap or a small pseudoaneurysm). However long term behaviour of these minimal injuries managed non-operatively is not known and hence they must be monitored by serial imaging. Use of endovascular graft is fast gaining in popularity despite lack of controlled trials and long term follow-up. This is due to significantly decreased moality and morbidity associated with use of grafts in comparison to open thoracic aoic repair. Endovascular grafts are paicularly attractive for patients who are poor candidates for open thoracic aoic repairs such as those with multiple associated injuries or in whom systemic heparin is contraindicated.",D

Using monopolar cautery is not advised when a child is undergoing circumcision as it may lead to coagulation of penis. The mechanism is,Channeling,Capacitance coupling,Electrocution,Explosion,"Channelling: Heat is produced wherever the current intensity is greatest. Normally, this would be at the tip of the active electrode, but if current passes up a narrow channel or pedicle to the active electrode, enough heat may be generated within this channel or pedicle to coagulate the tissues. This can prove disastrous, for example:coagulation of the penis in a child undergoing circumcision;coagulation of the spermatic cord when the electrode is applied to the testis.Capacitance coupling: This is a phenomenon in which a capacitor is created by having an insulator sandwiched between two metal electrodes.

Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases.",B

Cobra head appearance on excretory urography is suggestive of:,Horseshoe kidney,Duplication of renal pelvis,Simple cyst of kidney,Ureterocele,"The term ureterocele denotes a cystic ballooning of the distal end of the ureter. This type of ureterocele is also termed ohotopic, since it arises from a ureter with a normal inseion into the trigone. An intravesical ureterocele results from the prolapse of the mucosa of the terminal segment of the ureter through the ureterovesical orifice into the bladder. This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder. On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.

Commonest treatment of Branchial cyst,Cystectomy,Aspiration,Excision,Nothing done,"A branchial cyst probably develops from the vestigial remnants of the second branchial cleft, is usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. The cyst usually presents in the upper neck in early or middle adulthood and is found at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages so that it may be difficult to palpate. If the cyst becomes infected it becomes erythematous and tender and, on occasions, it may be difficult to differentiate from a tuberculous abscess. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration both aid diagnosis and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undeaken when the lesion is quiescent. Although the anterior aspect of the cyst is easy to dissect, it may pass backwards and upwards through the bifurcation of the common carotid. Bailey & Love,5th,727",C

Multiple cutaneous sebaceous adenomas are seen in:,Cowden syndrome,Gardner syndrome,Turcot syndrome,Muir Torre syndrome,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Muir Torre syndrome Multiple sebaceous Neoplasms (adenomas) are characterstics of Muir Torre syndrome. Muir-Torre syndrome Muir-Tone syndrome is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome. The hallmark of Muir-Tone syndrome is presence of numerous sebaceous gland neoplasms, including carcinomas that may precede, follow, or coexist with visceral cancers. Visceral cancers associated with MTS are - GI tract adenocarcinoma of the colon or genitourinary tract, or lymphoma. The defining feature of this syndrome is the combination of sebaceous gland tumours and at least one visceral cancer. Typical skin tumours associated with this syndrome include sebaceous adenomas, epitheliomas and carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas with sebaceous differentiation also occur. All these sebaceous gland tumours are rare in the general population; the finding of such a tumour is a marker for MTS. Early recognition of the syndrome in patients with sebaceous gland tumours should facilitate early detection of subsequent malignancies if the patient is entered into appropriate screening programmes. Colorectal cancer is the commonest visceral neoplasm to occur in MTS. Cutaneous neoplasms Visceral malignancies * Sebaceous adenomas * GIT malignancies most Muir Torre * sebaceous epitheliomas commonly colorectal ca syndrome * sebaceous carcinomas * Genitourinary ca * Keratocanthoma * Basal cell carcinoma Other options: Cowden's disease or multiple hamaoma syndrome is an autosomal-dominant syndrome with numerous tumors of the hair follicles called tricholemmomas located on the face. These patients have very high risk of breast and thyroid carcinomas. Bilateral mastectomies may be recommended. Mammography and other exposure of the breast tissue to 0 radiation is contraindicated. Multiple Hamaomatous polyps occur anywhere in the GI tract. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP; familial adenomatous polyposis, a colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an inevitable progression to colorectal cancer by age 40. Cutaneous manifestations may be the presenting sign and include numerous epidermal cysts and soft tissue tumors. Osteomas of mandible and skull are the most common facial lesions in Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Epidermoid cysts - Desmoid tumors - Osteomas - Thyroid neoplasms, and - Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium Turcot's syndrome is also a variant of FAP characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Brain tumors (Medulloblastoma, Glioblastoma multiforme) Also Know: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome or Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas, numerous bony abnormalities, and a strong predisposition for malignancy.

"In follow up of BPH, a most important indication of surgery is:",Prostate size >75gm,Single episode of UTI requiring 3 day antibiotics,Cannot use medication due to hypertension,Bilateral hydronephrosis,"""Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones.""- Schwartz 8/e p1.530
About other options:
Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwartz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology I7/e p.3.54)
UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypertension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypertensive persons.
Management of BPH
Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below.
Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH

Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal)
Recurrent UTI from BPH
Bladder stones d/t BPH
Renal insufficiency d/t BPH
Large bladder diverticula secondary to BPH
Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH


Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwartz.

Medical therapy
Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin)

Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base.

5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) -

5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use).

Surgery

Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed.
The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate.

Conventional surgical methods:

Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method)
Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)
Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) -


When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes ""too large"" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.
Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology.

Minimally invasive methods:

Laser therapy (Nd:YAG and holmium:YAG )
Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate
Microwave Hyperthermia
Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate-
High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation
Intraurethral stents—stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent. They are usually covered by urothelium within 4-6 months after insertion. These devices are typically used for patients with limited life expectancy who are not deemed to be appropriate candidates for surgery or anesthesia.",D

The mortality rate of emergency operation for abdominal aortic aneurysm is:,1%,5%,20%,50%,"In elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the operative mortality rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally approximates 45- 50%.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm.
An aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta with a diameter of at least 1.5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aortic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal.
A most common site is infrarenal.
More common in males than females.
Incidence increases with age.
At least 90% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms >4.0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease.
Prognosis is related to both the size of an aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease.
The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of an aneurysm.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons.
As abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening.
Contrast-enhanced CT is an investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if the use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size
Operative repair of an aneurysm with the insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aortic stent graft is indicated for:
abdominal aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms.
for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5.5 cm.
The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in part on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions.
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has a lower short-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e)
In Elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm the operative mortality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",D
Dysphagia mainly for liquids is seen with,Achalasia cardia,Zenker diverticulum,Barret esophagus,Diffuse esophageal spasm,"Ans. (a) Achalasia Cardia* Achalasia is a rare disease caused by loss of inhibitory ganglion cells within the esophageal myenteric plexus* It leads to a hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) which fails to relax on swallowing, and by aperistalsis of the body of the oesophagus.* Long-standing achalasia is characterized by progressive dilatation and sigmoid deformity of the esophagus with hypertrophy of the LES.Clinical Presentation* Progressive dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom. It generally concerns initially liquids and later both liquids and solids from the outset.# Dysphagia: Liquids > Solid* The second most common symptom is the regurgitation of undigested food during or shortly after a meal.Investigation* Screening: Barium study- Bird beak appearance* IOC: ManometryTreatment* Medical management:# Calcium channel blockers# Nitrates# Botulinum toxin (injected into the LES under endoscopic guidance)* Surgical management:# Harrison states: ""The only durable therapies for achalasia are pneumatic dilatation and Heller myotomy""# Surgery of choice: Heller's myotomy",A

A congenital hydrocele is treated by?,No treatment before 5 years,Herniorraphy,Herniotomy,Eversion of sac,"""Congenital hydrocele will resolve spontaneously within 1 year. The operation is required only when it persists for longer than 1 year” In congenital hydrocele, the processes vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.
""Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously” Treatment usually, no treatment of congenital hydrocele is indicated because this condition typically resolves spontaneously by age 1. Most surgeons advocate observation in the majority of infants less than 12 months. Others may continue to be observed for longer, as the majority of patent processes vaginalis will close within the first 12-24 months of life",C
Which of the following is true regarding medullary carcinoma of the thyroid -,Arises from parafollicular cells,Secretes calcitonin,Occurs in families,All,"Ans. is 'a' Arises from parafollicular cells, 'b' Secretes calcitonin, 'c' Occurs in families Medullary Ca of thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the calcitonin secreting parafollicular cells (C cells) of thyroid which in turn are derived from the ultimobranchial bodies (These C cells are concentrated superlaterally in the thyroid lobes, which is where MTC usually develops) Most MTCs (75-80%) arise sporadically. The remainder occurs in the setting of MEN syndromes 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome. - The sporadic MTCs tend to originate in one lobe, whereas bilaterality and multicentricity is common in familial cases. The familial cases are also associated with C-cell hyperplasia, which is considered premalignant lesion of MTC. - Familial cases occur at a younger age, even childhood. Sporadic cases are seen in 6th decade. RET proto-oncogenes are known to play an impoant role in the development of both familial & sporadic MTCs. Patients with MTC often present with a neck mass that may be associated with palpable cervical lymphadenopathy (early spread to lymphatics is common) Diarrhoea is a feature in 30% of cases and this may be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine or prostaglandins produced by the tumour cells. (Ref B & L 25/e p797) Distal blood-borne metastasis to the liver, bone (frequently osteoblastic), and lung occur late in the disease. Diagnosis is established by FNAC - presence of amyloid stroma is diagnostic. raised serum calcitonin and CEA levels (Calcitonin is a more sensitive tumor marker, but CEA is a better predictor of prognosis) As it is not possible to distinguish sporadic from familial disease at initial presentation, all new patients with MTC should be screened for RET point mutations - pheochromocytoma (24 hr urinary levels of VMA, catecholamine & metanephrine) - hyperparathyroidism (serum calcium) (It is impoant to rule out a coexisting pheochromocytoma to avoid precipitating a hypeensive crisis & death during surgery) Also remember - MTC tumors don't take up radioiodine and are not hormone dependent.",D

"An 8 year old boy with a history of fall from 10 feet height complains of pain in the right ankle. X-ray taken at that time are normal without any fracture line. But after 2 years, he developed a calcaneovalgus deformity. The diagnosis is:",Undiagnosed malunited fracture,Avascular necrosis talus,Tibial epiphyseal injury,Ligamentous injury of ankle joint,"Epiphysial fractures are more common than ligamentous injuries in children since the ligaments of the joints are generally stronger than their associated growth plates. Fractures across the growth plate may produce bony bridges that will cause premature cessation of growth or angular deformities of the extremity. These bridges are due to the trauma to the growth plate and can occur even with adequate reductions. Epiphysial fractures around the shoulder, wrist, and fingers can usually be treated by closed reduction, but fractures of the epiphyses around the elbow often require open reduction. In the lower extremity, accurate reduction of the epiphysial plate is necessary to prevent joint deformity when a joint surface is involved. If angular deformities result, corrective osteotomy may be necessary. Ref: Erickson M.A., Merritt C., Polousky J.D. (2012). Chapter 26. Ohopedics. In W.W. Hay, Jr., M.J. Levin, R.R. Deterding, J.J.

Pituitary adenomas are classified on the basis of hormone(s) produced by the neoplastic cells detected by immunohistochemical stains.
Most common pituitary adenomas are prolactinomas.
Pituitary adenomas can be differentiated from hyperplasia by reticulin stain (Absence of reticulin network is seen in adenoma)
Pituitary adenomas are sellar lesions but larger adenomas can extend through the diaphragm sella into the suprasellar region and compress the optic chiasm (causing visual field abnormalities) and other cranial nerves. Large adenomas can also erode the sellar turcica and extend into surrounding region (k/a invasive adenomas)

More about Pituitary adenomas 

It is the most common cause of hyperpituitarism.
Pituitary adenomas can be

- functional (i.e. associated with hormone excess and their clinical manifestations) or
- silent (i.e. without clinical symptoms of hormone excess. May or may not produce hormone)

Prolactinomas are the most common adenomas
Some pituitary adenomas can secrete two hormones - Growth hormone and prolactin being the most common combination
Rarely adenomas are plurihormonal
Age : usually found in adults
Gender

Prolactinomas have 4-5 : 1 female/male ratio
GH secreting adenomas have 2:1 male predominance.

Clinical signs & symptoms - occur due to hormone excess or mass effect (visual field disturbances, elevated intracranial pressure or occasionally hypopitutarism - d/t silent adenomas compressing normal pituitary)

"Child presents with recurrent abdominal pain and bilious vomiting. Condition was diagnosed by barium follow through. Surgery was done, - mesentric widening, appendicectomy, cutting the Ladd's band. What is the diagnosis?",Recurrent Caecal volvulus,Mal rotation,Recurrent appendicitis,Stricture TB,"Malrotation The surgey mentioned in the question is Ladd's procedure done for malrotation. 3 things are done: A. Lysis of cecal and duodenal bands. B. Broadening of the mesentery. C. Appendectomy. Obstruction in a patient with malrotation can occur because of mid gut volvulus or because of bands (Ladd's band). Midgut volvulus can occur at any age, although it is seen most often in the first few weeks of life. Bilious vomiting is usually the first sign of volvulus, and all infants with bilious vomiting must be evaluated rapidly to ensure that they do not have intestinal malrotation with volvulus. When volvulus is suspected, early surgical intervention is done to avoid or reverse the ischemic process. Surgery: Volvulus occurs clockwise, and it is therefore untwisted counterclockwise. (This can be remembered by using the memory aid ""Turn back the hands of time."") Subsequently, Ladd's procedure is performed. This operation does not correct the malrotation but does broaden the narrow mesenteric pedicle to prevent volvulus from recurring. Steps done in Ladd's procedure are: - duodenal and cecal bands are divided, - Broadening of the mesentery - The appendix is removed to avoid diagnostic errors in later life. This maneuver brings the straightened duodenum into the right lower quadrant and the cecum into the left lower quadrant. Note that: A subset of patients with malrotation can also present with incomplete obstruction or chronic obstruction. (so the patient here in this question has either incomplete volvulus or obstruction because of-duodenal hand) Ladd's procedure is performed to prevent voluvulus ; however, volvulus can still occur rarely after Ladd's procedure.",B

A patient in ICU seemed to be very aggressive and restless. He is pulling out all the i.v lines. Duty doctor administered a muscle relaxant which has a fast onset of action and asked the nurse to sta iv fluids. Which among the following muscle relaxant has the fastest onset of action?,Vecuronium,Rocuronium,Mevacuronium,Atracuronium,"Rocuronium is a monoquaternary steroid analogue of vecuronium was designed to provide a rapid onset of action. Rocuronium is the fastest acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Rocuronium (at a dose of 0.9-1.2 mg/kg) has an onset of action that approaches succinylcholine (60-90 s), making it a suitable alternative for rapid-sequence induction. Rocuronium is less potent than most other steroidal muscle relaxants (potency appears to be inversely related to speed of onset). Because rocuronium does not have active metabolites, it may be a better choice than vecuronium for prolonged infusions. Its duration of action is not significantly affected by renal disease, but it is modestly prolonged by severe hepatic failure and pregnancy. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.E., Mikhail M.S., Murray M.J. (2006).

It is also the most common type of cancer that occurs outside the eyeball.# BCC of the eyelid usually affects adults, but may also occur in younger people.# These tumours are related to sun exposure and are similar to basal cell carcinoma of the skin.# BCC most often occurs in the lower eyelidb. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)# SCC of the eyelid is uncommon, accounting for about 5% of all eyelid tumours.# It can occur from a precancerous condition, such as actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease.# These tumours are also related to sun exposure and are similar to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.# SCC tends to behave more aggressively and is more likely to spread than BCC.c. Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC)# SGC is cancer of the glands in the eyelid.# It is a rare tumour that may account for up to 5% of all eyelid cancers.# It occurs more often in women than men and occurs most often in the elderly.# These tumours develop most often on the upper eyelid, followed by the lower eyelid and the caruncleo SGC can start in the Meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or the sebaceous glands of the caruncle.# SGC is often diagnosed at a later stage because it can mimic benign conditions. It can also grow aggressively.# SGC may be multifocal (occurring in more than one place), so they have a tendency to recur after treatmentd Malignant melanoma# Melanoma of the eyelid is very uncommon and accounts for less than 1% of all eyelid cancers.# Melanoma of the eyelid is similar to melanoma of the skin of the skin.

A male with azoospermia found to have normal FSH & testosterone levels & normal size testes. Probable cause is,Vas obstruction,Kallman syndrome,Undescended testis,Klinefelter's syndrome,"Bilateral vas obstruction can cause azoospermia with normal FSH and testosterone levels and normal sized testis. Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis. It is characterized by low luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimu- lating hormone (FSH) levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol). Patients with undescended testis have different FSH and LH levels with the level of sperm density and spermatogenesis. The FSH levels in men are usually inversely correlated with sperm counts and indicate the integrity of seminiferous tubules, a marker of spermatogenesis. Patients with bilateral undescended testes have significantly lower sperm motility, sperm concentration, testicular volume and inhibin B levels, while showing higher FSH and LH levels than those with unilateral undescended testis. Klinefelter's Syndrome is characterized by small testes, infeility, gynecomastia, tall stature/increased leg length, and hypogonadism in phenotypic males.Plasma concentrations of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) are increased in most adults with 47,XXY, and plasma testosterone is decreased (50-75%), reflecting primary gonadal failure.

This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",D

True about solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is alUexcept,Increased muscle layer proliferation,Crypt distoion,Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte,Subepithelial fibrosis,"Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte Histopathology of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome shows hypocellular lamina propria. There is relative absence of inflammatory cells Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology writes - ""There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), but without the dense lamina propria inflammation."" Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome The pathogenesis of mucosa/ prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS. SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age. Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction. Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa. Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration. The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, paicularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial poion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosa' hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium. In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudomembrane. The cells show enlarged, hyperchronzatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells",C

A 25 year old overweight female was given fentanyl-pancuronium anesthesia for surgery. After surgery and extubation she was observed to have limited movement of the upper body and chest wall in the recovery room. She was conscious and ale but voluntary respiratory effo was limited. Her blood pressure and hea rate were normal. The likely diagnosis is:,Incomplete reversal of pancuronium,Pulmonary embolism,Fentanyl induced chest wall rigidity,Respiratory depression,"Patient with limited movement of the upper body and chest wall and limited respiratory effo after receiving a long acting muscle relaxant pancuronium is showing features of incomplete reversal from the effects of muscle relaxant drug. Factors affecting rate of recovery of neuromuscular activity after reversal depend upon: 1. Intensity of block - greater the intensity of block at the time or reversal longer the recovery of neuromuscular activity. 2. Dose. 3. Choice of neuromuscular blocking agent - Overall recovery of intermediate acting agents (atracuium, vecuronium, mivacurium, rocuronium) following same dose of anticholinesterase is more rapid and more complete than after pancuronium. 4. Age - recovery occur more rapidly with smaller doses of anticholinesterases in infants and children than adults. 5. Drug interactions 6. Renal failure.

Acute intestinal obstruction is characterized by -a) Vomiting is common in duodenal obstructionb) Pain after each attack of vomiting is characteristic of ileal obstructionc) In colonic obstruction distension is common than vomitingd) X-ray erect posture is diagnostice) Colicky pain to steady pain indicates strangulation,abc,ad,acd,bde,"Clinical features of small intestinal obstruction
Abdominal pain

Pain is crampy in nature and tends to be more severe the distal the obstruction.
the pain occurs in paroxysms and the patient is relatively comfortable in the intervals between the pain.
audible borborygmi are often noted by the patient simultaneously with the paroxysm of pain.
the pain may become less severe as, distention progresses, probably because motility is impaired in the edematous intestine.
when strangulation occurs, the pain becomes steady and more localized without a colicky component.

Vomiting

Vomiting is almost invariable, and it is earlier and more profuse the higher (proximal) the obstruction.
the vomits initially contains bile and mucus and remains as such if the obstruction is high (proximal) in the intestine.
the more distal the obstruction, the more likely it is that vomits will become feculent. 
Vomiting follows the onset of pain after an interval that varies directly with the level of obstruction.

Constipation and Obstipation

constipation and obstipation will eventually occur in complete obstruction, but some stools and gas may pass initially after the onset of symptoms. In some patients diarrhea may also be seen initially, due to increased peristalsis.

Abdominal distention

abdominal distention occurs as the obstruction progresses and the proximal intestine becomes increasingly dilated.
it is minimal to absent in proximal obstruction, but is pronounced in more distal obstruction.

Temperature

is normal or mildly elevated

Blood in the stool

is rare but does occur in cases of intussusception, or ischemic injury.

Plain radiograph of abdomen

will show dilated small bowel loops with air fluid levels in a ladder-like pattern. These feature are absent in proximal obstruction, early obstruction or closed-loop obstruction.",C

Inability to pronate forearm is due to injury to which nerve ?,Ulnar,Radial,Median nerve,Musculocutaneous,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Median nerve Pronation of the forearm is by two muscles pronator teres and pronator quadratus. These two muscles are supplied by median nerve. Thus injury to median nerve produces inability to pronate forearm. The median nerve is also called labourer's nerve. The median nerve arises by two roots, one from the lateral cord (C5,6,7) and the other from the medial cord (C8, T1). The various muscles supplied by median nerve are : ? 1) In the forearm All the flexor muscles of the forearm, except the flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus to the ulnar two fingers. These muscles are : - Pronater teres Flexor digitorum superficialis Flexor pollicis longus Flexor carpi radialis Flexor digitorum profundus (lateral half) Pronator quadratus Pulmaris longus 2) In hand Median nerve supplies : - Thenar muscles (except adductor pollicis) - Flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis.

Which of the following is NOT TRUE about intermittent claudication?,Most common in calf muscle,Pain is positional,Atherosclerosis is impoant predisposing factor,Relieved by rest,"Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. Intermittent claudication: It refers to the pain or fatigue in muscles of the lower limb caused by walking and relieved by rest. Claudication is derived from the latin word for ""liping, lame"", strictly speaking, the term should be used only for symptoms in the lower extremities. The pain is a deep seated ache usually in the calf muscle, which gradually progressive until the patient is compelled to stop walking. Patient occasionally describe ""cramping""or ""tiredness""in the muscle. Typically, symptoms are completely relieved after 2-5 min of inactivity. Claudication is distinguished from other types of pain in lower extremity in that some exeion is always required before it appears; it is reproducible; it does not occur at rest; and it is relieved by cessation of walking. Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. The distance a patient can walk varies with the rate of walking, the level of incline, and the degree of aerial obstruction. The average patient with involvement of a single aerial segment can walk 90-180 meters on a level terrain at a moderate pace before pain appears. Regardless of which aerial segment is involved, claudication most commonly involves the calf muscles due to their high workload with normal walking. The correct diagnosis should be easily established by determining the location of pain (calf), the quality of the pain, the length of the time required for relief of symptoms, the reproducibility of symptoms, the distance walked before symptoms begin (initial claudication distance), and the type of rest or position required for relief of symptoms. Although most patients with the disorder do not develop gangrene or require amputations, adverse outcomes of systemic atherosclerosis, including death are common. There is increasing interests in the use of the ankle- brachial index ( ABI ). Normal is >1. Claudication are in the 0.6- 0.9 range. with the rest pain and gangrene occurring at rest <0.3. Indications for surgery include disabling claudication (severely limiting work or lifestyle), rest pain, limb threatening ischemia, and microembolization of the toes in which no other source is identified. Claudication distance will vary from day to day and will altered by walking up hill, and speed of walking of against the wind. Characteristically this pain is worse at night and is worsened by elevation of the extremity, whereas it is somewhat relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed or by sleeping in a chair. Tis rest pain is mainly due to ischemic changes in the somatic nerves, so it is the cry of the dying nerves. Ref: L & B 25/e, page 899 ; Textbook of Surgery By S. Das 5/e, page 151",B

Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome

The pathogenesis of mucosal prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS.
SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age.
Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction.
Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa.
Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration.
The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, particularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial portion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosal hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distortion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium.
In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudo membrane. The cells show enlarged, hyper chromatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells.",C

Dextrose is added to the spinal anesthetic drugs to,Increase duration of action,Reduce plasma levels of local anesthetic to prevent toxicity,Increase specific gravity,Hasten onset of action,"By adding dextrose we maKe local anaesthetic hyperbaric and prevent uncontrolled ascending of local anaesthetics The local anesthetic solutions can be made hyperbaric by the addition of glucose or hypobaric by the addition of sterile water or fentanyl. A hyperbaric solution of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, whereas a hypobaric solution is less dense (lighter) than CSF. Significance: Hyperbaric solutions tend to move to the most dependent area of the spine. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric anesthetic solution moves caudal. A head-up position causes a hyperbaric solution to settle caudally and a hypobaric solution to ascend cephalad. An isobaric solution tends to remain at the level of injection.",C
What are the features of colonic obstruction ?,No passage of gas absolutely (Obstipation),No passage of stools absolutely,Distention of abdomen,All,"Answer is 'a' i.e. No passage of gas absolutely (obstipation); 'b' i.e. No passage of stools absolutely; 'c' i.e. Distention of abdomen Colonic obstruction may occur in any poion of the colon, but most commonly is seen in the sigmoid colon. Obstruction at the ileocecal valve produces symptoms and signs of small bowel obstruction. So do obstruction in proximal asc. colon if the ileo-cecal valve becomes incompetent. The pathophysiology of more distal colonic obstruction depends on the competence of the ileocecal valve. If the ileocecal valve is incompetent the colonic pressure is relieved by reflux into the ileum. If the colon is not decompressed through the ileocecal valve, a 'closed loop' is formed between the valve and the obstructing point. The colon distends progressively because the ileum continues to empty gas and liquids into the obstructed segment. Increasing colonic pressure may lead to impaired circulation with gangren and perforation. The risk of perforation is highest in the cecum. Symptoms & signs - depend on the degree and acuity of obstruction, as well as on the cause. Abdominal distention is the most prominent initial finding. Pain is cramping in nature but of less severity than seen in small bowel obstruction. Vomiting is late and occurs only if the ileocecal valve is incompetent. Feculant vomiting is very rare (cf. feculant vomiting is seen in distal small bowel obstruction). Constipation or obstipation is a universal feature of complete obstruction, though the colon distal to the obstruction may empty after the initial symptom begins. So its a late feature even in complete obstruction. If ileocecal valve incompetence decompresses the colonic contents into the small intestine, features of both small & large intestine obstruction appears. Fever is commonly seen in acute diveiculitis, ischemic injury or perforation. (But I don't think its an early finding) Plain x-ray films will show peripheral gas filled dilated colon segments. Air fluids level will not be noted unless the ileocecal valve incompetence has decompressed the colonic contents into small intestine. Also know MC cause of colonic obstruction Ca colon",D

True regarding cystic hygroma is: March 2008,Always unilateral,Brilliantly translucent,Subsides itself,Always presents at bih,"Ans. B: Brilliantly translucent Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs that result from a blockage in the lymphatic system and are lined by single layer of epithelium. Cystic hygromas are single or multiple cysts found mostly in the neck region. Swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child cough or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other swelling of the neck is that it is brilliantly translucent. A cystic hygroma can be present as a bih defect (congenital) or develop at any time life. A cystic hygroma in a developing baby can progress to hydrops (an excess amount of fluid in the body) and eventually fetal death. Some cases of congenital cystic hygromas resolve leading to webbed neck, edema (swelling), and a lymphangioma (a benign yellowish-tan tumor on the skin composed of swollen lymph vessels). In other instances the hygroma can progress in size to become larger than the fetus. Cystic hygromas occur in approximately 1% of fetuses between weeks 9 and 16 of pregnancy. Definitive management is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of the sclerosing agent (picibanil) may reduce the size of the cyst.",B

A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked T waves on ECG. Fastest way of shifting potassium intracellularly is aEUR',Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E.C.G. appearance. But an impoant point to note - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - ""Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels"". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium. for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower p1{. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells :? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ IC ATPase. I.V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelr2. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. * The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. 5' adrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 18 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking ft blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism .for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary IC' elimination in patients with some kidney. function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium polysterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -""Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body"". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",C

True about mesenteric cysts is -,Enterogenous cyst is commonest type,Recurrence is common after enucleation,Mensentric cyst are usually multiple,Enucleation is the treatment of choice of chylolymphatic cyst,"Mesenteric cysts are of following types:


Chylolymphatic (most common)           
simple (mesothelial)
Enterogenous
Urogenital remnan 
Dermoid (teratomatous cyst)

Chylolymphatic cyst

Usually are congenital, resulting from developmental sequestration of lymphatics.
It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum.
The cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst.
The cyst is not lined by mucosa.
It is filled with clear lymph or chyle.
A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extremely rare cases, multiple cysts may be seen.
The cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular.
A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of the gut.

Enterogenous cyst

Believed to be derived either from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine.
An enterogenous cyst has a thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated.
The content is mucinous
The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply, therefore, enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related portion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

Clinical features

painless abdominal swelling


the swelling moves freely in a plane at right angles to the attachment of the mesentery.

Which of the following does not help in the prevention of reflux esophagitis?,Long intraabdominal esophagus,Increased intraabdominal pressure,Right crus of diaphragm,Increased intrathoracic pressure,"The principal barrier to reflux is the lower esophageal sphincter. LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure. Factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES: Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus: these muscles differ from those in the other area of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of the a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intra Abdominal pressure: the intra abdominal pressure compresses the abdominal segment of the esophagus and is probably the most impoant factor in preventing the reflux. The gastroesophageal angle: the oblique entry of the esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when gastric fundus distends. Folds of the mucosa at the cardia : helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure arises. Intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux as it is too low ranging from -5 to + 5mm of Hg Ref: Sabiston 18/e, Page 1108 ; Essential of Surgery By Sunil Chumber 1/e, Page 7 ; Textbook of Surgery By S.

Which is not a feature of pancreatic ascites ?,Low protein,Somatostatin is the drug of choice,Communication with pancreatic duct in 80%,Raised amylase levels,"Answer is 'a' i.e. Low protein Pancreatic ascitic fluid, contains elevated protein (> 2.9 g/dI) and amylase levels. Pancreatic ascites occurs - when pancreatic juice gains entry into the peritoneal cavity either from a pancreatic duct disruption or - from a leaking pseudocyst The principal causative factors are alcoholic pancreatitis in adults and traumatic pancreatitis in children. The diagnosis can usually be made when high amylase levels are found in the ascitic fluid. Definitive diagnosis is made by ERCP. Management The initial treatment usually is nonoperative and involves attempts to decrease pancreatic secretion by - elimination of enteral feeding - nasogastric drainage and - use of antisecretory hormone somatostatin About 50 to 60 % pts. respond to this tit. If considerably improvement does not occur within 2-3 weeks then these patients are treated either endoscopically or surgically. - Endoscopic tit involves endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy with or without placement of transpapillary pancreatic duct stent. By reducing the resistance to drainage into the duodenum, and by bridging the site of duct disruption, this approach is designed to allow the site of leakage to seal.

Haemodynamicaly unstable patient with blunt trauma to abdomen and suspected liver injury; which of the following is the first investigation performed in the emergency room?,FAST,CT Scan,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage,Standing X ray Abdomen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., FAST * The patient has gunshot injury to the right upper quadrant of abdomen, mostly damaging the liver.General: Liver trauma* The liver is the second most common organ injured in abdominal trauma.* Liver trauma can be divided into blunt and penetrating injuries.* Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion injuries to the liver, often in association with splenic, mesenteric or renal injury.* Penetrating injuries, such as stab and gunshot wounds, are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement.* Blunt injuries are more common and have a higher mortality than penetrating injuries.Diagnosis of liver injury:* The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ, and blood loss is therefore the major early complication of liver injuries.* Clinical suspicion of a possible liver injury is essential, as a laparotomy by an inexperienced surgeon with inadequate preparation preoperatively is doomed to failure.* All lower chest and upper abdominal stab wounds should be suspect, especially if considerable blood volume replacement has been required.* Similarly, severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen often combine rib fractures, haemothorax and damage to the spleen and/or liver.* Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed in the emergency room by an experienced operator can reliably diagnose free intraperitoneal fluid.* Patients with free intraperitoneal fluid on FAST and haemodynamic instability, and patients with a penetrating wound will require a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy once active resuscitation is under way.* Owing to the opportunity for massive ongoing blood loss and the rapid development of a coagulopathy, the patient should be directly transferred to the operating theatre while blood products are obtained and volume replacement is taking place.* Patients who are haemodynamically stable should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen as the next step.* Additional investigations that may be of value include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, which can confirm the presence of haemoperitoneum, but this is rarely performed nowadays due to inceased use of FAST and CT.Initial management:* The initial management is maintenance of airway patency, breathing and circulation (ABC) following the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS).* Peripheral venous access is gained with two large-bore cannulae and blood sent for crossmatch of ten units of blood, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, clotting screen, glucose and amylase.* Initial volume replacement should be with colloid or O-negative blood if necessary. Arterial blood gases should be obtained and the patient intubated and ventilated if the gas exchange is inadequate.* Intercostal chest drains should be inserted if associated pneumothorax or haemothorax is suspected. Once initial resuscitation has commenced, the patient should be transferred to the operating theatre, with further resuscitation performed on the operating table.* The necessity for fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate should be discussed with the blood transfusion service immediately the patient arrives, as these patients rapidly develop irreversible coagulopathies due to a lack of fibrinogen and clotting factors.* Standard coagulation profiles are inadequate to evaluate this acute loss of clotting factors, and factors should be given empirically, aided by the results of thromboelastography (TEG), if available.* A contrast CT prior to laparotomy should be considered if the patient is haemodynamically stable.",A

An endotracheal tube may well be required later in the resuscitation because this patient has a severe head injury; however, endotracheal intubation requires an anaesthetist and significant time. Guedel airway placement should still be considered the first choice adjunct as it is quick, allowing fur-ther assessment of the patient to continue, and it acts as a bridge to intubation. -Any suspicion of a basal skull fracture is an absolute contraindication to nasopharyngeal airway and nasogastric tube inseion. This is because of the risk of penetrating through the damaged cribriform plate and damaging the brain. Basal skull fracture include: periorbitalecchy-mosis (panda eyes/raccoon eyes), retroauricular ecchymosis (battle sign), CSF leakage from the nose or ears VII/VIII cranial nerve dysfunction. The internal carotid aery may also be injured resulting in dissection or pseudoaneurysm. -CSF leakage can be differentiated from blood by dripping the fluid on a white sheet; CSF will form concentric circles whereas blood will simply make a spot With nasopharyngeal tube placement contraindicated, the first option in this patient would be Guedel oropharyngeal airway place-ment.",A
"A 45 year old gentleman has undergone truncal vagatomy and pyloroplasty for bleeding duodenal ulcer seven years ago. Now he was intractable recurrent symptoms of peptic ulcer.

Pathology The aetiology and pathogenesis of sporadic gastrinomas are unknown. At the time of diagnosis more than 60% of tumours are malignant. Pancreatic gastrinomas are mainly found in sporadic disease; most are found in the head of the pancreas. More than 70% of the gastrinomas in MEN 1 syndrome and most sporadic gastrinomas are located in the first and second pa of the duodenum. Therefore, the anatomical area comprising the head of the pancreas, the superior and descending poion of the duodenum and the relevant lymph nodes has been called the 'gastrinoma triangle' because it harbours the vast majority of these tumours. All patients with gastrinomas should be tested for MEN 1 syndrome. Clinical and biochemical features Over 90% of patients with gastrinomas have peptic ulcer disease, often multiple or in unusual sites. Diarrhoea is another common symptom, caused by the large volume of gastric acid secretion. Abdominal pain from either peptic ulcer disease or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) remains the most common symptom, occurring in more than 75% of patients. Biochemical diagnosis If the patient presents with a gastric pH below 2.5 and a serum gastrin concentration above 1000pg/mL (normal <100pg/mL) then the diagnosis of ZES is confirmed. Unfounately, the majority of patients have serum gastrin concentrations between 100 and 500 pg/mL and in these patients a secretin test should be performed. The secretin test is considered positive if an increase in serum gastrin of >200pg/mL over the pretreatment value is obtained; this also rules out other causes of hypergastrinaemia (e.g. atrophic gastritis).

A young man weighing 65 kg was admitted to the hospital with severe burns in a severe catabolic state. An individual in this state requires 40 kcal per kg body weight per day and 2 gms of protein/kg body weight/day. This young man was given a solution containing 20% glucose and 4.25% protein. If 3000 ml of solution is infused per day -,The patient would not be getting sufficient protein,The calories supplied would be inadequate,Both protein and calories would be adequate,Too much protein is being infused,"Let's see the amount of calories and proteins supplied by the infused solution.

First the calories

Note here that the calories are calculated by catabolism of glucose, not proteins. (Proteins are given for anabolic processes of the body, it's not meant for catabolic production of energy).
So calories are produced from 20% glucose in 3000 ml of solution.
Percentage of glucose in solution → 20%
Amount of glucose in 3000 ml → 3000 x 20/100 = 600 gms.
1 gm of Glucose on catabolism produces → 4.2 kcal.
600 gms of glucose would produce → 600 x 4.2 = 2520 kcal.

Now the amount of protein provided by the solution.

Percentage of protein in fluid 4.25%
Percentage of protein in 3000 ml of fluid → 3000 x (4.25/100)=127.5 gm

Now, let's find out the amount of calories and proteins required by the patient per day.

Calories required → 40 x 65 = 2600 Kcal
Amount of protein required → 2 x 65 = 130 gms",C
"In a case of road traffic accident, emergency nasotracheal intubation is done.

Which is not having underlying malignancy?,Paget disease of bone,Paget disease of nipple,Paget disease of vulva,Paget disease of anal region,"Paget's disease of bone (commonly known as Paget's disease or historically, osteitis deformans) is a condition involving cellular remodeling and deformity of one or more bones. The affected bones show signs of dysregulated bone remodeling at the microscopic level, specifically excessive bone breakdown and subsequent disorganized new bone formation.These structural changes cause the bone to weaken, which may result in deformity, pain, fracture, or ahritis of associated joints. The disease is progressive and slowly worsens with time, although people may remain minimally symptomatic. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms, but there is no cure. Any bone or bones can be affected, but Paget's disease occurs most frequently in the spine, skull, pelvis, femur, and lower legs. Osteogenic sarcoma, a form of bone cancer, is a rare complication of Paget's disease occurring in less than one percent of those affected. The development of osteosarcoma may be suggested by the sudden onset or worsening pain. Ref : Paget's Disease of Bone Overview NIH osteoporosis and related bone disorders National Resource Centre",A

"A patient presented with blunt abdominal injury underwent complete repair of liver; and was given transfusion of 12 units of whole blood. Thereafter, it is found that wound is bleeding. It is treated by",Calcium gluconate/calcium chloride,Fresh Frozen Plasma,Vitamin-K,Platelets rich plasma,"(D) Platelets rich plasma > Massive Transfusion is usually defined as the need to transfuse from one to two times the patient's normal blood volume. In a ""normal"" adult, this is the equivalent of 10-20 units. Potential complications from this include coagulopathy, citrate toxicity, hypothermia, acid-base disturbances and changes in serum potassium concentration. Coagulopathy is common with massive transfusion. The most common cause of bleeding following a large volume transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. This should be suspected and treated first before moving on to factor deficiencies as the cause of coagulopathy. Patients who may require multiple transfusions are best second by receiving SPAP and leucocyte reduced components to lower the risk of autoimmunization. Citrate toxicity results when the citrate in the transfused blood begins to bind calcium in the patient's body. Clinically significant hypocalcemia does not usually occur unless the rate of transfusion exceeds one unit every five minutes or so. Citrate metabolism is primarily hepatic - so hepatic disease or dysfunction can cause this effect to be more pronounced. Treatment is with intravenous calcium administration - but identification of the problem requires a high index of suspicion. Hypothermia should not occur on a regular basis. Massive transfusion is an absolute indication for the warming of all blood and fluid to body temperature as it is being given.Acid-Base balance can be seen after massive transfusion. The most common abnormality is a metabolic alkalosis. Patients may initially be acidotic because the blood load itself is acidic and there may be a prevailing lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion. However, once normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis resolves and the citrate and lactate are then converted to bicarbonate in the liver. Serum potassium can rise as blood is given. The potassium concentration in stored blood increases steadily with time. The amount of potassium is typically less than 4 milliequivalents per unit - so you can see that large amounts of blood at a high rate of delivery is required to raise serum levels of potassium.",D

• The spectrum of chronic mediastinitis ranges from granulomatous inflammation of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum to fibrosing mediastinitis.
• Most cases are due to TB or histoplasmosis, but sarcoidosis, silicosis, and other fungal diseases are at times causative.
Clinical Features
• Patients are usually asymptomatic.
• Those with fibrosing mediastinitis usually have signs of compression of some mediastinal structure such as the SVC or large airways, phrenic or RLN paralysis, or obstruction of the pulmonary artery or proximal pulmonary veins.
Treatment

Which of the following conditions shows susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma in skin?,Epidermodysplasia verruciformis,Actinic keratosis,Xeroderma pigmentosum,All the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All the above Squamous Cell Carcinoma:* Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common tumor arising on sunexposed sites in older people, exceeded only by basal cell carcinoma.* Except for lesions on the lower legs, these tumors have a higher incidence in men than in women.* Invasive squamous cell carcinomas are usually discovered while they are small and resectable.* Less than 5% of these tumors metastasize to regional nodes; these lesions are generally deeply invasive and involve the subcutis.* The most important cause of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is DNA damage induced by exposure to UV light.* Tumor incidence is proportional to the degree of lifetime sun exposure.* A second common association is with immunosuppression, most notably chronic immunosuppression as a result of chemotherapy or organ transplantation.* Immunosuppression may contribute to carcinogenesis by reducing host surveillance and increasing the susceptibility of keratinocytes to infection and transformation by oncogenic viruses, particularly human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes 5 and 8. These same HP Vs have been implicated in tumors arising in patients with a rare autosomal recessive condition, epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is marked by a high susceptibility to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas.* In addition to its damaging effect on DNA, sunlight, through uncertain mechanisms, seems to cause a transient defect in cutaneous innate immunity that may diminish immunemediated elimination of sun-damaged cells.* Other risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include industrial carcinogens (tars and oils), chronic ulcers and draining osteomyelitis, old burn scars, ingestion of arsenicals, ionizing radiation, and (in the oral cavity) tobacco and betel nut chewing.* Most studies on the genetics of squamous cell carcinoma have focused on acquired defects in sporadic tumors and their precursors (actinic keratoses), and the relationships between these defects and sun-exposure.* The patients patients with xeroderma pigmentosum show remarkable susceptibility to squamous cell carcinoma.* As with all other forms of cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma stems from multiple driver mutations.* In addition to defects in p53, mutations that increase RAS signaling and decrease Notch signaling are common and are also likely to contribute to the transformation process.",D

Which of the following statements concerning this condition is true?",Appropriate management would be embolectomy of the right femoral artery under general anesthesia,Noninvasive hemodynamic testing is required,Prophylactic exploration of the contralateral femoral artery should be done despite the presence of a normal pulse,The source of the embolus is most likely the left ventricle,"The heart is the most common source of arterial emboli and accounts for 90% of cases. Within the heart, sources include diseased valves, endocarditis, the left atrium in patients with unstable atrial arrhythmias, and mural thrombus on the wall of the left ventricle in patients with a myocardial infarction. The diagnosis in this patient is clear, and therefore neither noninvasive testing nor arteriography is indicated. Arteriography in fact may also prove to be too stressful for a patient undergoing an acute myocardial infarction. Embolectomy of the femoral artery can be performed under local anesthesia with minimal risk to the patient. Emboli typically lodge in one femoral artery; contralateral exploration is not indicated in the absence of signs or symptoms.

Doppler ultrasound allows identification of vascular occlusion and the direction of poal venous low. CT and MR angiography are useful for evaluating poal venous patency and anatomy. The most accurate method for measuring poal hypeension is hepatic venography. This procedure introduces a balloon catheter directly into the hepatic vein where free hepatic venous pressure (FHVP) is measured. The hepatic vein is then occluded by inflation of the balloon allowing measurement of the wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP). The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) may then be calculated by subtracting the FHVP rom the WHVP (HVPG = WHVP-FHVP). Clinically significant poal hypeension is defined as HVPG greater than 10 mm Hg.

Harrison 17th/e p 2066 & 16riVe p 52, 1952] Angioedema is essentially an anaphylaxis limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues and can be due to drug allergy, insect stings or bites, desensitization injections or ingestion of ceain foods (paicularly eggs, shellfish or nuts) Sometimes reactions occur explosively after ingestion of minute amounts. Others (e.g. reactions to strawberries), may occur only after overindulgence and possibly result from direct (toxic) mediator liberation. It is characterized by a diffuse and painful swelling of loose subcutaneous tissue, e.g. dorsum of hands or feet, eyelids, lips, genitalia and mucous membrane. Edema of the upper airways may produce respiratory distress and the stridor may be mistaken for asthma. Treatment Epinephrine should be the first treatment for acute pharyngeal or laryngeal angioedema. This may be supplemented, by a nebulized agonist (e.g. albuterol) and an I.V. antihistamine (diphenhydramine). This is usually sufficient to prevent airway obstruction hut intubating or performing a tracheostomy and administering 0, might be necessary. Also know Uicaria This is also an anaphylaxis reaction, but in uicarias the disease is limited to the superficial tissues. Uicaria is characterized by local wheals and erythema in the superficial dermis whereas angioedema is a deeper swelling due to edematous areas in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Generally, pruritus is the first symptom, which is followed sholy by the appearance of wheals that may remain small (1-5 mm) or enlarge. The larger ones tend to be clear in the centre and may be noticed, first as large rings (> 20 cm across) of erythema and edema. Also know If acute angioedema is recurrent progressive, painful rather than pruritic and not associated with uicaria a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be considerd. Hereditary angioneurotic edema occurs due to loss of C1 inhibitor (regulatory protein) CIF of hereditary angioneuroedema - Episodes of laryngeal edema - Prominence of recurrent gastrointestinal attacks - lack of pruritus and of uicarial lesions Laboratory diagnosis of hereditary angioneuroedema - It depends upon demonstrating the deficiency of C1 inhibitor",D

Which of the following does not cause malignant hypehermia,Isoflurane,Desflurane,N2O,Enflurane,"Anesthetic drugs that trigger Malignant Hypehermia include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, anddepolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used. Mild hypothermia and the preadministration of barbiturates, tranquilizers, propofol, or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers delay or prevent the onset of MH The two classic clinical manifestations of fulminant MH syndrome may sta with one of the following two scenarios:1. Rigidity after induction with succinylcholine but successful intubation, followed rapidly by the symptomslisted after scenario 22. Normal response to induction of anesthesia and uneventful anesthetic course until the onset of the following symptoms:* Unexplained sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias (or both)* Tachypnea, if spontaneous ventilation is present* Unexplained decrease in oxygen (O2) saturation (because of a decrease in venous O2 saturation)* Increase in end-tidal paial pressure of CO2 (Pco2) with adequate ventilation and, in most cases, unchanged ventilation* Unexpected metabolic and respiratory acidosis* Central venous desaturation* Increase in body temperature above 38.8deg C with no obvious cause. TREATMENTAcute management for MH can be summarized as follows:1. Discontinue all anesthetic agents and hyperventilate with 100% O2 with a fresh flow to at least 10 L/min. With increased aerobic metabolism, normal ventilation must increase. However, CO2 production is also increased because of neutralization of fixed acid by bicarbonate; hyperventilation removes this additional CO2.2. Reconstitute dantrolene in sterile water (not saline), and administer rapidly (2.5 mg/kg intravenously to a total dose of 10 mg/kg IV) every 5 to 10 minutes until the initial symptoms subside.3. Administer bicarbonate (1 to 4 mEq/kg IV) to correct the metabolic acidosis with frequent monitoring of blood gases and pH.4. Control fever by administering iced fluids, cooling the body surface, cooling body cavities with sterile iced fluids, and, if necessary, using a heat exchanger with a pump oxygenator. Cooling should be halted when the temperature approaches 38deg C to prevent inadveent hypothermia.5. Monitor urinary output, and establish diuresis if urine output is inadequate. Administer bicarbonate to alkalinize urine to protect the kidney from myoglobinuria induced renal failure.6. Blood gases, electrolytes, CK, temperature, arrhythmia, muscle tone, and urinary output guide fuher therapy. Hyperkalemia should be treated with bicarbonate, glucose, and insulin. Effective doses of dantrolene to reverse MH are the most effective way to lower serum potassium levels. In severe cases, calcium chloride or calcium gluconate may be used.7. Analyze coagulation studies (e.g., international normalized ratio , platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split degradation products). Safe anesthetics consist of nitrous oxide, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine must be avoided at all times, even in the presence of dantrolene. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",C

These statistics emphasize both the rarity and lethality of esophageal cancer.* One notable trend is the shift of dominant esophageal cancer type from squamous cell to adenocarcinoma, strongly linked to reflux disease and Barrett's metaplasia.* The typical presentation of esophageal cancer is of progressive solid food dysphagia and weight loss.* Associated symptoms may include odynophagia, iron deficiency, and, with mid-esophageal tumors, hoarseness from left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Generally, these are indications of locally invasive or even metastatic disease manifest by tracheoesophageal fistulas, and vocal cord paralysis.* Even when detected as a small lesion, esophageal cancer has poor survival because of the abundant esophageal lymphatics leading to regional lymph node metastases.* Benign esophageal tumors are uncommon and usually discovered incidentally.

• Adenocarcinomas are more numerous in the proximal small bowel, whereas the other malignant lesions are more common in the distal intestine (ileum).
Clinical Features
• In contrast to benign lesions, malignant neoplasms almost always produce symptoms
• MC symptom: Abdominal pain >weight loss
• Obstruction develops in 15-35% of patients and, in contrast to the intussusception produced by benign lesions, is usually the result of tumor infiltration and adhesions.
• Diarrhea with tenesmus and passage of large amounts of mucus may occur.
• Adenocarcinomas may produce the typical constricting apple-core lesions similar to those observed in the colon.
• Gastrointestinal bleeding is more common with leiomyosarcomas.
• A palpable mass may be felt in 10-20% of patients, and perforations develop in about 10%, usually secondary to lymphomas and sarcomas.
Diagnosis
• Barium meal follow through (BMFT): Accurate diagnosis in 50–70% of patients with malignant neoplasms of the small intestine
• Enteroclysis (small bowel enema): Diagnostic accuracy of about 90%
Treatment
• Wide resection including regional lymph nodes.
• Often, surgical resection for cure is not possible. Therefore, palliative resection should be performed to prevent further complications of bleeding, obstruction, and perforation.
• Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy have little role in the treatment of patients with adenocarcinomas of the small bowel.
Prognosis
• Only half of the patients operated on for malignant tumors of the small intestine have lesions amenable to curative resection.
• One third have a distant metastasis at the time of initial surgery
• Overall 5-year survival rate after surgical treatment of malignant tumors is only 25%
• Adenocarcinoma has the poorest prognosis, with an overall survival rate of 15-20%.
• Obstruction in CA small bowel develops in 15-35% of patients, due to tumor infiltration and adhesions.
• Obstruction in benign lesions is due to intussusceptions.",D
A 45 year old woman presents with a hard and mobile lump in the breast. Next investigation is -,FNAC,USG,Mammography,Excision biopsy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., FNAC In any patient with a breast lump or other symptoms suggestive of carcinoma, diagnosis should be made by a combination of : 'Triple Assessment' : a. Clinical assessment b. Radiological imaging c. Tissue sampling for either cytological or histological examination. FNAC is more than often the first investigation for a tissue assessment. Bailey writes ? ""FNAC is the least invasive technique for obtaining a cell diagnosis and is very accurate if both operator and cytologists are experienced. However false negatives do occur, mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from 'in situ' disease. A histological specimen taken by core biopsy allows a definitive preoperative diagnosis, differentiates between duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive disease and also allows the tumor to be stained for receptor status. This is impoant before commencing neoadjuvant therapy.""",A

Multifocality is common in papillary carcinoma
TSH levels are high; tumors are TSH dependent, hence follow-up with TSH.

Key Concept:

Multifocality is common (up to 85% of cases) on microscopic examination.
Multifocality is associated with an increased risk of cervical nodal metastases, rarely invade adjacent structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and RLNs.

RLN implies lymph nodes.",C

"After removal of the parotid gland, patient is having sweating on the cheeks while eating. The nerve involved in this phenomenon",Lingual nerve,Auriculotemporal nerve,Lesser petrosal nerve,Buccal nerve,"Frey's syndrome (gustatory sweating) results from damage to the autonomic innervation of the salivary gland with inappropriate regeneration of the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibres of the auriculotemporal nerve that aberrantly stimulate the sweat glands of the overlying skin. The clinical features include sweating and erythema (flushing) over the region of surgical excision of the parotid gland as a consequence of autonomic stimulation of salivation by the smell or taste of food.Demonstrated by a starch-iodine test.Ref: Bailey and love, page no: 795",B
"A 64-year-old man undergoes CEA surveillance for cancer, because his brother and father both had colon cancer. What information should he be provided?",CEA is highly sensitive for diagnosis.,"If CEA is elevated preoperatively, it implies unresectable disease.",Increases in CEA after resection may indicate tumor recurrence.,CEA is highly specific for the presence of colon cancer.,CEA is useful in the follow-up care of patients with colon carcinoma after resection. The levels of this antigen usually come to normal after complete resection of the tumor. A subsequent elevation may suggest a recurrence of the tumor either at the resection margin or at distant sites. The sensitivity and specificity of CEA for diagnosis of colon carcinoma is poor. It has no implications for respectability of the lesion.,C
All are true about chronic osteomyelitis except ?,Reactive new bone formation,Cloaca is an opening in involucrum,Involucrum is dead bone,Sequestrum is hard and porus,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Involucrum is dead bone Pathology in chronic osteomyelitis Chronic osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in long bones. Bone is destroyed or devitalized in the affected pa. Cavities containing pus and pieces of dead bone (sequestra) are surrounded by vascular tissue, and beyond that by areas of sclerosis due to reaction new bone formation, which may take the form of a distinct bony sheath (involucrum) Often sinus track leads to the skin surface; the sinus tends to heal and present down recurrently, but if a sequestrum is present it never heals permanently. This is because sequestra act as substrate for bacterial adhesion in much the same way as foreign implants, ensuring the persistence of infection until they are removed or discharged through perforations in the involucrum and sinuses that drain to the skin. Sequestrum Sequestrum is apiece of dead bone, surrounded by infected granulation tissue trying to eat the sequestrum away. The sequestrum is hard, rough, porus, light in weight and lighter in colour than normal. Normal pattern of bone is lost.(Note : Sequestrum in syphilis and TB is heavier than normal bone because sclerosis usually precedes the death of the bone). On x-ray, sequestra show up as unnatural dense fragments, in contrast to the surrounding osteopenic bone. Involucrum Involucrum is reactive new bone overlying a sequestrum. There may be some holes in the involucrum for pus to drain out. These holes are called cloaca.",C

A 42-year-old man who was in a house fire is transferred to your burn unit. He has singed nose hairs and facial burns. Direct laryngoscopy in the emergency room demonstrates pharyngeal edema and mucosal sloughing. He has 60% total body surface area burns. Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?,Hyperbaric oxygen,Intravenous steroids,Inhaled steroids,Intubation,"The patient requires intubation because of suspicion of upper airway burns. Clinical suspicion should be increased given the singed nose hairs and facial burns. Intubation should be considered in the presence of posterior pharyngeal edema, mucosal sloughing, or carbonaceous sputum on direct laryngoscopy. Significant upper airway edema can result of upper airway burns, paicularly 12 to 24 hours post-injury. Bronchoscopy can be used to evaluate for lower airway burn injuries, but would not change management in this patient given the high clinical suspicion for airway burn injuries and the need for intubation. Inhaled or intravenous steroids for airway burn injuries are not indicated in patients with large burns due to the increased risk of infections. Carbon monoxide poisoning is treated with 100% inhaled oxygen; hyperbaric oxygen is used in patients with neurologic symptoms and small burns as it reduces the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin. However, the risks outweigh the benefits in patients with large burns. Miller&;s anaesthesia 9th edition page no 546",D

Least soluble anaesthetic agent is,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Halothane,Methoxyflurane,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood. The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) staging system is based on preoperative chemotherapy but is applied after resection. The presence of metastases is evaluated at presentation, relying on imaging studies, and chemotherapy is instituted before operative intervention. The National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) has also developed a staging system that incorporates the clinical,surgical, and pathologic information that was obtained at the time of resection but stratifies patients before the initiation of chemotherapy. The advantage of this system is that it ors stage-based therapy, thereby avoiding unnecessary chemotherapy in patients who might not otherwise benefit from it. ref : Sabiston 20th ed , chapter 66 , pg no 1889",B
Local excision in CA rectum is done in all except,Within 6 cm of anal verge,Lesion <4 cm,Involvement of <40% circumference,T1 and T2 cancer with or without lymph node involvement,"""Local excision does not allow complete removal of lymph nodes in the mesorectum, so operative staging is limited. In addition, definitive treatment nt of early-stage rectal cancers by local excision has been shown to be associated with a three fold to five fold higher recurrence rate compared with similar stage cancers treated by radical surgical resection before guidelines for specific selection criteria. Oveime, the selection criteria have been refined to select only patients for this procedure who will have acceptable long-term outcomes. The operation is indicated for mobile tumours smaller than 3 cm in diameter that involve less than 30% of the rectal wall circumference and that are located in the distal rectum. These tumors should be stage T1 (limited to the submucosa), be well or moderately differentiated histologically, and have no vascular Lymphatic invasion.

A 72-year-old patient with an intractable type I ulcer along the incisura with a significant amount of scarring along the entire length of the lesser curvature. Select the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient. (SELECT 1 PROCEDURE),Vagotomy and antrectomy,Antrectomy alone,Vagotomy and pyloroplasty,Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,"Gastric ulcers have been classified as type I (incisura or most inferior portion of lesser curvature), type II (gastric and duodenal), type III (pyloric and prepyloric), and type IV (juxtacortical). Indications for surgery are intractability, perforation, obstruction, and bleeding. A patient with an intractable type I ulcer can be treated with an antrectomy alone or with a proximal gastric vagotomy. If done properly, antrectomy offers slightly lower recurrence rates and a higher incidence of postoperative sequelae as compared with proximal gastric vagotomy. However, significant scarring along the lesser curvature makes a proximal gastric vagotomy technically unfeasible.Gastric outlet obstruction and severe inflammation around the pylorus and duodenum make resection a difficult and dangerous option. Similarly, pyloroplasty is often not adequate in the setting of gastric outlet obstruction to provide adequate drainage. Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy, although associated with the highest recurrence rate, offers the best choice in the described setting.In an elderly patient with a bleeding duodenal ulcer, recurrence rates are less of a consideration and thus the simplest and most expedient operation offers the best surgical outcome. Vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the ulcer is the best choice in this setting. Finally, in a young patient with intractable type III ulcers, antrectomy with vagotomy offers the best long-term outcome. Recurrence rates following this procedure are about 2-3%, as compared with 7.4% for vagotomy and drainage and 10-31% in patients receiving a proximal gastric vagotomy only.",B

Sistrunk operation is used for treatment of -,Pharyngeal pouch,Cystic hygroma,Thyroglossal duct cyst,Sternocleidomastoid tumor,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts* The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base of the tongue towards its position in the lower neck with the isthmus lying over the second and third tracheal rings.* At the time of its descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed and the track of the descent of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body.* Thyroglossal duct cysts represent a persistence of this track and may therefore be found anywhere in or adjacent to the midline from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus.* The cysts almost always arise in the midline but, when they are adjacent to the thyroid cartilage, they may lie slightly to one side of the midline. Classically, the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and with tongue protrusion.* Treatment must include excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, which involves removal of the body of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum, together with a core of tissue on either side. This operation is known as Sistrunk's operation and prevents recurrence, most notably from small side branches of the thyroglossal tract.",C

Breast cancer mainly spreads to the vertebrae via -,Arterial route,Direct Invasion,Batsons venous plexus,Via Axillary lymph nodes,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Batsons venous plexus o Three principal groups of veins are involved in the venous drainage of the thoracic wall and the breast:1) Perforating branches of the internal thoracic vein,2) Tributaries of the axillary vein, and3) Perforating branches of posterior intercostal veins.o Metastatic emboli traveling through any of these venous routes will pass through the venous return to the heart and then be stopped as they reach the capillary bed of the lungs, providing a direct venous route for metastasis of breast carcinoma to the lungs.o The vertebral plexus of veins (Batson's plexus) may provide a second route for metastasis of breast carcinoma via veins. This venous plexus surrounds the vertebrae and extends from the base of the skull to the sacrum. Venous channels exist between this plexus and veins associated with thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic organs. These vessels provide a route for metastatis emboli to reach the skull, vertebrae, ribs, pelvic bones, and central nervous systemo Metastasis of breast cancer to bone, and especially to thoracic vertebrae, is common due to the direct connection between the intercostal veins draining the breast and the internal vertebral plexus also known as Batson's plexus. In 1940 Batson found that dye injected into the breast of female specimens could be recovered in the vertebral veins.",C

A 70-kg woman is to undergo nail removal from her right ring finger in the ambulatory surgery clinic. Which of the following is the most appropriate option for local anesthesia?,Digital block with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine up to 4.5 mg/kg,Digital block with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine up to 4.5 mg/kg,Digital block with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine up to 7 mg/kg,Local injection around the nail bed with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine up to 4.5 mg/kg,"The maximal safe total dose of lidocaine administered to a 70-kg person is 4.5 mg/kg, or approximately 30 to 35 mL of a 1% solution. The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine, procaine, or bupivacaine not only doubles the duration of infiltration anesthesia, but increases the maximal safe total dose by one-third (eg, 7 mg/kg for lidocaine with epinephrine) by decreasing the rate of absorption of drug into the bloodstream. However, epinephrinecontaining solutions should not be injected into tissues supplied by end aeries (eg, fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis). Hypersensitivity to local anesthetics is uncommon and occurs most prominently with anesthetics of the ester type (procaine, tetracaine). While small nerve fibers seem to be most susceptible to the action of local anesthetics, these agents act on any pa of the nervous system and on every type of nerve fiber. CNS toxicity usually appears as stimulation followed by depression, probably because of an early selective depression of inhibitory neurons; with a massive overdose, all neurons may be depressed simultaneously",A
Malignant hyperthermia is caused by:,Ryanodine receptor,Nicotinic receptor,Muscarinic receptor,NMDA receptor,"Ans. (a) Ryanodine receptor* Malignant hyperthermia is a condition that is usually triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for general anesthesia, specifically the volatile anesthetic agents and the neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine.* Succinylcholine is depolarizing / non competitive M.R. with shortest duration of action (3-5 min) due to rapid hydrolysis by pseudo cholinesterase.* It causes dual/biphasic block. It causes hyperkalemia, increased intraocular & intragastric pressure and temperature which leads to malignant Hyperthermia.* Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, for which there are at least 6 genetic loci of interest, most prominently the Ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1).* DOC for malignant hyperthermia: Dantrolene",A

A newborn child presents with inveed foot and the dorsum of the foot cannot touch the anterior tibia. The most probable diagnosis is,Congenital veical talus,Ahrogryposis Multiplex,CTEV,Flat foot,"CTEV [Ref: Maheshwari Ohopaedics 3/e p195; Ebnezar 3/e p454J In a new born child it is possible to dorsiflex and eve the foot till the dorsum of foot touches anterior surface of tibia.This is not possible in CTEV. This is known as 'clorsillexion test' and can be used as a screening test. Ahrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and muscle atrophy and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. CTEV can be seen as one of the components of AMC. So AMC can also be the answer but since it's much rarer than CTEV and in the question other joints involvement is not mentioned, answer would be `CTEV'. Congenital veical talus is a'rare disease usually affecting both feet, characterized by rigid flatfoot deformity, with the plantar aspect of the foot having a convex contour. The heel is in valgus, and the forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed. In the newborn having this condition, the dorsal aspect of the foot may be in close approximation to the distal aspect of tibia. Flat foot or Pes planus is a condition characterized by varying degrees of loss of the longitudinal arch of the foot. This condition can be normal which usually disappears as the child grows, or can be pathological as seen in Congenital veical talus, tarsal coalition, inflammatory joint disorder or a neurological disorder. Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (Idiopathic club-food -Talipes is a term for any foot deformity that centres around the talus. - Equinus implies that the foot is flexed in the plantar direction. - Varus implies that the foot is inveed and adducted so that the sole faces inwards. CTEV is a complex deformity of the foot where the foot is both turned and twisted inwards so that the sole faces posteromedially. Deformities noted are: - plantar flexion (equines) - in version - adduction - supination - sometimes cavus (high medial arch) The involved foot is generally smaller than the opposite side with varying amounts of calf atrophy. More common in boys (2:1) Bilateral in 1/3 cases.(Ret Apley's Ohopaedics 11/e 591) Clinical tests in CTEV: 1)Dorsiflexion test: described above. 2)Plumbline test: This test helps to detect the tibial torsion. The child is made to sit on a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line drawn from the centre of the patella to the tibial tubercle when extended down, should cut the foot at the first or second intermetatarsal space normally. This is called the pulmline. In CTEV, with medial rotation of the tibia. the plumbline cuts the zith or 5th intermetatarsal space. 3)Scratch test: This test is performed to detect muscle imbalance in an infant who cannot obey commands. - Medial scratch test- In a normal child when the medial sole is scratched, the foot eves. The tests the peroneals. - Lateral scratch test- When the lateral sole is scratched, the child inves the foot. This tests the inveors.

This results in a pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Consequently, left atrial pressure rises while the left ventricle is under-filled. As left atrial pressure increases, pulmonary venous return is impaired and pulmonary hypeension with right ventricular failure can occur.",B

"Semen analysis of a young man who presented with primary infertility revealed low volume, fructose negative ejaculate with azoospermia. Which of the following is the most useful imaging modality to evaluate the cause of his infertility?",Colour duplex ultrasonography of the scrotum,Transrectal ultrasonography,Retrograde urethrography,Spermatic venography,"First lets briefly review the anatomy of male internal genitalia
Sperms are produced in testes and then stored and mature within the epididymis. Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct.
The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large part of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase.

Now coming to the question.

Semen analysis forms an important part of infertility assessment.
Low ejaculatory volume is caused by
retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or
obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct
Azoospermia may be seen in
testicular failure or
obstruction of vas deferens
Absence of fructose suggests
seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction.
A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests → either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles.
The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.
Also know

Tissue suturing glue contains:,Cyanoacrylate,Ethanolamine oleate,Methacrylate,Polychloroprene,"Most tissue adhesives or glue are cyanoacrylate polymers, such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl®, PeriAcryl®) or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond®, Surgiseal).
Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue.
Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair.
Advantages:

Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injection
More rapid application and repair time
Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair
	Waterproof barrier
Antimicrobial properties
Better acceptance by patients
No need for suture removal or follow-up

Indications and contraindications:


For use of tissue adhesives the wound needs to be clean, dry with near perfect hemostasis and under no tension.
Complex stellate lesions or crush injuries should not be closed with tissue adhesives since good wound approximation is difficult to achieve.
Tissue adhesives are not recommended for lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, since repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved.

Pulsatile proptosis is a feature of ?,Orbital varix,Retinoblastoma,Coico-cavernous fistula,Covernous sinus thrombosis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Coico-cavernous fistula Proptosis Proptosis is bulging of the eyeball (forward bulging) beyond the orbital margins. Though the word exophthalmos is synonymous with proptosis; some source define xophthalmos as a protrusion of globe greater than 18mm and proptosis as a protrusion equal to or less than 18 mm. Proptosis may be classified as follows : ? Unilateral Proptosis Proptosis of one eye. Inflammatory lesions :- Orbital cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, etc. Vascular disturbances :- Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc. Cysts and tumour :- Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit Neuroblastoma, breast, prostate, lung, GIT, Kidney, Ewing's tumor, melanoma, wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma)]. Systemic diseases - Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages. Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia. Mucocele of PNS' - Frontal (most common), ethmoid, maxillary. Bilateral Proptosis Proptosis of both eyes. evelopmental anomalies of the skull- Oxycephaly (tower skull). Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic. Inflammatory lesions - Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Tumours - lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma. Systemic disease - Histocytosis (Hand - schuller christon disease), amyloidosis, wegner's granulomatosis. Intermittent proptosis Proptosis developing intermittently and rapidly in one eye when venous stasis is induced by forward bending or lowering the head, turning the head forcibly, hyperextension of the neck, coughing, forced expiration with or without compression of the nostrils, or pressure on jugular veins. The most impoant casue is orbital varix (varicocele). Pulsatile proptosis : - Pulsatile proptosis is seen in caroticocovernous fistula; saccular aneurysm of ophthalmic aery; and due to transmitted cerebral pulsation as seen in meningocele, neurofibromatosis and traumatic or operative hiatus.",C
"A full thickness graft can be obtained from all of the following sites, EXCEPT:",Eyelids,Knee,Postauricular skin,Supraclavicular skin,"Full-thickness skin grafts include the epidermis and all the dermis. They are the most aesthetically desirable of the free grafts because they include the highest number of skin appendage elements, undergo the least amount of contracture, and have a greater ability to withstand trauma. Areas of thin skin are the best donor sites for full-thickness grafts (eg, the eyelids and the skin of the postauricular, supraclavicular, antecubital, inguinal, and genital areas). In grafts thicker than approximately 0.015 inch, the results of transplantation are less reliable, except on the face, where vascularity is usually superior. Ref: Vasconez H.C., Habash A. (2010).

Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is a progressive disorder cause by J.C. viruso. The main cells affected in the disease are oligodendrocytesQ. Since oligodendrocytes are concerned with myelination, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is characterized by multifocal areas of dernyelinationQ of varying size distributed throughout the brain but sparing the spinal cord and optic nerves. Patholocv Besides demyelination there are characteristic cytological alterations in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes - Astrocytes2 Enlarged and contain, hyperchromatic, deformed and bizarre nuclei and frequent mitotic figures. Oligodendrocytesdeg These have enlarged densely staining nuclei that contains virus inclusions, formed by crystalline arrays. Symptoms of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy :? Focal neurological signs -> Speech defect (aphasia), dysahria hemiparesis, Ataxia Visual defects (45%) -> Homonymous hemianopia Mental impairment (38%) -> Dementia, confusion, personality changes Weakness -> Hemi or monoparesis and ataxia Seizures (20%) Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy is predominantly seen in patients with immunosuppressive disorders : - Most commonly associated conditions are :? - AIDS (80%)Q - Hematological malignancies (13%) - Transplant recipients (5%) - Chronic inflammatory disease (2%) Prognosis of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy In most cases death occurs in 3-6 months from onset of neurological symptoms and even more rapidly in patients with AIDS unless aggressive interetrul treatment is undeaken. Diagnosis MRI is used for the diagnosis of PML - MRI is better than CT scan in the diagnosis of PML and is frequently used for the diagnosis of PML. - On MRI the lesion appears as multifocal asymmetric coalescing white matter located periventricularly. - These lesions have increased signals on T2 and FLAIR images and decrease signal on T,-weighted images. - PML lesions are classically nonenhancingu. Brain biopsy in diagnosis of progressive multifocal leuco encephalopathy - It has a sensitivity of 74-92% and specificity of 92-100%. - Brain biopsy demonstrates multiple demyelinative foci in cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem white matter. - Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates are seen - Nuclear inclusions may be seen - Microscopic hallmark of the disease is intranuclear basophilic or eosinophilic inclusions within the swollen nucleus of oligodendrocytes often at the periphery of lesions. - Large multinucleated astrocytes arc also seen. PCR amplification of JCV DNA. - The PCR amplification of JCV DNA in association with typical MRI lesion in the appropriate clinical setting is diagnostic of PML",C

Myodesis is employed in amputations for all of the following indications except:,Trauma,Tumor,Children,Ischemia,"D i.e. Ischemia: * Myodesis is contraindicated in cases of severe dysvascularity (ischemic limb) in which blood supply to the muscle appears compromised for fear of damaging the already precarious blood supply.* Myodesis should not be performed when vascularity is compromised (Ischemia) In Myodesis the residual musculature is stitched to the bone such that it retains the ability to developtension. This helps in achieving structurally stable residual limbs and to reduced atrophy. Myodesis is not preferred in ischemic limbs for fear of damaging the already precarious blood supply.* Myodesis may be used in children (Kulkarni 2nd/3909) 'When amputation is performed in children, the bone may overgrow the muscles and protrude under the skin (stump overgrowth). To prevent this myodesis must be preferred at the time of amputation which will stimulate the muscles to grow along with the bone'. * Myodesis may be used in Amputation for Tumors & Trauma Maximum preservation of stump length and the use of reconstructive techniques such as myodesis and myoplasty are ofpaicular impoance.",D

Veebral tuberculosis is the most common form of skeletal tuberculosis in children, accounting for 50% of all cases in repoed series. Approximate distribution in the skeleton are spine (50%), hip (20%), knee (10%), ankle and foot (5%), hand and wrist (3%), elbow (2%), shoulder (1 %), bursal sheaths and other bones (8%) The thoracic spine is most commonly affected; the radiological features include bone marrow oedema and enhancement, posterior element involvement, canal stenosis, and spinal cord or nerve root compression. Inter-veebral disc enhancement, veebral collapse and kyphosis deformity are paicularly suggestive of tuberculosis. Those with dorsal lesions have maximal deformity at the time of presentation, paly due to the additive effect of the normal thoracic kyphosis. However, the rib cage offers protection against additional collapse. Patients with dorsolumbar lesions have the worst prognosis as they tend to collapse more during the active phase of the disease and even more during the growth period. Those with lumbar lesions have the best prognosis with the least deformity at presentation, a lesser increase during the active phase, and also a tendency for substantial decrease during the growth period.",D

Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

Projectile nonbilious vomiting is seen in viually all patients. Patients also often develop a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from the persistent vomiting. On exam, the upper abdomen may be distended after feeding and prominent peristaltic waves from left to right may be seen. The classic physical exam finding of an ""olive-shaped"" mass in the epigastric area is not always felt. An ultrasound is the least invasive, safest diagnostic test. The typical appearance on ultrasound is a hypoechoic ring with a hyperdense center. The pyloric muscle thickness measures greater than 4mm. Since this patient has the symptoms of pyloric stenosis, it is inappropriate to do nothing (choice A). A plain film of the abdomen (choice B) will most likely appear normal unless there is a complete obstruction of the pyloric outlet. Again, this study would expose the baby to unnecessary radiation. And, in this case, it would not help you to establish the diagnosis. A barium enema (choice D) will not help to make the diagnosis in this patient. The fact that the vomitus is nonbilious puts the point of obstruction prior to the entrance of the sphincter of Oddi. A study performed from below will not help to see what is happening so high in the intestinal tract. If you suspected intussusception (paroxysmal abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, heme-positive stool, and sausage-shaped mass in upper mid abdomen on palpation), then a barium enema (or air enema) would be both diagnostic and therapeutic.",C

A 42-year-old man sustains a gunshot wound to the abdomen and is in shock. Multiple units of packed red blood cells are transfused in an effo to resuscitate him. He complains of numbness around his mouth and displays carpopedal spasm. An electrocardiogram demonstrates a prolonged QT interval. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,Intravenous bicarbonate,Intravenous potassium,Intravenous calcium,Intravenous digoxin,"Hypocalcemia is associated with physical findings including spasm of the muscles of the forearm and hand when a blood pressure cuff is inflated (Trousseau sign) and spasm of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is stimulated (Chvostek sign). Hypocalcemia is also associated with a prolonged QT interval and may be aggravated by both hypomagnesemia and alkalosis. Additionally, massive transfusion is associated with hypocalcemia secondary to chelation with citrate in banked blood. Severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, encountered most frequently following parathyroid or thyroid surgery or in patients with acute pancreatitis, should be treated with intravenous calcium gluconate. The myocardium is very sensitive to calcium levels; therefore, calcium is considered a positive inotropic agent. Calcium increases the contractile strength of cardiac muscle as well as the velocity of shoening. In its absence, the efficiency of the myocardium decreases. Hypocalcemia often occurs with hypoproteinemia, even though the ionized serum calcium fraction remains normal.",C

"In cases of burn, which is the fluid of choice in the first 24 hours?",Ringer Lactate,Normal saline,5% Dextrose,Blood,"Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.
The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from the intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of the body)
This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.
Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.
The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)
half of the calculated fluid is given in the first 8 hrs and a half in next 16 hrs.
Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)
A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remains the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.
There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.
Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",A

Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver and has a relatively low 5-year survival rate. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) has conventionally been considered to be a histologic variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The liver is the second most commonly involved organ by metastatic disease. Types of metastases (1) Nodular metastases are the most common type and occur with all tumors capable of metastasizing to the liver, including lymphoma.

Rapid fluid resuscitation of the hypovolemic patient after abdominal trauma is significantly enhanced by which of the following?,Placement of long 18-gauge subclavian vein catheters,Placement of percutaneous femoral vein catheters,Bilateral saphenous vein cutdowns,"Placement of short, large-bore percutaneous peripheral intravenous catheters","Rapid fluid administration is often the key to successful trauma resuscitation. Some of the important factors affecting the rate of fluid resuscitation include the diameter of the intravenous tubing, the size and length of the venous cannulae, the fluid viscosity, and the site of administration. According to Poiseuille's law, flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of a catheter and inversely proportional to its length. Therefore, the shorter a catheter and the larger its diameter, the faster one can infuse a solution through it. Central venous placement alone does not assure rapid flow. Importantly, the diameter of the intravenous tubing employed may be the rate-determining factor in fluid delivery: blood-infusion tubing allows twice the flow of standard intravenous tubing and should be used when rapid fluid resuscitation is needed. Any patient who is suspected of having a major abdominal injury should immediately have at least two short, large-bore (16-gauge or larger) intravenous cannulae placed in peripheral veins. Longer, smaller catheters, such as standard 18-gauge central venous catheters, may take more time to place and will have lower flow rates. Once fluid resuscitation is under way, one may elect to place an 8- or 9-French pulmonary artery catheter-introducer via a central venous approach for further volume administration, as well as for measurement of central venous pressure or for Swan-Ganz catheter insertion. Lower-extremity venous cannulae, placed by saphenous vein cutdown or percutaneously into the femoral veins, are no longer advised as primary access for patients with abdominal trauma, since possible disruption of iliac veins or the inferior vena cava will render volume infusion ineffective. Studies have demonstrated that the flow rate of cold whole blood is roughly two-thirds that of whole blood at room temperature. Diluting and warming the blood by ""piggybacking"" it into infusion lines that are delivering crystalloid will decrease the blood's viscosity, enhance flow, and minimize hypothermia.",D

A child presents with recurrent episodes of lip and laryngeal edema and abdominal pain associated with stress levels of which of the following are reduced.,C3,C5a,CI estease inhibitor,C9,"Ci esterase inhibitor Angioedema without uicaria suggests hereditary angioneurotic edema. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of plasma protein Ci esterase inhibitor. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is clinically characterized by:- Episodic edema (nonpitting) in the skin and extremities as well as in the laryngeal and intestinal mucosa provoked by emotional stress or trauma or extreme changes in temperature. Pathophysiology The mediators of edema formation in these patients are proteolytic fragments of complement C2, kinin and bradykinin. - Normally these mediators are kept in check by C1 inhibitor (CIINH) Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of the enzyme C1 inhibitor (CIINH). - (CIINH) blocks the first step in the complement pathway i.e. activation of C1. C1 complement is activated by its binding to immune complex. - CIINH prevents this activation. Thus, in the absence of CIINH there is excess of activated C1 which leads to increase in the level of activated C2. - Activated C2 mediates edema formation. Besides being inhibitor of CI,CIINH is also an inhibitor of kinin ReneratinR system. -Kining generating system includes, Hageman.factor and prekallikrein. - Activated hageman factor and prekallikrein leads to the generation of bradykinin which mediates edema formation. Normally the activation of kinin generating system is prevented by (CIINH). - In the absence of (CIINH) there is increased activation of kallikrein and .factor XII which in turn leads to increased .formation of bradykinin which produces edema. Another impoant point about hereditary angioneurotic edema is :? - It presents with angioedema without uicaria. - All patients with angioedema without uicaria should be screened with C4 level which is reduced during and between the attacks of Hereditary angioneurotic edema. One more impoant point Angioneurotic edema can also be precipitated by angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, - It occurs due to increased level of bradykinin in the serum. - Bradykinin is degraded by an angiotensin conveing enzyme present in the lung. - ACE inhibitors blocks this enzyme leading to decreased degradation of Bradykinin.",C

A Child presents with complaints of abdominal colic and hematuria USG showed a renal stone 2.5cm in diameter in renal pelvis the next step in management of this case -,ESWL,PCNL,Nephroureterostomy,Conservative,"ESWL is the treatment of choice for most of the renal calculi which are not able to pass spontaneously, however PNL is the preferred method for larger (>2 cm) renal stones.
Campbell's Urology writes- ""In summary, for patients harboring nonstaghorn stones smaller than 10 mm, SWL is usually the primary approach. For patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm, SWL can still be considered a first-line treatment unless factors of stone composition, location, or renal anatomy suggest that a more optimal outcome may be achieved with a more invasive treatment modality (PNL or ureteroscopy). Patients with stones larger than 20 mm should primarily be treated by PNL unless specific indications for ureteroscopy are present (e.g., bleeding diathesis, obesity).""
Spontaneous passage of stones — Most stones <5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 5 nun in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones >10 mm in diameter.
The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone.

Nesiritide lowers right and left side cardiac filling pressures without a direct chronotropic or inotropic action. - The hemodynamic response to nesiritide is characterized by decreased right atrial, pulmonary aerial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. - Systemic vascular resistance is reduced and cardiac index is increased. - There is improvement in global clinical status, attenuation of dyspnoea and fatigue and enhanced diuretic responsiveness have been repoed and corroborated. In acute hea failure the two primary hemodynamic determinants that produce symptoms are ? a) Elevated left ventricular, filling pressure b) Depressed cardiac output. - The depressed cardiac output is frequently accompanied by increase in systemic vascular resistance as a result of excessive neurohormonal activation. Management of acute hea failure The drugs used in acute hea failure mainly acts to improve these two hemodynamic parameters.",A

All of the following effects the height of block in spinal anesthesia except,Age,Height,Sex,Weight,"Explanation The gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, among the options given. Gender can affect the block height theoretically. The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of ""normal-sized"" adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height.",C

KDT 6th ed. Pg. 459.# Midazolam: The hepatic clearance of IV anesthetics with a high (e.g., etomidate, propofol, ketamine) or intermediate (e.g., methohexital, midazolam) extraction ratio is largely dependent on hepatic blood flow, with most of the drug being removed from the blood as it flows through the liver (so- called perfusion-limited clearance). Midazolam undergoes extensive oxidation by hepatic enzymes to form water-soluble hydroxylated metabolites, which are excreted in the urine. The hepatic clearance rate of midazolam is five times greater than lorazepam and 10 times greater than diazepam. Although changes in liver blood flow can affect the clearance of midazolam, age has relatively little influence on midazolam's elimination half-life..........

Charcot's joint is another name for joint affected by ?,Neuropathy,Osteoahritis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Neuropathy Another name given to joint affected by neuropathic ahropathy is charcot's joint. Neuropathic joint (Charcoat's joint) It is a progressive destructive ahritis associated with loss of pain sensation, proprioception or both, in addition normal muscular reflexes that modulate joint movements are decreased. Without these protective mechanisms, joints are subjected to repeated trauma, resulting in progressive cailage and bone damage. It is most commonly caused by diabetes mellitus. Pathophysiology At least two underlying mechanisms are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropathic ahritis. i) An abnormal autonomic nervous system is thought to be responsible for the increased blood flow to the joint and subsequent resorption of bone. ii) With the loss of deep pain, proprioception and protective neuromuscular reflexes, the joint is subjected to repeated injuries including ligamental tears and bone fractures. Pathology The pathological changes seen in charcoat's joints are similar to those found in severe osteoahritic joint. There is fragmentation and eventual loss of aicular cailage with eburnation of the underlying bone. Osteophytes are found at the joint margins. With more advanced diseases, erosions are present on the joint surface. Fractures, devitalized bone, and intraaicular loose bodies may be present. Joint effusions are prominent. Clinical manifestations Usually begins in a single joint and then progresses to involve other joints. The involved joints progressively becomes enlarged from bony overgrowth and synol effusion. o Loose bodies may be palpated in the joint cavity.",A

The differential includes irritable bowel, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pyelonephritis, ischemic colitis, and perforated carcinoma. Diverticulitis is an infectious complication of diverticulosis resulting from perforation of the colonic diverticulum.

The clinical spectrum is correspondingly broad ranging from mild symptoms to peritonitis and sepsis. Patients with signs and symptoms of sepsis should be hospitalized and undergo diagnostic study. A CT scan is the best study to evaluate the extent of the inflammatory process as well as to exclude other pathology. Plain x-ray would not reveal specific pathology.

"A 40 year old woman has the following family and personal history: her mother died of breast cancer at age 64, she smokes one pack/day, she drinks five or more cups of coffee/day, she has no children, and she takes bih control pills. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for breast cancer in this patient?",Bih control pills,Caffeine consumption,Cigarette smoking,Family history,"Positive family history is definitively the most significant risk factor of developing breast cancer among the ones mentioned in the list. About 5% to 10% of cases are attributable to inheritance of autosomal dominant genes. Most hereditary cases of breast cancer are due to two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are tumor suppressor genes probably involved in DNA repair. There are additional rare ""susceptibility"" genes, namely those causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (mutations of p53), Cowden syndrome (mutations of a gene on chromosome 10), and ataxia-telangiectasia (mutations of ATM gene). Note, however, that 80% to 90% of women with breast cancer do not have a positive family history. The role of exogenous estrogens, including those administered with bih control pills or postmenopausal replacement therapy, is still debated. If there is any associated risk for breast cancer, this is minimal. There is no convincing evidence linking caffeine consumption or cigarette smoking to breast cancer.

A 28-year-old white male presents with asymptomatic testicular enlargement. Which of the following statement(s) is/are true concerning his diagnosis and management?,"Tumour markers, b-fetoprotein (AFP) and ?-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) will both be of value in the patient regardless of his ultimate tissue type",The diagnosis of seminoma should be followed by postoperative radiation therapy,Orchiectomy should be performed scrotal approach,"With current adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is no longer indicated for non-seminomatous testicular tumours","Test is cancer is most common between the ages of 25 and 34 and is rare in blacks. The most common malignant neoplasm of the testis arise from the germ cells and can represent a variety of histologic manifestations, e.g, choriocarcinoma, embryonal cell carcinoma, seminoma, and teratoma. For therapeutic purposes, the tumors can be divided into seminomas and nonseminomas. The usual presenting symptom is testicular enlargement that may be associated with mild discomfo. Any solid testicular mass should be considered suspicious for testis carcinoma. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach for any suspected testis carcinoma is inguinal exploration with orchiectomy if the operative findings confirm the presence of a testicular mass. The inguinal approach is employed to perform high ligation of the cord at the inguinal ring and to eliminate potential involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes which are the primary area of drainage for the scrotum. Tumor Marker Characteristics Tumor marker size (daltons) Half-life Normal range Tumor type AFP 70,000 5-7 days <40 ug/l Embryonal, teratoma, yolk sac hCG 38,000 24-36 hours <5 IU/I Seminoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonal, LDH 134,000 Varies 1.5-3.2 ukat/l Any Abbretions: AFP alpha fetoprotein; hCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase. The tumour markers, a-fetoprotein (AFP) and the b-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) can contribute to both diagnosis and follow-up of testis cancer. Tumour markers are helpful when obtained prior to and following orchiectomy to help in assessing the stage of the tumour. Pure seminoma does not cause elevated AFP but can produce a moderate rise in HCG in 10% of patients. Seminomas are very responsive to radiation. Patients with minimal to moderate tumour burden (Stage I or II) are usually treated with radiotherapy. The field of treatment encompasses the para-aoic and para-caval areas below the diaphragm and ipsilateral inguinal and pelvic areas. STAGING OF TESTIS TUMORS BY THE AMERICAN JOINT COMMITTEE ON CANCER (AJCC) Primary Tumor The extent of primary tumor is classified after radical orchiectomy pTX - Primary tumor cannot be assessed. (If no radical orchiectomy has been performed, TX is used.) pTO - No evidence of primary tumor (e.g., histologic scar in testis) pTis - Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (carcinoma in situ) pT1 - Tumor limited to the testis and epididymis withoutvascular/lymphatic invasion. Tumor may invade into the tunica albuginea but not the tunica vaginalis. pT2 - Tumor limited to the testis and epididymis with vascular/lymphatic invasion, or tumor extending through the tunica albuginea with involvement of the tunica vaginalis pT3 - Tumor invades the spermatic co rd with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion pT4 - Tumor invades the scrotum with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion When bulky retroperitoneal and/or distant metastases are present, cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy is the preferred treatment. The treatment of non-seminomatous tumours is more controversial. Stage I tumours are effectively treated with retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. If bulky stage II and stage III non-seminomatous tumors are present, initial treatment includes cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Evidence for residual disease with normalization of tumour markers is usually an indication for surgical exploration.",B

Abdominal distention and tenderness are the common presenting symptoms. Volvulus of the sigmoid colon can usually be detected on a supine and erect abdominal x-ray. Sigmoidoscopy and contrast barium studies may be helpful to differentiate carcinoma from volvulus (Figure below).Volvulus of the sigmoid colon. Barium enema taken with the patient in the supine position. Note the massively dilated sigmoid colon. The distinct vertical cease, which represents juxtaposition of adjacent walls of the dilated loop, points toward the site of torsion. The barium column resembles a ""bird's beak"" or ""ace of spades"" because of the way in which the lumen tapers toward the volvulus.",C

This feature results from preservation and hypertrophy of the segment with direct venous drainage to the I VC in the face of atrophy of the rest of the liver due to venous obstruction.* IVC compression or occlusion from the segment I hypertrophy is also a common feature, as is thrombosis of the portal vein.* Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis is by hepatic venography via a transjugular approach, which demonstrates occlusion of the hepatic veins and may allow a transjugular biopsy.",A

Osteitis fibrosa cystica is seen with ?,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Teiary hyperparathyroidism,Pseudohypoparathypoidism,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Primary hyperparathyroidism The initial osseous lesions associated with primary hyperparathyroidism show merely a decrease in bone density. The full blown osseous manifestations have been referred to as osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) or Recklinghausen's disease. Primary hyperparathvroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica, von recklinghausen's disease) Primary hyperparathyroidism refers to increased parathormone secretion due to primary pathology in parathyroid gland. Primary adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. Rise in parathormone causes increased osteoclastic activity, which resorbs the bone. Consequently, there is increased osteoblastic activity resulting in fibrous replacement of bone and consequent weakening. Parathormone causes increased calcium absorption and increased phosphate excretion by the kidney. The net result in : - T Calcium levels Phosphate levels T Alkaline phosphatase (due to increased osteoblastic activity). Clinical features of Primary hyperparathyroidism (Osteitis fibrosa cystica) Primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in females and occurs in the third to fifth decades of life. o Clinical features are : ? Bone pains : This is the most common initial feature. There is tenderness on palpating the bones, especially in the lower limbs and back. Pain is usually associated with general weakness, pallor and hypotonia. Pathological fracture : Fractures occur with tril injuries and unite in a deformed position. Common sites of fractures are dorso-lumbar spine, neck of the femur and pubic rami. Brown's tumour : This is an expansile bone lesion, a collection of osteoclasts. It commonly affects the maxilla or mandible, though any bone may be affected. Anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps are common presenting complaints. Occasionally, renal colics with haematuria, because of renal calculus, may occur.",A

"Virchow's triad includes all of the following, EXCEPT?",Venous stasis,Injury to veins,Blood hypercoagulability,Venous thrombosis,"Ans. is `d' i.e., Venous thrombosis Virchow's triad refers to three primary influences that predispose to thrombus formation. (a) Endothelial injury (or vascular injury) (b) Stasis or turbulence of blood flow (c) Blood hypercoagulability Virchow's triad should be the cornerstone for assessment of risk factors for deep venous thrombosis. Stasis can occur with venous insufficiency, severe hea failure, or prolonged bed rest or immobility of an extremity following coma, pelvic or limb fracture, paralysis, extended airplane travel, or a lengthy operation. Endothelial injury can result from direct trauma (severed vein, venous cannulation, or transvenous pacing) or local irritation secondary to infusion of chemotherapy, previous DVT, or phlebitis. - Damaged endothelium leads to platelet aggregation, degranulation and formation of thrombosis as well as vasoconstriction ad activation of the coagulation cascade. Hypercoagulable state can be inherited or acquired. These are - def of antithrombin III, protein C or S - increased homocysteine - factor V Leiden mutation - prothrombin gene mutation - antiphospholipid syndrome - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria - malignancy (lung cancer - most commonly pancreas, prostate, breast, ovary etc...) - nephrotic syndrome - pregnancy, high dose estrogen therapy or OCPs.

Most commonly affects boys aged 2-8 weeks.# Characterised by projectile vomiting after feeds and Gastric peristalsis can be seen and a lump felt# Weight loss is a striking feature and rapidly the infant becomes emaciated and dehydrated.Imaging# Ultrasonography is the investigation of choice. Contrast radiology is not now necessary.Treatment# Following diagnosis the first concern is to correct the metabolic abnormalities. Essentially this is the same situation that pertains in adults with the patient being dehydrated, with low sodium, chloride and potassium, and a metabolic alkalosis. The child should be rehydrated with dextrose--saline and potassium (2.5 per cent dextrose plus 0.45 percent sodium chloride plus 1 g of potassium chloride per 500 ml of fluid). This will restore the infant's clinical condition and electrolytes to normal. Following this operation is required.# Ramstedt's operation is surgery of choice.",B

A case of spontaneous pneumothorax comes to you. What will be the earliest t/t of choice -,IPPV,Needle aspiration,ICD,Wait and watch,"Pneumothorax: is the presence of gas in the pleural space.

Types :

(a) Spontaneous pheumothorax → is one that occurs without antecedent trauma to the thorax
(i) Primary spontaneous - Occurs in the absence of an underlying lung disease (usually d/t apical plural blebs).
(ii) Secondary spontaneous - d/t an underlying lung disease.


Traumatic pneumothorax → results from penetrating or non-penetrating injuries to the chest.
Tension pheumothorax → Any pneumothorax in which the pressure in the pleural space is positive
	throughout the respiratory cycle.


In this pt. it's not specified the type of spontaneous pneumothorax; still, let's see the t/t

Treatment
Primary spontaneous pneumothorax

Initial recommended treatment is a simple aspiration
If the lung does not expand with aspiration, or if the pt. has a recurrent pneumothorax, thoracoscopy with stapling of blebs and pleural abrasion is indicated (100% success rate)

Secondary Spontaneous pneumothorax

Sec. spon. pneumothorax can occur in any lung ds but are commonly seen in COPD.
Nearly all pts are t/t with tube thoracostomy and the installation of a sclerosing agent such as doxycycline or talc.
Pts. with a persistent air leak, an unexpanded lung after 3 days of tube thoracostomy, or a recurrent pneumothorax should be subjected to thoracoscopy with bleb resection and pleural abrasion.

Traumatic pneumothorax

Traumatic pneumothorax should be t/t with tube thoracostomy unless they are very small. If a hemopneumothorax is present, one chest tube should be placed in the superior part of the hemithorax to evacuate the air, and another should be placed in the inferior part of the hemithorax to remove the blood.

Tension pneumothorax

It is an emergency situation.
A large bore needle is inserted into the pleural space through the Second anterior intercostal space. The needle should be left in place until a thoracostomy tube is inserted.

All of the following are seen in persisting vomitting EXCEPT -,Hypokalemia,Decreased K+ in urine,Elevated pH of blood,Metabolic alkalosis,"Presistant vomitting causes loss of hydrochloric acid, K+ Na+ ions and body fluids.
Loss of HCl leads to metabolic alkalosis.
Loss of K+ leads to hypokalemia which further increases the pH of blood (intracellular K+ ions come out in the ECF by exchanging with H+ ions of ECF).
Hypokalemia should lead to decreased K+ in urine but this does not happen -
Low Na+ and hypovolemia would lead to increased aldosterone secretion which would increase the reabsorption of Na+ ions in the distal renal tubular in exchange of K+ ions. Thus K+ ions excretion in urine is increased despite hypokalemia.",B

Local anesthesia acts by blockage of -,Na+ channel,Ca++ channel],K+ channel,Mg++ channel,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ channel Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contactr without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted.o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :RecoveryResting (close)-Active (open)-Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na"" channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only wrhen the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad> Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A
Open biopsy is done for salivary gland tumor unless they are arising from:-,Palate,Buccal,Sublingual,Parotid,"Open surgical biopsy is contraindicated in parotid tumors because it can cause tumor seeding of the track and increased risk of parotid fistula formation. The initial imaging modality of choice is ultrasound as it demonstrates if the lump is intrinsic to the parotid or not. It also facilitates accurate sampling of the lesion by FNAC or True-Cut biopsy. Subsequently, CT and MRI are the most useful imaging techniques. Open surgical biopsy is contraindicated unless evidence of gross malignancy is present, and preoperative histological diagnosis is required as a prelude to radical parotidectomy.",D

Anaesthetic agent that predisposes to maximum arrhhmias,Isoflurance,Enflurane,Halothane,Ether,"Halothane-catecholamine sensitization also promotes abnormal automaticity of dominant and latent atrial pacemakers. These effects may produce premature ventricular contractions and arrhythmias originating from the His bundle. Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

(d) Sigmoid colectomy should be performed after confirming diagnosis.Sigmoid volvulus is the diagnosis of the given figure, observe the characteristic bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance, with the convexity of the loop lying in the right upper quadrant (opposite to the site of obstruction). Unless there are signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the initial management of sigmoid volvulus is resuscitation followed by endoscopic detorsion. Detorsion is usually most easily accomplished by using a rigid proctoscope, but a flexible sigmoidoscope or colonoscope may also be effective. Majority of patients are at risk of recurrence (up to 40%). For this reason, an elective sigmoid colectomy should be performed after the patient has been stabilized and undergone an adequate bowel preparation.

Best site for going spinal anaesthesia is interveebral space between.,L2 - L3,L3 - L4,L1 - L2,L5 - S1,"The spinal canal contains the spinal cord with its covering (the meninges), fatty tissue and venous plexus. The meninges are composed of three layers: the pia mater, the arachnoid mater and the Dura meter. The spinal subdural space is poorly demarcated. The epidural space is a better defined potential space within the spinal canal that is bounded by the Dura meter and ligamentum flavum. There is cerebrospinal fluid between pia meter and Archnoid meter and this space is called sub arachnoid space. The spinal cord normally extends from the foramen magnum to the level of L1 in adults. so in adults we can give spinal anesthesia below this level in L2/L3, L3/L4.

Regarding high-voltage electrical burns to an extremity,Injuries are generally more superficial than those of thermal burns,Intravenous fluid replacement is based on the percentage of body surface area burned,Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required,Evaluation for fracture of the other extremities and visceral injury is indicated,"The treatment of electrical injury should be modified from that of thermal burns because tissue damage is much deeper than is apparent at first inspection. The heat generated is propoional to the resistance to the flow of current. Bone, fat, and tendons offer the greatest resistance. Therefore, the tissue deep within the center of an extremity may be injured while more superficial tissues are spared. For this reason, the quantification of fluid requirements cannot be based on the percentage of body surface area involved, as in the Parkland,Brooke, or Baxter formulas, which are used to calculate fluid replacement after thermal burns. Massive fluid replacement is usually essential. A brisk urine output is desirable because of the likelihood of myonecrosis with consequent myoglobinuria and renal damage. As with deep thermal burns, debridement, skin grafting, and amputation of extremities may be required following electrical injury. However, fasciotomy is more frequently required than escharotomy with electrical injury because deep myonecrosis results in increased intracompamental pressures and compromised limb perfusion. In addition, distant fractures may result owing to vigorous muscle contraction during the accident or if subsequent falls occur. Cardiac or respiratory arrest may occur if the pathway of the current includes the hea or brain. An electrical current can also damage the pulmonary alveoli and capillaries and lead to respiratory infections, a major cause of death in these victims. Owing to the deep myonecrosis that often accompanies high-voltage injury, prophylaxis for clostridia with high-dose penicillin may be considered.",D

Scar tissue formation may be secondary to previous granulomatous disease (tuberculosis), infarction, or interstitial diseases of the lung associated with fibrosis (e.g., progressive systemic sclerosis).

One theory is that scar tissue blocks lymphatic drainage, causing an increased concentration of anthracotic pigment-containing carcinogens.

Least useful in Treatment of local anesthetic induced convulsions/seizures?,Phenytoin sodium,Thiopentone sodium,Midazolam,Propofol,"Ans. a (Phenytoin sodium) (Ref. Katzung pharma, 9th/Chapter 26; Anaesthesia by Ajay Yadav 3rd/pg. 111)When local anesthetic-induced seizures occur, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis develop rapidly. ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation) is the mainstay of treatment. Administration of O2 by mask, or ventilation support by bag and mask, is often all that is necessary to treat seizures. If seizures interfere with ventilation, benzodiazepines, small dose propofol or thiopental can be used. The use of succinylcholine effectively facilitates ventilation and, by abolishing muscular activity, decreases the severity of acidosis. However neuronal seizure activity is not inhibited and therefore, cerebral metabolism and oxygen requirements remain increased.LOCALANAESTHETICSMechanism of action of local anesthetics# Diffusion of the unionized (base) form across the nerve sheath and membrane# Re-equilibration between the base and cationic forms in the axoplasm# Binding of the cation to a receptor site inside of the Na+ channel, resulting in its blockade and consequent inhibition of Na+ conductance.Order of blockade: small fibre > large fibres; myelinated fibres > unmyelinated fibres.

Tamoxifen is a competitive inhibitor of estradiol, binding to the estrogen receptor. It has become a standard agent as a result of its anti-cancer activity and good tolerability profile. Tamoxifen is prescribed for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk patients, for the adjuvant therapy of early stage breast cancer, and for the therapy of advanced breast cancer.

Maylard Transverse Muscle cutting Incision3. Abdominothoracic incisionsPARAMEDIAN INCSIONSThe skin incision is placed 2 to 5 cm lateral to the midline over the medial aspect of the bulging transverse convexity of the rectus muscle.Skin and subcutaneous fat are divided along the length of the wound.The anterior rectus sheath is exposed and incised, and its medial edge is grasped and lifted up with hemostats.The medial portion of the rectus sheath then is dissected from the rectus muscle, to which the anterior sheath adheres.Segmental blood vessels encountered during the dissection should be coagulated.Once the rectus muscle is free of the anterior sheath it can be retracted laterally because the posterior sheath is not adherent to the rectus muscle.The posterior sheath and the peritoneum which are adherent to each other, are excised vertically in the same plane as the anterior fascial plane.The deep inferior epigastric vessels are encountered below the umbilicus and require ligation and division if they course medially along the line of the incision.As regards option D, sabiston mentions that there is enough overlap amongst various nerves in the abdomen, that there is no chance of neuropathy in any incision on abdomen. Also in majority of paramedian incisions the rectus muscle is not cut. There is no reason to support the loss of sensation in the nerves.INCISIONAL HERNIA AND INCISIONSThe rate of incisional hernia is highest in midline incisions.The lateral paramedian incision takes longer to perform, requires a longer incision, rarely results in dehiscence, and does confer protection against incisional hernia.The rate of hernia formation is lowest in transverse incisions.

Which of the following are histopathological features of Extra hepatic Biliary Atresia -a) Bile lakesb) Hepatocyte ballooning degenerationc) Marked bile duct proliferationd) Fibrosis of hepatic ducte) Parenchymal cholestasis,cde,acd,bde,ade,"• Characterized by progressive obliteration of the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts.
• Etiology is unknown; incidence 1 in 12,000 live births.
• Presently, there is no medical therapy to reverse the obliterative process
• Patients who are not offered surgical treatment uniformly develop biliary cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and death by 2 years of age.
• MC indication for pediatric liver transplantation
Pathology
• Bile duct proliferation, severe cholestasis with plugging, and inflammatory cell infiltrate are the pathologic hallmarks of this disease.
• Over time, these changes progress to fibrosis with end-stage cirrhosis.
• Positive for neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56) staining
Variants of biliary atresia
• Patency to the level of CBD
• Patency to the level of common hepatic duct
• Left and right hepatic duct at porta involved, solid porta hepatis (90%)
Clinical Features
• Infants with biliary atresia present with jaundice at birth or shortly thereafter.
• Infants with biliary atresia characteristically have acholic, pale gray stools, secondary to obstructed bile flow.
• With passage of time, progressive failure to thrive and, if untreated, develop stigmata of liver failure and portal hypertension (splenomegaly and esophageal varices)
• Associated malformations in 25%: Polysplenia, malrotation, preduodenal portal vein, and intrahepatic vena cava.
Diagnosis
• USG of the liver and GB is important in the evaluation of the infant with cholestasis.
• USG: GB is shrunken and CBD is not visible. A triangle cord sign found on ultrasound has a predictive accuracy of 95%, the gallbladder ghost triad in which the gallbladder is short (<1.9 cm) and irregular and lacks an echogenic inner lining also got good sensitivity.
• Next diagnostic step: Percutaneous liver biopsy if the hepatic synthetic function is normal (diagnostic accuracy 90%).
• Hepatobiliary scintigraphy: In cases in which the USG and biopsy findings are inconclusive (absent excretion into the intestine)
Treatment
• Exploratory laparotomy: If the needle biopsy or abdominal ultrasound is consistent with BA
• Intra-operative cholecystocholangiography: To confirm the diagnosis, demonstration of the fibrotic biliary remnant and definition of absent proximal and distal bile duct patency
• Treatment of choice: Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy)
Postoperative Management
• Ursodeoxycholic acid (facilitate bile flow) + Methylprednisolone (anti-inflammatory agent) + TMP-SMX (antimicrobial prophylaxis)
• Cholangitis is the MC post-operative complication.
Prognosis
• About 30% of infants undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy before 60 days of age will have a long-term successful outcome and not require liver transplantation.
• Liver transplantation in the patients who develop progressive hepatic fibrosis with resultant portal hypertension and progressive cholestasis.
• Serum bilirubin at 3 months after surgery seems to be strongly predictive of long-term survival.",A

Which of the following causes orchitis without epididymitis: March 2009,Syphilis,TB,Gonorrhoea,Chlamvdia trachomatis,"Ans. A: Syphilis In most cases of acute orchitis, the testicle is inflamed due to the spread of a bacterial infection from the epididymis, and therefore ""epididymo-orchitits"" is the correct term. Acute epididymo-orchitis is usually a primary bacterial or rarely a tuberculous infection of the epididymis that has spread to the testicle to involve both structures. Rarely, it can sta in the testicle and spread to the epididymis. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease causing acute epididymitis, though gonococcal is still prevalent. TB epididymitis should be considered when the vas is thickened and there is little response to the ususal antibiotics. Acute epididymo-orchitits develops in about 18% of males suffering from mumps, usually as the parotid swelling is waning. Orchitis may be seen in syphilis and leprosy",A

What was the cause?",Pseudocholinesterase deficiency causing prolonged action of succinylcholine,Type II depolarizing block caused by succinylcholine,Undiagnosed muscle dystrophy complicated by succinylcholine,Fasciculations produced by succinylcholine,"The only depolarizing type of neuromuscular blocker in clinical use is succinylcholine (SCh). Succinylcholine mimics acetylcholine in action and it causes muscle relaxation by causing persistent depolarization of motor end plate. This is also known as phase I blockade. Repeated doses or continuous infusion may cause phase II block. Clinically relevant phase II block can occur with total succinylcholine doses as low as 4 mg/kg in some patients, with either repeat dosing or continuous infusions. Such block may be evident with tetanic stimulation in highly sensitive muscle groups, later respiratory muscles are involved. Patients having abnormal pseudocholinesterase experiences prolonged paralysis after administration of succinylcholine. Ref: Anaesthesia By M.

TNM staging as per AJCC is:",T1N1M0,T1N2M0,T0N1M0,T0N2M0,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary is defined as the identification of squamous cell carcinoma in one or more lymph nodes within the head and neck region that are not solely in the supraclavicular region, without an identifiable primary tumor.
Isolated supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, including those of squamous cell origin, almost always originate from cancer in the skin or a primary site beneath the clavicles (ie, lung, breast, colon, prostate, esophagus, cervix, urethral, and lymphoma primaries).
Head and neck cancers arise from a variety of sites within the head and neck region, which is divided into five basic areas:

Oral cavity
Pharynx
Larynx
Nasal cavity & paranasal sinuses &
Salivary glands

Cancers of the brain, thyroid, eye, ear, scalp, skin, teeth, bones (including skull base), and muscles, are not included with squamous cell cancers of the head and neck.
Most head and neck cancers begin in the mucosal surfaces of the head and neck region (upper aerodigestive tract) and are predominantly squamous cell carcinomas.
Cancers of the Head and Neck are classified using the tumor node metastases (TNM) staging system of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).
The T classifications indicating the extent of the primary tumor are site specific but there is considerable overlap in the cervical node (N) classifications.

Must know: Ewing's sarcoma typically involves the diaphyseal region of long bones. The presence of p30/32, the product of the mic-2 gene (which maps to the pseudoautosomal region of the X and Y chromosomes) is a cell-surface marker for Ewing's sarcoma (and other members of the Ewing's family of tumors, sometimes called Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNETs). Glycogen-filled cytoplasm detected by staining with periodic acid-Schiff is also characteristic of Ewing's sarcoma cells. The classic cytogenetic abnormality associated with this disease (and other PNETs) is a reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 11 and 22, t(11;22).

Mostly the underlying cause is a duct papilloma or duct ectasia, but since the chances of malignancy are high, it must be investigated further. The risk of malignancy increases if an underlying mass is present.
Investigation used are

Mammography - can show any underlying suspicious lesion.
Cytological examination - this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer.
Galactography/Ductography.


The primary indication for ductography is nipple discharge, particularly when bloody.
Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential since excision of the bloody duct system is indicated regardless of finding.
In this study, a contrast medium is injected into the discharging duct and a mammogram taken. The injected may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular masses or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Duct ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures.
Ultrasound - may show the presence of an underlying mass or duct ectasia.
The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (Microdochotomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them for a histopathological diagnosis.

Percentage of thiopentone used for induction is,0.50%,1.50%,2.50%,4.50%,"The usual concentration of thiopental is 2.5%. The usual doses of thiopental (3 to 4 mg/kg) and thiamylal (3 to 4 mg/kg) are approximately twice the dose of methohexital (1 to 2 mg/kg). In dose-response studies, the ED50 for thiopental ranged from 2.2 to 2.7 mg/kg, and the ED50 for methohexital was 1.1 mg/kg. Less interpatient variability is seen in the dose-response to barbiturates than to benzodiazepines when used for anesthesia induction, but significant variability remains in the dose of thiopental required to induce anesthesia. Interpatient dose variability is related to the presence of hemorrhagic shock, cardiac output, lean body mass, obesity, gender, and age. Hemorrhagic shock, lean body mass, age, and obesity explain the variability of patients' responses resulting from a decrease in the central volume of distribution. Finally, patients who have severe anemia, burns, malnutrition, widespread malignant disease, uremia, ulcerative colitis, or intestinal obstruction also require smaller induction doses of barbiturates.

"Neurocardiagenic syncope, the least useful investigation is :",Tilt table,Carotid sinus massage,Carotid duplex scan,Ohostatic blood pressure recording,"Carotid duplex scan Neurocardiogenic syncope is also called vasovagal syncope or vasodepressor syncope. It is considered to be an abnormality in the complex neurocardiovascular interactions responsible for maintaining systemic and cerebral perfusion. Under normal circumstances, upright posture causes venoul polling and a transient decrease in aerial pressure, resulting in unloading of baroreceptors. Reflex augumentation of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawl results in peripheral aerial vasoconstriction, venoconstriction and an increase in hea rate and contractility. These adaptive mechanisms serve to maintain normal systemic and cerebral perfusion. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular response to upright posture for prolonged periods. In these patients due to incompletely understood mechanisms the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors are stimulated resulting in increased neural stimulus to vasomotor centre. This results in reflex paradoxical vasodilation and bradycardia. The final result is hypotension, cerebral hypopeifusion, cerebral hypoxia and syncope. Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope : Tilt table study It is used to evaluate patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. In a tilt table study the patient is strapped to a table which is then mechanically tilted to an upright position. While monitoring the pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and sometimes blood oxygen saturation, the patient is left in a 'motionless standing position' for 20 to 30 minutes. When the patient's syncope is reproduced during the test a ""positive"" tilt table study is said to have occurred. During an upright tilt, a patient's cardiovascular system has to adjust itself in order to prevent a significant poion of the blood volume from pooling in the legs. These adjustments consists of a mild increase in hea rate and a constriction of blood vessels in the legs. When a normal individual is placed in an upright tilt, these cardiovascular adjustments occur very quickly, and there is no significant drop in the blood pressure. However, in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, these adjustments do not occur. Carotid sinus massage In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, the symptoms can be elicited by carotid sinus massage. Ohostatic blood pressure recording Supine and upright blood pressure monitoring should be done in all patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Carotid duplex scan Carotid duplex scan is a non-invasive study to estimate the presence and severity of carotid narrowing due to atherosclerosis. In neurocardiogenic syncope, no organic cause is present, so carotid duplex scan has no role.",C

These injuries are common in both rural and urban environments and result from motor vehicle crashes, domestic violence, spoing events, and accidents involving bicycle handlebars. The clinical presentation of splenic injury is highly variable. Most patients with minor focal injury to the spleen complain of left upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Left shoulder tenderness may also be present as a result of subdiaphragmatic nerve root irritation with referred pain. With free intraperitoneal blood, diffuse abdominal pain, peritoneal irritation, and rebound tenderness are more likely.

A child is spinned around by holding his hand by his father. While doing this the child staed crying and does not allow his father to touch his elbow. The diagnosis is:,Pulled elbow,Radial head dislocation,Annular ligament tear,Fracture olecranon process,"Pulled elbow or Nursemaid's elbow occurs in children under 4 years old. It is caused by a sudden pull on the extended pronated arm, usually by an adult tugging on a reluctant toddler. The pronated radial head slips paially under the annular ligament and displaces into the radiocapitellar joint. The child suddenly stops using the arm, holding it in a flexed and pronated position. Radiographs show no abnormalities, since positioning for elbow films will often reduce the subluxation. Reduction is achieved by firmly supinating the forearm and flexing the elbow while pressing down on the radial head. Often, a ""click"" is felt when reduction is achieved. Soon after reduction the child becomes less apprehensive and gradually resumes use of the arm. Ref: Srinivasan R.C., Tolhurst S., Vanderhave K.L. (2010). Chapter 40. Ohopedic Surgery. In G.M.

Left-sided tumours: rectal bleeding, alteration in bowel habit, tenesmus, obstruction.- The main symptoms are those of increasing intestinal obstruction.- Alteration of bowel habit. An adult previously having a predictably regula bowel habit suddenly develops irregularity.- The episodes of constipation may be followed by attacks of diarrhoea.- Distension. Lower abdominal distension is not uncommon and, as with the pain, is relieved by passing flatus.Carcinoma of the sigmoid- This follows the general pattern of the above, with these differences:- Pain is usually colicky from the outset.- Tenesmus. Low tumours may give rise to a feeling of the need for evacuation, which may result in tenesmus accompanied by the passage of mucus and blood, especially in the early morning.- Bladder symptoms are not unusual and in some instances may herald a colovesical fistula.Right-sided tumours- iron deficiency anaemia, abdominal mass are presenting features.Carcinoma of the transverse colon- This may be mistaken for a carcinoma of the stomach because of the position of the tumour together with anaemia and lassitude.Carcinoma of the caecum and ascending colon* Anaemia, severe and unyielding to treatment; there may be a palpable tumour present.* The presence of a mass in the right iliac fossa.

Chylolymphatic (most common)           
simple (mesothelial)
Enterogenous
Urogenital remnan 
Dermoid (teratomatous cyst)

Chylolymphatic cyst

Usually are congenital, resulting from developmental sequestration of lymphatics.
It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum.
Cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst.
Cyst is not lined by mucosa.
It is filled with clear lymph or chyle.
A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extreme rare cases, multiple cyst may be seen.
Cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular.
A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of gut.


Enterogenous cyst


Believed to be derived either from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine.
An enterogenous cyst has thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated.
The content is mucinous
The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply therefore enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related portion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

Which of the following induction agent produce cardiac stabilityaEUR',Ketamine,Etomidate,Propofol,Midazolam,"Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular system Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in aerial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol : The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in aerial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload). Propofol markedly impairs the normal aerial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload. Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental) The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, basline autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure. Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in hea rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes. However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia. congestive hea ,failure, 13 adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression. Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular system Ketamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased aerial blood pressure, hea rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work. Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary aery disease, uncontrolled hypeension, congestive hea failure and aerial aneurysms.",B

The following is a marker of Paget's disease of the mammary gland,S-100,HMB 45,CEA,Neuron specific enolase,"Ans is 'c' ie CEA Paget's ds is a chronic eczematous disease on the skin of the nipple and the areola , with an associated intraductal carcinoma of the underlying mammary gland. Pathophysiology: The pathogenesis of mammary PD and the origin of Paget cells were once controversial. It is now widely accepted as an underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium. Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. Paget cells often express cell markers that mimic those of the underlying breast carcinoma, including glandular epithelial cell markers (ie, low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, or CAM 5.2). They also express tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (TP53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast.",C

IV Fluids only 30% loss of blood volume is a moderate grade of hypovolemia and can be managed adequately by IV fluids only. Cardiac stimulants, dopamine or vasopressor agents are required only in severe hypovolemia (> 40% loss).

Volume resuscitation is initated with the rapid infusion of isotonic saline or a balanced salt solution such as Ringers lactate through large bore IV lines. No distinct benefit from the use of colloids have been demonstrated and in trauma patients, it is associated with a higher moality. The infusion of 2 to 3 lt. over 20 to 30 min should restore normal hemodynamic parameters. Continued hemodynamic instability implies that shock has not been reversed and/or that there are significant ongoing blood or volume losses. Continued blood loss, with haemoglobin concentration declining to 10 g/dl should initiate blood transfusion. In the presence of severe and for prolonged hypovolemia, inotropic suppo with dopamine vasopressin or dobutamine may be required to maintain adequate ventricular performance, after blood volume has been restored. Infusion of norepinephrine to increase aerial pressure by raising peripheral resistance is inappropriate, other than as a temporizing measure in severe shock while blood volume is reexpanded.""",A
"In a pregnant female, there is decreased requirement of the spinal anaesthetic agent because of all of the following except –",Exaggerated lumbar lordosis,Decreased volume of subarachnoid space,Engorgement of epidural veins,Increased sensitivity of the nerves to anaesthetic agent,"A smaller dose of local anaesthetic is nedded to produce the same level of neuraxial block in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women.
The causes may be :-


Compression of the inferior vena cava by the pregnant uterus causes ""distension or engorgment"" of the epidural venous plexus. This decreases the volume of the epidural space and also the volume of the CSF per spinal segment. Therefore a given dose of epidural or intrathecal local anaesthetic will produce a greater degree of demiatomal involvement.
Pregnant women exhibit increase susceptibility to local anaesthetics.

Capillary malformations (port wine stains or nevus flammeus)

Capillary malformations (port wine stains or nevus flammeus) are low-flow vascular malformations of dermal capillaries and postcapillary venules.
They are present at birth as blanchable pink to red patches.
They may be located anywhere on the body, most commonly on the face, typically with a unilateral or segmental distribution that respects the midline.
On the face, they tend to follow the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches (segments V1 , V2 , and V3 )

A 25-year-old male cigarette smoker has a history of respiratory infections and has also been found to have hematuria. A high value for diffusing capacity is noted during pulmonary function testing. This finding is consistent with which of the following disorders?,Anemia,Cystic fibrosis,Emphysema,intrapulmonary hemorrhage,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1450-1451.) Carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity provides an estimate of the rate at which oxygen moves by diffusion from alveolar gas to combine with hemoglobin in the red blood cells. It is interpreted as an index of the surface area engaged in alveolar-capillary diffusion. Measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung is done by having the person inspire a low concentration of carbon monoxide. The rate of uptake of the gas by the blood is calculated from the difference between the inspired and expired concentrations. The test can be performed during a single 10-second breath holding or during 1 minute of steady-state breathing. The diffusing capacity is defined as the amount of carbon monoxide transferred per minute per millimeter of mercury of driving pressure and correlates with oxygen transpo from the alveolus into the capillaries. Primary parenchymal disorders, anemia, and removal of lung tissue decrease the diffusing capacity. Conversely, polycythemia, congestive hea failure, and intrapulmonary hemorrhage tend to increase the value for diffusing capacity. In this patient, the possibility of Goodpasture syndrome would be considered.",D

Carcinoma in which surgery is rarely indicated,Osteosarcoma,Wilm's tumor,Neuroblastoma,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) (or simply bone cancer) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid. Treatment A complete radical, surgical, en bloc resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma. Although about 90% of patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications, paicularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence may cause the need for fuher surgery or amputation. Mifamuide is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists. Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical oncologist and an ohopedic oncologist experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell necrosis (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery. Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage ohopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-aerial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low. Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best repoed 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-aerial regimen that individualizes therapy based on aeriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65-70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia.

Which of the following is the most effective intravesical therapy for superficial bladder cancer,Mitomycin,Adriamycin,Thiotepa,BCG,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the main intravesical immunotherapy for treating superficial bladder cancer.BCG is put directly into the bladder through a catheter. The body's immune system cells are attracted to the bladder and activated by BCG, which in turn affects the bladder cancer cells. Treatment is usually staed a few weeks after a TURBT(trans urethral resection of bladder tumour) and is given once a week for 6 weeks at a dose of 120mg in 150ml of normal saline .Reference : page 1036 SRB's manual of surgery 5th edition",D
Inability to adduct the thumb is due to the injury of: March 2009,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,Radial nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,"Ans. B: Ulnar Nerve Ulnar Nerve I. Lesion at the elbow The term cubital tunnel syndrome is often used for ulnar nerve compression at the elbow. Total paralysis of the nerve, including those branches of the nerve serving the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor carpi ulnaris muscles, causes wasting along medial side of forearm. Paralysis of the nerve also leads to weakness of flexion of fouh and fifth fingers; if proximal poions of these fingers are held steady, patient is unable to flex terminal phalanges. With paralysis of hypothenar muscles, abduction of fifth finger is impossible. Paralysis of interossei and medial two lumbricals causes 'claw hand' deformity, mainly seen in the ulnar fingers. There may be wasting of hypothenar muscles, interossei and medial pa of thenar eminence. Also there is weakness in movement of fingers and abduction to the extended thumb against the palm. There is sensory loss of the dorsal and palmar aspects of the medial side of the hand together with the medial one and a half fingers. With compression of the ulnar nerve, the ulnar nerve is often palpably enlarged in the ulnar groove and for a sho distance proximal to the elbow. II. Lesion at the wrist Cutaneous sensation of hand and fingers is often spared. If lesion is just proximal to the wrist, it causes impaired sensation on the palmar aspects of hand and the fouh and fifth fingers and muscle weakness, especially in the hypothenar eminence. Adductor pollicis will be injured in ulnar nerve injuries so patient will hold the book by using the flexor pollicis longus (supplied by median nerve).This is the basis of book test/froment sign. Positive Tinel's sign on percussion over ulnar nerve at wrist (light percussion over the nerve causes a sensation of ""pins and needles"" in the distribution of the nerve, i.e. ulnar side of hand and fouh and fifth fingers).

Coical inhibitory pathways are most susceptible resulting in excitatory motor phenomenon in initial stages of LA toxicity.Hypercapnia, respiratory & metabolic acidosis exacerbates CNS toxicityQ. Increased PaCO2 increases cerebral blood flow delivering greater dose of LA more rapidly to brain. And decreased intracellular pH ours formation of non diffusable cationic (protonated) form of LA, which is trapped within neuron. Finally plasma protein binding of LA is decreased in acidic environment resulting in increased availability of free drug for diffusion into brain.But the involvement of the peripheral nerve is characterized by parathesies, numbness, hypaesthesia, pain and neurological dysfunction.So, this patient is having peripheral nerve injury.

Earliest reflex to reappear after spinal shock ?,Knee jerk,Ankle jerk,Bulbocavemous reflex,Abdominal reflex,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Bulbocavernous reflex Spinal shock Spinal shock refers to the period after spinal cord injury (usually 24-48 hours) when the reflex activity of the entire spinal cord becomes depressed. During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are not functioning. Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. There is loss of autonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion. Signs of spinal shock include : 1. Flaccid paralysis 2. Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexes The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock. o An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves. The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. The significance of spinal shock lies in the determination of whether a patient has sustained a complete vs incomplete spinal cord injury. This cannot be determined until spinal shock has ended. If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level of in jury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury. If there is some residual function distal to the level of injury after resolution of spinal shock indicates incomplete cord injury. High thoracic cord has poor prognosis as this area has narrow spinal canal and precarious blood supply, watershade area of blood supply lies in upper thoracic region.",C

Thiopentone is C/I in,Acute intermittent porphyria,Bronchial asthma,Shock,All the above,"Barbiturates promote aminolevulinic acid synthetase, which stimulates the formation of porphyrin (an intermediary in heme synthesis). This may precipitate acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria in susceptible individuals. Barbiturates incompletely depress airway reflex responses to laryngoscopy and intubation, and airway instrumentation may lead to bronchospasm (in asthmatic patients) or laryngospasm in lightly anesthetized patients. In situations where the baroreceptor response will be blunted or absent (eg, hypovolemia, congestive hea failure, b-adrenergic blockade), cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated peripheral pooling of blood and direct myocardial depression.

Diffusion hypoxia seen during ?,Induction of anesthesia,Reversal of anesthesia,Post operative period,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reversal of anaesthesia Second gas effect and diffusion hvpoxia In initial pa of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air.",B

Accounts for 80% of all thyroid malignancies in iodine-sufficient areas.
MC thyroid cancer in children and individuals exposed to external radiation.
More often in women, 30-40 years.

Pathology:

Grossly: Hard and whitish and remain flat on sectioning with a blade with macroscopic calcification, necrosis, or cystic changes.
Multifocality is common (up to 85% of cases) on microscopic examination.
Multifocality is associated with an increased risk of cervical nodal metastases.
Rarely invade adjacent structures such as the trachea, esophagus, and RLN.
Rarely encapsulated (PCT are seldom encapsulated).
Other variants: Tall cell, insular, columnar, diffuse sclerosing, clear cell, trabecular, and poorly differentiated types; account for about 1%; associated with a worse prognosis.

Histological characteristics of Papillary Carcinoma Thyroid:

Papillary projections: PTC contains branching papillae of cuboidal epithelial cells
Orphan Annie eyed nuclei: The nuclei contain finely dispersed chromatin, which imparts an optically clear or empty appearance, giving rise to term ground glass or Orphan Annie eyed nuclei.
Invaginations of cytoplasm in cross-sections: Intranuclear inclusions (pseudo-inclusion) or intranuclear grooves.
Diagnosis of PTC is based on these nuclear characteristics even in the absence of papillary structures.
Psammoma bodies: Microscopic, calcified deposits representing clumps of sloughed cells.

Clinical Features:

Most patients are euthyroid and present with a slow-growing painless mass in the neck.
Dysphagia, dyspnea and dysphonia are associated with locally advanced invasive disease.
Lymph node metastases are common, especially in children and young adults, and may be the presenting complaint.
“Lateral aberrant thyroid” almost always denotes a cervical lymph node that has been invaded by metastatic cancer.
Distant metastases are uncommon at initial presentation, but may ultimately develop in up to 20% of patients.
The MC sites of metastasis: Lungs >bone >liver >brain.

Diagnosis:

Diagnosis is established by FNAC of the thyroid mass or lymph node.
Once thyroid cancer is diagnosed on FNAC, a complete neck ultrasound to evaluate the contralateral lobe and for LN metastases in the central and lateral neck compartments.

Treatment: Total or near-total thyroidectomy

During thyroidectomy, enlarged central neck nodes should be removed.
Biopsy-proven lymph node metastases detected clinically or by imaging in the lateral neck in patients with papillary carcinoma are managed with modified radical neck dissection.

"Regarding injury to pancreas, what is NOT true ?",Majority of postoperative complications are due to missed duct injury,Commonly associated with vascular injury,Peritoneal lavage is good for making the diagnosis,All,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Fracture is common at the junction of head and body Pancreas being a retroperitoneal structure, peritoneal lavage is not helpful in making the diagnosis of pancreatic injury. CT scan is the best diagnostic procedure, apa from an exploratory laprotomy More about Pancreatic injury About two-thirds are due to penetrating injuries and rest one-third due to blunt trauma. Pancreatic injuries are usually associated with injury to other visceral organ. Isolated pancreatic injuries are rare. In blunt injuries which are usually the result of midline upper abdominal trauma (eg. car seat belt, cycle handle), junction of the neck and body of the pancreas are most commonly injured as they are pressed against the veebral column. Major abdominal vascular injuries are present in more than 75% of cases of penetrating trauma. ""The presence of pancreatic duct injury appears to be a key factor in postoperative morbidity."" - Sabiston Also know Serum amylase levels are elevated in most patients with significant pancreatic trauma, but they are also increased in up to 90% of severe abdominal trauma patients who do not have pancreatic injury. Thus measurement of amylase at the time of hospital admission is not helpful in identifying those with pancreatic injury. On the other hand a progressive rise in serum amylase activity is a more specific indicator of pancreatic injury. Treatment The treatment of pancreatic injury depends on its grade and extent. - Minor injuries not involving a major duct may be treated nonoperatively. Moderate injuries usually require operative exploration, debridement, and the placement of external drains. More severe injuries including those with major duct injury or transection of the gland, may require distal resection or external drainage.",B

The bursa develops within the first years of life as a result of mechanical pressure and friction, and it serves the purpose of reducing friction on underlying structures and allowing maximal range of motion in the knee. Aseptic prepatellar bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive work in a kneeling position, hence the name ""housemaid's knee",C
True about femoral hernia:,Commoner in males,Least likely to strangulate,Richter's hernia is its variant,Litter's hernia is its type,"Ans C. (Richter's hernia is its variant). (Ref. Bailey & Love surgery 25th/977)FEMORAL HERNIAS# Account for 1% of all abdominal wall hernia (third most common type of primary hernia).# Female: male ratio is 4:1# Commonest in middle aged and elderly women, More common in parous# Rare in children# Much less common than inguinal hernias but are as common as inguinal hernias in older women# Anatomy of the femoral canal- Anterior border is the inguinal ligament- Posterior border is the pectineal ligament- Medial border is the lacunar ligament- Lateral border is the femoral vein# Management of femoral hernia# All uncomplicated femoral hernias should be repaired as an urgent elective procedure# Three classical approaches to the femoral canal have been described- Low (Lockwood)- Transinguinal (Lotheissen)- High (McEvedy)# Irrespective of approach used the following will be achieved- Dissection of the sac- Reduction/inspection of the contents- Ligation of the sac# Approximation of the inguinal and pectineal ligamentsAlso remember:The relationships of an indirect inguinal and a femoral hernia to the pubic tubercle; the inguinal hernia emerges above and medial to the tubercle whereas the femoral hernia lies below and lateral to it.Although inguinal hernia may be 10 times more common than femoral hernia, a femoral hernia is more likely to strangulate because of the narrowness of the neck and its rigid surrounds. Femoral hernias should be operated on as soon as possible.Surgical anatomyThe femoral canal occupies the most medial compartment of the femoral sheath and extends from the femoral ring above to the saphenous opening below. It is 1.25 cm long and 1.25 cm wide at its base, which is directed upwards. The femoral canal contains fat, lymphatic vessels and the lymph node of Cloquet. It is closed above by the septum crurale, a condensation of extraperitoneal tissue.Special types of hernia# Richter's hernia Partial enterocele (circumference of intestine involved), presents with strangulation and obstruction# Maydl's hernia W loop strangulation, strangulated bowel within abdominal cavity.# Littre's hernia Strangulated Meckel's diverticulum, can cause small bowel fistula.",C

Which of the following vessels is involved in extradural haematoma?,Middle meningeal artery,Venous sinuses,Bridging veins,Middle cerebral artery,"Ans. a (Middle meningeal artery). (Ref: B & L, Surgery, 25th/ 303).Extradural haematoma (EDH)# It is a neurosurgical emergency. An EDH is nearly always associated with a skull fracture and is more common in young male patients. The skull fracture is asso- ciated with tearing of a meningeal artery and a haematoma accumulates in the space between bone and dura. The most common site is temporal, as the pterion is not only the thinnest part of the skull but also overlies the largest meningeal artery - the middle meningeal.# An EDH may also occur in other regions such as frontal as well as in the posterior fossa. They are not always arte- rial: disruption of a major dural venous sinus can result in an EDH. The force required to sustain a skull fracture can be surprisingly small - a fall from standing or a single blow to the head.# The classical presentation of an EDH, occurring in less than one-third of cases, is initial injury followed by a lucid interval when the patient complains of a headache but is fully alert and orientated with no focal deficit. After minutes or hours a rapid deterioration occurs, with contralateral hemiparesis, reduced conscious level and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation as a result of brain compression and herniation.FEATUREEDH (EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA)SDH (SUBDURAL HEMATOMA)Incidence1-4%10-20%EtiologyLacerated middle meningeal artery/ dural sinus in 70 to 85% cases.Stretching, tearing of bridging cortical veins.AgeAnyOlder peoplefractureSeen in 85-95% cases-LocationBetween skull & dura.95% supratentorialCrosses dural attachments but not sutures.Between dura & arachnoid95% supratentorialCrosses suture but not dural attachmentBilateral5%15%CT- Biconvex (lentiform shape)- 2/3 hyperdense (- 1/3 mixed density)- Displace greywhite interfacea) Acute SDH: Crescentic & hyperdenseb) Subacute SDH: May be nearly isodense with cortex neo-membrane, underlying vessels may enhance.c) Chronic SDH: Hypodense with enhancing membrane.

Which of the following explains why individuals with hyperlipidemia and/or gout should minimize their intake of sucrose and high fructose syrups?,Fructose is initially phosphorylated by liver fructokinase,"After intial modification, fructose is cleaved by a specific enolase",Fructose is conveed to UDP-fructose,Fructose is ultimately conveed to galactose,"Fructose is initially phosphorylated by liver fructokinase. Fructose is taken in by humans as sucrose, sucrose-containing syrups, and the free sugar. Fructose is mainly phos-phorylated to fructose-1-phosphate by liver fructokinase. Aldol cleavage by fructose-1-phosphate-specific aldolase, not enolase, yields glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triose kinase, and both triose phosphates can enter glycolysis. Excess fructose from commercial foods can exercise adverse effects by raising blood lipids and uric acid. Fructose phosphorylation bypasses phosphofructokinase, a regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and provides excess glycerol metabolites and excess triglyceride lipid biosynthesis. Fructose phosphorylation can also deplete liver cell ATP, lessening its inhibition of adenine nucleotide degradation and increasing production of uric acid. In adipocytes, fructose can be alternatively phosphorylated by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate. However, this reaction is competitively inhibited by appreciable amounts of glucose, as it is in other tissues.",A

False statements about carcinoma esophagus are all of the following except: March 2007,Most common in lower third,"Histologically, adenocarcinoma only",Unrelated to tobacco chewing,It is more common in females,"Ans. A: Most common in lower third There are a number of risk factors for esophageal cancer: Age-Most patients are over 60. Gender-It is more common in men. Heredity-It is more likely in people who have close relatives with cancer. Tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use increase the risk. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its resultant Barrett's esophagus increase esophageal cancer risk due to the chronic irritation of the mucosal lining (adenocarcinoma is more common in this condition, while all other risk factors predispose more for squamous cell carcinoma). Human papillomavirus (HPV) Paicular dietary substances, such as nitrosamine. Plummer-Vinson syndrome (anemia and esophageal webbing) Tylosis and Howel-Evans syndrome (hereditary thickening of the skin of the palms and soles). Radiation therapy for other conditions in the mediastinum. Celiac disease predisposes towards squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma may develop at the achalasia segment due to persistent retention esophagitis as a result of fermentation of food residues. The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 inches long) is commonly divided into three pas for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur distally and squamous cell carcinomas proximally, but the converse may also be the case. Worldwide squamous cell carcinoma is most common whereas adenocarcinomas predominates in the west. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption. Adenocarcinomas are often associated with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopy is the first line investigation for most patients.",A
Drug of choice for lignocaine toxicity ?,Phenytoin,Phenobarbitone,Beta-blockers,Amiodarone,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phenobarbitone Lignocaine toxicity Lignocaine toxicity occurs with unintended intravascular administration or with administration of excessive dose Toxicity may be observed at 6 ug/ml, but more commonly occur once levels exceed 10 tg/ml. Clinical manifestations 1. CNS manifestations These are the most common manifestations of toxicity. CNS lidocaine toxicity is biphasic Earlier manifestations-are due to CNS excitation e.g. convulsions Subsequent manifestations -are due to CNS depression drowsiness, disorientation, respiratory depression. The cause of biphasic response is Local anaesthetic action first blocks inhibitary CNS pathways-resulting in stimulation Eventually blocks both inhibitory and excitatory pathways- overall CNS depression 2. Cardiovascular manifestations These occur at higher serum concentrations There may be cardiac depression, hypotension, coma, respiratory arrest. Note: lignocaine can precipitate malignant hypehermia Management of toxicity If lignocaine toxicity is suspected, stop the injection immediately. Ensure adequate oxygenation, whether by face mask or by intubation. Anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are the drug of choice for seizure control. Succinykholine is sometimes also used to terminate the neuromuscular effects of seizures. If CVS symptoms occur (cardiac depression and hypotension), IVfluid and vasopressor agents may be required.

Adrenocoical adenomas are most common, followed by adrenocoical carcinoma, metastases from other primary cancers, and pheochromocytoma. Biochemical evaluation must weigh the prevalence of adrenal neoplasms against the consequences of a missed life-threatening diagnosis, as in pheochromocytoma. All adrenal masses should be evaluated for pheochromocytoma with measurement of 24-hour urine catecholamines and their metabolites. Aldosterone and coisol measurement are indicated if clinical features suggest aldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome. Fine-needle aspiration of adrenal masses is indicated for clearly cystic lesions or if metastasis is suspected based on the presence of another known primary. Fine-needle aspiration is not routinely indicated in the evaluation of adrenal lesions and is contraindicated until pheochromocytoma is definitively excluded. Adrenal lesions should be resected if they are functional, are larger than 6 cm., or have enlarged during follow-up.",C

40 years male presents with translucent scrotal swelling in which it is possible to get above the swelling on examination. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Hydrocele,Indirect inguinal hernia,Varicocele,Sebaceous cyst,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hydrocele * Hydroceles are typically translucent and it is possible to 'get above the swelling' on examination of the scrotum.Hydrocele* A hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serious fluid in a part of the processus vaginalis, usually the tunica.* Hydrocele fluid contains albumin and fibrinogen. If the contents of a hydrocele are allowed to drain into a collecting vessel, the liquid does not clot; however, the fluid coagulates if mixed with even a trace of blood that has been in contact with damaged tissue.* About 5% of inguinal hernias are associated with a vaginal hydrocele on the same side.* In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent.* Encysted hydrocele of the cord is a smooth oval swelling near the spermatic cord, which is liable to be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. The swelling moves downwards and becomes less mobile if the testis is pulled gently downwards.* Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is a similar condition in females. The cyst lies in relation to the round ligament and is always at least partially within the inguinal canal.",A

PPI's are very effective if nonoperative management fails, surgical intervention should be considered. Preoperative evaluation includes manometry, 24-hour pH test and esophagogram, in addition to endoscopy. Manometry evaluates the LES resting pressure and effectiveness of peristalsis. The 24-hour pH test is the gold standard for diagnosing and quantifying acid reflux. Esophagogram shows the external anatomy of the esophagus and proximal stomach, as well as demonstrating the presence of a hiatal hernia. Nissen fundoplication is a 360deg gastric wrap.

T/t of choice for grade IV vesicoureteric reflux with recurrent UTI -,Cotrimoxazole,Bilateral reimplantation of ureter,Injection of Collegen in the ureter,Endoscopic resection of ureter,"Ans is 'a' ie. Cotrimoxazale Don't get misled by this statement given in O.P. Ghai - ""Operative correction of VUR is indicated in pts. with -persistent severe (grade IV or V) reflux"". This statement does not mean that any pt. with grade IV & V reflux will be given surgical management and rest medical management. Treatment is not so clear-cut. The choice b/w medical or surgical modality is based on ceain principles (go through the following text to understand it). The below given explanation is a bit lengthy. Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most impoant but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment). This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient) Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvis Grading of VUR : is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrograni reflux into a non-dilated ureter Grade I Grade II reflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation. Grade HI reflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornices Grade IV reflux into a grossly dilated ureter Grade V Gross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces : calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VUR Reflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transpo of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract. The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring. Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypeension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy. Treatment The goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux. Treatment modality is either medical or surgical. Medical therapy - is based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution. Surgical therapy : - the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury. The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on ceain principles and parental, patient preferences. Below is given a cha listing the treatment recommendation for VUR. Before going through the cha lets see the basic principles on which this cha is based ?With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time. Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades. For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whetner if it unilateral or bilateral. For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution. Grade V reflux rarely resolves. The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs. Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.",A

Controlled hyperventilation (induced hypocapnia) is frequently recommended following head trauma. The therapeutic consequences of this therapy include,Reduction of endogenous catecholamines,Reduction of intracellular potassium levels,Increase in cerebrovascular resistance,Induction of compensatory metabolic alkalosis,"Controlled hyperventilation to a PaCO2 of 25 kPa raises tissue pH, increases cerebrovascular resistance, decreases cerebral blood flow, and consequently reduces intracerebral pressure (ICP). In the effort to avoid brain swelling by lowering cerebral blood flow and ICP, the clinician must be wary of causing ischemic brain damage through hypoperfusion. The metabolic compensation to induced hypocapnia leads to normalization of the pH by loss of bicarbonate (metabolic acidosis), and over 8-24 h the beneficial effects of the hypocapnia will have been lost. The partial pressures of carbon dioxide should be allowed to slowly return to normal and should be held in reserve in case unanticipated increases in ICP require another pulse of short-term reduction. It is important to monitor the patient while the PaCO2 is rising because untoward or rapid increases in ICP may occur in response to the rising cerebral blood flow.",C

Which of the following anesthetic agents does not trigger malignant hypehermia,Halothane,Isoflurane,Suxamethonium,Thiopentone,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a rare (1:15,000 in pediatric patients and 1:40,000 in adult patients) genetic hypermetabolic muscle disease, the characteristic phenotypical signs and symptoms of which most commonly appear with exposure to inhaled general anesthetics or succinylcholine (triggering agents). MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

"If caecum is involved as a pa of the wall of hernial sac and is not its content, then it will be known as:September 2009",Richter's hernia,Spigelian hernia,Sliding hernia,Interstitial hernia,"Ans. C: Sliding herniaIndirect inguinal herniaAn indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine.The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle.Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.Direct herniaA direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle.The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon.Femoral herniaThe femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament.Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated.Umbilical herniaThe umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years.Richter herniaThe Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel.As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting.The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional herniaThis iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%.Spigelian herniaThis rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle).Obturator herniaThis hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter.Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contentsSliding herniaAs a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.",C

Presenting symptoms are :

- rapidly enlarging mass (similar to anaplastic ca but is often painless.)
- acute respiratory distress
- hoarseness
- dysphagia
- fever

Diagnosis is usually suggested by FNA biopsy, although core needle or open biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.

Fulminant hepatic failure can be caused by,Halothane,Isoflurane,Nitrous oxide,Phenobarbitone,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

The hole in the proximal (segment nearer to screw insertion and screw head) has the gliding hole that does not ehgage the screw threads. The screw glides through that hole. The distal segment (segment away from the screw head) has the threaded hole that engages the screw threads and as the ascrew is tightened, the threads pull the distal segment towards the proximal segment, hence creating compression.

By definition, these lesions are dysplastic. The risk of malignant degeneration is related to both the size and type of polyp. Tubular adenomas are associated with malignancy in only 5% of cases, whereas villous adenomas may harbor cancer in up to 40%. Tubulovillous adenomas are at intermediate risk (22%). Invasive carcinomas are rare in polyps smaller than 1 cm; the incidence increases with size. The risk of carcinoma in a polyp larger than 2 cm is 35 to 50%.

These restrictions are fuher reduced in infants, as keeping hydrated reduces discomfo and is known to improve post- operative outcomes. If the surgery is delayed, oral intake of clear fluids should be allowed until 2 hours before surgery or intravenous fluids should be staed, especially in vulnerable groups of patients, e.g. children, the elderly and diabetics.

Which of the following fluorinated anaesthetics corrodes metal in vaporizers and breathing systems?,Sevoflurane,Enflurane,Isoflurane,Halothane,"D i.e. Halothane Halothane (2- bromo - 2- chloro - 1, 1, 1 trifluoroethane) is a potent, non inflammable, non toxic (relatively), colourless liquid with relatively non pungent (pleasant) vapour. It is decomposed by light and stabilised by 0.01% thymolQ, but is stable when stored in amber coloured bottles. Although it is decomposed by soda lime, it may be used safely with this mixture. The vapour is absorbed by rubberQ (rubber/gas paition cofficient is 120). It corrodes metals in vaporizers and breathing systemsQ. In the presence of moisture, it corrodes aluminium, tin, lead, magnesium and alloysQ. It should be stored in a closed container away from light and heat.

Most Imp. technical consideration at the time of doing below knee amputation is -,Post. flap should be longer than the anterior flap,Stump should be long,Stump should be sho,Ant flap should be longer than post flap,"Ans. is 'a' ie. Post flap should be longer than the anterior flop Posterior flap should be longer than the anterior flap as the posterior skin has a good blood supply (and anterior skin has poor due to lack of muscle on anterior aspect). A good blood supply helps in easy healing of stump. - Equally sho anterior and posterior flaps are used only when the long post flap technique is not feasible because of previous wounds or extensive tissue ischemia. 'The longer (the stump) the better', is the general rule for amputation at all sites, but below knee amputation is an exception. The amputation level is kept proximal to the lower third of tibia, since the preponderance of tendinous structures in the lower third predispose to poor circulation and an unstable painful lump. The best level below the knee as, for, as prosthetic fitting is concerned is at the distal musculotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Some other imp. points about BK amputation The fibula is transected slightly above the tibial level. No essential differences in healing rate is noted in pts. with or without popliteal pulses, but the absence of a femoral pulse is associated with a high failure rate for BK amputation. The nerves are pulled gently down, transected and then allowed to retract, and the vessels are ligated above the level of the end of tibia.",A

Most common site of pseudoaneurysm in I.V. drug abusers is:,Carotid,Brachial,Femoral,Radial,"In the IDU, frequent direct trauma to peripheral vessels produces damage to the vessel wall and an initial sterile perivascular hematoma. Injection of chemical agents in illicit drugs also causes tissue necrosis. The vascular wall usually becomes infected by contiguous spread from adjacent subcutaneous abscesses or areas of cellulitis. The infection causes liquefaction of the central poion of the hematoma in communication with the aerial or, less commonly, the venous wall, forming a secondary (false) pseudoaneurysm. The common femoral aery is the most frequent location, followed by the deep femoral and superficial femoral aeries. Because most IDUs are right handed, left-sided groin infections and aneurysms are more common. Primary mycotic aneurysms in which the damaged vessel wall is infected secondary to unrelated bacteremia are rare and are more likely to involve cerebral vessels as a complication of endocarditis.

Not true regarding sub dural haematoma,Occurs on both sides,X-Ray not visible,Surgery can be done,Unilateral surgery,"Acute subdural haematoma Acute subdural haematoma encountered in two broadly distinct contexts. Firstly, high-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of coical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration anddeveloping signs of raised ICP, reminiscent of extradural haematoma without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. In a second group of patients, older and often anticoagulated, a lower-energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic sub- dural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. This latter group may present much later with a fuher 'acute-on- chronic' subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significant associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively, at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7-10 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holesSince the dura is not adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface giving a diffuse concave appearance.

In which of the following respects do a seminoma involving the testis and a germinoma involving the ovary differ most significantly?,Most common age of presentation,Number of mitoses,Potential to contain foci of more aggressive tumours,Radiosensitivity,"Seminomas and dysgerminomas are very similar tumors but differ in two significant respects: the most common age of presentation in men is in the fouh decade, while in women, it is in the third decade. Also, seminomas are relatively common in men (30% of testicular germ cell tumors), while dysgerminomas are rare in women (1% of ovarian tumors). Both of these tumors are composed of sheets of uniform polyhedral cells with intervening fibrous septa of connective tissue, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. The number of mitoses per high-power field and ultrastructural appearance do not differ greatly between the two tumors. These tumors in pure form are very radiosensitive (90% 5-year survival), but can be much more aggressive if foci of other germ cell tumors (notably embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, and yolk sac tumors) are present.

Sudden withdrawal of steroids may lead to adrenal insufficiency, paicularly during period of stress such as surgery. The management of patients taking glucocoicoids preoperatively: In general, the duration of use and dosing of glucocoicoids determines appropriate management: Patients who have taken glucocoicoids for less than three weeks, or who have taken chronic alternate day therapy, are unlikely to have a suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and should continue usual doses of glucocoicoids perioperatively. Patients taking prednisone at a dose greater than 20 mg/day for three weeks or more, and patients with a Cushingoid appearance should be assumed to have HPA axis suppression and may need an increased dose of coicosteroids perioperatively.

Warts are epidermal growths associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection.
Histologically they are characterized by

- hyperkeratosis (hypertrophy of the horny layer)
- acanthosis (hypertrophy of the spinous layer)
- papillomatosis
-  Koilocytes (large keratinocytes with eccenteric nuclei) are seen
Different morphologic types of warts occur on different parts of body.

Verruca vulgaris (or common wart) - fingers and toes
Verruca plantaris (plantar warts) - soles & palms
Verruca plana (flat warts) - face, legs & hands
Condylomata acuminata (veneral warts) - moist areas around the vulva, arms & scrotum

Treatment-
 - warts can be removed by a number of chemicals, including formalin, podophyllum etc.
- surgical excision or curettage with electrodessication can also be used.
- treatment of extensive areas of skin requires surgical excision under general anaesthesia.

Recurrences are common

Investigation of choice for esophageal rupture is?,Dynamic MRI,Rigid esophagoscopy,Barium contrast swallow,Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow,"ANSWER: (D) Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallowREF: with textUse of non ionic water soluble contrast medium instead of barium is warranted when there is any risk of aspiration or esophageal leak. (Ref: Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites By Giles W. Boland 4th ed page 2)Careful endoscopic assessment at the end of any procedure combined with a chest X-ray will identify many cases of perforation immediately. If not recognised immediately, then early and late suspected perforations should be assessed by a water-soluble contrast swallow. If this is negative, a dilute barium swallow should be considered. A CT scan can be used to replace a contrast swallow or as an adjunct to accurately delineate specific fluid collections. (Bailey 25th ed page 1015)Diagnosis of an esophageal perforation may be made radiographically. A chest roentgenogram may demonstrate a hydropneumothorax. A contrast esophagram is done using barium for a suspected thoracic perforation and Gastrografin for an abdominal perforation. Barium is inert in the chest but causes peritonitis in the abdomen, whereas aspirated Gastrografin can cause life-threatening pneumonitis. A surgical endoscopy needs to be performed if the esophagram is negative or if operative intervention is planned. (Ref: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 41)",D
"A 25-year-old female presents with episodes of bizarre behavior, memory lapse, and unconsciousness. She also demonstrated previously episodes of extreme hunger, sweating, and tachycardia. During one of these episodes, her blood sugar was tested and was found to be 40 mg/dL. Which of the following would most appropriately indicate a diagnosis of insulinoma?",Demonstration of insulin antibodies in blood,Abnormal glucagon level,CT of the pancreas showing a mass,Hypoglycemia during a symptomatic episode with relief of symptoms by intravenous glucose,The characteristic features of insulinomas include: (a) hypoglycemic symptoms; (b) blood glucose <50 mg/dL during the symptomatic episodes; and (c) relief of symptoms by intravenous injection of glucose (Whipple's triad). Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of fasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately elevated levels of insulin in the blood. A ratio of plasma insulin/glucose >0.3 is diagnostic. Circulating levels of C-peptide are usually elevated in patients with insulinoma but not in patients with such other causes of hypoglycemia as tumors of mesenchymal origin and liver tumors.

True about acute pancreatitis -,Alcohol is the MC cause,20-25% needs surgical treatment,CECT is preferred over USG in diagnosis,Serum Amylase is diagnostic,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. CECT is preferred over USG in diagnosis Gall stones are the most common cause, alcohol being IInd most common. Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning - There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe form of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self limited in -85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days.

Acalculous cholecystitis is caused by -,Diabetes mellitus,Total parenteral nutrition,Tuberculosis,All,"Ans. (a) Diabetes mellitus (b) Total parenteral nutrition (c) Tuberculosis * In acalculous cholecystitis, there is acute inflammation of gallbladder without gallstones.* In over 50% of cases of acalculous cholecystitis an underlying explanation is not found.* Acalculous cholecystitis typically develop in critically ill patients in the ICU. Patients on parenteral hyperalimentation with extensive burns, sepsis, major operations, multiple trauma or prolonged illness with multiple organ system failure are at risk for developing acalculous cholecystitis.* Harrison writes* ""An increased risk for the development of acalculous cholecystitis is especially associated with serious trauma or burns, with the postpaum period following prolonged labor, and with ohopedic and other nonbiliary major surgical operations in the post operative period. It may possibly complicate periods of prolonged parenteral hyperalimentation. For some of these cases, biliary sludge in the cystic duct may be responsible. Other precipitating factors include- vasculitis- obstructing adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder- diabetes mellitus- torsion of the gall bladder- unusual bacterial infections of the gall bladder (eg. Leptospira, Streptococcus, Salmonella, or Vibrio cholera), andparasitic infestation of gallbladder.* Acalculous cholecystitis may also be seen with a variety of other systemic disease processes- sarcoidosis - syphilis- cardiovascular disease - actinomycosis- tuberculosis* Clinical manifestation- is indistinguishable from those of calculuos cholecystitis, however, the setting of cholecystitis in severe underlying illness is characteristic of acalculous cholecystitis.* U/S & CT examinations show a large, tense, static gallbladder without stones and with evidence of poor emptying over a prolonged period. Ultrasonography is usually the diagnostic test of choice, as it can be done bedside in the intensive care unit.* ManagementThe complication rate of acalculous cholecystitis is more than calculous cholecystitis.- Acalculous cholecystitis requires urgent intervention.- Percutaneous ultrasound or CT guided cholecystostomy is the treatment of choice for these patients, as they are unfit for surgery.- If the diagnosis is unceain, percutaneous cholecystostomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. About 90% of patients will improve with the percutaneous cholecystostomy. However, if they do not improve, other steps, such as open cholecystostomy or cholecystectomy, may be required.If needed cholecystectomy can be done after the patient has recovered from the underlying disease.",D

"While doing spinal anesthesia, the drug get deposited between:",Pia and arachnoid,Dura and arachnoid,Dura and veebrae,Into the spinal cord,"In spinal anaesthesia, local anaesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space, between pia and arachnoid, blocks conduction of impulses along all nerves with which it comes in contact. Regardless of the anaesthetic agent used, the desired effect is to block the transmission of afferent nerve signals from peripheral nociceptors. Sensory signals from the site are blocked, thereby eliminating pain. The spinal cord usually ends at the level of L2 in adults and L3 in children. Dural puncture above these levels is associated with a slight risk of damaging the spinal cord and is best avoided.",A

Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?",Administration of hypeonic saline solution,Restriction of free water,Plasma ultrafiltration,Hemodialysis,"The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq/L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).",B

"Following traumatic peripheral nerve transection, regrowth usually occurs at which of the following rates?",0.1 mm per day,1 mm per day,5 mm per day,1 cm per day,"Transection of a peripheral nerve results in hemorrhage and in retraction of the severed nerve ends. Almost immediately, degeneration of the axon distal to the injury begins. Degeneration also occurs in the proximal fragment back to the fist node of Ranvier. Phagocytosis of the degenerated axonal fragments leaves a neurilemmal sheath with empty cylindrical spaces where the axons were. Several days following the injury, axons from the proximal fragment begin to regrow. If they make contact with the distal neurilemmal sheath, regrowth occurs at about the rate of 1 mm per day. However, if associated trauma, fracture, infection, or separation of neurilemmal sheath ends precludes contact between axons, growth is haphazard and a traumatic neuroma is formed. When neural transection is associated with widespread soft tissue damage and hemorrhage (with increased probability of infection), many surgeons choose to delay re-approximation of the severed nerve end for 3-4 week.",B
TRUE/FALSE statements about Ischemic rest pain: 1. More at night 2. Usually confined to forefoot 3. Increases upon elevation of limb 4. Relieved by dependent position 5. Often associated with trophic changes,"1,3,5 true & 2,4 false","2,3,4 true & 1,5 false","1,2,3,4 true & 5 false",All statements are true,"Ischemic Rest Pain: Ischemic rest pain is a grave symptom caused by ischemic neuritis- indicates advanced aerial insufficiency that usually terminates in gangrene and amputation of the extremity if aerial reconstruction cannot be performed. In ischemic rest pain there is severe burning pain usually confined to the forefoot distal to the metatarsals. It may be localized to the vicinity of an ischemic ulcer or pre gangrenous toe. It is aggravated by the elevation of the extremity or by bringing the leg to the horizontal position. Thus, it appear at bed rest (hence the name) and may prevent sleep. Because gravity aids the delivery of aerial blood, classically, the patient with rest pain can obtain relief by simply hanging the leg over the side of the bed. This simple maneuver will not relieve the pain caused by peripheral neuropathy, the most common cause of foot pain at rest. If the foot is constantly kept dependant to relieve pain, the leg and foot may be swollen, causing some confusion in diagnosis. Ischemic neuritis pain is severe and resistant to opioid for relief. Rest pain occur when blood flow is inadequate to meet metabolic requirements. In the lower extremity, ischemic rest pain is localized to the forefoot and generally is easily distinguished from benign nocturnal muscle cramps in the calf, which are also common in old patients.

Choledochotomy,"1,2,3 true & 4,5 false","1,2,3,4 true & 5 false","1,2,3,5 true & 4 false",All are true,"Hepaticojejunostomy is not indicated in management of CBD stone. Management of CBD stone Endoscopic papillotomy is the preferred first technique with sphincterotomy, removal of the stones during a dormia basket or the placement of stent if the stone removal is not possible. Endoscopic cholangiography: the use of endoscopic cholangiography in patients with suspected common bile duct stone not only confirms the diagnosis but also provides ductal clearance of the stone and sphincterotomy before subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients with worsening cholangitis, ampullary stone compaction, biliary pancreatitis, multiple comorbidities, and cirrhosis are considered good candidate for preoperative endoscopic therapy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone extraction is well tolerated in most patients, with 5%to 8% complication rate. Complete clearance of all common duct stones is achieved endoscopically in 71% to 75% of patients at the first procedure and in 84% to 95% of patients after multiple endoscopic procedures. Laparoscopic common bile duct exploration through the cystic duct or with formal choledochotomy allows the stones to pass during the procedure. An open common bile duct exploration should be performed if endoscopic intervention is not available or not feasible because of anatomical restrictions or expeise. If choledochtomy is performed, a T tube is left in place. The purpose of the T tube is to provide access to the biliary system for postoperative radiologic stone extraction. With the increased use of endoscopic, percutaneous, and laparoscopic techniques, open bile common duct exploration is rarely performed today. Stone impacted in the ampulla may be difficult for both endoscopic ductal clearance and common bile duct exploration. In these cases, transduodenal sphincteroplasty and stone extraction should be performed; alternatively, if this is not successful, a choledochoduodenostomy or a Roux-en Y choledojejunostomy should be performed. The widespread use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ERCP has decreased the incidence of complicated biliary tract disease and need for choledocholithotomy and T tube drainage of the bile ducts. EBS followed by spontaneous passage or stone extraction is the treatment of choice in the management of patients with common duct stones, especially in elderly or poor risk patients.

D: Valgus Stress Test Tests to Detect Ligament Injury Lachman Test - The Lachman test is the best test to diagnose an ACL tear. - With the patient lying flat and relaxed, the examiner bend the knee slightly, about 20 degrees. The examiner then stabilizes the thigh while pulling the shin forward. - Both the amount of translation (shifting) as well as the feel of the endpoint offer information about the ACL. Anterior Drawer Test - The anterior drawer test is also performed with the patient lying flat. The knee is bent 90 degrees and the shin is pulled forward to check the stability of the ACL. - An intact ACL will only allow the shin to come forward slightly. - A torn ACL will allow the shin to move fuher forward. Pivot Shift Test - The pivot shift test is a difficult maneuver to perform on a patient who is not under anesthesia. This test places a stress on the knee joint that forces a subluxation (paial dislocation) in patients who do not have an ACL. - This test recreates the type of instability that caused the ACL injury. Posterior Drawer Test - The posterior drawer is performed similarly to the anterior drawer test. - This test detects injury to the PCL. - By pushing the shin backward, the integrity of the PCL is tested. - Excessive movement of the shin backwards is a sign of PCL injury. Varus and Valgus Instability - Varus and valgus instability tests check the LCL (lateral collateral ligament) and MCL (medial collateral ligament), respectively. - With the patient lying flat, and the knee held at about 30 degrees of flexion, gentle adduction and abduction force is applied. - Insufficiency of the LCL or MCL will allow the knee to ""open up"" excessively. - The test is repeated with the leg straight. If the knee still opens up excessively, then more than just the LCL or MCL was torn.",D

During the interdigestive period, the GI tract undergoes regular increases in peristaltic contractile activity at about every 90 mm that are termed migrating motor complexes. Originally recorded from the small intestine, they begin in the smooth muscle of the esophagus or the stomach. They are commonly associated with periodic increases in the hormone motilin. Although it is still unclear, they appear to serve a ""house keeping function"" by clearing the GI tract of luminal contents. They are immediately interrupted when a meal is ingested.",B

what % of testicular carcinoma is associated with crytorchidism?,10%,30%,70%,90%,"Testicular Tumours: Epidemiology and Risk Factors Of all primary testicular tumours, 90-95% are germ cell tumours (seminoma and nonseminoma) More common in whites and individuals of higher socioeconomic class Slightly more common on the right side than on the left, which parallels the increased incidence of cryptorchidism on the right side. Of primary testicular tumours, 1-2% are bilateral, and about 50% of these tumours occur in men with a history of unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism Seminoma is the most common germ cell tumour in bilateral primary testicular tumours, while malignant lymphoma is the most common bilateral tumour of the testis The strongest association has been with the cryptorchid testis. Approximately 7-10% of testicular tumours develop in patients who have a history of cryptorchidism; seminoma is the most common form of tumor these patients have. However, 5-10% of the testicular tumors occur in the contralateral, normally descended testis. The relative risk of malignancy is highest for the intraabdominal testis (1 in 20) and is significantly lower for the inguinal testis (1 in 80) Orchipexy doesnot alter the malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis; however, it does facilitate examination and tumor detection Ref: Smith 18th edition Pgno: 380",A

Local action on gamma opiate receptors ensures pain relief and consequent improvement in respiration without vasodilation or paralysis. The less lipid-soluble opiates are effective for long periods. Their slow absorption into the circulation also ensures a low incidence of centrally mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression or generalized itching. When these do occur, the intravenous injection of an opiate antagonist is an effective antidote. The locally mediated analgesia is not affected. One poorly understood side effect, which is apparently unrelated to systemic levels, is a profound reduction in gastric activity. This may be an important consideration after thoracic surgery when an early resumption of oral intake is anticipated.",D

Pulse oximeter is used for monitoring,Oxygen content of the blood,Oxygen saturation,Partial pressure of oxygen,All of the above,"Ans. b (Oxygen saturation). (Ref. Anaesthesia by Ajay yadav, 2nd ed., 47)PULSE OXIMETER# Pulse oximeters give non-invasive estimation of the arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation.# Useful in:- anaesthesia,- recovery,- intensive care (including neonatal),- patient transport.# 2 principles involved:- Differential light absorption by haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin.- Identification of pulsatile component of signal.# No direct indication of a patient's ventilation, only of their oxygenation.# Lag monitor Time delay between potentially hypoxic event such as respiratory obstruction and a pulse oximeter detecting low oxygen saturation.# Inaccuracies: ambient light; shivering and vasoconstriction; abnormal haemoglobins; and alterations in pulse rate and rhythm.# Advances in microprocessor have led to improved signal processing.Uses of pulse oximetry1. Simple, portable ""all-in-one"" monitor of oxygenation, pulse rate and rhythm regularity, suitable for ""field"" use.2. As a safe, non-invasive monitor of the cardio-respiratory status of high-dependency patients - in the emergency department, during general and regional anaesthesia, postoperatively and in intensive care. This includes procedures such as endoscopy, where often frail patients are given sedative drugs such as midazolam. Pulse oximeters detect the presence of cyanosis more reliably than even the best doctors when using their clinical judgement.3. During the transport of patients - especially when this is noisy - for example in aircraft, helicopters or ambulances. The audible tone and alarms may not be heard, but if a waveform can be seen together with an acceptable oxygen saturation, this gives a global indication of a patient's cardio-respiratory status.4. To assess the viability of limbs after plastic and orthopaedic surgery and, for example, following vascular grafting, or where there is soft tissue swelling or aortic dissection. As a pulse oximeter requires a pulsatile signal under the sensor, it can detect whether a limb is getting a blood supply.5. As a means of reducing the frequency of blood gas analysis in intensive care patients- especially in paediatric practice where vascular (arterial) access may be more difficult.6. To limit oxygen toxicity in premature neonates' supplemental oxygen can be tapered to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90% Thus avoiding the damage to the lungs and retinas of neonates. Although pulse oximeters are calibrated for adult haemoglobin, HbA, the absorption spectra of HbA and HbF are almost identical over the range used in pulse oximetry, so the technique remains reliable in neonates.7. During thoracic anaesthesia - when one lung is being collapsed down To determine whether oxygenation via the remaining lung is adequate or whether increased concentrations of oxygen must be given.8. Fetal oximetry- a developing technique that uses reflectance oximetry, using LEDs of 735nm and 900nm. The probe is placed over the temple or cheek of the fetus, and needs to be sterile and sterilisable. They are difficult to secure and the readings are variable, for physiological and technical reasons. Hence the trend is more useful than the absolute value.",B
A pregnant woman in her 32nd week of gestation is given magnesium sulfate for pre-eclampsia. The earliest clinical indication of hypermagnesemia is,Loss of deep tendon reflexes,Flaccid paralysis,Respiratory arrest,Hypotension,"States of magnesium excess are characterized by generalized neuromuscular depression. Clinically, severe hypermagnesemia is rarely seen except in those patients with advanced renal failure treated with magnesium-containing antacids. Hypermagnesemia is produced intentionally, however, by obstetricians who use parenteral magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ) to treat preeclampsia. MgSO4 is administered until depression of the deep tendon reflexes is observed, a deficit that occurs with modest hypermagnesemia (over 4 mEq/L). Greater elevations of magnesium produce progressive weakness, which culminates in flaccid quadriplegia and in some cases respiratory arrest from paralysis of the chest bellows mechanism. Hypotension may occur because of the direct arteriolar relaxing effect of magnesium. Changes in mental status occur in the late stages of the syndrome and are characterized by somnolence that progresses to coma.",A

Retroperitoneal fibrosis most commonly presents with,Pedal edema,Ascites,Ureteric obstruction,Back pain,"The most impoant clinical aspect of retroperitoneal fibrosis is that the fibrotic process frequently entraps and constricts the ureters thereby causing obstructive uropathy. Retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is a nonspecific, nonsuppurative inflammation of fibro-adipose tissue of unknown cause that produces symptoms by the gradual compression of tubular structures in retroperitoneal space. Aetiology of retroperitoneal fibrosis - About 2/3rd cases are primary idiopathic, are also known as Ormond's disease Secondary Retroperitoneal fibrosis a variety of inflammatory conditions - chronic pancreatitis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or actinomycosis. drugs methysergide (most imp.) b blockers hydralazine a methyldopa Etacapone (used in the t/t of Parkinson's ds.) - malignancies (prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sarcoma, characinoid & gastric cancer). antoimmune disorders (ankylosing spondylitis, SLE PAN etc.) Symptoms of retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is more common in men between 40-60 yrs of age Early symptoms are nonspecific and vague. These are Pain - Dull noncolicky and insidious in onset. Anorexia, nausea General malaise, diarrhea Later on, symptoms result from compression of tubular retroperitoneal structures. The major structure involved are- Ureter - Most commonly involved Aoa Inferior venacava Symptoms due to the involvement of ureter (usually b/1 involvement) Dysuria Frequency of urination Chills and fever occur with secondary infection of a hydronephrotic kidney. Hematuria can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis usually can be made accurately by intravenous pyelography if uremia is not present. The characteristic finding on pyelogram are Hydronephrosis with a dilated touous upper ureter. Medial detion of the ureter Extrinsic ureteral compression Note: In a retroperitoneal tumor, ureter is laterally deted while in retroperitoneal fibrosis ureter medially detes. Currently, the imaging procedure of choice is the CT scan. But if renal function is compromised contrast agents are not given and then MRI is the procedure of choice. T/T of Retroperitoneal fibrosis Coicosteroids, with or without surgery, are the mainstay of medical therapy. Surgical treatment is required in patients who present with moderate or massive hydronephrosis. It consists primarily of ureterolysis (freeing the ureter from adhesions and surrounding tissue) or ureteral stenting.. Also, know Paial or complete ureteral obstruction occurs in 75 to 85% of patients. Most common site of urethral obstruction is lower third of the ureter. Ref : Love & Bailey 25/e p1007",D

Hypeonic saline should be left within the cavity for 15-20 minutes to have effective scolicidal effect. * Detection of cystobiliary communications is very crucial as it may cause caustic sclerosing cholangitis when scolicidal agent like formalin is used. Communicating openings may be single or multiple. Cyst more than 10 cm is likely to have cysto-biliary communications. * Laparoscopic pericystectomy is becoming more popular. Contraindications are a deeply situated cyst, densely adherent cyst, and inaccessible cysts; more than 3 cysts; calcified cysts and cysts in other organs.

Diarrhoea occurs 5. Total thyroidectomy is performed,"1,2,3 true and 4,5 false","1,2,4 true and 3,5 false","4,5 true and 1,2,3 false",All are true,"MCT accounts for 5-10% of thyroid cancers, 80% of tumours are sporadic, and 25% occur as a pa of an autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome ( MEN 2A or 2B). Sporadic MTC often presents in the fifth decade as a unilateral solitary nodule. Patients with familial MTC more commonly present in the fouh decade with multifocal nodules in the upper poles or both thyroid lobes, where there is the greatest concentration of the cells. The malignancies involves the parafollicular cells, or C cells, derived from the neural crests. MCT is associated with the secretion of a biologic marker, calcitonin. Excess secretion of calcitonin has been demonstrated to be an effective marker for the presence of MCT. Calcitonin excess is not associated with hypocalcemia. Histologically, MCT is an ill-defined, nonencapsulated, invasive mass composed of spindle shaped or rounded cells separated by fibrous septa and amyloid deposits. Positive immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and amyloid aids in the diagnosis of MTC. A patients with a sporadic medullary carcinoma may have either of two manifestations: a palpable mass for which a diagnosis can be made with FNAC or the finding of an elevated calcitonin level. family members of patient with MEN-2 ideally screened for RET proto-oncogenes. The surgical approach to sporadic medullary medullary carcinoma involves at least total thyroidectomy with or without central lymph node dissection. Total thyroidectomy allows complete removal removal of the gland and a search for multicentricity. In sporadic MTC, the lesion is generally contained within one lobe, whereas in MEN 2, the malignancy involves the upper halves of both lobes. Age > 50 years at diagnosis, metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and association with MEN 2B are associated with poor prognosis. 70% of the patients with MEN 2B have metastasis at the time of diagnosis of medullary carcinoma thyroid out of which approximately less than 50% survive up to 5 years.

What should be the next management ?,Serial Ca 125 measurement and follow up,Hysterectomy and bilaterals alpingoophorectomy,Unilateral salpingoophorectomy,Radiotherapy,"Unilateral salpingoophorectomy Cystadenocarcinoma is an epithelial ovarian carcinoma. All patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma require surgery i.e., B/L salpingophorectomy with hysterectomy. But the patient in question is quite young and nulliparous. She needs feility sparing surgery. There have'nt been enough successful trials on feility sparing surgery in ovarian carcinoma. Currently two surgical options are available in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who desires to retain the feility. - Simple unilateral salpingoophorectomy - Staging procedure (unilateral salpingoophorectomy, bilateral pelvic and paraaoic lymphoadenectomy and multiple biopsies). Simple unilateral salpingoophorectomy is done in patients with early stage disease whereas staging procedure is done in patients with advanced disease. Stage of the cancer is not mentioned in the question. But, staging procedure is not mentioned as an option. Thus, the answer is obvious i.e., unilateral salpingoophorectomy. Management of epithelial ovarian tumour. The initial management of patient with epithelial ovarian tumour is surgery. Surgery is almost always performed in women suspected of epithelial ovarian cancer. The procedure is necessary to : ? Obtain tissue at diagnosis Assess the extent of the disease Attempt optimal cytoreduction which is crucial for successful treatment. Treatment in patients with Early stage disease Patients with stage I or II disease (Tumour confined to the ovary and pelvis). These patients require ? B/L salpingoophorectomy with hysterectomy.

Which one of the following can provide 100 % oxygen?,Ventimask,Simple oxygen mask,Oxygen catheter,Anesthetic face mask,"Anaesthesia face mask FEATURES These facemasks have a cuff that allows for a complete seal to be achieved between the mask and the patient's face. Anesthetic facemasks can therefore be used to deliver non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In order to ventilate with an anesthetic facemask you'll need a pressurized gas source (anesthesia gas supplies)such as a cylinder or gas wall supply. If no pressurized gas source is available, a self-inflating bag will allow for positive pressure-ventilation through an anesthetic facemask. The cuff volume can typically be adjusted through a valve. A somewhat under-inflated cuff usually achieves a better seal than a fully inflated one. Most manufacturers supply these masks with a detachable hook ring, which allows for the mask to be held in place with a head strap for delivering NIV. USES Anaesthetic facemasks are generally used in two different settings/ scenarios: 1. For bag-mask ventilation (BMV) in the OR or resuscitation setting. 2. To provide non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or respiratory suppo, most commonly as either continuous or biphasisc positive airway pressure (CPAP or BIPAP) in patients with respiratory compromise.",D

Sweating, wasting and anorexia are present.> There is sometimes epigastric fullness and pain, or pain in the shoulder on the affected side, owing to irritation of sensory fibres in the phrenic nerve, referred along the descending branches of the cervical plexus.> Persistent hiccup may be a presenting symptom.# Signs> A swinging pyrexia is usually present, unless antibiotics or drugs (steroids) have interfered. If the abscess is anterior, abdominal examination will reveal some tenderness, rigidity or even a palpable swelling.> Sometimes the liver is displaced downwards, but more often it is fixed by adhesions. Examination of the chest is important, and in the majority of cases collapse of the lung or evidence of basal effusion or empyema is to be found.# Investigations> Blood count usually shows a leucocytosis.> A plain radiograph demonstrates the presence of gas or a pleural effusion. On screening, the diaphragm is often seen to be elevated (so-called 'tented' diaphragm) and its movements impaired.> Ultrasound or CT scanning is the investigation of choice and permits early detection of subphrenic collections.> Radiolabelled white cell scanning may occasionally prove helpful when other imaging techniques have failed.",B
Stage of surgical anesthesia during ether administration is,Loss of Consciousness,failure of circulation,Regular respiration to cessation of breathing,Loss of Consciousness to beginning of regular respiration,Guedel's classification is a means of assessing of depth of general anesthesia introduced by Ahur Ernest Guedel for Ether in1937.

The following is true of Mendelson's syndrome,Critical Volume of aspirate is 50 ml,Critical pH of gastric aspirate is 1.5,Onset of symptoms generally occurs within 2 hours,Opioids have been shown to improve outcome,"In Mendelson's syndrome, the critical pH is 2.5 and the critical volume is 25ml (0.3ml/kg body wt). Opioids will decrease the tone of LES and increase the risk rather than decrease. In 1946, Mendelson was the first to describe aspiration pneumonitis attributable to the pulmonary aspiration of acidic gastric secretions in pregnant women undergoing anesthesia. This potentially fatal complication, occasionally referred to as Mendelson syndrome, has since been the intense focus of preventive effos among the anesthesia community. Prevention of aspiration of gastric contents is primarily accomplished by adherence to established preoperative fasting guidelines, premedication with drugs that may decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, and specialized induction techniques. Traditionally, patients who were scheduled for elective procedures requiring sedation, regional anesthesia, or general anesthesia were instructed to remain NPO (Latin for nulla per os or nothing by mouth) after midnight to ensure an empty stomach to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Based on evidence that allowing ingestion of clear liquids 2 to 4 hours before surgery resulted in lower gastric volumes and higher gastric pH, the ASA published Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration in 1999 that liberalized the traditional NPO policy and allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before beginning elective procedures requiring anesthesia. The guidelines, updated in 2011, recommend 4 hours of fasting from breast milk 6 hours of fasting from solid foods, infant formula, and nonhuman milk. Fried or fatty foods may require longer fasting times (e.g., 8 hours or more). Although the ASA guidelines do not specifically address chewing gum, hard candies, or smoking, guidelines published by the European Society of Anaesthesiology on the topic do not recommend delaying the sta of anesthesia if a patient has consumed any of these immediately before the induction of anesthesia. The routine use of drugs as prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis is not recommended by the ASA guidelines but may be beneficial in patients with specific risk factors for aspiration, such as a full stomach, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, presence of a nasogastric tube, morbid obesity, diabetic gastroparesis, or pregnancy. The goal of aspiration prophylaxis is twofold: to decrease gastric volume and to increase gastric fluid pH. Commonly used agents include nonpaiculate antacids (e.g., Bicitra), promotility drugs (e.g., metoclopramide), and H2-receptor antagonists. These drugs may be used alone or in combination.

Which of the following test is used to test anterior instability of shoulder?,Push-pull test,Jerk test,Posterior drawer test,Apprehension Test (crank test),"Pull-push, jerk, and posterior drawer test are used for testing posterior instability of shoulder. Tests for anterior shoulder instability: Anterior shoulder drawer test: with the patient supine, the scapula is stabilized with one hand while the upper arm is held firmly with the other so as to manipulate the head of the humerus forward and backward (like a driver). Apprehension test: this is a provocative test in which the examiner cautiously lifts the arm into abduction, external rotation and then extension, at the crucial moment the patient senses that the humeral head is about to slip out anteriorly and his body toutens in apprehension. Relocation test: this test involves placing the shoulder in the position of apprehension and applying a posteriorly directed force on the humeral head. The result is considered positive if this relieves the patient's apprehension. Fulcrum test: with the patient supine. The clinician takes the shoulder into 90 degree abduction and adds lateral rotation and extension. The test indicate anterior instability if the patient becomes apprehensive.

Acute inflammatory process occurs and the fibrosis exudate helps to cement the cut margins of the wound together. Minimum granulation tissue is formed, which can be called organization. Regeneration of epithelium In the first 24 hours basal cells mobilise from the undersurface of the epidermis. By 48 hours the advancing epithelial edge undergoes cellular hypertrophy and mitosis. Epithelial cells gradually line the wound deep to the fibrin clot and it also lines the suture tracks. Implantation epidermoid cyst may develop from epithelial remnants. There may be formation of ugly punctate scars from sutures which are left in position for longer period.

Ultrasonography and needle biopsy are used in the diagnosis of these nodules. Open biopsy may be required. Mammography is rarely indicated because of its decreased sensitivity during pregnancy and lactation; however, the fetus can be shielded if mammography is needed. --Schwartz 9/467""Because of the changes in the breast tissue with pregnancy, imaging modalities may be difficult to interpret. If used with appropriate shielding, mammography carries a limited risk to the fetus. Mammography has a high false-negative rate due to the increased density of the fibroglandular breast tissue, however.: so it has limited usefulness in the evaluation of the pregnant patient. Ultrasonography can safely be performed as an initial evaluation or in conjunction with mammography. Ultrasound is able to distinguish solid from cystic lesions in 97% of patients and is helpful in guiding fine-needle aspiration or biopsy Although MRI does not use ionizing radiation, the two main risks to the fetus from the magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation are heating and cavitation. With other reliable imaging modalities available, MRI is not currently recommended for breast imaging in the pregnant patient.

Protein metabolism after trauma is characterized by,Decreased liver gluconeogenesis,"Inhibition of skeletal muscle breakdown by interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF, cachectin)",Decreased urinary nitrogen loss,Hepatic synthesis of acute-phase reactants,"Injury and sepsis result in accelerated protein breakdown with increased urinary nitrogen loss and increased peripheral release of amino acids. The negative nitrogen balance represents the net result of breakdown and synthesis (with breakdown increased and synthesis increased or diminished). Amino acids such as alanine are released by muscle and transported to the liver for incorporation into acute-phase proteins including fibrinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and ferritin. The amino acids also undergo gluconeogenesis to glucose, which is utilized primarily by the brain and other glycolytic tissues such as peripheral nerves, erythrocytes, and bone marrow. Other tissues receive energy from fat in the form of fatty acids or ketone bodies during starvation following major trauma; this helps to conserve body protein. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood, and its levels in muscle and blood decrease following injury and sepsis as it is consumed rapidly by replicating fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and intestinal endothelial cells. The use of glutamine may decrease protein catabolism in the intestine and may help prevent atrophy of the gastrointestinal tract in starved and parenterally nourished patients. Along with the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol), interleukin 1 appears to mediate muscle breakdown. Recent studies have indicated that TNF (also called cachectin because of the role it plays in muscle wasting in septic or oncologic patients) also may be a principal catabolic cytokine in the traumatized patient. This protein is secreted by macrophages and further affects metabolism by inducing secretion of interleukin 1 and inhibiting synthesis and activity of lipogenic enzymes.",D

The most common cause of death in carcinoma penis?,Uremia,Urinary sepsis,Lung metastases,Erosion of femoral vessels,"Ans. d (Erosion of femoral vessels) (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1375)CARCINOMA OF PENISAetiology# Circumcision6 soon after birth confers almost complete immunity against carcinoma of the penis.# Later circumcision does not seem to have the same effect and muslims circumcised between the ages of 4 and 9 years are still liable to the disease.# Chronic balanoposthitis in known to be a contributory factor.6# Definite precarcinomatous states:- Leucoplakia of the glans is similar to the condition seen on the tongue;- Longstanding genital warts may rarely be the site of malignant change;- Paget's disease of the penis.Pathology# Carcinoma of the penis may be flat and infiltrating or papillary.# The former often starts as leucoplakia and the latter results from an existing papilloma.# The earliest lymphatic spread is to the inguinal and then to the iliac nodes.6# Once the growth breaches the partial barrier formed by the fascial sheath of the corpora cavernosa it spreads rapidly and iliac lymph node involvement is common.6# Distant metastatic deposits are infrequent.Clinical Features# Forty % of patients are under 40 years of age.# There is little or no pain.# Sixty % have inguinal lymph node enlargement when they present but in half this is reactive enlargement due to sepsis.# Later the inguinal nodes erode the skin of the groin and the death of the patient may be due to involvement of the femoral or external iliac artery with TORRENTIAL HEMORRHAGE.6Rx# Radiotherapy is effective (60-70 % survival at 5years) if the growth is small.# Surgery is needed for large anaplastic growths, if there is infiltration of the shaft and when radiotherapy fails.0# Partial amputation is used for distal growths when adequate clearance of the tumor is possible.# When an advanced, infiltrating or anaplastic lesion is present, total amputation is necessary.# Treatment of associated enlarged inguinal lymph nodes should usually be delayed until at least 3 weeks after local treatment to the primary lesion.# If surgery to the nodes is impossible, radiotherapy may cause a worthwhile temporary regression.Also know:Buschke-Lowenstein tumor is uncommon, verrucous carcinoma. It is locally destructive and invasive, but appears not to spread to lymph nodes or to metastasise. Treatment is by surgical excision.Paget's disease of the penis (syn. erythroplasia of Queyrat)0 is 'a persistent rawness of the glans like a long-standing balanitis followed by cancer of the substance of the penis' (Sir James Pager).

False localizing signs occur in two major contexts: as a consequence of raised intracranial pressure, and with spinal cord lesions. Cranial nerve palsies (especially sixth nerve palsy), hemiparesis, sensory features (such as truncal sensory levels), and muscle atrophy, May all occur as false localizing signs. Sixth nerve palsies are the most common false-localizing sign of raised intracranial pressure. In one series of 101 cases of IIH, 14 cases were noted, 11 unilateral and 3 bilateral. Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, is a disorder associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve), which is responsible for contracting the lateral rectus muscle to abduct (i.e., turn out) the eye. The inability of an eye to turn outward results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is double vision or diplopia in which the two images appear side-by-side. The condition is commonly unilateral but can also occur bilaterally.",C

Allen's test is used to detect the patency of which of the following ?,Radial aery,Ulnar aery,Both,None,"Allen's test, also Allen test, is used to test blood supply to the hand, specifically, the patency of the radial and ulnar aeries. It is performed prior to radial aerial blood sampling or cannulation. Allen's test is also performed prior to hea bypass surgery. The radial aery is occasionally used as a conduit for bypass surgery, and its patency lasts longer in comparison to the saphenous veins. Prior to hea bypass surgery, Allen's test is performed to assess the suitability of the radial aery to be used as a conduit. The modified Allen's Test *The hand is elevated and the patient/person is asked to make a fist for about 30 seconds. *Pressure is applied over the ulnar and the radial aeries so as to occlude both of them. *Still elevated, the hand is then opened. It should appear blanched (pallor can be observed at the finger nails). *Ulnar pressure is released and the color should return in 7 seconds. Inference: Ulnar aery supply to the hand is sufficient and it is safe to cannulate/prick the radial If color does not return or returns after 7-10 seconds, the test is considered positive and the ulnar aery supply to the hand is not sufficient. The radial aery therefore cannot be safely pricked/ cannulated.",C

Severity of acute pancreatitis correlate with levels of all of the following except,Glucose,Amylase,Transaminase,Calcium,"ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS It is impoant to define that group of patients who will develop severe pancreatitis, as they are the ones with poorer outcomes and therefore they require aggressive early management and possibly transfer to a specialist unit. A severe attack may be heralded by an initial clinical impression of a very ill patient and a worsening physiological state at 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems have been used, all aimed at predicting persistent organ failure, paicularly respiratory, cardiac and renal. Severity stratification assessments should be performed in patients at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after admission. The Ranson and Glasgow scoring systems are specific for acute pancreatitis, and a score of 3 or more at 48 hours indicates a severe attack. Several other systems that are used in intensive care units can also be applied. These include the APACHE, SAPS, SOFA, MODS and modified Marshall scoring systems (the latter has the advantage of simplicity). Regardless of the system used, persisting organ failure indicates a severe attack. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after the onset of symptoms is also an indicator of severity. Patients with a body mass index over 30 are at higher risk of developing complications. A revision in 2013 of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (1992) recommends that patients with acute pancreatitis be stratified into 3 groups: Mild acute pancreatitis: * no organ failure; * no local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: * organ failure that resolves within 48 hours (transient organ failure); and/or * local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure. Severe acute pancreatitis: * persistent organ failure (>48 hours); * single organ failure; * multiple organ failure. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1224",B

Cobra head appearance on excretory urography is suggestive of: March 2010,Horseshoe kidney,Duplication of renal pelvis,Simple cyst of kidney,Ureterocele,"Ans. D: UreteroceleThe term ureterocele denotes a cystic ballooning of the distal end of the ureter. This type of ureterocele is also termed ohotopic, since it arises from a ureter with a normal inseion into the trigone.An intravesical ureterocele results from the prolapse of the mucosa of the terminal segment of the ureter through the ureterovesical orifice into the bladder.This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium.Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder.On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.",D

Most common subtype of Basal cell carcinoma is: March 2005,Superficial basal cell carcinoma,Nodular basal cell carcinom,Sclerosing basal cell carcinoma,Pigmented basal cell carcinoma,"Ans. B: Nodular basal cell carcinoma Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma: Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of basal cell carcinoma and usually presents as a round, pearly, flesh-colored papule with telangiectases. As it enlarges, it frequently ulcerates centrally, leaving a raised, pearly border with telangiectases, which aids in making the diagnosis. Most tumors are observed on the face, although the trunk and extremities also are affected Cystic basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma, cystic basal cell carcinoma is often indistinguishable from nodular basal cell carcinoma clinically, although it might have a polypoid appearance Pigmented basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma that has brown-black macules in some or all areas, often making it difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Morpheaform (sclerosing) basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant in which tumor cells induce a proliferation of fibroblasts within the dermis and an increased collagen deposition (sclerosis) that clinically resembles a scar. Superficial basal cell carcinoma is often multiple, most often developing on the upper trunk or shoulders",B

Absolute contraindication of conservative breast cancer therapy is,Large pendulous breast,History of previous radiation,Axillary node involvement,Subareolar lump present,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. History of previous radiation Conservative breast cancer management: Absolute Contraindications Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. However, in many cases, it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and treat the patient with irradiation after delivery. Women with two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast or with diffuse malignant-appearing microcalcifications are not considered candidate for breast conservation treatment. A history of prior therapeutic irradiation to the breast region that would require retreatment to an excessively high total-radiation dose to a significant volume is another absolute contraindication. Persistent positive margins after reasonable surgical attempts. Relative Contraindications A history of collagen vascular disease is a relative contraindication to breast conservation treatment because published repos indicate that such patients tolerate irradiation poorly. Most radiation oncologists will not treat patients with scleroderma or active lupus erythematosus, considering it an absolute contraindication. In contrast, rheumatoid ahritisis not a relative or an absolute contraindication. The presence of multiple gross tumors in the same quadrant and indeterminate calcifications must be carefully assessed for suitability because studies in this area are not definitive. Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication to breast conservation treatment, although there is little published experience in treating patients with tumor sizes greater than four to five cm. However, a relative contraindication is the presence of a large tumor in a small breast in which an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. In this circumstance, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered. Breast size can be a relative contraindication. Large pendulous breast is a relative contraindication, as it presents difficulty in delivering a uniform radiation dose. Centrally located tumor for which removal of the nipple areola complex is required to obtain a tumor free margin is a relative contraindication. It depends on patient acceptability. The nipple and areola can now be reconstructed.",B

"A middle-aged man presents with a lower jaw swelling. Clinically, there is expansion of the left ramus and the X-ray mandible shows soap bubble appearance. What is the clinical - diagnosis?",Keratocyst,Adamantinoma,Aneurysmal bone cyst,Odontogenic myxoma,"Ameloblastoma/Adamantinoma is a rare, benign or cancerous tumor of odontogenic epithelium (ameloblasts, or outside poion, of the teeth during development) much more commonly appearing in the lower jaw than the upper jaw. Diagnosis Ameloblastoma is tentatively diagnosed through radiographic examination and must be confirmed by histological examination through biopsy. Radiographically, the tumour area appears as a rounded and well-defined lucency in the bone with varying size and features. Numerous cyst-like radiolucent areas can be seen in larger tumours (multi-locular) giving a characteristic ""soap bubble"" appearance. A single radiolucent area can be seen in smaller tumours (unilocular). The radiodensity of an ameloblastoma is about 30 Hounsfield units, which is about the same as keratocystic odontogenic tumours. However, ameloblastomas show more bone expansion and seldom show high density areas. Lingual plate expansion is helpful in diagnosing ameloblastoma as cysts rarely do this. Resorption of roots of involved teeth can be seen in some cases, but is not unique to ameloblastoma. Ref: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameloblastoma",B

Medullary carcinoma can also be diagnosed by finding an increased Serum Calcitonin* level in conjunction with thyroid mass.
Treatment -

Because medullary Ca are C-cell tumors*, they do not respond to thyroxine therapy and do not concentrate radioiodine.
They are relatively insensitive to external radiation and surgery offers the only chance for cure.
Total thyroidectomy is performed because of frequent multicentricity, recurrences have occurred when thyroid tissue is left.

Structure pierced to give caudal anaesthesia is?,Obturator foramen,Sacrococcygeal membrane,Dura mater,Lumbosacral ligament,"Caudal anesthesia is popular in pediatric anesthesia and is paicularly useful when sacral anesthetic spread is desired (e.g., perineal, anal, rectal procedures). Caudal anesthesia requires identification of the sacral hiatus. The sacrococcygeal ligament (i.e., extension of ligamentum flavum) overlies the sacral hiatus between the two sacral cornua. To facilitate locating the cornua, the posterior superior iliac spines should be located and, by using the line between them as one side of an equilateral triangle, the location of the sacral hiatus should be approximated. After the sacral hiatus is identified, the index and mid-dle fingers of the palpating hand are placed on the sacral cornua, and after local infiltration, the caudal needle (or Tuohy needle if a catheter is to be placed) is inseed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the sacrum. While the needle is advanced, a decrease in resistance to needle inseion should be appreciated as the needle enters the caudal canal.

A rickshaw is run over legs of a child making markings of tyre on the legs. Which type of injury is this?,Patterned abrasion,Imprint abrasion,Pressure bruise,Split lacerations,"Patterned abrasion. Patterning of abrasions The patterning of abrasions is clearer than that of bruises because abrasions frequently take a fairly detailed impression of the shape of the object causing them and, once inflicted, do not extend or gravitate; therefore, they indicate precisely the area of application of force. An abrasion (or a graze) is a superficial injury involving only the outer layers of the skin and not penetrating the full thickness of the epidermis. Patterned Abrasions: Patterned abrasions occur when the force is applied at or around right angle to the surface of skin. The classical example of this is seen in traffic accidents when tyre of a motor car passes over the skin leaving the pattern when the skin has been squeezed into the grooves of the rubber tread. Pressure Abrasions (Imprint Abrasions): When the impact is veical to the skin surface, the epidermis gets crushed and pressure type of abrasions result and the imprint of the impacting object may be produced. These may be seen in manual strangulation (abrasions produced by fingernails) and in hanging, where the weave of the ligature material may be reproduced.",A
Metacarpophalangeal joints are most commonly affected in: March 2005,Osteoahritis,Psoriatic ahritis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Rheumatic fever,"Ans. C: Rheumatoid Ahritis RA is characterized by diffuse cailage loss and erosion of bone and cailage. It stas in the synol membrane, with the initial processes of edema, neovascularization, and hyperplasia of the synol lining. Proliferation of synoviocytes and macrophages causes thickening of the synol lining and, together with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells, develops into pannus. Pannus is a sheet of invasive cellular tissue that is continuous with the synol lining. As a result of the higher propoion of synoviocytes and macrophages, pannus causes erosion of bone and cailage at the margin of joints. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints are most frequently involved. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved only in the presence of a coexisting MCP or PIP disease. Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons causes a reduction in finger flexion and grip strength. Nodular thickening in the tendon sheath may also produce a trigger finger. In osteoahritis and psoriatic ahritis, DIP is commonly involved.",C

Bispectral index monitoring (Ref: Morgan 4/144-146; Lee's 12/e p146, 286, 447)Use of the bispectral index (BIS), developed front a processed electroencephalogram, has been reported to decrease the incidence of anesthesia awareness when the BIS value is maintained below 60.Bispectral Index Scale (BIS)It is based on the principle of EEGQBispectral imaging analyses EEC date and quantitate anesthetic effects on the brain, specifically the hypnotic component.It is a composite numerical index, which represents a dimensionless numerical value that has been correlated with the patient's current hypnotic state or depth of anaesthesia and provides some assurance that paralyzed (anesthetized) patient is also asleep (unaware).BIS analysis may reduce chances of patient awareness during anesthesia. It may also reduce resource utilization because lesser drug is required to ensure amnesia, facilitating a faster wake up time and a shorter stay in recovery room.The BIS number decreases with increasing hypnosis.The BIS is derived from complex EEG analysis incorporating weighted information derived from the degree of burst suppression, spectral (b band) power and the bispectrum coherence.To make the EEG signals easier to interpret it uses 2 principles which are, which are, spectral analysis (power) and fast fourier analysis.It uses 3 EEG electrodes placed on frontal, parietal and temporal lobesQBIS is used to monitor: Intraoperative aw arenessQ.

Unlocking of knee is caused by?,Rectus femori,Quadricep,Hamstrings,Popliteus,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Popliteus Locking and Unlocking of knee joint Locking is a mechanism that allows the knee to remain in the position of full extension as in standing without much muscular effo. Locking occurs as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension. The anteroposterior diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is less than that of the medial condyle. As a result, when the lateral condylar aicular surface is fully 'used up' by extension, pa of the medial condylar surface remains unused. At this stage the lateral condyle rotates backwards, i.e. medial rotation of the femur occurs, so that the remaining pa of the media condylar surface is also 'taken up'. This movement locks the knee joint. Locking is aided by the oblique pull of ligaments during the last stages of extension. When the knee is locked, it is completely rigid and all ligaments of the joint are taut. Locking is produced by continued action of the same muscles that produce extension, i.e. the quadriceps femoris, especially the vastus medialis pa. The locked knee joint can be flexed only after it is unlocked by a reversal of the medial rotation, i.e. by lateral rotation of the femur. Unlocking is brought about by the action of the popliteus muscle. Physiological locking ----> Qudriceps femoris Physiological unlocking --> Popliteus",D

Phase 1 block (depolarizing)Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug.Its neuromuscular effects are like those of acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction.Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units.Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, the depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block).Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization (""reprintmg"") and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results.This so-called phase 1 (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors.2. Phase II block (desensitizing)With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized.Despite this re polarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it is desensitized.The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine' s neuromuscular blocking action.Later in phase II. the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of a nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",A
Paget's disease commonly develops in which age group ?,1st decade,3rd decade,5th decade,7th decade,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 5th decade Paget's disease (Osteitis deformans) Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (veebrae) and clavicle the next commonest. Paget's disease occurs after 40 years of age and is more common in males.",C

Strangulation most commonly occurs in: September 2005,Femoral hernia,Direct inguinal hernia,Indirect inguinal hernia,Lumbar hernia,"Ans. A: Femoral hernia Femoral hernias occur just below the inguinal ligament, when abdominal contents pass into the weak area at the posterior wall of the femoral canal. They can be hard to distinguish from the inguinal type (especially when ascending cephalad): however, they generally appear more rounded, and, in contrast to inguinal hernias, there is a strong female preponderance in femoral hernias. Although inguinal hernia may be 10 times more common than the femoral hernia, a femoral hernia is more likely to strangulate because of the narrowness of the neck and its rigid sorrounds. Repair techniques are similar for femoral and inguinal hernia.",A

This is a good screening test for detecting milder variety of club foot. Classic findings Bilateral foot deformity in 60% cases Size of the foot smaller Foot is in equinis, varus and adduction. This can be judged by the Inability to bring the foot in the opposite direction. In late cases in addition cavus of the foot may also be present Heel is small in size, the calcaneum may be felt with great difficulty Deep skin creases on the back of the heel and on the medial side of the sole Bony prominences felt on the lateral side of the foot, the head of the talus and lateral malleolus Outer side of the foot is gently convex.

A three years old boy presents with poor urinary stream. Most likely cause is -,Stricture urethra,Neurogenic bladder,Urethral calculus,Posterior urethral valve,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Posterior urethral valve Poor urinary stream in 3 years old boy suggests urinary tract obstruction (usually infravesical) and the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in a male child is posterial urethral valve. Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by (a) voiding cystourethrogram* & (b) endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First a small polyethylene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days. Then fuher management is done according to serum creatinine level. (a) with normal serum creatinine --> transurethral ablation of the valve leaflets. * (b) With increased serum creatinine and the worsening of condition --> vesicostomy to bypass the obstruction and when normal creatinine levels are achieved, transurethral ablation is done.",D

• The term is somewhat misnomer because the disease is actually an extraluminal pericolic infection caused by the extravasation of feces through the perforated diverticulum.
Complications
• Recurrent periodic inflammation and pain
• Perforation leading to general peritonitis or local (pericolic) abscess formation.
• Intestinal obstruction: In the sigmoid (as a result of progressive fibrosis causing stenosis) and in the small intestine (caused by adherent loops of small intestine on the pericolitis)
• Hemorrhage: Profuse colonic hemorrhage in 17% of cases, often requiring blood transfusions.
• Bleeding in diverticulosis may be massive but in about 80% patients are self limited and stop spontaneously. These patients do not require surgery
• Fistula formation (vesicocolic, vaginocolic, enterocolic, colocutaneous): MC is vesicocolic
Clinical Features
• Mild cases: mDistension, flatulence and a sensation of heaviness in the lower abdomen
• Emergency: Persistent lower abdominal pain, usually in the left iliac fossa, with or without peritonitis, could be caused by diverticulitis.
• Fever, malaise and leukocytosis can differentiate diverticulitis from painful diverticulosis.
• The sigmoid colon is often palpable, tender and thickened.
• Any urinary symptoms may herald the formation of a vesicocolic fistula, which leads to pneumaturia (flatus in the urine) and even feces in the urine (fecaluria)",A

The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3. If the tumor involves contiguous structures such as the prostate, the vagina, the uterus, or the pelvic sidewall, the tumor is classified as stage T4.# Tis Ca in situ# Ta Ca confined to mucosa# T1 Ca confined to submucosa# T2 Muscle invasion# T3 perivescical fat invasion# T4 invasion of adjacent structures (prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abd. wall)o Now the histological grading.# There are 3 histological gradeso Grade I, II & IIIo There is a strong correlation between tumor grading and tumor recurrence progression and survival.Treatment options for bladder cancersCancer stageInitial treatment optionsTisComplete TUR followed by intravesical BCGTa (single, low-to- moderate grade, not recurrent)Complete TURTa (large, multiple, high grade, or recurrent)Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo-or immunologyT1Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo- or immunotherapy or radical cystectomyT2-T4Radical cystectomyNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cytectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapyConcomitant chemotherapy and irradiationAny T, N+, M+Systemic chemotherapy followed by selective surgery orirradiationo Intravesical therapy : Common agents used for intravesical therapy are# Mitomycin C# Thiotepa# BCGo Among these agents, BCG is the most effective.o The patient in question has T1 stage (Tumor upto submucosa)",B

"A 45-year-old male presents with 4x4 cm, mobile right solitary thyroid nodule of 5 months duration. The patient is euthyroid. The following statements about his management are true except -",Cold nodule on thyroid scan is diagnostic of malignancy,FNAC is the investigation of choice,The patient should undergo hemithyroidectomy if FNAC report is inconclusive,Indirect laryngoscopy should be done in the preoperative period to assess mobility of vocal cords.,"On isotope scanning, a thyroid nodule can be 'hot' 'warm' or 'cold'.
Hot - a hot nodule is one that takes up isotope, while the surrounding thyroid tissue is inactive because the hot nodule is producing such high levels of thyroid hormones that TSH secretion is suppressed.
Warm nodule - a warm nodule takes up isotope and so does normal thyroid tissue around it.
Cold nodule - it takes up no isotope.

The cold nodules carry a higher risk for malignancy. But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant.
FNAC is the investigation of choice for a solitary thyroid nodule.
The finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but the false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology. Age and underlying medical condition are also taken into consideration while deciding the course of management.

"Trauma to spleen in a stable patient is best diagnosed by: September 2005, March 2008",X-ray abdomen,USG,CT scan,diagnostic peritoneal lavage,"Ans. C: CT scan Plain radiographs demonstrate a wide variety of abnormal findings. The constitution of findings reflects whether the spleen has sustained capsular rupture. Normal findings on chest and abdominal radiographs do not exclude splenic injury. USG/Focused abdominal sonar for trauma (FAST) is commonly used as the bedside investigation of choice for detection of intra-abdominal blood in abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is especially useful in the hypotensive, unstable patient with multiple injuries as a means of excluding intrabdominal bleeding. DPL has been largely replaced by FAST. It is extremely sensitive to the presence of intra-peritoneal bleeding, being able to pick up just 20m1 of blood (Sensitivity 85-98%) Relative contraindications to DPL include near term pregnancy (DPL should be carried out supra-umbilically in this situation), presence of a coagulopathy, cirrhosis, and multiple prior abdominal operations. A DPL is deemed positive if blood or bowel contents are aspirated from the abdomen. It is also determined to be positive if on analysis of the dialysate, greater than 100,000 RBC/mml or 5000 WBC/ mm3 are found. False positives on DPL may occur from abdominal wall bleeding from a traumatic catheter placement and from pelvic fractures. CT is the modality of choice for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in stable patient because it is not only sensitive, but also has a high specificity. In addition to being able to identify the presence of intra-abdominal fluid, individual organ damage can be identified. Retroperitoneal trauma may be identified and tril trauma not requiring laparotomy may be diagnosed as such.",C

"In a patient with Le-fo II, Le-fo III, & naso-ethmoid , what is the choice of intubation?",Oral,Oral & nasal,Nasal,Submental,"Submental Surgical repair of maxillofacial trauma requires modification of the standard anesthesia technique. Nasal endotracheal intubation is often contraindicated in the presence of fracture of base of he skull. Comminuted midfacial fractures cause physical obstruction to the passage of nasotracheal tube. Fuher, the presence of nasotracheal tube can interfere with surgical reconstruction of fractures of the naso- orbital ethmoid (NOE) complex. Surgical reconstruction often involves maxillo-mandibular fixation in the intra operative period to restore patient's dental occlusion. This precludes the use of oral endotracheal intubation in such cases. In these conditions tracheostomy may be indicated but it carries a significant morbidity. Submental endotracheal intubation has been described as an useful alternative totracheostomy",D
Which of the following intravenous anaesthetic agent is highly protein bound and highly lipid soluble?,Etomidate,Barbiturates,Propofol,Ketamine,"Propofol is available only for intravenous administration for the induction of general anesthesia and for moderate to deep sedation. The high lipid solubility of propofol results in a fast onset of action. Because of its reasonably sho elimination t1/2, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels. The sedative and hypnotic actions of propofol are mediated by its action on GABAA receptors; agonism at these receptors results in an increased chloride conduction and hyperpolarization of neurons. Propofol is metabolized in the liver by conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide to less active metabolites that are renally excreted. Ref: Patel P.M., Patel H.H., Roth D.M. (2011). Chapter 19.

The most common type of mode of meniscal injury is,Extension of knee,Flexion of knee,Flexion and rotation movement,Extension and rotation of movement,"C i.e. Flexion & rotation movement The twisting force (rotation) in a weight bearing flexed knee is the commonest mode of meniscal (semilunar cailage) injuryQ. Menisci follow the tibial condyles during flexion & extension, but during rotation, they follow the femur and move on the tibia; consequently the medial meniscus becomes distoed. Its anterior and posterior attachments follow the tibia, but its intervening pa follows the femur, thus it is likely to be injured during rotation. However, the lateral meniscus b/o firm attachment to popliteus muscle, ligament of Wrisberg or Humphry, follows the lateral femoral condyle during rotation and therefore is less likely to be injured. In addition popliteus muscle, by way of arcuate ligament, draws the posterior segment of lateral meniscus backward there by preventing it from being caught between the condyles of femur & plateau of tibia when tibia is rotated internally and knee is flexed(2.",C

What is the time period for perimoem cesarean section in pregnant female with cardiac arrest?,4 min,5 min,8 min,10 min,"If we are doing resuscitation of a pregnant female in cardiac arrest and no successful in return of spontaneous circulation within 4 min then we have to go for perimoem cesarean section. If attempts at maternal resuscitation fail, consider immediate cesarean section. Gestational age greater than 23 weeks is the recommended cut-off for immediate delivery. A fetus younger than 23 weeks has an extremely poor prognosis. Such instances of perimoem delivery are rare, and the chances of fetal survival are generally poor. The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest the better is the fetal survival. Delivery should be conducted in the mother's current location; transpoation to an operating room wastes valuable time. Cesarean section should be performed no later than 4 minutes after initial maternal arrest. A fetus delivered within 5 min from initiation of CPR has the best chance for survival. Deliveries occurring more than 5 min after cardiopulmonary arrest are unlikely to result in a normal ble infant. Resuscitative effos should continue during preparation for, and throughout, delivery of the fetus. Delivery of the fetus sometimes results in maternal recovery due to release of vena caval compression and improved cardiac return.",A

"Regarding testicular torsion, which of the following is FALSE?",Undescended testicle is a risk factor.,Decreased blood flow relative to contralateral testicle demonstrable by ultrasound.,Testicular salvage decreases to <5% if surgery is delayed >6 hours.,Surgical exploration should include fixation of the contralateral testicle.,"Risk Factors for torsion include : undescended testis testicular tumour ""bell-clapper"" deformity--poor gubernacular fixation of the testicles to the scrotal wall. The diagnosis is made by clinical history and examination, but can be suppoed by a Doppler ultrasound, which typically shows decreased intra-testicular blood flow relative to the contralateral testis. Immediate surgical exploration can salvage an ischemic testis. More than 80% of testes can be salvaged if surgery is performed within 6 hours; this rate decreases to <20% as time lapses beyond 12 hours. At the time of surgery, the contralateral testes must also be explored and fixed to the daos fascia due to the possibility that the same anatomic defect allowing torsion exists on the contralateral side.",C
All of the following factors fascilitate non union except:,Haematoma formation,Periosteal injuries,Absence of nerve supply,Chronic infection,"A i.e. Hematoma formation Fracture healing process passes through several stages. In which the, first is stage of hematoma formationQ and the last is stage of remodelingQ Fracture Healing Bone is a unique tissue because it heals by the formation of normal bone, as opposed to scar tissue. Infact it is considered a nonunion when a bone heals by fibroblastic response. The majority of fractures heal by secondary (callus) healing through a combination of intramembranous - ossification (hard callus formation) & endochondral ossificaion (soft callus formation). Bone healing can be divided into following phases depending on the biological events. * There are two sources of repair tissues (callus), medullary & periosteal. The former is most marked in cancellous hone, while the later predominates in diaphyseal fracture. Periosteal callus may be of two types - primary callus (from DOPC) & external bridging callus (from IOPC), its appearance is inhibited by rigid fixation as plate and is predominant form of healing in cast immobilization &intramedullary nailing. (i.e. micromovements present) * Late medullary callus is more dependent on intramedullary vascularity (not on external soft trissue) and is impoant in fractures immobilized by rigid plating (i.e. no micrmovements)* Phenomenon of Creeping Substitution occurs in cancellous bone (i.e. blood vessels invading the trabeculae of bone directly causing bone apposition)* The modification of previously undifferentiated soft tissue cells in to osteogenic cells (IOPC) is termed bone induction.",A

The nonaggressive nature of this tumor locally and the infrequency of distant metastases combine to produce an 80-95% 5-year survival rate. A contributing factor to the success of thyroid surgery for papillary carcinoma is the easy accessibility of cervical nodes for examination and dissection. Slow growth and a predilection for local extension are characteristics of this tumor that contribute to a high survival rate in affected persons. This is true even of patients who have limited surgery, which has led to considerable controversy regarding the extent of the indicated surgical procedure.",D

Post transplant lymphoma is ?,T cell,B cell,Null cell,NK cell,"B cell Nearly 1 to 20% of people who receive a solid organ transplant develop a lymphoma. - Lymphomas have also been repoed (though less .frequently) after bone-marrow transplants .for other disorders. Why does it happen? - Post-transplant lymphomas are almost always related to infection by the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). - Infection by the Epstein Barr Virus causes a transformation of B-cells which becomes cancerous. In normal individuals other cells of the immune system can tackle the EBV infection, but for organ transplants high doses of drugs that suppress the immune system must be administered. With nothing to control the infection, the chances of developing lymphomas increase. The two main factors that determine the chances of getting lymphoma are: How much immunosuppressive treatment is required - The more the immunosuppression, the more the chances of EBV infection. The status of EBV serology of the recipient of the transplant - If this individual has previously been infected by EBV the chances are that the body remembers the infection and the blood already has called antibodies that can identify and kill the virus. Clinical features Post-transplant lymphomas are usually different .from the usual Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While most patients have involvement mainly of lymph nodes, other organs are very commonly affected as well. These include the brain, lungs and the intestines. The transplanted organ can also get involved. Treatment Whenever possible, immunosuppressive treatment has to be reduced or stopped. In those who have small and localized disease, surgery or radiation may be attempted. If not, the first line of treatment is usually Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets lymphoma cells. Only when this. fails is chemotherapy attempted. Chemotherapy is deferred until necessary as in paially immunosuppressed individuals, chemotherapy may fuher increase the risk of infections. In those who develop lymphomas after bone marrow transplants, donor leukocyte transfusions can be highly effective. Prognosis of Post transplant lymphomas In general, non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring after organ transplants have a poorer outcome than other NHLs. Around 60-80% of the victims ultimately succumb to their lymphoma. Involvement of brain has poor prognosis",B

Jumper's fracture is seen in?,Calcaneum,Tibia,Pelvis,Neck femur,"Forceful axial loading of spine and pelvis may lead to a pelvic ring injury that has been called the ""Jumper's fracture"" or ""suicidal jumper's fracture"". As the name implies the injury is often seen after a fall from height, as in suicidal attempts, causing dislocation of central poion of sacrum from the lateral position. Simply put, the patients hits the ground with both feets. The leg hips, and sacral ala stop immediately, while the sacral body and spinal column keep moving downward. The Sacrum fails at its weakest points, the neural foramina. This mechanism results in a variety of fracture patterns, but the shared finding is the separation of the center of the sacrum from the lateral poions.

A 60-year diabetic & hypertensive male with second-grade prostatism admitted for prostatectomy developed myocardial infarction. Treatment now would be -,Finasteride,Terazocin,Finasteride and terazocin,Diethyl stilbestrol,"This patient needs medical treatment to relieve him of symptoms of prostatism (now better k/a LUTS i.e. lower urinary tract symptoms)
Two classes of drugs are commonly used for BPH


α Adrenergic blockers - eg. Prazosin, Terazosin (α1 blockers) & Tamsulosin, Alfuzosin (α1a blockers)
5α reductase inhibitors - eg. Finasteride, Dutasteride, Triptorelin pamoate


α-Adrenergic blockers
Since activation of αl receptors in the bladder neck, prostate and prostatic urethra increases their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction and increasing the urinary flow rate.
5α reductase inhibitor
These drugs prevent the conversion of testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgen action in many tissues including prostate. Their use results in a reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptom.
But six months of therapy is required to see the maximum effect on the prostate size and symptomatic improvement and symptomatic improvement is seen only in men with enlarged prostate (> 40 cm3) 
Since the patient in the question needs to relieve him of his symptoms till he gets fit to be operated, a blocker (Terazocin) would be used. α lockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride. The bad point about α blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression.

About Combination therapy
Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to alleviate his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.",B

• Exposure to asbestos is the major known risk factor
• More common in males, most common after 40 years of age.
• Three types: Epithelial, sarcomatous, and biphasic
• Epithelial types are associated with a more favorable prognosis
Pathophysiology
• Physical characteristics of specific fibers (referred to as serpentine or amphibole) have been shown to be important.
• Serpentine fibers: Large and curly, not able to travel beyond larger airways.
• Straight amphibole fibers: In particular the crocidoliteQ fibers navigate distally into the pulmonary parenchyma, most clearly associated with mesotheliomas.
• Latency period between asbestos exposure and the development of mesothelioma is at least 20 years.
• Multicentric tumor with multiple pleura-based nodules coalescing to form sheets of tumor (but not bilaterally symmetrical)
• Natural history of the disease in untreated patients culminates in death due to local extension.
Clinical Features
• Most patients present with dyspnea and chest pain.
• Over 90% have a pleural effusion.
Diagnosis
• Results of thoracentesis are diagnostic in <10% of patients.

"Sunray appearance on X-ray may be seen in: September 2008, March 2013 (c)",Osteoclastoma,Osteoblastoma,Osteoblastoma,Chondroblastoma,"Ans. C: Osteosarcoma In radiographic terms,'sunray' or 'sunburst', or 'spicule', are used for periosteal new bone formation in which new bone is formed perpendicular to the coex resulting in multiple lines like sunrays. This event could occur when the periosteum is rapidly stripped from the coex. It is believed that a variety of substances that contact the inner surface of the exposed periosteum can cause new bone formation. These substances include inflammatory products from infection, blood from trauma, granulomatous reactions or neoplasms. Although the sunray pattern is highly suggestive of osteosarcoma and chrondrosarcoma, other jaw lesions sometimes show this feature, such as hemangioma, complex odontoma odontogenic myxoma, benign cementoblastoma and multiple myeloma.",C

Escharotomies is required in which type of burns:,1st degree,2nd degree deep ( subcutaneous ),2nd degree superficial,Electrical,"When deep second- and third-degree burn wounds encompass the circumference of an extremity, peripheral circulation to the limb can be compromised. Development of generalized edema beneath a nonyielding eschar impedes venous outflow and eventually affects aerial inflow to the distal beds. This can be recognized by numbness and tingling in the limb and increased pain in the digits. Aerial flow can be assessed by determination of Doppler signals in the digital aeries and the palmar and plantar arches in affected extremities. Capillary refill can also be assessed. Extremities at risk are identified either on clinical examination or on measurement of tissue pressures greater than 40 mm Hg. These extremities require escharotomies, which are releases of the burn eschar performed at the bedside by incising the lateral and medial aspects of the extremity with a scalpel or electrocautery unit. The entire constricting eschar must be incised longitudinally to completely relieve the impediment to blood flow. The incisions are carried down onto the thenar and hypothenar eminences and along the dorsolateral sides of the digits to completely open the hand, if it is involved. If it is clear that the wound will require excision and grafting because of its depth, escharotomies are safest to restore perfusion to the underlying non burned tissues until formal excision.

What is the mode of action of local anesthetics?,Prevents Na+ channel activation and the Na+ influx associated with membrane depolarization.,Change the voltage gated Na+ channel from conducting to non conducting,Destroys the Na+ channel,Close the Na+ channel,"Sodium channels are membrane bound proteins that are composed of one large and subunit through which Na ions pass, and one or two smaller b subunits. Voltage - gated Na channels exist in three stages - resting, open and inactivated local anesthetics bind a specific region of the & subunit and inhibit voltage - gated Na channels preventing channel activation and Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition ofActivated, voltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses).This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations Sodium passess through voltage gated sodium channel and cause change in membrane potential and cause depolarization. Local anesthetic attaches to sodium channel and prevents propogation & depolarization",A

This disorder almost always occurs in cigarette smokers at a young age (usually below 35years) and is often associated with HLA-A9,B5 genotypes. It used to be found exclusively in men, but recently there has been an increase in the number of repoed cases in women. The vessels primarily affected are in the extremities, and this leads to painful ischemia and gangrene of the legs and arms due to thrombosis. Histologic sections reveal an acute inflammatory infiltrate involving the entire wall of the vessel. In contrast to atherosclerosis, small microabscesses may be seen within thrombi. The inflammation leads to intimal proliferation that obliterates the lumen and causes pain. The disease may regress on cessation of smoking. In contrast, granulomatous inflammation with giant cells involving blood vessels can be seen with temporal aeritis orTakayasu's aeritis. Fragmentation of neutrophils surrounding blood vessels is called leukocytoclastic vasculitis, the differential for which includes microscopic polyaeritis nodosa, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome.",D

However, if the BIS monitor is used primarily to decrease the amount of anesthetic administered for reasons of cost and efficiency, it is possible that an even more frequent incidence of recall might result. Conversely, a recent study on the use of the BIS monitor showed no decrease in the incidence of awareness with the use of volatile anesthetics.",A

Ideally which gas is used for laproscopy?,NO,N2O,CO2,AIR,"ANSWER: (C) CO2REF: Schwartz's Principles of Surgery 9th ed chapter 14, Mastery of endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery edited by Nathaniel J. Soper, Lee L. Swanstrom, W. Stephen Eubanks 3rd ed page 7, Palanivelus Text Book of Surgical Laparoscopy 1st ed page 21""Laparoscopic surgery is most commonly performed with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum, because it is cheap, does not support combustion, and is rapidly eliminated from the body, decreasing the risk of gaseous embolism""The unique feature of laparoscopic surgery is the need to lift the abdominal wall from the abdominal organs. Two methods have been devised for achieving this. The first, used by most surgeons, is a pneumoperitoneum.I Pneumoperitoneum1. Air pneumoperitoneum:* Throughout the early twentieth century, intraperitoneal visualization was achieved by inflating the abdominal cavity with air, using a sphygmomanometer bulb.* The problem with using air insufflation is that nitrogen is poorly soluble in blood and is slowly absorbed across the peritoneal surfaces. Air pneumoperitoneum was believed to be more painful than nitrous oxide (N2O) pneumoperitoneum, but less painful than carbon dioxide (COO2) pneumoperitoneum.2. N2O pneumoperitoneum* N2O had the advantage of being physiologically inert and rapidly absorbed.Local affectsSystemic effectsPeritoneal distentionVagal reactionElevated diaphragmAltered venous returnPainHypercartwaAddosisIncreased aftertoadIncreased catecholaminesMyocardial stressIt also provided better analgesia for laparoscopy performed under local anesthesia when compared with CO2 or airDespite initial concerns that N2O would not suppress combustion, controlled clinical trials have established its safety within the peritoneal cavity, (controvertial)In addition, N2O has been shown to reduce the intraoperative end-tidal CO2 and minute ventilation required to maintain homeostasis when compared to CO2 pneumoperitoneum.3. CO2..pneumoperitoneumThe physiologic effects of CO2 pneumoperitoneum can be divided into two areas: (a) gas-specific effects and (b) pressure-specific effectsII. Abdominal lift device:In some situations, minimally invasive abdominal surgery should be performed without insufflation. This has led to the development of an abdominal lift device that can be placed through a 10- to 12-mm trocar at the umbilicus. These devices have the advantage of creating little physiologic derangement, but they are bulky and intrusive.",C

When epinephrine fails to control the anaphylactic reaction, hypoxia due to airway obstruction or related to a cardiac arrhythmia, or both, must be considered Oxygen alone a nasal catheter or with nebulized albuterol may be helpful, but either endotracheal intubation or a tracheostomy is mandatory for oxygen delivery if progressive hypoxia develops. Ancillary agents such as the antihistamine diphenhydramine, 50 to 100 mgIM or IV, and aminophylline , 0.25 to 0.5 g IV, are appropriate for uicaria-angioedema and bronchospasm, respectively. Intravenous glucocoicoids, 0.5-1.0 mg/kg of medrol, are not effective for the acute event but may allete later recurrence of bronchospasm, hypotension, or uicaria.",B

Ramesh met an accident with a car and has been in &;deep coma&; for the last 15 days. The most suitable route for the administration of proteins and caloriesis by?,Jejunostomy tube feeding,Gastrostomy tube feeding,Nasogastric tube feeding,Central venous hyperalimentation,"Unless the GI tract is non-functional, its use for nutritional suppo is preferable as compared to TPN. In a patient who is comatose either NG feeding or feeding through a gastrostomy tube may lead to vomiting and aspiration. This can be avoided by using a nasoenteric tube with the tip placed in jejunum under fluoroscopic guidance or endoscopic control. Alternatively, a catheter may be placed directly into the proximal jejunum through a small upper abdominal incision. Enteral Nutrition Enteral feeding means delivery of nutrients into the GIT. The alimentary tract should be used whenever possible. This can be acheived with oral supplements (sip feeding) or with a variety of tube-feeding techniques delivering food into the stomach, duodenum or jejunum. Advantages of Enteral route over Parenteral route Maintains integrity of gastrointestinal tract. Reduces translocation of gut bacteria that may lead to infection. Reduces levels of pro inflammatory cytokines generated by the gut that contribute to hypermetabolism.

What would be the immediate management?",Encourage him to pass urine after adequate control of pain,Assess the urethral injury by ascending urethrography,Percutaneous suprapubic catheterization of the bladder,Catheterization of the urethra,"Assess the urethral injury by ascending ......... The bulbous urethra may be injured as a result falling astride an object. Urethral contusion may cause a perineal hematoma without urethral disruption. Perineal hematoma usually resolves without complications. Laceration will lead to urinary extravasation. The patient usually has a desire to void, but voiding should not be allowed until assessment of the urethra is complete. No attempt should be made to pass a urethral catheter, but if the patient's bladder is over distended, percutaneous suprapubic cystostomy can be done as a temporary procedure. A urethrogram with instillation of 15 - 20 m1 of contrast material, will demonstrate extravasation and the location of injury. The contused urethra will show no evidence of extravasation. If there is no evidence of extravasation on the urethrogram, a urethral catheter may be passed into the bladder. Extravasation is a contraindication to fuher instrumentation at this time. After the urethrography, the patient with urethral contusion is allowed to void; and if the voiding occurs normally, without pain or bleeding no additional treatment is necessary. If bleeding persists urethral catheter drainage can be done. If urethral laceration is detected on urethrography instrumentation of the urethra should be avoided. A suprapubic cystostomy tube should be inseed (through a small incision in the suprapubic area to expose the dome of the bladder) to allow complete urinary diversion while the urethral laceration heals.",B

In trauma to the neck which indicates immediate management,Sub cutaneous emphysema,Air bubbling,Stridor,Hypotension,"Trauma to neck Immediate Management Neck injuries can often require rapid intervention because of the vulnerability of the contained vital structures. The highest priority concern is establishment of a secure airway, especially given the rapidity with which deterioration can occur in the setting of a neck injury. Direct injury to the larynx or trachea is the most common cause of airway compromise. Expanding neck hemato- mas can quickly compress the upper airway, leading to inadequate ventilation. Immediate intubation should occur in the setting of an expanding neck hematoma or if there is concern about impend- ing airway compromise. Suspected laryngotracheal injury presents one of the most challenging airway management situations. Patients who are maintaining their own airway should have a planned approach to airway management that might include intu- bation or awake tracheostomy in the operating room. Attempted intubation could worsen a tenuous situation and should not be performed without a well-developed backup plan. A loss of airway requires emergent intervention that might include performing a surgical airway. The surgical airway of choice for an upper airway injury is a tracheostomy because injury to the larynx could make cricothyroidotomy ineffective. In the immediate setting, hemorrhage is the other major concern that might occur after neck injury. Direct pressure effec- tively manages most bleeding from the neck, at least during transpo to the operating room and initiation of neck explora- tion. Injury to the large vessels of the neck will often require control in the operating room. Bleeding should be immediately treated with digital pressure on the wound until operative expo- sure can be achieved. Large quantities of blood can be lost quickly, so resuscitation with blood products should be rapidly initiated. Patients with suspected injury should be rapidly trans- ferred to the operating room for surgical management of ongoing bleeding. Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno :423",C

Select the wrong statement with respect to cleft lip and palate,Have possible genetic and environmental predisposition,Frequency varies among population groups,Cleft lip with palate is the most common combination,Antenatal diagosis is not possible,"The incidence of cleft lip and palate is 1:600 live bihs and of isolated cleft palate is 1:1000 live bihs. The incidence increases in Oriental groups (1:500) and decreases in the black population (1:2000). The highest incidence repoed for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1:276). Although cleft lip and palate is an extremely diverse and variable congenital abnormality, several distinct sub-groups exist, namely cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP) alone and submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The typical distribution of cleft types is: *cleft lip alone: 15%; *cleft lip and palate: 45%; *isolated cleft palate: 40%. Cleft lip/palate predominates in males whereas cleft palate alone appears to be more common in females. In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left side in 60% of cases. AETIOLOGY Contemporary opinion on the aetiology of cleft lip and palate is that cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate have a genetic predisposition and a contributory environmental component. A family history of cleft lip and palate in which the first-degree *The key features of the perioperative care of the child with cleft lip and palate *The associated complications of cleft lip and palate and their management relative is affected increases the risk to 1:25 live bihs. Genetic influence is more significant in cleft lip/palate than cleft palate alone, in which environmental factors exe a greater influence. Environmental factors implicated in clefting include maternal epilepsy and drugs, e.g. steroids, diazepam and phenytoin. The role of antenatal folic acid supplements in preventing cleft lip and palate remains equivocal. Although most clefts of the lip and palate occur as an isolated deformity, Pierre Robin sequence remains the most common syndrome. This syndrome comprises isolated cleft palate, retrognathia and a posteriorly displaced tongue (glossoptosis), which is associated with early respiratory and feeding difficulties. Isolated cleft palate is more commonly associated with a syndrome than cleft lip/palate and cleft lip alone. Over 150 syndromes are associated with cleft lip and palate, although Stickler's (ophthalmic and musculoskeletal abnormalities), Shprintzen's (cardiac anomalies), Down's, Ape's and TreacherCollins' syndromes are most frequently encountered.

The most likely cause of the bleeding is",Delayed blood transfusion reaction,Autoimmune fibrinolysis,A bleeding blood vessel in the surgical field,Factor VIII deficiency,"Whenever significant bleeding is noted in the early postoperative period, the presumption should always be that it is due to an error in surgical control of blood vessels in the operative field. Hematologic disorders that are not apparent during the long operation are most unlikely to surface as problems postoperatively. Blood transfusion reactions can cause diffuse loss of clot integrity; the sudden appearance of diffuse bleeding during an operation may be the only evidence of an intraoperative transfusion reaction. In the postoperative period, transfusion reactions usually present as unexplained fever, apprehension, and headache all symptoms difficult to interpret in the early postoperative period. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia) would almost certainly be known by history in a 65-year-old man, but if not, intraoperative bleeding would have been a problem earlier in this long operation.

Exception of Meyer-Oveon rule are all except,Non anaesthetics,Non immobilizer,Cut off effect,Hydrophobic site of action,"Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or ""lipoid-based"" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that ""All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anaesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

The risk of viral infection is highest during the first 6 months after transplantation and the most common problem is CMV infection. CMV disease may arise because of either reactivation of latent infection or primary infection that can be transmitted by an organ from a CMV-positive donor. Recipients at most risk from CMV infection are those who are CMV seronegative and receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor (about half of all UK donors are CMV seropositive). CMV disease typically presents at 4-8 weeks with a high swinging fever, lethargy and leukopenia. The severity of the disease is variable and the clinical picture depends on the organ system most affected. It may present as: pneumonia , gastrointestinal disease , hepatitis , retinitis , encephalitis. Severe CMV disease is potentially fatal.

Test for reversible cardiac ischemia aEUR',Angiography,Thallium scan,MUGA,Resting Echocardiography,"Thallium scan Thallium scanning Principle Thallium is a monovalent cation which acts as potassium analogue. It is taken up by ble cells - not dead ones. It is distributed to all pas of the body, largely in propoion to the regional blood flow. The concentration of thallium in the myocardium is propoional to the coronary blood flow over a wide range of flows. Once inside the myocardial cell, the thallium does not stay there. There is constant and continuous thallium exchange. Over a period of time thallium washes out of the normal cells and some thallium is extracted by the hypoperfusedareas. This unique propey is taken advantage of clinically during thallium stress testing and is the basis for the redistribution or late 4 hour image. Clinical application : Exercise is the most. frequently used form of stress in the testing of cardiac .function. During exercise myocardial blood flow normally increases by upto 3-4 folds to supply the increase in 0, demand. If coronary flow is limited by a stenosis there will be less thallium extracted .from the blood by the myocardium in the territoy of that aery compared with the normal, surrounding myocardium. This will cause a perfusion defect. Over 2-4 hours, this perfusion defect will redistribute or fill in as thallium washes out of the normally perfused cells and some more thallium is extracted by the hypoperfused myocardial cells Hence in ischemia the thallium perfusion defect disappears with time and is called a reversible defect. By contrast, areas of scar tissue or infarction do not change with time and appear as fixed defects. Clinical utility - interpretation No ischemia : In a patient without significant CAD, there will be uniform distribution of thallium in all myocardial segment's in the immediate post stress and 4 hour redistribution image. if the thallium scan is normal there is usually a very low probability, of angiographically significant CAD. Ischemia present : In a patient with significant CAD, (a stenosis of at least 70%), myocardial thallium uptake will be reduced causing a perfusion defect in the distribution of the stenosed vessel in the immediate poststress image. After 4 hours, the perfusion defect will 'fill in' or redistribute giving a unifonn thallium distribution, throughout the myocardium,, on reimagingo. Some perfusion defects only paially redistribute or do not ""fill in' at all by 4 hours. These patient are now re-injected with a smaller dose of thallium and reimaged after 30 minutes or alternatively reimaged at 24 hours without reinjection. Following reinjection and /or delayed imaging patients with severe ischemia usually demonstrate ,full or paial redistribution. Fixed defects which do not show redistribution are interpreted as scar tissue from myocardial infarction or nonble myocardium, which would at not benefit from revascularisatioe Viability The question of whether myocardium is ble can also be addressed, using rest and redistribution imaging. Following thallium injection, coronary blood flow at rest is assessed immediately and again at 4 hour. In a patient with a critical stenosis there will be very low flow at rest, producing a perfusion defect of varying severity. If there is ble myocardium present, the defect will resdistribute over time.",B

Phase 1 in this normal capnograph represent which pa of expiration:-,Dead space ventilation,Alveolar ventilation,Both,None,"Cellular metabolism produces carbon dioxide, while the lungs work to eliminate it from the body. The balance between production and elimination can be followed in the rise and fall of EtCO2 as displayed by the capnogram. More specifically, EtCO2waveforms provide clinicians with a tool for quick and reliable diagnoses of common pulmonary pathophysiology. Generally, EtCO2is displayed as a waveform with paial pressure of CO2on the y-axis and time on the x-axis (see the images below). Normal breathing. The capnogram has four phases, as follows: Phase I represents the end of inspiration, and early expiration of gas from dead space (circuit tubing, anatomic) Phase II represents gas from late anatomic and alveolar dead space, upsloping as alveolar gas mixes in and raises the CO 2 Phase III (plateau) represents the paial pressure of carbon dioxide exchanged at the alveoli; the amplitude of the plateau is referred to as EtCO 2;phase III normally has a very slight upslope due to physiologic V/Q mismatch Phase IV signifies the sta of inspiration, and the capnogram reflects the transition at the sampler from alveolar air flow to fresh air flow, or ""scrubbed"" air, in a closed circuit Of note, the information captured by end-tidal capnography (paial pressure of CO2) is devoid of volumetric information. Therefore, capnography should be used with end-tidal volume measurements to fully assess ventilation parameters.",A

""""In the absence of a precise diagnosis, children presenting with an undiagnosed neuromusculardisease should not have elective surgery or anaesthesia other than as part of the diagnostic process.Ref: Vindra etal., Anaesthesia for Children with Neuromuscular Disease, Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care and Pain, Volume 10, Issue 5, 1 October2010, pages 143-147Inguinal hernia repair is the most common general surgical procedure performed by pediatric surgeons.Males are more frequently affected than females, and the incidence of inguinal hernia is highest in the first year of life.Right-sided hernias (60%) occur more frequently than left-sided (30%) and bilateral (10%) hernias.Risk factors associated with inguinal hernias are prematurity, chronic respiratory illness, and excessive intraperitoneal fluid (ventriculoperitoneal shunts, ascites, peritoneal dialysis).Anesthesia can be induced by mask inhalation of volatile agents or by IV or rectal technique.Endotracheal intubation is usually unnecessary for herniorrhaphy, except in infants younger than 1 year, in whom it may be difficult to maintain an adequate airway with bag and mask ventilation without distending the stomach.Premature infants have a particularly high incidence of inguinal hernias. In these infants, for whom an inhalation anesthetic may have increased risks, spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia have been used successfully to avoid general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation.The history is compatible with cerebral palsy or congenital myopathies. Since this is an elective surgical repair, complete neurological workup and diagnosis is necessary before anesthetic risk can be assessed.These children are ideal for assessment by a multidisciplinary team which include anaesthesiologists and pediatrician. A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children, including a discussion of postoperative pain management with the parents. Cognitive and communication problems may make preoperative assessment more difficult. Parents and caretakers are best to be involved during this period not only to gain information but also allay the fears of the child.Anesthetic Concern in Cerebral PalsyIntraoperative hypothermia and slow emergence.Suxamethonium does not cause hyperkalaemia in these patients, and a rapid sequence induction may be indicated.Anesthetic Concern in Neuromuscular DiseasesThe incidence of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis is significant.Succinylcholine and volatile agents should be avoided in at-risk children.",A

Muscle rigidity is caused by which anaesthetic,Halothane,Ether,Sevoflurane,Alfentanil,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeterso Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in younger adults and children.o It is also known as universal tumourOther conditionso Lipomatosis is believed to be a hereditary condition in which multiple lipomas are present on the bodyo Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. Early studies mentioned prevalence in obese postmenopausal women. However, current literature demonstrates that Dercum disease is present in more women than men of all body types; the average age for diagnosis is 35 years.o Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years ofalcoholism. But, non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.Treatmento Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for histopathology to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma..o Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. This cures the great majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision.o Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissuecomponent. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.",D

Abdominal xrays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction."" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points upto 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2.5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus. They are not seen in colonic obstruction and pseudoobstruction. They may be seen in colonic obstruction if the ileocecal valve is incompetent.",C

"A 70 kg old athlete was posted for surgery, Patient was administered succinylcholine due to unavailability of vecuronium. It was administered in intermittent dosing (total 640 mg). During recovery patient was not able to respire spontaneously & move limbs. What is the explanation -",Pseudocholinesterase deficiency increasing action of syccinylcholine,Phase 2 blockade produced by succinylcholine,Undiagnosed muscular dystrophy and muscular weakness,Muscular weakness due to fasciculation produced by succinylcholine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block.Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug.(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong).Morgan's Anaesthesia 4th/e p. 112The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase II block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower.Millers Anaesthesia 6th/e p. 985After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, non depolarizing dual or phase II block occursProlonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiencyBut in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine.Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxantNormally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctionsAcetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potentialCompetitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential.On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i.e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate.At their first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarization would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so.With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinylcholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to further stimulation.Neuromuscular block with succinylcholine occurs in two sequential phasesAn initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and fasciculations.Maintained depolarization past the threshold for firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated.This is called phase I or depolarization blockIn the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized *Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restoredNonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptorsThis is known as phase II or desensitization blockThe mechanism for phase II block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected.Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drue usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 mg drug.Pseudocholinesterase deficiencySuccinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive.In certain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur.These are : -Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholineSmall proportion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine.In these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal form of the enzyme presentThe metabolism of succinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis.An important point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine.Other endogenous and exogenous causesPlasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as : -PregnancyLiver diseaseUremiaMalnutritionBurnsPlasma pheresisOral contraceptivesThese conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimportant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",B

Gleasons score is used for,Prostate carcinoma,Testicular carcinoma,Renal cell carcinoma,Malignan melanoma,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Prostate carcinoma Gleason score and grading system* Gleason score is the most commonly used histological grading system for prostate cancer.* The two most predominant histological patterns of the prostate cancer are assigned a Gleason grade ranging from 1-5.* Primary grade is assigned to the pattern of cancer that is most commonly observed in the histological slides of the specimen.* Secondary grade is assigned to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen.* Gleason score is the sum of the two grades. Thus it is also known as Gleason sum.* If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and sencondary grades are reported as the same grade.* As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus range from 2 to 10* The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts prognosis and helps guide therapy.* A point of importance is that the primary Gleason grade is most important with respect to placing patients in prognostic groups. For example in patients with a Gleason score 7, a Gleason 4+3 is a more aggressive cancer than a Gleason 3+4.",A

Example of syndesmosis joint is: September 2007,Tibiotalar joint,Tibiofibular joint,Elbow joint,Carpometacarpal joint,"Ans. B: Tibiofibular Joint I. Six types of synol joints are: Hinge Ball-and-socket Pivot Condyloid (angular or ellipsoidal) Plane (gliding) Saddle. - The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. Here, the convex and concave aiculating bones allow movement along one plane, similar to a door. -The shoulder and hip are the only ball-and-socket joints in the body. In this type of joint, one bone has a spherical head that aiculates with a corresponding concavity. This joint frees the joint to move in many directions. - In a pivot joint, one round-shaped aiculating bone fits within a corresponding depression on another bone. This joint allows one bone to rotate against the other. An example is the radioulnar joint (joint of the radius and ulna) in the forearm. - In a condyloid (angular) joint, one bone has an oval aiculating head that rests within an oval concavity. This joint permits angular movement of the bones. The metacarpophalangeal joint (junction between the metacarpals and phalanges) of the hand are examples of condyloid joints - Plane joints have two flat bones joined. The sole movement of the bones is sho gliding motions. An example of this joint is the intearsal joint (junction between the tarsal bones) of the feet. Saddle joint bones have convex and concave surfaces similar to a saddle. This joint allows the joint to move in many directions. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is an example saddle joint. II. As their name implies, amphiahrosis joints (slightly movable joints) have limited movement. The two types of amphiahrosis joints are: Syndesmosis (fibrous) Symphysis (cailaginous). - A Syndesmosis joint occurs when two bones join by a section of cailage. The junction between the tibia and fibula is an example. A symphysis joint forms when two bones fuse by a fibrocailage pad. Typical symphysis joints are between the pubic symphysis (pubic bones in the pelvis), and in the veebral column between individual veebrae. Interveebral discs act as weight-bearing shock absorbers for walking, jumping, and lifting. III. An immovable joint is called a synahrosis. The two types of this joint are: Sutures Gomphoses. - Sutures are joined by sho fibers of dense fibrous connective tissue and are in the skull. - The single example of a gomphosis joint is the teeth sitting within their sockets. IV. An example of a bony fusion joint is the fusion of the three bones forming a coxa (hip bone): the ilium, ischium, and pubis.",B

(A Meckel's is notoriously difficult to see with contrast radiology.)ii) Diverticulitis: Meckel's diverticulitis presents like appendicitis, although if perforation occurs the presentation may resemble a perforated duodenal ulcer.iii) Intussusception: A Meckel's can be the lead point for ileoileal or ileocolic intussusception.iv) Chronic ulceration: Pain is felt around the umbilicus, as the site of the diverticulum is midgut in origin.v) Intestinal obstruction: A band between the apex of the diverticulum and the umbilicus (also part of the vitellointestinal duct) may cause obstruction directly or by a volvulus around it.vi) Perforation* The vast majority of Meckel's are asymptomatic. When found in the course of abdominal surgery, a Meckel's can safely be left alone provided it has a wide mouth and is not thickened.* When there is doubt, it can be resected.* The finding of a Meckel's diverticulum in an inguinal or femoral hernia has been described as Littre's hernia.",B

"A 62-year-old woman with a history of coronary aery disease presents with a pancreatic head tumor and undergoes a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postoperatively, she develops a leak from the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis and becomes septic. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed, which demonstrates an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. She also develops acute renal failure and oliguria. Which of the following is an indication to sta dopamine?",To increase splanchnic flow,To increase coronary flow,To decrease hea rate,To lower peripheral vascular resistance,"Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension.",B

Best fluid for resuscitation of burns patient -,Hartmann solution,Colloid,Normal saline,5% Dextrose,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hartmann solution * Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL)(Hartman's solution) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis).* Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",A
Nirous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following except: September 2006,Volvulus surgeries,Pneumothorax,Patient in shock,Tympanoplasties,"Ans. C: Patient in shock Overall, nitrous oxide is a very safe drug with few absolute contraindications. Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock.",C

Not true about varicocele is :,Common on the right side,Can present as a late sign of renal cell carcinoma,Has bag of worm like feeling,Can lead to infertility,"Ans. is 'a' ie Common on the Rt. side Varicocele is seen on left side in 95% of cases VaricoceleIt is seen 95% of times on left side.Several anatomic features contribute to the predominance of left-sided varicoceles. The left internal spermatic vein is longer than the right; in addition, it usually joins the left renal vein at right angles. The right internal spermatic vein has a more oblique insertion into the inferior vena cava. This particular anatomy in the standing man may cause higher venous pressures to be transmitted to the left scrotal veins and result in retrograde reflux of blood into the pampiniform plexus.Clinical pictureAge - young adultTall thin men are frequently affected* *Bag of worms* like feel on palpationThe veins empty in supine position (so examination is always done in standing position)* Infertility : The varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility worldwide. In approximately 70% of patients with secondary infertility, a varicocele is an underlying cause. ""The World Health Organization concluded that varicoceles are clearly associated with impairment of testicular function and infertility. "" Varicocele may be secondary to renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney. The growth from renal cell carcinoma blocks the renal vein by venous permeation. So sudden onset of varicocele (left side) in middle aged man should arouse suspicion of a renal cell carcinoma of the left side.In renal cell Ca, the varicocele does not decompress in the supine positon*.",A

51 yr female with ductal ca in situ managed by-,Quadrentectomy,Simple mastectomy,Radiotherapy,Chemotherapy,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Simple mastectomy Breast conserving surgery and Simple mastectomy, both can be done in this patient. Though Simple mastectomy offers lesser risk of recurrence, it induces the psychological trauma of loss of breast. Hence breast consenting surgery would be the best management in this young patient.Treatment of Ductal Ca in situ (DC1S)o DCIS carries a high risk for progression to an invasive cancer. Schwartz writes - ""The risk of invasive breast cancer is increased nearly five fold in women with DCIS. The invasive cancers are observed in the ipsilateral breast, usually in the same quadrant as the DCIS that was originally detected, suggesting that DCIS is an anatomic precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma "".o The treatment of intraductal lesion is controversial. It can be t/t by eitherSimple mastectomy orBreast conservation with wide excision (lumpectomy) with radiation therapyo Choice of operation depends on both surgeon and patient preference', however following points must be kept in mind.o Simple mastectomy is the gold standard procedure with no need of radiation and less recurrence rate (-2%), but there is loss of breast, a big psychological trauma to the patient,o Breast conserving procedures are better cosmetically but recurrence rate is more.The patient also has to be monitored regularly both clinically and by mammography for any recurrent disease.Those in favour of conservative procedure, however say that local recurrences if occur, can be successfully managed with salvage mastectomy.o Simple mastectomy is recommended for the following DCISDCIS with evidence of widespread disease (involving two or more quadrants)Mammographically identified mu Dicentric disease or diffuse suspicious calcification.Persistent positive margins after reexcision.Unacceptable cosmesis to obtain negative margins.A patient not motivated to preserve her breast.For patients who are high risk for recurrenceSize greater than 4 cmComedo appearance on histologyNegative estrogen receptor statusHigh grade tumorFor patients with contraindications to radiation therapyPrior radiation to the breast regionPresence of collagen vascular disease {SLE, Scleroderma)First or second trimester pregnancyo Adjuvant Tamoxifen therapy is may be give to ER positive DCIS patients. (The use of hormonal therapy in ER- positive DCIS decreases the risk for local recurrence and also reduces the risk for development of new contralateral and ipsilateral breast cancers).o ''Sentinel node biopsy is currently recommended when mastectomy is performed for DCIS because up to 10% of patients with DCIS on a diagnostic biopsy will be found to have invasive cancer in their mastectomy specimen"".-- Sabiston 18/e po Because the risk for metastatic disease in patients with DCIS is 1%, systemic chemotherapy is not required.o Breast conservative surgery (lumpectomy) without radiation can be an option for -Low-grade DCIS of the solid, cribriform, or papillary subtype that is <0.5 cm in diameter if the margins of resection are widely free of disease.Treatment of lobular carcinoma in situ (LOS)o LCIS is not an anatomical precursor of invasive disease like DCIS, rather it is considered as a risk factor for invasive breast carcinoma (which can be either invasive ductal or lobular type),o The risk for invasive cancer is equal for both breast, so there is no benefit to excise LCIS.o Treatment of LCIS isObservation with or without tamoxifenThe goal of treatment is to detect the invasive cancer at an early stage which will develop in about 25 to 35% of these womenFor patients who are unwilling to accept the increased risk of breast cancer may be offered bilateral simple mastectomy.o Also RememberThe majority of invasive cancer which subsequently develop in LCIS are of ductal nature (~65%) not lobular.One more difference between LCIS & DCISLCIS is seen in female breasts only whereas DCIS can be seen in both male and female breasts.",B

Innovation of refrigeration leading to better food preservation has led to decrease incidence of which of the following malignancies?,Esophagus,Colon,Oropharyngeal,Stomach,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Stomach ""This sharp decline (in gastric cancer) during the 20th century remains an unexplained yet staling phenomenon. The leading theories to explain this change concern the advent of refrigeration and infection with Helicobacter pylori."" Int. J. Epidemiol. (2001) 30 (1):181-182 Stomach cancer used to be the most common cause of cancer deaths in the early pa of the century. During the later half of the century a dramatic decline in the cancer incidence without any planned intervention was noted. Two major reasons have been advocated for this: 1. H. pylori infection: decrease incidence of H. pylori due to improved hygine and effective drugs. 2. Refrigeration: Refrigerators improved storage of food, thereby reducing intake of salt-based preserved food (high in nitrites and carcinogenic nitrosamines). Refrigeration also allowed for fresh food and vegetables to be more readily available, which are a valuable source of antioxidants impoant for cancer prevention. Salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite found in preserved food are potentially carcinogenic. Intake of salted food may increase the risk of H pylori infection and act synergistically to promote the development of gastric cancer.",D

Best diagnostic method for breast lump is ?,USG,Mammogram,Biopsy,FNAC,"Ans is 'c' ie. Biopsy First investigation is -------> FNAC Best & the definitive investigation is -------> Open biopsy Preferred method -------> Core needle biopsy ""Core-needle biopsy is the preferred method for diagnosis of palpable or nonpalpable breast abnormalities."" - Schwaz 9/e p425 The diagnosis of breast cancer depends ultimately upon examination of tissue or cells removed by biopsy or FNAC (also known as FNA biopsy). The treatment should never be undeaken without a confirmed diagnosis of cancer. Thus a biopsy (biopsy includes all kinds of biopsy including FNA biopsy, also known as FNAC) should be done of all suspicious masses found on physical examination and in the absence of a mass of suspicious lesions demonstrated by mammography. A breast mass should not be followed without a biopsy. Exception to this is perhaps in the premenopausal woman with a nonsuspicious mass presumed to be fibrocystic disease. A lesion such as this could be observed through one or two menstrual cycles. However if the mass does not completely resolve during this time, it must be biopsied. For biopsy, FNAC (or FNAB) is the simplest method Schwaz writes - ""The combination of diagnostic mammography, ultrasound or sterotactic localization and fine needle aspiration biopsy is almost 100% accurate in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However while FNA biopsy permits cytological evaluation, core-needle or open biopsy also permits the analysis of breast tissue architecture and allows the pathologist to determine whether invasive cancer is present. Core-needle biopsy is preferred over open biopsy for nonpalpable breast lesions because a single surgical procedure can be planned based on the results of the core biopsy. The advantages of core-needle biopsy include a low complication rate, avoidance of scarring, and a lower cost."" CSDT writes? ""Open biopsy under local anaesthesia as a separate procedure prior to deciding upon definitive treatment is the most reliable means of diagnosis.""",C

What is the coagulation factor involved exclusively in the extrinsic coagulation system? SELECT ONE.,Factor II (prothrombin),Factor V,Factor VII,Factor VIII,"There are two coagulation pathways - extrinsic and intrinsic. In the extrinsic system, tissue thromboplastin (a lipoprotein) interacts with factor VII. The intrinsic pathway requires factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Factor XII is the initial step in the coagulation cascade. Factor XII, activated by contact with a nonendothelial substance, will activate factor XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent). However, factor XI can be activated even when factor XII is deficient. Calcium is required for nearly all of the enzyme reactions in both the intrinsic and extrinsic systems. The amount of ionized calcium required for these reactions is extremely small, and clinical hypocalcemia itself is not a cause of abnormal bleeding. Fibrin split products are not part of the normal pathway in either the intrinsic or extrinsic system. The excessive breakdown of fibrinogen results in measurable amounts of the breakdown products of fibrinogen in the blood. Their presence may signal DIC if the PT and platelet count are deranged. In pure fibrinolysis, fibrinogen breakdown product levels also may be increased.",C

Which of the following is the main mechanism by which the mechlorethamine exes its cell killing?,"Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands",Blocking microtubular assembly and mitosis during M-phase,"Inhibiting topoisomerase, preventing repair of DNA strand breaks","Intercalating in DNA strands, there by preventing DNA replication by Mrna","Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands Vincristine and the other vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin and impair microtubular assembly, preventing mitosis (M-phase-specific). Mechlorethamine, like cyclophosphamide (and carmustine and several others), is an alkylating agent. They are called bifunctional alkylating agents because they can covalently bind to DNA in two places (""nucleophilic attack""), thereby forming cross-links between two adjacent strands or between two bases in one strand. This ultimately disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis or may cause strand breakage. Cyclophosphamide (which can be considered the prototype of the alkylating agents) is actually a pro- drug--it requires metabolic activation in order for its effects to occur. Cyclophosphamide (and other alkylating agents) are cell cycle-nonspecific, although their efficacy is greater when cells are not in G0.Bleomycin, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are good examples of drugs that intercalate in DNA strands. Thus, the altered DNA no longer serves as an adequately precise template for eventual synthesis of more functional DNA and RNA. They are classified as antitumor antibiotics. Etoposide and topotecan are examples of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase 11. The consequence is inhibited ability of affected cells to repair DNA strand breaks. This stops the cell cycle in G2 - The taxoid (e.g., paclitaxel) impairs mitosis, but by stabilizing assembled microtubules rather than by exeing a vinca alkaloid-like inhibition of microtubular assembly.",A

It should appear blanched (pallor can be observed at the finger nails). Ulnar pressure is released and the colour should return in 7 seconds. Inference: Ulnar aery supply to the hand is sufficient and it is safe to cannulate/ prick the radial If color does not return or returns after 7-10 seconds, the test is considered positive and the ulnar aery supply to the hand is not sufficient. The radial aery therefore cannot be safely pricked/ cannulated.",D

Diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome is made by which one of the following?,Clinical Evaluation,CT scan,MRI,Angiography,"Thoracic outlet syndrome is diagnosed by history and physical examination. Diagnosis is confirmed by the reproduction of symptoms by tests such as Adson or scalene test, costoclavicular test, hyperabduction test or arm claudication (Roos) test. In thoracic outlet syndrome, Adsons test (i.e extension and turning the neck towards a side) results in change in radial pulse or occurrence of symptoms of nerve compression. In costoclavicular test, by drawing the shoulders down and backward symptoms appear. In hyperabduction test, arms are hyperextended to 180 degrees and symptoms are generated. In Roos test, symptoms are generated by drawing shoulders upward and backward, with arm raised to horizontal position with the elbow flexed at 90 degree.

Pituitary irradiation has been used for patients with persistent or recurrent disease after surgery. However, it is associated with a high rate of panhypopituitarism, and some patients develop visual deficits. This has led to increased use of stereotactic radiosurgery, which uses CT guidance to deliver high doses of radiotherapy to the tumour (photon or gamma knife) and also bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

The likely diagnosis on this occasion is:,Gastric ulcer,Atrophic gastritis,Duodenal ulcer,Chronic pancreatitis,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Duodenal ulcer Epigastric pain that awakens the patient at nights, and is relieved by food suggests a diagnosis of duodenal ulcer. Gastric ulcer pain is usually exacerbated by food and does not awaken the patient at nights. ""Traditionally pain relieved by food is duodenal and pain exacerbated by food is gastric""- Clinical history taking and examination by Wels 2/e p49. ""Two thirds of patients with duodenal ulcers will complain of pain that awakens them from sleep.

The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin A is best described by:,Postsynaptic receptor blockade,Acetylcholinesterase inhibition,Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release,Slowing of myelinated nerve fiber transmission,"Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release Botulinum toxin is an effective inhibitor of presynaptic acetylcholine exocytosis. Acting at the neuromuscular junction, cellular uptake is believed to occur through an active cell surface receptor-mediated process. This three-step chemical denervation is initiated by the toxin selectively binding to sites on the surface membrane of cholinergic nerve endings. An energy-dependent endocytotic process ensues internalizing the cell membrane with bound protein. The final step is presumed to act on calcium-mediated exocytosis, preventing the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. It is also believed that Botulinum toxin acts as a zinc-dependent metalloendo protease to inhibit exocytosis.",C

The main controlling agent for respiratory drive is which of the following -,CO2,Oxygen,NO,HBO3,"Central chemoreceptors are situated in the deeper pa of medulla oblongata, close to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons. This area is known as a chemosensitive area, and the neurons are called chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are in close contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Central chemoreceptors are connected with respiratory centers, paicularly the dorsal respiratory group of neurons through synapses. These chemoreceptors act slowly but effectively. Central chemoreceptors are responsible for 70% to 80% of increased ventilation through chemical regulatory mechanisms. Main stimulant for central chemoreceptors is the increased hydrogen ion concentration. However, if hydrogen ion concentration increases in the blood, it cannot stimulate the central chemoreceptors because the hydrogen ions from blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. On the other hand, if carbon dioxide increases in the blood, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the interstitial fluid of the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid. There, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. Since carbonic acid is unstable, it immediately dissociates into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. CO2 + H2O - H2CO3 - H+ + HCO3- Hydrogen ions stimulate the central chemoreceptors. From chemoreceptors, the excitatory impulses are sent to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, resulting in increased ventilation (increased rate and force of breathing). Because of this, excess carbon dioxide is washed out and respiration is brought back to normal. Lack of oxygen does not have a significant effect on the central chemoreceptors, except that it generally depresses the overall function of the brain. Ref: Sembulingam - physiology 7th edition",A

He can be managed by,Intercostal cryoanalgesia,I.V fentanyl,Oral morphine,Oral brufen,"Orotracheal intubation Patients with severe maxillofacial trauma and with low Sp02 even on oxygen suggests severe airway compromise or obstruction. In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in ""emergency airways management"". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. The better option of intubation in this patient is orotracheal intubation. The ideal management in this patient is cricothyroidotomy.

Which of the following statements about prostaglandins is true?,They are precursors to arachidonic acid,They release arachidonic acid from membranes through the action of phospholipase A,They were first observed to cause uterine contraction and lowering of blood pressure,"Although found in many organs, they are synthesized only in the prostate and seminal vesicles","Although prostaglandins were originally isolated from prostate glands, seminal vesicles, and semen, their synthesis in other organs has been amply documented; indeed, few organs have failed to demonstrate prostaglandin release. Prostaglandins cause platelet aggregation, smooth-muscle contraction, vasodilation, and uterine contraction. Prostaglandins are synthesized from arachidonic acid, a 20-carbon fatty acid with interspersed carbon double bonds. Signals such as angiotensin II, bradykinin, epinephrine, and thrombin can activate phospholipase A2 and release arachidonic acid from membrane lipids. The arachidonic acid is cyclized by cyclooxygenase to form prostaglandins. Arachidonic acid can also be oxidized to leukotrienes by the action of lipoxygenases.",C

Option 2 Satisfactory speech following surgical repair of cleft palate is achieved in 70-90% of cases. Significant speech defects usually require secondary operations when the child is older. The most widely used technique is the pharyngeal flap operation, in which the palatopharyngeal space is reduced by attaching a flap of posterior pharyngeal muscle and mucosa to the soft plate. This permits voluntary closure of the velopharyngeal complex and thus avoids hypernasal speech. Option 3 Eustachian tube dysfunction plays a central role in pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in babies and children born with a cleft palate.

Treatment of choice for asymptomatic pseudocyst pancreas is?,Marsupialisation,Conservative,Drainage,Cystogastrostomy,"ANSWER: (B) ConservativeREF: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 56Recent reports have shown that many pseudocysts eventually resolve without complications. Intervention is not mandatory in all cases unless the pseudocysts areSymptomaticEnlargingAssociated with complications.The likelihood that a pseudocyst will resolve spontaneously, however, is dependent on its size. Large pseudocysts (i.e., >6 cm in diameter) are more likely to become symptomatic either because they are tender or because of their mass effect on adjacent organs Symptomatic or enlarging pseudocysts can be treated by several methods:Those in the tail can be treated by excision (i.e., distal pancreatectomy), but excision in the setting of recent acute inflammation maybe hazardous.Most patients who develop symptomatic pseudocysts are best managed by pseudocyst drainage.In poor surgical risk patients, percutaneous catheter drainage can be considered.Internal drainage can be accomplished either endoscopically (by transpapillary drainage, cystogastrostomy, or cystoduodenostomy) or surgically (by cystogastrostomy, cystoduodenostomy, or Roux-en-Y cystojejunostomy).Pseudocysts that are directly adjacent to either the stomach or duodenum can be safely drained endoscopically if there are no intervening vessels. After endoscopic ultrasound and preliminary aspiration of the cyst fluid to confirm the diagnosis and exclude intervening vessels, endoscopic drainage is achieved by making an incision into the pseudocyst through the wrall of the stomach or duodenum.Transpapillary drainage might be more appropriate for patients with pancreatic head pseudocysts",B

"A 56-year-old male presents with the sudden onset of excruciating pain. He describes the pain as beginning in the anterior chest, radiating to the back, and then moving downward into the abdomen. His blood pressure is found to be 160/115. Your differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction; however, no changes are seen on ECG, and you consider this to be less of a possibility. You obtain an x-ray of this patient's abdomen and discover a ""double-barrel"" aoa. This abnormality most likely results from",A microbial infection,Loss of elastic tissue in the media,A congenital defect in the wall of the aoa,Atherosclerosis of the abdominal aoa,"Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aoa. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypeension and Marfan's syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aoa, just above the aoic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aoa itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of aeries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aoa and may lead to luetic hea disease by producing insufficiency of the aoic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular aeries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aoa.",B

True about branchial anomaly :,Cysts are more common than sinuses,For sinuses surgery is not always indicated,Cysts present with dysphagia and hoarseness of voice,Most commonly due to 2nd branchial remnant,"Branchiogenic Anomalies 

Branchial anomalies are remnants of the branchial apparatus present during the embryonic life.
Embryologically the structures of head and neck are derived from 5 pairs of branchial arches, their intervening clefts externally and pouches internally.
A tract of branchial origin may form a complete fistula, or one end may be obliterated to form an external or internal sinus, or both ends may resorb forming a cyst.
2nd branchial remnant are the most common
Ist branchial remnants are typically located in front or back of the ear or in the upper neck in the region of the mandible. Fistulas typically commence through the parotid gland and end in the external auditory canal.
2nd branchial cleft remnants cause fistulas/sinuses with an external opening along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal opening at the tonsillar fossa (The fistulous track passes in b/w internal & external carotid arteries)
3rd branchial cleft remnants usually do not have associated sinuses or fistulas and are located in the suprasternal notch or clavicular region. These most often contain cartilage and present clinically as a firm mass or as a subcutaneous abscess. Rarely sinus may occur which open internally into the pyriform sinus.
Branchiogenic anomalies occur with equal frequency on each side of the neck and 15% are bilateral.

Clinical presentation

By definition, all branchial remnants are present at the time of birth although they may not become clinically evident until later in life.
Fistulas and sinus present at birth whereas cysts usually appear in late childhood and adults.
Fistulas and sinuses usually discharge a mucoid or purulent material
The cysts are characteristically found anterior and deep to the upper third of the sternocleidomastoid (interior to the angle of mandible)
Sinuses and cysts are prone to become repeatedly infected producing cellulitis and abscess formation.

Treatment

Almost all branchial abnormalities should be excised early in life since repeated infection is common making resection more difficult.
Complete removal of the cyst and tract is necessary for a cure and preventing recurrence.
A series of two or sometimes three small transverse incisions in a ""stepladder' fashion is preferred to a long oblique incision in the neck, which is cosmetically undesirable.",D
Better prognostic factor for operation of biliary duct obstruction in newborn are -,No passage of bile,Size of ductule > 200 micron,Weight of baby > 3 kg,Preterm baby,"Answer (b) Size of ductule > 200 micron Surgical treatment of biliary atresia Pooenterostomy or Kasai's operation is the surgery of choice. The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate the flow of bile into the intestine. It is based on the observation that the fibrous tissue at the pa hepatitis invests microscopically patent biliary ductules that in turn communicates with the intrahepatic ductal system. Transecting this fibrous tissue, opens these channels and establishes bile flow into a surgically constructed intestinal conduit, using a Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum. Liver transplantation is done in those, who fail to respond to Pooenterostomy. About prognostic factors for successful outcome of the Kasai operation, we have consulted many books including books on Pediatric Surgery. The maximum information we could get was from CSDT, Maingot's and Schwaz. The prognostic factors are: a) Age of operation - a better prognosis is achieved with age less than 60 days (8 weeks given in 8th edition of Schwaz). b) Absence of cirrhosis - checked by bridging liver fibrosis on biopsy. c) Diameter of bile ductules at the poal plate - ductules greater than 150 gm in diameter are associated with good chances of bile drainage (- Maingot 10/e, p 2123) d) Establishment of adequate bile flow e) Cholangitic episodes - postoperative cholangitic episodes are associated with bad prognosis.",B

Dumping syndrome is associated with-,Reduction of part of stomach,Decreased gastric secretion,Hyperglycemia,Decreased absorption,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reduction of part of stomach Dumping syndrome -o Symptom complex that occurs following ingestion of a meel wrhen part of stomach has been removed or the pyloric sphincter mechanism has been disrupted.o Dumping syndrome refers to a constellation of post-prandial symptoms occuring due to accelerated emptying (dumping) of hyperosmolar stomach contents into the small bowel.o It is usually seen in operation which destroy the pyloric sphincter (i.e. gastrectomy, antrectomy and drainage procedures). It also affects a small percentage of patients with highly selective vagotomy due to loss of receptive relaxation of stomach.o It is of 2 typesEarly dumping syndromeIt occurs immediately after meals (after about 15 to 30 min)Dumping of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel results in rapid fluid influx from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to acute intestinal distention and peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation.This gives rise to vasomotor & abdominal symptoms : epigastric fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, diarrhoea.Symptoms can be ameliorated by lying down or saline infusion.Late dumping syndromeIt is seen late - 2 to 3 hrs after mealOccurs due to reactive hypoglycemia. The carbohyrate load in the small bowrel causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn, causes high insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia leads to hypoglycemia.Symptoms are relieved by administration of sugar,o ManagementDietary managmentDiet therapy is done to reduce jejunal osmolalityMultiple small mealsFood low in carbohydrate and rich in fat and protein are taken.Liquids during meals should be avoided.Somatostatin analogues (octreotide)Diet therapy is usually successful but if it fails, the patient is started on octreotide.SurgeryMost of the patients improve with time, dietary management and Octreotide. Only rarely surgery is needed,Surgical procedures used to treat dumping arePyloric reconstruction, takedown of gastrojejunostomy, interposition of a 10 cm reversed intestinal segment between the stomach & duodenum, conversion of Billroth II to Billroth I anastomosis, and conversion to Roux-en-Y-anastomosis.",A

Common complication of acute & chronic pancreatitis -,Portalvein thrombosis,Pancreatic abscess,Pseudocyst,Pancreatic head mass,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Pseudocyst "" Pseudocysts occur in up to 10% of patients with acute pancreatitis, and in 20 to 38% of patients with chronic pancreatitis, and thus, they comprise the most common complication of chronic pancreatitis "",-- Schwartz 9/e pi200Pancreatic Pseudocysto Pancreatic pseudocyst is collection of pancreatic fluid surrounded by a nonepithelialized wall of granulation tissue and fibrosis.o Most common cause of pancreatic pseudocyst is Pancreatitis (90%)The second most common cause is trauma (10%).o Pseudocysts are seen in both acute and chronic pancreatitis.o Most common causes of acute pancreatitis in children include:Blunt abdominal injuries,Mumps and other viral illnessesCongenital anomalieso Management of Pancreatic Pseudocvsto A pancreatic pseudocvst may resolve spontaneously so it is followed with serial ultrasound studies,o Indications of Surgical intervention: (Ref: Bailey and Love 25/e 1145; CSDT 13/ep583; Harrison 17/e p)Age of cyst more than 12 weeks without resolutionSize of cyst greater than 6 cm.Symptomaticiv) Development of complications (eg. haemorrhage, perforation, g.i. obstruction)But note that these indications for intervention arejust a generalization usedfor teaching the undergraduates. These are not specific indications for interventions.Therapeutic interventions are advised (irrespective of size and duration) whenThe pseudocyst is symptomatic orIncreasing is size on follow up studies, orAny complication (rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess) arise orThere is suspicion of malignancy.Thus expectan t management is adequate (irrespective of size) if the patient is asymptomatic and serial u/s studies show that the cyst is resolving,o Surgical methodsInternal Drainage: most preferred surgical management in uncomplicated pseudocyst is internal drainage. The three options are :CystojejunostomyCystogastrostomyCystoduodenostomyInternal drainage can be done either open surgical or laparoscopic or by percutaneous catheter-based methods (transgastric puncture and stent placement to create a cystogastrostomy)Excision of Pseudocvst - Is hardly done and is usually limited to pseudocyst involving the tail of the pancreas.External drainage-Is done in:-Infected pseudocystFor immature pseudocyst with thin nonfibrous walls that does not allow safe internal drainage.In an unstable pt. in whom more complex surgical intervention is precluded.Transp a pillary pancreatic duct stent: Because pseudocysts often communicate with the pancreatic ductal system, two newer approaches to pseudocyst management are based on main duct drainage, rather than pseudocyst drainage per se.A stent is passed into the pseudocyst through the papilla of Vater. this drainage, particularly when incomplete, can allow bacteria to enter the pseudocyst and lead to development of an infected pseudocyst.Another transpapillary approach involves placing a stent across the duct defect rather than into the cyst through the defect. By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).",C

Which one is Not true regarding carotid body tumour,Unilateral,Surgical resection is the t/t,Non cromaffin paraganglioma,None,"Ans is None Carotid body tumor (also k/a) chemodectoma or potato tumor) The tumor arises from the chemoreceptor cells* on the medial side of carotid bulb Histologically it is a non-chromaffin paraganglioma* There is an association with pheochromocytoma* Although chronic hypoxemia has been invoked as a stimulus for hyperplasia of carotid body, approximately 35% of carotid body tumors are hereditary. Approximately 5 to 7% of carotid body tumors are malignant. The risk of malignancy is greatest in young patients with familial tumors. Clinical features Usually unilateral* Present most commonly in the 5th decade* and approximately 10% have family history. The pt. often presents with a long history of several years of a slowly enlarging painless lump* at the carotid bifurcation. The mass is firm, rubbery, pulsatile and is mobile from side to side but not up and down, and can sometimes be emptied by firm pressure, after which it will slowly refill in pulsatile manner. A bruit may also be present. Investigation Doppler study Carotid angiogram FNAC & biopsy are Ca Treatment Because these tumors rarely metastasize and their overall rate of growth is slow, the need for surgical removal must be considered carefully as complication of surgery are potentially serious. The operation is best avoided in elderly patients. Schwaz 8/e writes - ""The treatment of choice of carotid body tumors is surgical excision.

Which of the following is the most useful imaging modality to evaluate the cause of his infeility ?",Colour duplex ultrasonography of the scrotum,Transrectal ultrasonography,"Retrograde urethrogr, aphy",Spermatic venography,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Transrectal ultrasonography First lets briefly review the anatomy of male internal genitalia Sperms are produced in testes and then stored and mature within the epididymis. Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large pa of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an impoant pa of infeility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests - seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests -+ either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

Commonest complication of celiac plexus block is,Bradycardia,Hypotension,Seizures,Retroperitoneal hematoma,"Celiac plexus is a sympathetic ganglion thus blocking it will always cause hypotension. The celiac plexus is the largest plexus of the sympathetic nervous system. It contains preganglionic sympathetic fibers from greater and lesser splanchnic nerves (emerge from the thoracic sympathetic ganglia, T5 to T12) as well as postganglionic sympathetic and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers. It provides sensory innervation and sympathetic outflow to stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney and GI tract up to splenic flexure. Plexus is located at the level of T12-L2 (usually L1) and lies anterior to aoa in the retroperitoneal space. Indications Most common indication is treatment of pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Occasionally used in the treatment of pain from chronic pancreatitis (controversial). Can be used for pain from other GI malignancies from LES to splenic flexure, as well as liver, spleen and kidneys. Complications Ohostatic hypotension (most common, can be minimized with fluid hydration) and diarrhea (secondary to blockade of sympathetic fibers). Less common complications include paraplegia (from damage to aery of Adamkiewicz), local anesthetic toxicity, spinal or epidural injection, aoic or vena cava puncture and bleeding, retroperitoeneal hemorrhage, visceral organ injury, and pneumothorax (if needle is placed too cephalad) Anatomical Considerations: preganglionic SNS (greater/lesser splanchnic nerves), postganglionic SNS, preganglionic PNS, sensory Indications: pancreatic cancer (common); sometimes pancreatitis (controversial) Common Side Effects: ohostatic hypotension, diarrhea Rare Side Effects: paraplegia, LA toxicity, spinal/epidural injection, aoic or vena cava puncture, retroperitoeneal hemorrhage, visceral organ injury, pneumothorax",B

Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax or pancreatitis. An elevated serum amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.

Obesity has a profound effect on overall health and life expectancy. The morbidly obese are predisposed to developing serious weight-related comorbidities, including hypeension, CAD, adult onset DM, sleep apnea and/or obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hypercoagulability, hyperlipidemia, and depression among others. Physiological abnormalities resulting from OSA include hypoxemia, hypercapnia, pulmonary and systemic vasoconstriction, and secondary polycythemia (from recurrent hypoxemia). These result in an increased risk of ischemic hea disease and cerebrovascular disease. Right ventricular failure can occur from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Obesity is now considered to be the second leading cause of preventable death behind cigarette smoking. The incidence of comorbidities and moalities is directly related to the degree of obesity. in a study with 12 year follow up, moalities rates for those weighing 50% over average weight were doubled. Moalities and morbidities is largely attributable to the comorbidities of obesity. Ref: Schwaz 9/e, Page 1743.",D

A cystic swelling is treated by aspiration and surgery is performed only if it recurs (can be reaspirated upto 3 times) or cytology is suspicious of malignancy. most of the discrete thyroid swelling are non-neoplastic and benign, still surgery is the mainstay of treatment because of the risk of leaving a malignant nodule. Even though cold nodule ours malignancy only a very small percentage of them turn out to be malignant, so isotope scanning is of very little use in distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant swellings and is rather obsolete now.

Best test for achalasia cardia-,Barium meal,Bariun meal follow through,Enteroclysis,Barium swallow',"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Barium swallow Achalasiao Achalasia cardia is a motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, & the esophageal body undergoes nonperistaltic contractions. (Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced).o The pathogenesis of Achlasia is poorly understood. It involves :Neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach's myentric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus)Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The clolinergic inner\>ation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease.o As a result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findingsBoth sexes are equally affected (Ref: Maingot's 10/e, p 846)May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.Regurgitation and Pulmonary-1 aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propuloine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.DiagnosisChest x-ray - show's absence ofgastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.Barium swallow - show's dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'birds' beak ' appearance. Fluoroscopy show's loss of normal peristalsis in the lower twro thirds of esophagus.Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achlasia eg. carcinoma, stricture at LES.Manometryo It's the most confrmatory investigation.o It is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophaguso Manometric characteristics of AchlasiaIncomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (< 75% relaxation)Elevated LES pressureLoss of primary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present.Increased intraesophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline.o Cholecystokinin (CCK) which normally causes a fall in the sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of the LES (the CCK test). This paradoxical response occurs because, in achlasia the neurallv transmitted inhibitory effect of CCK is absent owing to the loss of inhibitory neurons.Also know""Although complete absence of peristalsis in the esophageal body has been proposed as the major abnormality, present evidence indicates achlasia is a primary disorder of the LES'. __Schwartzo The LES fails to relax on deglutition, - elevation of intraluminal esophageal pressure - esophageal dilatation - subsequent loss of primary' peristalsis in the body of esophagus.",D

A child is posted for operative repair of exostrophy of bladder with renal failure. Which anesthetic should be preferred?,Pancuronium,Vecuronium,Ataracurium,Rocuronium,"C i.e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction.",B

Which of the following is TRUE about Zenker's diverticulum -,It is asymptomatic,Occurs in the mid-esophagus,Treatment is simple excision,It occurs in children,"Zenker's or Pharyngo-esophageal diverticula

Zenker's diverticula are mucosal outpouchings occurring through the triangular bare area (Killian's triangle) between the upper oblique fibres (also known as thyropharyngeus muscle) and lower horizontal fibres (also known as cricopharyngeus muscle) of the inferior constrictor muscle.
The underlying pathology is neuromuscular incoordination in this region 
Zenker's diverticulum is a pulsion diverticulum.
Esophageal Diverticula are of two types: pulsion & traction

In pulsion diverticulum, increased intraluminal pressures (secondary to abnormal esophageal motility) push the mucosa and submucosa through a muscular defect in the wall of the esophagus creating a pulsion diverticulum. It's not true diverticula (not containing all the layers of the esophageal wall)
In traction diverticula extraluminal forces (like inflammed & scarred peribronchial & mediastinal lymph nodes) pull the full thickness of the esophagus out, creating true diverticula.

Zenker's is the most common esophageal diverticula.
The diverticula arise posteriorly in the midline of the neck. The mouth of the diverticula is in the midline but the sac projects laterally (usually left laterally)
Zenker's diverticula are rarely seen below 30 yrs of age, most patients are over 50.
Dysphagia is the most common symptom.
Undigested food is regurgitated into the mouth, especially when the patient is in the recumbent position.
Swelling of the neck, gurgling noises after eating, halitosis (bad mouth odour) and a sour metallic taste in the mouth are common symptoms.
Barium swallow is diagnostic
Management (Maingot's 11/e chapter 8; Sabiston 18/e p1062; Schwartz 9/e p848)
Surgical therapy is the treatment of choice. Methods used are:


Cricopharyngeal myotomy - a myotomy alone is usually sufficient for small diverticula (<2cm).
Myotomy with Diverticulopexy

the larger diverticulum may be sutured in the inverted position to the prevertebral fascia using a permanent suture (i.e., diverticulopexy).
Diverticulopexy avoids the complication of infection due to leak from a resected diverticulum (diverticulectomy)

Myotomy with excision of sac - done for large (> 5 cm) diverticula

If the diverticulum is excessively large so that it would be redundant if suspended a diverticulectomy should be performed.

Diverticula-esophagostomy using a linear cutting staple gun

the septum between the esophagus and the diverticula  is divided also known as Dohlman procedure the advantage is that it takes less time to complete, does not require an incision, and therefore may have less morbidity. This is an important consideration since this disease most commonly presents in the elderly. 
This procedure is effective for diverticula >2 cm and may be impossible to perform for the small diverticulum. Sabiston writes- "" For these reasons, this technique has gained favour and is advocated in patients with diverticula between 2 and 5 cm.""",C
"A 35-year-old man presents with a bleeding duodenal ulcer documented by endoscopy. The patient is somewhat unstable, and bleeding does not stop despite transfusing 8 U of blood. What is the most appropriate surgical therapy?",Further blood transfusion alone,Oversewing the ulcer alone,Oversewing the ulcer and performing a gastrojejunostomy,Oversewing the ulcer and performing a vagotomy and pyloroplasty,"For the patient who is unstable and has a pyloric or duodenal ulcer, oversewing the ulcer and closing the pyloric incision as a pyloroplasty and performing a vagotomy is the procedure of choice because of its low operative mortality. However, this procedure carries a higher-recurrence rate. Major resections, such as antrectomy and subtotal gastrectomy are contraindicated in the unstable patient. At endoscopy biopsies for H. pylori should be taken and, if positive, treatment designed to eradicate H. pylori should be started. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the recurrence rate of bleeding.",D
Post-transplant cytomegalovirus infection may cause,Pyelonephritis,GI ulceration and hemorrhage,Cholecystitis,Intraabdominal abscess,"Overall, 30% of all infections contracted in the posttransplant period are viral. The most common viral infections are DNA viruses of the herpesvirus family and include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus. CMV infections may occur as either primary or reactive infections and have a peak incidence at about 6-week post-transplant. The classic signs include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukopenia. CMV infection can affect several organ systems and result in pneumonitis; ulceration and hemorrhage in the stomach, duodenum, or colon; hepatitis; esophagitis; retinitis; encephalitis; or pancreatitis. The risk of developing posttransplant CMV depends on donor-recipient serology, with the greatest risk in seronegative patients who receive organs from seropositive donors. Pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, intraabdominal abscesses, and parotitis are caused by bacterial infections or GI perforation and not primarily by CMV infection.",B

True regarding colovesical fistula is:,Commonly presents with pneumaturia,Barium enema is diagnostic,Common in females,May be a surgical complication,"Ref: l.

Sahiston Textbook of Surgery, 19th Edition, Pg: 1313.Explanation:""The most common presenting symptom of colovesical fistula is pneumaturia""About other optionsBarium enema is diagnostic - barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time.Common in females - more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder.May be a surgical complication - Colovesical fistulas can occur as a result of surgical complication, however it is rare. Iatrogenic Rectovesical fistula is more common.Hence, option A. commonly presents withpneumaturia appears more appropriate.Vesicoenteric fistulasIt commonly occurs in the setting of bowel disease, such as diverticulitis. colorectal carcinoma, and Crohn's disease.Less common causes include irradiation, infection, and trauma (external penetrating trauma as well as iatrogenic surgical trauma).Diverticulitis is the most common cause of colovesical fistula, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.Sigmoid-vesicular fistulas are more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder.Women with sigmoid fistulas have usually had a prior hysterectomyClinical featuresAlthough enterovesical fistulae are almost always secondary to extravesical pathology, they present with urinary symptomsThe MC presenting symptom is pneumaturia, (seen in 50% to 85% cases)Irritative voiding symptoms (in 70% to 90% cases)Fecaluria (20% to 68%) of patients with enterovesical fistulae and tends to be more common with diverticular and malignant fistulae.The classic presentation of vesicoenteric fistula is described as Gouverneur's syndrome and consists of suprapubic pain, urinary frequency, dysuria, and tenesmus.Other symptoms include hematuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary retention, perineal pain, hematochezia, and fever.Urine in the stool is rarely reported with enterovesical fistulae: these fistulae tend to be unidirectional with flow from the high-pressure intestinal tract to the low-pressure urinary tractInvestigationsThe most reliable test Computed Tomography (CT Scan), which may demonstrate air in the bladder ' .The triad of findings on CT that are suggestive of colovesical fistulaBladder wall thickening adjacent to a loop of thickened colonAir in the bladder (in the absence of previous lower urinary tract manipulation)Presence of colonic diverticula.A barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time, and an IV pyelogram is even less accurate.Cystoscopy usually reveals cystitis and bullous edema at the site of the fistula, but the test is helpful to exclude cancer (colon or bladder) as the cause of the fistula.ManagementNonoperative managementIn nontoxic, minimally symptomatic patients with nonmalignam causes of enterovesical fistulas, a trial of medical therapy including intravenous total parenteral nutrition bowel rest, and antibiotics may be warranted.This may be the preferred initial approach, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom the notion of immediate exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection is discouraged because of the chronic relapsing nature of the disease.Operative ManagementThe goal of operative management is to separate and close the involved organs with minimal anatomic disruption and normal long-term function of both systems.Both one- and tw o-stage procedures have been advocated, depending on the clinical circumstances.A one-stage procedure involves removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and primary reanastomosis of the bowel after resection of the involved bowel segment.A two-stage approach advocates removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and construction of a temporary proximal diverting colostomy, with a later return to the operating room for colostomy takedown once the fistula track is demonstrated to be closed.The choice of whether to proceed with a one- stage or two-stage repair is influenced by the location and cause of the fistula, the patient's general condition, the presence of a pelvic abscess, and the presence of colonic obstruction.Patients with an inflammatory cause of the fistula hut without gross contamination can be treated with a one-stage procedure, whereas those with unprepared bowel, gross contamination, or abscess may require a two-stage procedure.",A

Prologed Post-op ileus is best treated by,Long tube inseion,Calcium pentonthenate,Laporotomy and exploration,Peristaltic stimulants,"Answer is 'c' i.e. Laparotomy and exploration Most patients develop a transient ileus after a major abdominal operation. Most of these cases resolve within 3 to 5 days. Conditions like-extensive operative manipulation, major small bowel injury, heavy narcotic use, intraabdominal infection and pancreatitis - can prolong the ileus to 5 to 7 days. Ileus prolnged beyond this period is viewed with suspicion. Management of post op. ileus The essence of treatment is prevention, with the use of nasogastric suction and restriction of oral intake until bowel sounds and passage of flatus return. Electrolyte abnormality, if any is corrected. A battery of labroatory tests are conducted to look for primary cause, which if found is treated.

Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion. Surgery to release the pulley is done as a day case through a palmar incision under local anaesthetic. Cure rates approach 100%. Splinting for six weeks can decrease inflammation. This is an option for those wishing to avoid injections or surgery. Congenital triggering usually presents in the first year of life. The digit is locked in flexion or extension.

An intussusception is composed of three parts: the entering or inner tube; the returning or middle tube; and the sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens).# most common in children, where it occurs in an idiopathic form with a peak incidence at 3-9 months.# Seventy to 95% of cases are classed as idiopathic. It is believed that hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum may be the initiating event. This is due to weaning/viral infection.# Ileocolic type is otherwise most common and the colocolic variety is common in adults.# C/F: Intermittent sudden spasmodic abdominal pain, the 'red currant' jelly stool, palpable lump, feeling of emptiness in the right iliac fossa (the sign of Dance) and Empty RIF sign.# Ultrasonography is preferred over Barium enema today.# Ultrasound shows the mass with pseudokidney apperance or a target lesion or a bowel mass-like'doughnut sign.# A barium enema may diagnose by demonstrating signs like the claw sign and the coiled spring appearance.# Hydrostatic reduction is contraindicated in the presence of obstruction, peritonism or a prolonged history (greater than 48 hours) and is unlikely to succeed where a lead point is likely. It is successful in 50% of cases with a recurrence rate 5%.# Surgery is required where hydrostatic reduction has failed or is contraindicated. Reduction is achieved by squeezing the most distal part of the mass in a cephalad direction. Do not pull. In difficult cases the little finger may he gently inserted into the neck of the intussusception to try and separate adhesions (Cope's method).# In the presence of an irreducible or gangrenous intussusception the mass should be excised in situ and an anastomosis or temporary end stoma created.",A

What is the probable diagnosis?,Hypothermia,Pulmonary embolism,Massive fluid deficit,Myocardial depression due to anaesthetic agent,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. pulmonary embolism Ref: Miller's anesthesia 5th/e p1276First what is end tidal CO2The air exhaled during normal respiration initially consists of the dead space. Then a mixture of dead space air plus alveolar air comes out. The air coming out at the end consists purely of alveolar air.Measurement of concentration of gases in this alveolar air is useful for analysis. The CO2 concentration in the last 10ml. of tidal volume is known as end tidal CO2In pulmonary embolism the blood supply to certain parts of the lung is cut off due to the emboli in circulation. This reduces the exchange of gases between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, as a result the cone, of CO2 in alveolar air decreases (CO2 is carried from tissues to the lung by blood and is transferred to the alveoli in exchange of O2). The decrease in alveolar CO2 will lead to decrease in end tidal CO2.Other conditions in which end tidal CO2 decreasesIncrease in dead space (decrease in end tidal CO2 in pulmonary embolism can be explained by this also. Pulmonary embolism causes increase in physiological dead space hence decreases the end tidal CO2)HyperventilationMalignant hyperthermia.",B

It causes dual/ biphasic blockQ. It increases K. (ie hyperkalemiaQ 1/t diastolic cardiac arrest), intraocular & intragastric pressure and temperature (l/t) malignant Hypehermia)Q - Depolarizing block (phase I & II) caused by Succinyl cholineQ is also called Dual or Biphasic Block. In contrast to phase II depolarization block & Non depolarizing block, phase I depolarization block does not exhibit fade during tetanus or train-of-four, neither does it demonstrate post tetanic potentiation. Phase I block is potentiated by isoflurane, Mg, Li & Anticholine-esterase while phase II block is potentiated by enflurane. - The onset of paralysis by succinylcholine is signaled by visible motor unit contractions called fasciculation.Q Patients who have received suxamethonium have an increased incidence of postoperative myalgiaQ. This is more common in healthy female outpatients. Pregnancy & extremes of age seem to be protective. Succinylcholine releases a metabolite succinylmonocholine, causing excitation of the cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node resulting in bradycardia. Q Intravenous atropine is given prophylactically (paicularly in children, who are more susceptible) in children and always before a second dose of sch. - Prolonged apnea after suxamethonium is best managed by providing mechanical ventilation, maintaining anesthesia and continuous monitoring until muscle function returns to normal.Q Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is beneficial (as it provides pseudocholinesterase) its infectious risks outweigh its potential benefits -Morgan Administration of purified pseudocholinesterase, blood or plasma may antagonize the block. However because of the risk associated with their use, infusion of banked blood or fresh frozen plasma cannot be recommended - Churchill. - Succinylcholine & mivacurium are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while esmolol and remifentanyl are metabolized by RBC es terase.(2 - Pseudo cholinesterase deficiency causes prolonged residual paralysis at normal Sch dose (1-2 mg/kg)Q whereas, phase 2 non-depolarization blockade occurs after administration of higher doses >6 (7-10) mg/kgQ Despite large decrease in pseudo cholinesterase activity (level) there is only moderate increase in duration of action of Sch.

"In excessive burns, least useful is -",Blood,Dextran,Ringer lactate,Nasogastric intubation,"We know that Ringer's lactate is the preferred agent during initial 24 hrs.

Dextran is a colloid and can be used in 2nd 24 hrs., however albumin is the preferred and most widely used colloid.
Blood has also role in burn patient.
The need for Blood replacement is significant in extensive burns. Besides injury to red blood cells and their decreased half-life resulting in their early destruction, many patients may be anaemic. Hence, repeated and frequent transmission to maintain a hematocrit around 35% is necessary.
Schwartz 9/e p201 writes- ""The role of blood transfusion in burns has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years. A large multicenter study found that increased numbers of transfusions were associated with
increased infections and a higher mortality rate in burn patients, even when correcting for burn severity. A follow-up study implanting a restrictive transfusion policy in burned children showed that a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL had no more adverse outcomes versus a traditional transfusion trigger of 10 g/dL.
These data, in concert with other reported complications such as transfusion-related lung injury, have led to recommendations that blood transfusions be used only when there is an apparent physiologic need.""",A

A 40 year old dental assistant presents with increased weakness and fatigue. Lab tests reveal megaloblastic anemia. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the presence of anemia?,Propofol,Nitrous oxide,Lignocaine,Halothane,"Answer: b) Nitrous oxideNITROUS OXIDE (laughing gas)Has second gas effect during induction & diffusion hypoxia after discontinuation of anesthesia in recovery phase.As N2O is used in high concentration (70-80%) it leads to entry of N2O in blood at a rate higher than minute (1 lit/min) volume.N2O has low blood solubility. So it rapidly diffuse into alveoli & dilutes the alveolar air-Partial Pressure of O2 in alveoli is reduced i.e. diffusion hypoxiaDiffusion hypoxia is prevented by administering 100% oxygen for 5-10 min after discontinuing N2OPoynting effect: Entonox (50% O2 & 50% N2O) & mixture of gases (O2 & N2O) keeps them in gaseous form.If another potent anesthetic eg. Halothane is added, it also will be delivered to the blood at a rate higher than minute volume & the induction will be faster.N2O is a good analgesic but weak anaesthetic and poor muscle relaxant. Hence it is not a complete anaesthetic.N2O has blood gas coefficient of 0.47 and has fast inductionIt has MAC value of 104; Hence Potency is lowN2O is used as a carrier gas given in a mixture of 33% O2 and 66% N2OContraindications for N2O:Middle ear surgeries and tympanoplastyLaparoscopic surgeriesAcute intestinal obstruction and volvulusMicrolaryngeal surgeriesPneumothorax, pneumoperitoniumEye surgeriesPneumoencephalos.It should be avoided in patients with pulmonary hypertensionAdverse effects: bone marrow depression (agranulocytosis, megaloblastic anemia) and even neurological deficiencies (peripheral neuropathies and pernicious anemia).NOTE:Nitrous oxide is one of the most common anesthetics used in dental procedures. Prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide results in the development of megaloblastic anemia.Mechanism: Nitrous oxide oxidizes the cobalt in methylcobalamin to produce physiologically inactive B12.The resultant deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia. Severe forms even present with myelosuppression and sub-acute combined degeneration.Side effects of nitrous oxide:Methylcobalamin deficiencyPneumothorax and pneumoperitoneumMethemoglobinemia.",B

Midazolam may be administered by mouth,parenterally, or the intranasal or endorectal route in children; preservative free intrathecal midazolam has been used for postoperative analgesia in caesarean section delivery. It has been postulated that a possible mechanism for the anti-emetic effect of miazolam could be an action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone reducing synthesis, release and postsynaptic effect of dopamine.

Incisional biopsy of a breast mass in a 3 5-year-old woman demonstrates a hypercellular fibroadenoma (Cystosarcoma phyllodes) at the time of frozen section. Appropriate management of this lesion could include,Wide local excision with a rim of normal tissue,Lumpectomy and axillary lymph- adenectomy,Modified radical mastectomy,Excision and postoperative radiotherapy,"Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a tumor most often seen in younger women. It can grow to enormous size and at times ulcerate through the skin. Still, it is a lesion with low propensity toward metastasis. Local recurrence is common, especially if the initial resection was inadequate. Simple re-excision with adequate margins is curative. Very large lesions may necessitate simple mastectomy to achieve clear margins. Axillary lymphadenectomy, however, is seldom indicated without biopsy-positive demonstration of tumor in the nodes. The low incidence of metastatic disease suggests that adjunctive therapy is indicated only for known metastatic disease, even when the tumors are quite large and ulcerated.",A

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment in the management of this patient?",10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate,0.25 mg digoxin every 3 hours for 3 doses,100 mg lidocaine,Emergent hemodialysis,"The electrocardiogram demonstrates changes that are essentially diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. Correct treatment for the affected patient includes discontinuation of exogenous sources of potassium, administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the myocardial effects of potassium), and administration of sodium bicarbonate (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium-potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy, given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would be not only ineffective but contraindicated, since they would fuher depress the myocardial conduction system.",A

Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. Xe did not affect voltage-gated Ca2+ currents and caused minimal inhibition of transient outward K+ currents in human atrial myocytes in vitro.

Any metabolic acidosis should be seen to be correcting. There-after, one must try to maintain normovolaemia. This is a continuous process. Critically ill patients may have capillary leak and will therefore have a continuing colloid requirement. Gelatins, being small molecules, are poorly retained and can be replaced by hydroxyethyl starch, plasma or blood at this stage. In sepsis this requirement may be very large . The impoance of blood in immediate resuscitation, the threshold at which one should transfuse urgently (i.e. con-sider using group compatible, uncross-matched blood or even Group 0 blood) and even the target haemoglobin level are controversial.

"In which of the following transmission, meiosis occurs:",Primary to secondary spermatocyte,Secondary spermatocyte to globular spermatid,Germ cells to spermatogonium,Spermatogonium to primary spermatocyte,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Primary to secondary spermatocyte Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes to the haploid number of 23 (from diploid number 46). It takes place in germ cells only; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell divisions, meiosis I & meiosis II.The first mitotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23).The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell.Steps of spermatogenesisSpermatogenesis which begins at puberty is the process which converts spermatogonia into mature sperms or spermatozoa.At or shortly before puberty, primordial germs cells in the seminiferous tubules, divide mitotically into spermatogoniaI stem cells.

All are used in hyperkalemia except,50 ml of 50% dextrose,Sodium bicarbonate,Salbutamol,Salbutamol,50 ml of 50% dextrose Dextrose alone It was earlier believed that administration of dextrose alone can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin releases. The administration of hypeonic dextrone alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons. - Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. Sodium Biarbonate Sodium bicarbonate was earlier believed to cause movement of potassium inside the cells. It has now been demonstrated that Na Bicarbonate does not cause movement of potassium inside the cells even when infused for 4-6 hrs. Instead. - Sodium bicarbonate causes excretion of potassium from the body. When sodium bicarbonate is administered at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine it enhances urinary K+ excretion.

"In trauma, which of the following is increased -",Epinephrine,ACTH,Glucagon,All,"Answer is 'a' i.e. Epinephrine; 'b' i.e. ACTH ; 'c' i.e. Glucagon As already mentioned in one of the previous questions, the neuroendocrine response to injury is an impoant pa of the stress response. The release of various hormones, creates an altered metabolic state which helps the individual to survive through the injury or the adverse circumstances. The neuroendocrine response begins with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hypothalmic activation leads to - ADH (or vasopressin) release from the neurohypophysis epinephrine secretion from the adrenal medulla norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings - CRH travels to adenohypophysis, stimualting ACTH production. ACTH acts on adrenal coex, producing coisol release (ACTH also stimulates release of aldosterone from the adrenal coex) About other hormones Insulin - hormones and inflammatory mediators associated with stress response inhibit insulin release. This is required to achieve the hyperglycemic state after injury. Glucagon - increased Aldosterone - increased Thyroid hormones : Thyroxine-no change; T3 - decreased 3 - increased Sex hormones - decreased",D

All are false about N20 except?,Least potent,Good muscle relaxant,Lighter than air,No diffusion hypoxia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Least potent Nitrous oxide N2Q It is colourless, odourless, heavier than air, nonirritating and noninflammable gas. o It is also called laughing gas. MAC is 105% (least potent) - even pure N20 at 1 atmospheric pressure can not produce adequate anaesthesia. o It has good analgesic but poor muscle relaxant activity. It is supplied under pressure in blue coloured steel cyclinders. It has very low blood solubility --> induction is quick and smooth with rapid recovery. Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia occur with N20 only. N20 is generally used as a carrier and adjuvant to other anaesthetics --> A mixture of 70% N20 + 25 - 30% 02+ 0.2 - 2% another potent anaesthetic is employed for most of the surgical procedures. Entonox is a mixture of 50% N20 and 50% 02. It has little effect on respiration, hea and BP. It can cause bone marrow depression and vit B12 deficiency. N20 is the only anaesthetic repoed to produce hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity with long term administration. Both toxicities are the result of the interaction of N20 with vit B12. Complete bone marrow failure can be expected after several days of continuous exposure. Bone marrow changes are preventable by pretreating patients with large doses of folinic acid.

The chemotherapy drug fluorouracil undergoes a series of chemical changes in vivo that result in a covalent complex such that it is bound to both thymidylate synthase and methylene-tetrahydrofolate. The inhibition of deoxythymidilate formation and subsequent blockage of cell division is due to,Allosteric inhibition,Competitive inhibition,Irreversible inhibition,Noncovalent inhibition,"Since rapidly multiplying cancer cells are dependent upon the synthesis of deoxythymidilate (dTMP) from deoxyuridylate (dUMP), a prime target in cancer therapy has been inhibition of dTMP synthesis. The anticancer drug fluorouracil is conveed in vivo to fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), which is an analogue of dUMP. FdUMP irreversibly forms a covalent complex with the enzyme thymidylate synthase and its substrate N5,N10-methylene- tetrahydrofolate. This is a case of suicide inhibition, where an enzyme actually paicipates in the change of a substrate into a covalently linked inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits its catalytic activity.",C

Upper Lid Retractors include,Muller muscle and superior rectus,Levator palpabrae superioris and superior oblique,Superior oblique and superior rectus,Levator palpabrae superioris & muller muscle,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Levator palpabrae superioris & muller muscle The levator palpebrae superioris is the impoant upper eye lid retractor. Injury or weakness to this muscle leads to ptosis. This muscle is supplied by occulomotor (3') nerve. Deep pa of the elevator muscle is the Muller's muscle, which is sympathetically innvervated. In hypehyroidism, sensitization of the Muller muscle leads to upper eyelid retraction and pseudoproptosis. On the other hand, in Horner's syndrome loss of this muscle action leads to ptosis.

Pilonidal disease
Pilonidal disease consists of a hair-containing abscess or chronic sinus, occurring in the intergluteal cleft.
It is an acquired disease
Although earlier it was thought to be a congenital disease, it is now considered to be an acquired infection of natal cleft hair follicles. The hair follicles become infected and rupture into the subcutaneous tissues to form a pilonidal abscess. Hair from surrounding skin is pulled into the abscess cavity by the friction generated by the gluteal muscles during walking.
More common in males
The incidence of pilonidal disease is more common in males (3:1 male: female ratio) between ages 15 & 40 with peak incidence between 16 & 20 yrs.
Pilonidal ds is more common in people with more body hair (hirsute). The ds. is almost rare in persons with less body hair.
Treatment of choice is surgery
Pilonidal sinus should be excised along with the secondary openings. (But only after controlling acute infection).
Acute pilonidal abscesses and sinus ds can be managed by simple incision and drainage (under local anesthesia).",B

Treatment of Simple rib fracture includes following EXCEPT,Analgesics,Physiotherapy,Early ambulation,Strapping of chest,"Ans. d. (Strapping of chest) (Ref Bailey and Love 25th/343)Localised rib fracture due to direct trauma. A simple rib fracture may be serious in elderly people or in those with chronic lung disease who have little pulmonary reserve. Uncomplicated fractures require sufficient analgesia to encourage a normal respiratory pattern and effective coughing. Oral analgesia may suffice but intercostal nerve blockade with local anesthesia may be very helpful. Chest strapping or bed rest is no longer advised and early ambulation with vigorous physiotherapy (and oral antibiotics if necessary) is encouraged. A chest radiograph is always taken to exclude an underlying pneumothorax. It is useful to confirm the skeletal injuries but routine chest radiography may miss rib fractures. However, once a pneumothorax and major skeletal injuries are excluded, the management is the same - the local control of chest pain.THE COMPONENTS OF CHEST INJURY IN BLUNT TRAUMAMajor chest wall traumaa. Flail chest: This occurs when several adjacent ribs are fractured in two places either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum. The flail segment moves paradoxically, that is, inwards during inspiration and outwards during expiration, thereby reducing effective gas exchange. The net result is poor oxygenation from injury to the underlying lung parenchyma and paradoxical movement of the flail segment. This creates a right-to-left shunt and prevents full saturation of arterial blood. In the absence of any other injuries and, if the segment is small and not embarrassing respiration, the patient may be nursed on a high-dependency unit with regular blood gas analysis and good analgesia until the flail segment stabilises. In the more severe case, endotracheal intubation is required with positive pressure ventilation for up to 3 weeks, until the fractures become less mobile. Thoracotomy with fracture fixation is occasionally appropriate if there is an underlying lung injury to be treated at the same time. An anterior flail segment with the sternum moving paradoxically with respiration can be stabilised by internal fixation but operative management is not usual for either.b. First rib fracturec. Fractures of the sternum.d. Vertebraee. Pleuraf. Traumatic pneumothoraxg. Continuing blood loss in excess of 200 mL/hour may require urgent thoracotomy within the first few hours.h. Lung contusion.It is important to prevent infection of the underlying lung by early mobilisation (if the patient's condition permits), prophylactic antibiotics, suction drainage and physiotherapy.MANAGEMENT OF BLUNT CHEST TRAUMAMost chest injuries where the heart is not injured are managed conservatively with underwater seal drainage if necessary, and oxygen and physiotherapy to help the patient to expectorate while the underlying lung parenchyma heals. In about 10 per cent of cases a thoracotomy is required. The indications for thoracotomy following blunt thoracic trauma are the following:# 50--1000 mL of blood at the time of initial drainage is common and may need no further action, but greater volumes, especially if the blood is fresh, require intervention;# continued brisk bleeding (>100 mL/15 minutes) from the intercostal drains indicates a serious breach of the lung parenchyma and urgent exploration is required;# continued bleeding of >200 mL/hour for 3 or more hours may require thoracotomy under controlled conditions;# rupture of the bronchus, aorta, esophagus or diaphragm;# cardiac tamponade (if needle aspiration is unsuccessful).All explorations following trauma should have double-lumen tube endotracheal intubation to facilitate surgery on the injured side and to protect the undamaged lung.",D

D: Recurrent dislocation of shoulder A Hill-Sachs lesion usually results from recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation with resultant posterolateral humeral head compression fracture as the humeral head comes to rest against the anteroinferior pa of the glenoid. It is often associated with a Banka lesion of the glenoid (stripping of the glenoidal labrum along with the periosteum from the anterior surface of the glenoid and scapular neck). Plain film Best seen following re-location of the joint, and better appreciated on internal rotation views. It appears as a sclerotic veical line running from the top of the humeral head towards the shaft. If large then a wedge defect may be evident. CT and MRI Both MRI and CT are very sensitive to this lesion, which appears as a region of flattening or a wedge shaped defect (with bone marrow oedema on MRI acutely) seen involving the posterolateral humeral head above the level of the coracoid. This is usually seen in the most superior few slices, were the humeral head should be rounded. It is impoant to note that below the level of the coracoid the humeral head normally flattens out posterolaterally, and this should not be misinterpreted as a Hill-Sachs lesion",D

What is the concentration of oxygen supplied by oxygen concentrator:-,90% and 96%,100%,30 and 60%,60% and 90%,"oxygen concentrator They are also known as pressure swing adsorbers. They can be considered as an alternative to a traditional supply where no reliable liquid oxygen supply is available, such as an off-shore site or a site where the safety criteria for liquid installations cannot be met. These devices can be small, designed to supply oxygen to a single patient or they can be large enough to supply oxygen for a medical gas pipeline system. The components of this system are: Duplex compressors and molecular sieves, receivers, dryers, vacuum pumps, filters, line pressure regulators, control system, oxygen performance monitoring system and back up cylinder manifold. Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of adsorbing (under pressure) other gases in the atmosphere onto the surface of an adsorbent material, known as zeolite. Because oxygen is not adsorbed by the zeolite, it is free to pass through into the storage for use. Zeolite is hydrated aluminium silicates of the alkaline eah metals in a powder or granular form. The zeolite is sealed in a vessel known as sieve bed. The sieve beds operate in pairs, one adsorbs whilst the other regenerates. Ambient air is filtered and pressurised to about 137 kPa by a compressor and then exposed to a zeolite molecular sieve column, forming a very large surface area, at a ceain pressure. The sieve selectively retains nitrogen and other unwanted components of air. These are released into the atmosphere after heating the column and applying a vacuum. The changeover between the columns is made by a time switch. The process is capable of producing oxygen concentrations of about 95%. The remainder is made up of mainly argon with a small percentage of nitrogen. During closed circuit anaesthesia, argon accumulation could occur. Therefore, to avoid this, higher fresh gas flows are required. As the process generates a great deal of heat, hence ventilation and cooling are mandatory. If the plant fails, the emergency cylinder manifold will feed into the pipeline at higher concentrations (99.5%) than the plant's operating norm of 95%. This may have an effect on down line equipment, paicularly in the critical care areas. This low-flow (2-4 L/min), low-pressure system can provide continuous oxygen to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. A typical unit operates on mains supply and can provide up to 5 L/min of oxygen at a concentration of 94%. It can be piped around the home in small wall mounted outlets .",A

MCN: MC cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.
Frequently seen in young women, mean age 5th decade.
More common in the body and tail of the pancreas.

Pathology

MCNs contain mucin-producing epithelium, macrocystic.
Histology: Presence of mucin-rich cells and ovarian-like stroma.
Estrogen and progesterone staining are positive in most cases.

Clinical Features

Incidental MCN is becoming increasingly common.
Up to 50% of patients present with vague abdominal pain.
A history of pancreatitis may be found in up to 20% of patients, which explains the common misdiagnosis of pseudocyst.

Diagnosis

CT scan: Presence of a solitary cyst with fine septations and rim of calcification.
Cross-sectional imaging may not be able to distinguish between benign and malignant MCNs.
Presence of eggshell calcification, larger tumor size, or a mural nodule on cross-sectional imaging is suggestive of malignancy.
Cyst fluid analyses: Mucin-rich aspirate, high CEA and low amylase levels.
These fluid analyses provide accurate diagnosis in up to 80% of cases.

Treatment

Exclusion of malignancy can’t be obtained by biopsy alone, so surgical excision is indicated for all mucinous cystic neoplams, because extensive histological sampling is required for confirmation.
Pancreatic resection is the standard treatment for MCNs.
In the absence of invasive malignancy, resection is curative and no further surveillance is required.",A

Index of potency of general anaesthesia -,Minimum alveolar concentration,Diffusion coefficient,Dead space concentration,Alveolar blood concentration,"Minimum alveolar concentration is defined as the alveolar concentration of an inhaled anesthetic agent that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized surgical stimulus. The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely propoional to its lipid solubility (oil: gas coefficient), in most cases. This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC.

True about laryngeal mask airway is?,Prevents aspiration,Used in oral surgeries,Used in laryngeal surgeries,Maintains airway,"ANSWER: (D) Maintains airwayREF: Ajay Yadav 2nd ed p. 36, Fundaments of anesthesia 3rd ed by Tim Smith Colin Pinnock Ted Lin page 29A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is an advanced airway device that is an acceptable alternative to the endotracheal tube (ETT). The LMA is composed of a tube with a cuffed mask- like projection at the end of the tube.The LMA was designed by British anaesthesiologist Archie Brain and is also known as Brains airway.'The LMA is usually suitable for minor oral surgeries only like tooth extractions but not for other oral and pharyngeal surgeries'1Advantages of LMAEasy to insertDoesn't require muscle relaxant and laryngoscope, can be inserted blindlyCan be inserted without interrupting CRPLeave the anaesthetist's hands free to manage other aspects of the anaestheticThey are not as stimulating as endotracheal tubes and will not traumatise the larynxDoesn't require any specific position of cervical spine so can be used in cervical spine injuriesDisadvantages of LMADoesn't prevent aspiration , so not used for full stomach patientsLMA does not replace the ETT (especially in longer cases and when protection from aspiration is important)However, they do not protect the airway from aspiration reliably, may become dislodged intraoperatively, and may cause as much sore throat as an endotracheal tube.Although they do not damage the larynx, the distension of the pharynx can (rarely) lead to temporary vocal cord palsy.",D
Anti-TPO antibodies are present in: September 2007,Reidel's thyroiditis,Grave's disease,Hashimotos thyroiditis,DeQuervain's thyroiditis,"Ans. C: Hashimotos thyroiditis Laboratory investigation of hypothyroidism: In the presence of suggestive symptoms and physical findings, a serum TSH test is needed for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, and it serves to assess the functional status of the thyroid. - This is a sensitive test of thyroid function; levels are invariably raised in hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in primary hypothyroidism of any cause. - The TSH level is also elevated in subclinical hypothyroidism and is usually the initial laboratory abnormality detected as the pituitary gland attempts to increase thyroid hormone production from the failing thyroid gland. The total T4 or free T4 usually remain within reference ranges in subclinical hypothyroidism. - The TSH level may also be elevated in the recovery phase of euthyroid sick syndrome. Medications that suppress TSH production include steroids, dopamine, dobutamine, and octreotide. A free T4 is usually needed to correctly interpret the TSH in some clinical settings. A low total T4 or free T4 level in the presence of an elevated TSH level fuher confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. When a total T4 study, rather than a free T4 study, is performed, a T3 resin uptake helps to correct the total T4 and T3 values for protein binding, especially thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) abnormalities, but the FT4 is typically the test of choice. T3 levels are most often maintained within reference ranges (even in the very late stages of hypothyroidism), and T3 measurement has little value in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies, typically anti-TPO (anti thyroid peroxidase) and also anti-Tg (anti-thyroglobulin) antibodies, delineates the cause of hypothyroidism as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or its variant. However, 10-15% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be antibody negative.",C

Fluoride levels which can cause renal toxicity is,Above 50 micromol/litre,Above 20 micromol/litre,Above 80 micromol/litre,Above 5 micromol/litre,"If a inhalational agent is highly metabolized and produces huge amount of fluoride it can cause nephrotoxicity. We need more than 50 micromol/litre of fluoride in blood to be nephrotoxic. Methoxyflurane is the most nephrotoxic among inhalational anesthetics- it causes polyuric renal failure due to a large amount of inorganic fluoride released, and it is no longer used in clinical practice. The renal toxicity of volatile anesthetics is due to their metabolic breakdown to free fluoride ions. The amount of fluoride ions produced: Methoxyflurane: 80uM Sevoflurane: 20-30 uM Enflurane: 20uM Isoflurane and desflurane: 5uMWhen compared to methoxyflurane, the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity among the newer inhaled anesthetics is due to lesser metabolic breakdown, lower solubility in the kidney which results in lesser amount of intrarenal fluoride which is liberated and also due to their faster clearance.",A

"A 72-year-old man with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and coronary aery disease presents in septic shock from emphysematous cholecystitis. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 6-L nasal cannula and his hemoglobin is 7.2 mg/dL. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%. Which of the following treatment options will improve his oxygen delivery the most?",Increase his inspired oxygen concentration,Transfer him to a hyperbaric chamber,Administer an erythropoietic agent,Transfuse two units of packed red blood cells,"Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous. Correction of the patient's anemia by the most expeditious manner, that is, transfusion of blood, is the treatment of choice.",D

Abdominal Aoic Aneurysms Abdominal aoic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true aerial aneurysm. An aoic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aoa with a diameter of at least 1.5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aoic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aoic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal. Most common site is infrarenal. More common in males than females. Incidence increases with age. At least 90% of all abdominal aoic aneurysms >4.0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease. Prognosis is related to both the size of the aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary aery and 3 cerebrovascular disease. The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of aneurysm. An abdominal aoic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons. As abdominal aoic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening. Contrast-enhanced CT is investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size Operative repair of the aneurysm with inseion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aoic stent graft is indicated for: - abdominal aoic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms. - for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aoic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5.5 cm. The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in pa on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions.

Which of the following is the preoperative imaging study of choice for gastrinoma ?,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS),Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy,CT scan,"CT will detect most lesions >1cm in size and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is comparable. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is more sensitive than these other non-invasive imaging tests, but it still misses many of the smaller lesions, and may confuse normal lymph nodes or gastrinomas. Currently, the preoperative imaging study of choice for gastrinoma is somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (the octreotide scan). When the pretest probability of gastrinoma is high, the sensitivity and specificity of this modality approach 100%. Gastrinoma cells contain type II somatostatin receptors that bind the indium-labeled somatostatin analogue (octreotide) with high affinity, making imaging with a gamma camera possible. Currently, angiographic localization studies are in frequently performed for gastrinoma.",C

During rapid induction of anesthesia ?,Sellick's maneuver is not required,Pre-oxygenation is mandatory,Suxamethonium is contraindicated,Patient is mechanically ventilated before endotracheal intubation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Pre-oxygenation is mandatory During rapid sequence induction preoxygenation is done for full 3 minutes. Sch is the muscle relaxant of choice for intubation. Sallieck's maneuver is done to prevent aspiration. Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Rapid sequence anaesthesia When anaesthesia is given for emergency surgery, it is called a ""rapid sequence anaesthesia"". The patients have full stomach because there is no starvation for anaesthesia (it is an emergency surgery) and gastric emptying is delayed due to trauma, acute abdomen. Therefore, the objective of rapid sequence anaesthesia is to secure the airway rapidly and prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Procedure of rapid sequence has following steps : - Li The patient is preoxygenatedfor full 3 minutes. Intravenous induction agent (thiopentone or propofol) is given. Sellick's maneuver (cricoid/pressure) is done to prevent aspiration. After ensuring the correct position of tube cricoid pressure is released and maintenance anaesthesia (NCO 66%, 02% 33%, & inhalational agent) is given. A non-depolarizing blocker is now added. Suxamethenium (succinylcholine) is given as it quickly relaxes the laryngeal muscles so that rapid intubation can be done. Not done during rapid sequence anaesthesia : ? Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Premedications are not given.",B

Which of the following statements concerning carcinoma of the esophagus is true?,Alcohol has been implicated as a precipitating factor,Squamous carcinoma is the most common type at the cardio esophageal junction,It has a higher incidence in males,It occurs more commonly in patients with corrosive esophagitis,"Carcinoma of the esophagus occurs primarily in the sixth and seventh decades of life in a male:female ratio of 3:1. Although the cause is unknown, alcohol, tobacco, and dietary factors have been implicated as causative agents. A high incidence is reported in patients with corrosive esophagitis. The malignant tumors arising in the esophagus are usually squamous cell carcinomas except those involving the esophagogastric junction, which are usually adenocarcinomas. Even though squamous cell carcinomas are weakly radiosensitive, surgical extirpation affords reasonable, if short-term, palliation. Some authorities recommend radiotherapy for palliation alone or in combination with surgery to treat this lesion. Adenocarcinomas are not particularly radiosensitive and surgical treatment is generally employed. Following resection for esophageal carcinoma among the highly select group of patients whose tumors are still resectable when the diagnosis is made, survival is only about 14% at 5 years.

Venoocclusive disease in hepatic vein characterized by:,Central venous congestion,Hepatomegaly,Poal vein obstruction,Budd chiari syndrome,"Ans is b i.e. hepatomegaly Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) now better known as 'Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome' is one of the most frequently encountered serious complications after bone marrow transplantation. Other uncommon causes are: - Long-term immunosuppression with azathioprine in renal and liver transplant patients - Sporadic cases may be due to use of herbal teas (pyrrolizidine alkaloids). The hallmark features of VOD are hyperbilirubinetnia, painful hepatomegaly, and fluid retention. The onset of VOD usually occurs within 3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, with a peak 12 days posttransplantation. However, the onset of VOD has been repoed even later. According to the modified Seattle criteria, 2 or more of the following must be present prior to 20 days after stem cell transplantation for a diagnosis of VOD: Bilirubin level of more than 2 mg/dL (34 prnol/L) Hepatomegaly and upper right quadrant pain of liver origin Ascites and/or unexplained weight gain of more than 2% above the reference range Pathophysiology: The causes of VOD are still unclear, but a combination of pretransplant risk factors and transplant-related conditions are believed to trigger a primarily hepatic sinusoidal injury. This can quickly extend to a hepatocytic and panvasculitic disease. This process eventually leads to complete venular obliteration, extensive hepatocellular necrosis, and widespread fibrous tissue replacement of normal liver. Because of the initiating pathology it is also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The disease has significant morbidity and moality. Treatment is largely suppoive. VOD and Budd-Chiari syndrome In VOD hepatic venous outflow obstruction occurs from diffuse involvement of hepatic venules/ vein radicles, whereas in Budd-Chiari syndrome the outflow obstruction is due to involvement of major hepatic veins or the hepatic poion of IVC. In VOD the major hepatic veins are patent. Tender hepatomegaly with jaundice and ascites is common in both conditions.",B

What is the most characteristic of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis -,Affects the first born female child,The pyloric tumour is best felt during feeding,The patient is commonly marasmic,Loss of appetite occurs early,"Option (a)

HPS classically presents in a firstborn male child between 3 and 6 weeks of age. However, children outside this age range also are commonly seen, and the disease is not restricted to either male or first borne children.

Option (d)

After vomiting the child has a voracious appetite, that leads to a cycle of feeding and vomiting.

Option (c)

""Greater awareness of pyloric stenosis has led to earlier identification of patients with fewer instances of chronic malnutrition and severe dehydration"" -Nelson 17/e


Option (b)

The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is usually made by palpation - of the typical olive shaped hard pyloric mass located in the right upper quadrant. In healthy infants when palpation is difficult, feeding can help in the diagnosis. After feeding, gastric peristalsis waves may be visible.
After the infant vomits, the abdominal musculature is more relaxed and the mass is easier to palpate. Sedation can also be used to facilitate examination but is usually unnecessary. In cases of doubt, ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis.",B

The development of a clinically significant metabolic alkalosis is secondary not only to the loss of acid or addition of alkali but also to renal responses that maintain the alkalosis (paradoxical aciduria). The normal kidney can tremendously augment its excretion of acid or alkali in response to changes in ingested load. However, in the presence of significant volume depletion and consequent excessive salt and water retention, the tubular maximum for bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. Correction of volume depletion alone is usually sufficient to correct the alkalosis, since the kidney will then excrete the excess bicarbonate. HCl infusion is usually unnecessary. Acetazolamide can be utilized to increase renal excretion of bicarbonate but should be avoided in volume-depleted individuals. Moreover, to the extent that acetazolamide causes natriuresis, it will exacerbate the volume depletion.",A

A 58 year old male alcoholic with chronic pancreatitis develops a palpable abdominal mass. Ultrasound reveals a 9 cm cystic lesion adjacent to the pancreas. An impoant complication that might occur if this cyst ruptured would be?,Anaphylactic shock,Carcinomatosis,Disseminated infection,Intestinal hemorrhage,"The patient most likely has a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not a true cyst; it is lined by granulation tissue and collagen. It contains pancreatic juices and lysed blood, so rupture would spill the active digestive enzymes onto the adjacent viscera, paicularly the stomach, small intestine, and transverse colon. Digestive action produces potentially severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Anaphylactic shock results from massive activation of the IgE-mediated branch of the immune system. Pancreatic secretions do not elicit an IgE response. The classic abdominal cyst that ruptures, producing anaphylactic shock, is a hydatid cyst. Carcinomatosis is widespread serosal spread of a carcinoma, typically due to tumor spillage into a body cavity. Although this may occur with pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, this disease is far less likely to occur than is pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not an infective disease. Although septic abscesses do occur in the abdomen, and may even complicate a pancreatic pseudocyst, the danger of rupture is more associated with tissue destruction by pancreatic enzymes than with infection.

The most common aery for invasive blood pressure monitoring:-,Radial aery,Ulnar aery,Femoral aery,Axillary aery,"The radial aery is commonly cannulated because of its superficial location and substantial collateral flow. The radial aery is chosen for cannulation primarily because of the superficial nature of the vessel and ease of maintenance of the site. The radial aery lies between the brachioradialis tendons and flexor carpi radialis tendons, approximately 1-2 cm from the wrist, medial to the bony head of the distal radius. Before cannulation of radial aery The Modified Allen's Test has been the most frequently used method to clinically assess adequacy of ulnar aery collateral flow despite the lack of evidence that it can predict ischemic complications in the setting of radial aery occlusion.

Appropriate management should include which of the following?",Urgent upper gastrointestinal contrast study to delineate site of bleeding,Immediate selective aeriography the left gastric aery to diagnose and treat presumed stress ulceration,Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to diagnosis the cause of bleeding,Urgent intravenous infusion of vasopressin at 0.2-0.4 IU/min,"Patients who have sustained a major thermal burn of 35% or more of their body surface area are at a predictably high risk for the development of gastric erosions and hemorrhage. Endoscopy has demonstrated that gastric erosions are present in 93% of these patients, whereas the occurrence of severe acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in severely burned patients ranges between 25% to 50%. At least 60% of patients at risk develop stress erosions within 1 to 2 days after the precipitating event. Painless upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be the only clinical sign. The onset of hemorrhage is often delayed, usually occurring 3 to 10 days after the onset of the primary disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate stress erosion from other sources of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Correct identification of the bleeding source is made in greater than 90% of instances. If endoscopy is not diagnostic, visceral angiography through selective catheterization of the left gastric or splenic vessels may provide information regarding the primary vessel supplying the bleeding site. In contrast, barium examinations are usually of little value, due to the superficial nature of stress erosions, and in fact may be detrimental by interfering with the interpretation of subsequent aeriography.",C

The biochemical propeies that promote cqoprecipitation are not well understood but three different types of cryoglobulins have been described. Type I This type of moglobulin contains a monoclonal inununoglobulin (IgM) and is most often due to underlying multiple myeloma or waldenstroms macroglobulinetnia. Type II or Essential ,nixed cryoglobulinemia (contains mixture of two antibodies) This type of cryoblobulin contains both a polytonal IgGdeg (which may either act as on antigen or be directed against an antigen) and a monoclonal(' IgM rheumatoid factor directed against the IgG. Most cases are due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus('. Type III This also has mixed cryoglobulin but both the IgG and the rheumatoid factor IgM are polyclonalQ. This condition is often seen in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (such as lupus and leucocytoclastic vasculitis) lymphoproliferative malignancies and in as many as one half of cases HCV infection. Cryoglobulinemia may also be classified based on the association with an underlying disease : -Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia When the cryoglobulins are a mixture of various antibody types and forms for unknown reasons, the condition is called essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. However the discovery of a close association between hepatitis virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobulinemia has tasted doubt on the existence of essential or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia. Current evidence suggests that in majority of cases essential mixed cryoglohulinemia occurs when an aberrant immune response to Hepatitis C infection leads to formation of immune complexes consisting of :-- Hepatitis C antigen - Polyclonal hepatitis C specific IgG - Monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor These immune complexes are thought to outstrip reticuloendohelial clearing activity. Tissue damage result from immune complex deposition and complement activation.",B

In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory' flow rate is set at:,140-160 L/min,110-130L/min,60-100 L/min,30-50L/mm,"In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory flow rate is usually set at 60-100 U/min to allow greater expiration time for each breath. Use of high inspiratory flow rate can minimize end inspiratory lung volume and intrinsic PEEP, but it can cause higher peak airway pressures. Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

In Refeeding syndrome - lab values to be monitored are all except,Calcium levels,Magnesium levels,Phosphate levels,Ammonia,"This is characterised by severe fluid and electrolyte shifts in malnourished patients undergoing refeeding. It can occur either with enteral or parenteral nutrition, but more common with latter It results in hypophosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia. These electrolyte disorders can result in altered myocardial function, liver dysfunction, seizures, confusion, coma, tetany and death. Patients at risk are those with alcohol dependency, those suffering severe malnutrition, anorexic and those who have undergone prolonged periods of fasting. Treatment involves matching intakes with requirements and assiduously avoiding overfeeding. Calorie delivery should be increased slowly and vitamins administered regularly.

Ochsner sherren regimen is used for management of:,Appendicular mass,Appendicular abscess,Appendicitis,Peritonitis following appendicitis,"Ans. (a) Appendicular massRef: Bailey & Love 26th ed. /1211* The appendix that is acutely inflamed may perforate and later wall off from the peritoneal cavity by omentum and adjacent bowel loop to form a tender, palpable right iliac fossa mass. It is a common surgical pathology which occurs in about 2-6% of patients who presented with acute appendicitis.The initial school of thought regards this condition to be managed conservatively, with the famous one being the Ochsner-Sherren regimen. The idea behind this is that, surgery would be hazardous and increase the mortality rate.* The conservative management of appendicular mass can be summarized by mnemonic ""ABCDEF"" which is# A: Analgesic, Antibiotic, antipyretic# B: Bed rest# C: Charting (vital sign, size of the mass)# D: Diet (Keep Nil by Mouth)# E: Exploratory laparotomy KIV.# F: Fluid maintenanceThree methods are proposed for management of appendicular mass which are:1.

"A jaundiced, 43 year old alcoholic male presents to the emergency room complaining of bright red blood in his last two stools. He denies pain on defecation or changes in his bowel habits. Which of the following would be the most likely finding on sigmoidoscopic examination?",Colorectal carcinoma,Diveiculitis,Hemorrhoids,Hyperplastic polyps,"The patient's jaundice indicates that he has significant alcoholic liver disease. Hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis both produce vascular injury and poal hypeension, which leads to the development of poosystemic shunts-most typically causing esophageal varices, caput medusae, and hemorrhoids. Bright red blood in stools is a classic presentation of hemorrhoids. Colorectal carcinoma generally develops in an older population, and produces occult blood loss rather than frankly bloody stools. Although diveiculosis may be an asymptomatic condition, diveiculitis is associated with significant abdominal distress, which may be accompanied by blood loss and diarrhea and/or constipation. Hyperplastic polyps are asymptomatic, non-neoplastic, polypoid growths, generally less than 5mm in diameter. They do not produce bleeding or any increased risk of carcinoma.

Urine gets collected in which place in case of extraperitoneal rupture of bladder -,Groin,Below urogenital diaphragm,Above urogenital diaphragm,Perineal space,"Ans is 'c' ie above the Urogenital diaphragm Bladder rupture is of two types : a) Extraperitoneal - 80% of cases b) Intraperitoneal - 20% of cases Urethral rupture is also of two types: a) Bulbar urethral injury - MC b) Membranous urethral injury Extravasation of urine in Bladder & Urethral injuries. Extravasation of urine (+ blood ) in bulbar urethral injury It is a superficial extravasation. If the Buck's fascia remains intact, extravasation of blood and urine are confined to the penile shaft. However disruption of Buck's fascia allows extravasated contents into a space limited by colle's fascia forms a scrotal and perineal butterfly hematoma which can extend up the abdominal wall. Extravasation of urine in Membranous urethral injury & Extraperitoneal bladder rupture. Extravasation is same in both It is a deep extravasation Urine extrvasates in the layers of the pelvic fascia and the retroperitoneal tissues Urine collects in the perivesical space. The typical finding on cystogram is extravasation of contrast material into the pelvis around the base of the bladder. Intraperitoneal rupture - usually occurs with a direct blow to lower abdomen with full bladder. - blood & urine will extravasate into the peritoneal cavity producing signs of peritonitis.

Weight allowed in skeletal traction upto?,5 kg,I 0 kg,20 kg,30 kg,"Ans. is `c' i.e., 20 kg Traction Traction is defined as a pulling force to treat muscle or skeletal disorders (fractures, dislocation). There are two major types of tractions : skin & skeletal traction: A. Skin traction Here the traction is applied to the skin (using adhesive or nonadhesive tape or straps) which is indirectly transmitted to the bone. Skin traction can sustain a pull of no more than 4 to 5 kgs. Skin traction is given by adhesive tape & bandage, Buck's appratus. Gallow's/Bryant's/Russel traction are examples of skin traction. B. Skeletal traction Skeletal traction is an invasive procedure in which pins, screws, wires or tongs (e.g., Seinmann pin, Denham's pin, Kirschner's wire, ice tong, Crutchfield's tong, Bohler stirrup, Ilizarov's wire) are placed into the bones so that the weight is directly applied to the bone. Skeletal traction is used. In cases when the pulling force needed is more than the skin traction can bear. When longer durations of traction is required. When the pa of the body needing traction is positioned so that the skin traction is impossible. Upto 20 kg weight is permitted.",C
True about extraperitoneal urinary bladder rupture is all except,Associated with fracture pelvis in about 70% cases,More common than intraperitoneal bladder rupture,Commonly associated with anterior urethral rupture,Can be managed conservatively without surgical intervention,"Ans. c (Commonly associated with anterior urethral rupture). (Ref. LB, 25th/ 1365)Rupture of the bladder may be -# Intraperitoneal (20 per cent) or - Extraperitoneal (80 per cent).Extraperitoneal bladder rupture (JIPMER 2003)# It is commonest type of bladder rupture (80%) after blunt trauma abdomen & is associated usually with bony pelvis & posterior urethral injuries.# The urine extravasates in perivesical region, first in cave of Ritzius i.e., retropubic space.# Radiograph may show pelvic bones, pear shaped bladder density, loss of obturation fat planes, upward displacement of coils & paralytic ileus.# Cystography (gold standard, definitive) reveals distorted bladder with extravasation of contrast in perivesical space & streaks of contrast into facial planes giving typical ""sun burst"" appearance.# US shows ""bladder in bladder"" appearance due to perivesical collection and rent may be detected.# CT cystography is best investigative technique as the exact site & extent of rent, bladder wall contusions, blood clots & surrounding organ injuries can be detected.# Can be managed conservatively without surgical intervention.Intraperitoneal rupture# Intraperitoneal rupture may be secondary to a blow, kick or fall on a fully distended bladder and it is more common in the male than in the female, and usually follows a bout of beer drinking. More rarely, it is due to surgical damage. Extraperitoneal rupture is usually caused by a fractured pelvis or is secondary to major trauma or surgical damage.# Treatment of intraperitoneal ruptureThe mainstay is to provide adequate drainage of the bladder. The standard treatment is to perform a lower midline laparotomy, urine is removed by suction, after which the patient is placed in Trendelenberg's position. The edges of the rent, which are usually situated in the posterior part of the dome of the bladder, are trimmed and sutured with two layers of interrupted catgut stitches, and the operation completed by placement of a suprapubic and urethral catheter.The peritoneum should be irrigated with copious amounts of warm saline.Operations in which the bladder is liable to be injured are:# Inguinal or femoral herniotomy;# Hysterectomy by either the abdominal or vaginal route; and# Excision of the rectum. In the latter two operations, the bladder should be catheterised prior to operation to minimize the risks of this accident.If the injury is recognised at the time, the bladder must be repaired in two layers and urethral catheter drainage maintained for 7 days. If it is not recognised, the treatment is similar to that of rupture of the bladder.When accidental perforation of the bladder occurs during endoscopic resection of a bladder tumour, or the prostatic capsule is perforated during transurethral prostatectomy, the perforation is usually extraperitoneal.",C

There is accompanying hyperophy of the nerve trunks. MC site is rectosigmoid colon.* (or Rectum, more specificaly)* The Clinical picture varies from acute intestinal obstruction in neonates to chronic constipation in later life. One imp feature which distinguishes Hirschprungs disease from other types of constipation is that fecal soiling is not a feature of HD. M: F ratio is 4: I Diagnosis: Barium enema: The initial diagnostic step in a newborn with radiographic evidence of a distal bowel obstruction is a barium enema. In a normal barium enema study, the rectum is wider than the sigmoid colon. In patients with Hirschsprung's disease, this relationship is reversed.

Zuska disease is an eponym for,Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts in breast,Chronic inflammation of bile ducts,Chronic renal transplant rejection,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts in breast Squamous Metaplasia Of Lactiferous Ducts:* Squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts is known by a variety of names, including recurrent subareolar abscess, periductal mastitis, and Zuska disease.* Women, and sometimes men, present with a painful erythematous subareolar mass that clinically appears to be a bacterial abscess. In recurrent cases, a characteristic fistula tract often tunnels under the smooth muscle of the nipple and opens onto the skin at the edge of the areola.* Many women have an inverted nipple, most likely as a secondary effect of the underlying inflammation.* More than 90% of the afflicted are smokers. It has been suggested that a relative deficiency of vitamin A associated with smoking or toxic substances in tobacco smoke alter the differentiation of the ductal epithelium.* The key feature is keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the nipple ducts. Keratin shed from these cells plugs the ductal system, causing dilation and eventually rupture of the duct. An intense chronic granulomatous inflammatory response develops once keratin spills into the surrounding periductal tissue.* With recurrences, a secondary anaerobic bacterial infection may supervene and cause acute inflammation.* Simple incision drains the abscess cavity, but the offending keratinizing epithelium remains and recurrences are common.* In most cases, en bloc surgical removal of the involved duct and contiguous fistula tract is curative. If secondary bacterial infection is present, antibiotics also have a therapeutic role.",A

"Among patients who require nutritional resuscitation in an intensive care unit, the best evidence that nutritional support is adequate is",Urinary nitrogen excretion levels,Total serum protein level,Serum albumin level,Serum transferrin levels,"The serum albumin level provides a rough estimate of protein nutritional adequacy. The accuracy of this estimate is affected by the long half-life of albumin (3 week) and vagaries of hemodilution. The acute-phase serum proteins have a very short half-life (hours) and may also provide good short-term indications of nutritional status. Transferrin is one of these acute-phase proteins, but unfortunately its levels too are influenced by changes in intravascular volume and, along with the other acute-phase reactants, rise nonspecifically during acute illness.

About preoperative bowel preparation Sabiston 18/e p266 writes-

""Mechanical bowel preparation with the addition of oral antibiotics was the standard of care for several decades for any intestinal surgery. More recent studies have evaluated the need for both oral antibiotics and mechanical cleansing. Oral antibiotics confer no benefit to the patient and may increase the risk for postoperative infection with Clostridium difficile. In addition, although it seems intuitive that removal of bulk fecal material would decrease the risk for anastomotic and infectious complications, the opposite is true. A recent meta-analysis showed that both of these events are not decreased and may be increased with mechanical cleansing.""

The fracture may be intracapsular where the fracture line can vary from middle of the neck to subcapital region (fractre neck femur); or extracapsular where the fracture can be at the very base of neck or through the peritrochenteric line. (fracture interochenteric femur) Fracture of the neck of femur are usually sustained by old people from tril strains such as tripping on a stair or stumbling on a carpetQ It most commonly occur in elderly women. Risk factors are postmenopausal/age related osteoporosis, bone losing or bone weakening disorders such as osteomalacia, diabetes, stroke (disuse), alcoholism, and chronic debilitating disease. Every elderly patient who, after tril injury, complains of pain in the region of hip and lies with the limb in lateral rotation should be assumed to have sustained a fracture of femoral neckQ until radiographs taken in two planes prove other wise. In the extra capsular fractures (interochanteric fracture) there is usually gross deformity and loss of functionQ but in undisplaced intracapsular (neck) fracture patient may still be able to walk, and such ordinary signs of fractures as shoening of the limb seldon develop until after several days or weeks.

Glasgow coma scale in death is: September 2005,0,1,2,3,"Ans. D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: - No eye opening Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) - Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied ; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain. (Purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e.g., hand crosses mid-line and gets above clavicle when supra-orbital pressure applied.) - Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things as asked.)

All are true about gantacurium-except,Its onset and duration similar to succinylcholine,It is non depolarizing neuromuscular blocker,It is not metabolized by pseudocholinesterase,It is benzylisoquinoline nondepolarizing NMB,"Gantacurium was the first compound of this new class of neuromuscular blocking drugs, the asymmetric mixed-onium chlorofumarates. Gantacurium is an asymmetric enantiomeric isoquinolinium diester of chlorofumaric acid . Gantacurium, like cisatracurium, is a single isomer as atracurium and mivacurium are consisting of a mixture of isomers . Gantacurium is an ultra-sho acting non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug with a rapid onset and a wide safety margin . As cisatracurium and atracurium are inactivated by Hofmann elimination, gantacurium is metabolized by chemical degradation which involves cysteine adduction (fast process) and pH-sensitive hydrolysis (slow process) . Cysteine adduction results in replacement of chlorine by cysteine whereafter a heterocyclic ring is formed which cannot longer interact with the postjunctional acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, the metabolites of gantacurium showed no neuromuscular propeies . Moreover, there is no renal and hepatic involvement in the elimination of gantacurium . Reversal of a gantacurium-induced neuromuscular block is possible with administration of cysteine . This first drug in class showed promising results in animal and human studies which will be discussed.",D

In 1991, OSHA. (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) issued the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to protect workers from this risk. In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The standard requires that employees he provided: - Adequate protective equipment and clothing (gloves, face masks, aprons etc.); - Hepatitis B vaccine at no cost to the employee; - confidential medical evaluation and counseling after an incident (employees must be offered training, testing and post exposure prophylaxis at no cost) ; and - training on an annual basis on all aspects of bloodborne hepatitis, HIV and other bloodborne diseases (i.e., modes of transmission, effective preventive measures -- equipment, clothing and work practices, and the medical evaluation available after an exposure). Revisions to Blood Borne Pathogen standards as a result of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act: According to the revised standards the employers must keep a Sharps Injury Log for the recording of percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. The log must documet at a minimum, the type and brand of device involved in each incident; the depament or work area in which the exposure occurred; and an explanation of how the incident happened. The information would be recorded and maintained in a way that would protect the confidentiality of injured employees. The log would serve as an impoant source of data to help determine the relative effectiveness and safety of currently used devices and to guide the development of future products. It requires the use of engineering and work practices to control and eliminate or minimize employee exposure to bloodborne pathogens. the employer should use safer needle devices, (e.g.syringes with a sliding sheath that shields the attached needle after use; needles that retract into a syringe after use;) and to involve employees in identifying and choosing these devices",C
"A 66 year old man develops low back pain, and radiologic investigations reveal multiple osteoblastic lesions of the lumbar veebrae. A hard, irregular nodule on the posterior surface of the prostate is appreciated on rectal examination. Plasma levels of prostatic specific antigen (PSA) are markedly increased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic prostatitis,Multiple myeloma,Prostatic adenocarcinoma,Prostatic hyperplasia,"This is the typical clinical presentation of carcinoma of the prostate, which is probably the most frequent cancer in males (although lung cancer is the most frequent neoplastic cause of death). Autopsy studies show that small foci of adenocarcinoma are found in the prostate of up to 70% of men older than 80. Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) is expressed by both normal prostatic tissue and adenocarcinoma of the prostate. A rise in PSA plasma levels, therefore, simply results from any increase in the mass of prostatic tissue and cannot be used to differentiate between cancer and hyperplasia. Cancer arises more frequently in the peripheral zone of the gland, producing firm nodules on the posterior surface that can be detected on rectal examination. Metastasis to the bone can be osteoblastic (with formation of new bone) or osteolytic (with destruction of bone). Osteoblastic metastases in the veebral column are characteristic of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Chronic prostatitis presents with dysuria and perineal discomfo. The diagnosis relies on finding at least 10 leukocytes per high-power field on microscopic examination of expressed prostatic secretions. Chronic prostatitis is fuher classified into bacterial prostatitis if cultures are positive for bacteria, or abacterial prostatitis if cultures are negative. Increased plasma PSA is frequently seen. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of plasma cells that frequently manifests with osteolytic (not osteoblastic) lesions in the veebral column as well as other bones, such as the cranial vault and ribs. Prostatic hyperplasia is an extremely common disorder in middle-aged and elderly men. It involves the periurethral zone of the gland, leading to compression of the urethra, difficulty in urination, urinary retention, and recurrent cystitis. PSA levels are increased in a manner roughly propoional to the degree of prostatic enlargement. Ref: La Rochelle J., Shuch B., Belldegrun A. (2010). Chapter 40. Urology. In F.C. Brunicardi, D.K.

On neurologic examination, flaccid paralysis of both lower extremities and complete anesthesia to all sensory modalities below approximately the L3 dermatome are noted. Catheterization of his bladder yields approximately 700 mL of urine. Plain radiographs of the spine reveal compression fracture in the body of L3 with greater than 50% of loss in its height.

"All are TRUE about hypospadias, EXCEPT ?",Circumcision in infancy is contraindicated,Avoid surgery till pubey,No treatment required in glandular variety,All,"Ans. is 'b i.e. Avoid surgery till pubey Different books mention different age criteria for correcting hypospadias. Campbell's urology states ""Best time for surgery for hypospadias is between 6-12 months of age."" Hypospadias: This is a condition in which the external meatus of the urethra is situated at some point on the undersurface of the penis or perineum. Besides the abnormal position of external urethral meatus the other associated abnormalities are a) In the penile variety the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening are absent, Instead a fibrous cord is present. Due to contracture of this fibrous cord, the penis is curved ventrally (in a downward direction) this is known as chordee. So the more proximal the ectopic opening is placed the greater is the chance of chordee. This curved penis causes problem in intercourse as well as micturition. b) In all cases, inferior aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed. While the superior aspect is normally developed. This causes prepuce to take the form of hood and is called hooded prepuce. Complications of hypospadias ? a) Difficulty in directing the urinary stream. b) Due to presence of chordee, erection is difficult and painful and the intercourse may be difficult or impossible. c) Infeility can occur (usually associated with posterior type), T/T of Hypospadias: T/T of hypospadias is very complex. Here are some impoant points. Treatment is not required in anterior variety. In this variety the patient is usually functional both for micturition and procreation and repair is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. In case of other varieties, a plastic operation is performed to bring the external urethral meatus to its normal position, and remove the chordee to straighten the curvature. Operation can be done in one stage or two stage surgeries. Now days one stage surgeries are more popular. - Indication for 2 stage operation - Scrotal or perineal variety - Even sever proximal types have been treated in single stage repair with success. - Circumcision is not done in patients with hypospadias as the prepuce can later be used in surgical repair.",B

Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most important but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment).This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient)Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvisGrading of VUR : is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU).Grade 1reflux into a non-dilated ureterGrade IIreflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation.Grade IIIreflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornicesGrade IVreflux into a grossly dilated ureterGrade VGross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces : calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VURReflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transport of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract.The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring.Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypertension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy.* TreatmentThe goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux.Treatment modality is either medical or surgical.Medical therapyis based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution.Surgical therapy :the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury.The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on certain principles and parental, patient preferences.Below is given a chart listing the treatment recommendation for VUR.Before going through the chart lets see the basic principles on which this chart is based -With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time.Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades.For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whether if it unilateral or bilateral.For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution.Grade V reflux rarely resolves.The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs.Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.Treatment Recommendation for VUR diagnosed following a UTI.GradeAge (yrs)ScarringInitial t/tFollow-upI-iiAny-Antibiotic prophylaxis-III - IV0-5-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6- 10-U/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6 - 10-B/L: Surgery V<1-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoU/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoB/L: Surgery V1 - 5YesSurgery V6- 10-Surgery * ThusMedical Management is the initial t/t in almost all children except for -Grade III & IV (Bilateral)Grade V (Mostly)Medical management (antibiotic prophylaxis) is continued till the reflux resolves.Pt. is shifted from medical to surgical management, in children withbreakthrough UTI (Recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis)Development of new renal scarsFailure of reflux to resolve.Thus in this question we will begin with medical management ie cotrimoxazole. This pt is having recurrent UTI. This will not alter our t/t. If the pt. had recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis, we would have done a surgical management.If you have a close look at the statement of O.P. Ghai, you will note that he is not stating that grades IV & V will be t/t surgically. It is persistent grades IV & V that are t/t surgically (persistent means VUR that are not resolving over time).",A

Garden's classification used for which fracture?,Surgical neck humerus,Shaft humerus,Neck of femur,Shaft femur,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Neck of femur Garden's classification Garden's classification is the most useful and most accepted classification of the neck of femur. This is based on the degree of displacement of the fracture. Following 4 stages of fracture are there :? 1) Stage 1 : The fracture is incomplete, with head tilted in postero-lateral direction, i.e. into valgus, therefore is known as valgus (abduction) impacted fracture. 2) Stage 2 : Complete fracture but undisplaced. 3) Stage 3 : Complete fracture with paial displacement. 4) Stage 4 : Complete fracture with total displacement. The degree of displacement, in Garden's classification, is judged from change in the direction of medial trabecular stream of the neck, in relation to the bony trabeculae in the weight bearing pa of the head and in the corresponding pa of the acetabulum. i) Stage 1 :- There is an obtuse angle laterally at the trabecular stream. ii) Stage 2 :- Trebeculae between head and neck are broken but they are in alignment with each other and with trabeculae in the acetabulum. iii) Stage 3 :- All three trabeulae are out of alignment. iv) Stage 4 :- Acetabular and head trabeculae are in alignment but head and neck trabeculae are not aligned.",C

Which of the following anesthetic is safe in hea failure,Etomidate,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,"Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. In multiple studies, etomidate has been used for induction in patients with a compromised cardiovascular system who are undergoing coronary aery bypass surgery or valve surgery, as well as in patients requiring induction of general anesthesia for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aoic aneurysm repair, and thoracic surgery. For cardioversion, the rapid onset, quick recovery, and maintenance of aerial blood pressure in these sometimes hemodynamically tenuous patients, combined with continued spontaneous respiration, make etomidate an acceptable choice.

What are his surgical options?",Esophagectomy,Surgical esophagomyotomy proximal to the LES,Modified Heller myotomy and partial fundoplication,Repeat pneumatic dilation using pressures of loops,"A healthy patient with achalasia who has failed nonoperative management should be considered for surgical intervention. Pneumatic dilatation is first-line therapy. It causes disruption of the muscular layers of the LES. A balloon is placed endoscopically at the level of the LES. Fluoroscopically is used to visualize the balloon as it is inflated to pressures no higher than 10 psi. If pneumatic dilatation fails, or if symptoms return after successful dilation, surgery should be considered. The procedure may be done open or endoscopically. The operation involves a myotomy that divides the circular and longitudinal muscle fibers. It extends from the distal 6 cm of the esophagus, through the LES, and the proximal gastric cardia.

"Following aortic reconstruction, the viability of the sigmoid colon can most reliably be evaluated by",Intraoperative measurement of inferior mesenteric artery stump pressure,Intraoperative Doppler arterial signal in the sigmoid mesentery,Intraoperative observation of bowel peristalsis,Postoperative sigmoidoscopy,"Viability of the colon can be evaluated intraoperatively by Doppler auscultation of the bowel mesentery and serosa, observation of bowel peristalsis, and measurement of the IMA stump pressure. A strong, pulsatile Doppler signal in the mesentery; active sigmoid peristalsis; a chronically occluded IMA; or a patent IMA with stump pressure greater than 40 mm Hg presage viability of the sigmoid colon postoperatively. However, none of these observations excludes the possibility of late sigmoid ischemia. Serial postoperative sigmoidoscopic examination is the best predictor of ischemic colitis and in experienced hands allows assessment of the depth of ischemic injury before frank perforation has occurred. Barium enema is not as accurate as sigmoidoscopy in determining depth of injury and carries grave risks of contamination by barium and feces if perforation occurs.",D
Most common type of supra condylar fracture in children ?,Posteromedial extension,Posterolateral extension,Anteromedial flexion,Anterolateral flexion,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Posteromedial extension Supracondylar fracture of humerus Supracondylar humeral fractures are the most common elbow fractures in children. Most common age group affected is 5-8 years. Boys are affected more than girls. Left side is more common than right. Mechanism of injury Mostly it occurs due to hyperextension injury. Fracture is caused by a fall onto the outstretched hand with hyperextension at elbow. Types of supracondylar fracture Supracondylar fracture is broadly classified into extension type and flexion type. 1) Extension type It is the most common type (97 - 99%). Distal fragment is extended (tilted backward/posteriorly) in relation to proximal fragment. Occurs due to hyperextension injury after fall on outstretched hands. Generally, displacement of distal fragment may be : - i) Posteromedial (70-80%) ii) Posterolateral (20-30%) 2) Flexion type It is less common type (1-3 %) Distal fragment is flexed (tilted forward/anteriorly) in relation to proximal fragments. The mechanism of injury generally is believed to be a fall directly onto the elbow rather than a fall on outstretched hand. As the extension type fracture is more common (97 - 99%), the most common elbow injury in children is extension type of supracondylar fracture. Clinical features of supracondylar fracture Following a fall, the child is in pain and elbow is swollen. In extension type of injury, `S' shaped deformity of the elbow is obvious. There is loss of both active and passive movements of elbow. Symptoms relating to vascular and nerve injury may be seen. Unusual posterior prominence of the point of elbow (tip of olecrenon) because of backward tilt of the distal fragment. Three point bony relationship is maintained as the fracture is above the level of condyles. Dimple sign due to one of the spikes of proximal fragment penetrating the muscle and tethring the skin.",A
Treatment of Anal canal stage 2 is,Chemoradiation,Abdominoperineal resection,Chemotherapy and surgery,Radiotherapy only,"AJCC staging for anal canal cancers is based on the size of the tumor and local invasion of adjacent organs or structures.A tumor that is 2 cm or smaller is designated T1, larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is T2, and larger than 5 cm is T3. Any size tumor that invades a local structure is designated T4. Staging of disease includes CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and pelvic MRI. Positron emission tomography scanning should be considered for larger (T2 or greater) tumors or any node-positive disease. HIV testing and checking a CD4 count should also be considered if indicated. Historically, treatment consisted of surgery alone or radiation therapy alone. Epithelial or subepithelial tumors were locally excised, and more advanced lesions underwent APR. The introduction of multimodality therapy combining chemotherapy andradiation therapy promised to preserve continence, to avoid colostomy, and to offer similar or improved survival. Nigro was the first to promote radiation therapy with chemotherapy as definitive treatment for squamous cell cancers of the anal canal. The current protocol includes infusional 5-FU with mitomycin C and external beam radiation to the pelvis with a minimum dose of 45Gy. The inguinal nodes, pelvis, anus, and perineum should be included in the radiation fields. Patients with T2 lesions and residual disease after 45 Gy, T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease are usually treated with an additional 9 to 14 Gy for a total dose of 54 to 59 Gy. In patients treated with APR for persistent or locally recurrent disease, 5-year actuarial survival is repoed at 57%.46 Despite high success rates with definitive chemoradiotherapy, 15% to 30% of patients will have recurrence or fail to respondcompletely.47 Patients with persistent disease up to 6 months after treatment generally require APR. Those who have local recurrence are also recommended for APR. In the setting of isolated inguinal node recurrence, groin dissection is generally required with consideration for radiation therapy to the inguinal node basins if no prior radiotherapy was given. Up to 50% of patients treated with salvage APR can expect a 5-year cure. This is compared with approximately 27% of patients treated with salvage radiation and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy who can expect cure. In those patients presenting with anal squamous cell carcinoma in the setting of HIV infection, disease severity (CD4 count and use of antiretroviral therapy) has a significant impact on success of standard chemoradiation. The current consensus is that standard protocols for chemoradiotherapy should be attempted, regardless of HIV status, and that medical management of the patient's HIV infection be optimized. The 2-year survival rates for HIV-positive patients have been repoed to be the same as for HIV-negative patients, 77% and 75%, respectively Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pg no : 1415",A

Associated with urinary bladder carcinoma are all of the following except: September 2009,Smoking,Human papilloma virus infection,Schistosomiasis,Cyclophosphamide,"Ans. B: Human papilloma virus infection Up to 80% of bladder cancer cases are associated with environmental exposure, which suggests that bladder cancer is potentially preventable. Smoking is the most commonly associated risk factor and accounts for approximately 50% of all bladder cancers. Nitrosamine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-aminobiphenyl are possible carcinogenic agents found in cigarette smoke. Bladder cancer is also associated with industrial exposure to aromatic amines in dyes, paints, solvents, leather dust, inks, combustion products, rubber, and textiles. Therefore, higher-risk occupations associated with bladder cancer include painting, driving trucks, and working with metal. Several medical risk factors are associated with bladder cancer. Patients with prior exposure to radiation treatment of the pelvis have an increased risk of bladder cancer. Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer exposure to acrolein, a urinary metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Patients with spinal cord injuries who have long-term indwelling catheters have a 16- to 20-fold increased risk of developing carcinoma of the bladder. It is also associated with Schistosoma hematobium infection (bilharzial bladder cancer) in regions where it is endemic.",B

Sodium Thiopentone is ultra sho acting d/t,Rapid absorption,Rapid metabolism,Rapid redistribution,Rapid excretion,"Barbiturate pharmacokinetics has been described in physiologic and compament models. Both these pharmacokinetic models describe rapid redistribution as the primary mechanism that terminates the action of a single induction dose. Physiologic models of barbiturates describe a rapid mixing of the drug within the central blood volume followed by a quick distribution of the drug to highly perfused, low-volume tissues (i.e., brain), with a slower redistribution of the drug to lean tissue (muscle), which terminates the effect of the initial (induction of anesthesia) dose. In these models, adipose tissue uptake and metabolic clearance (elimination) play only minor roles in the termination of the effects of the induction dose. The reasons are the minimal perfusion ratio of adipose tissue compared with other tissues and the slow rate of removal. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition",C

A patient presented with blunt trauma to the abdomen to the emergency depament. His hea rate is 150/min and his BP 80/50 mm Hg.He is scheduled to undergo an emergency laparotomy. Which of the following is anaesthetic agent of choice?,Thiopentone,Midazolam,Ketamine,Propofol,"The cardiovascular stimulatory effects make ketamine a desirable drug for the induction of anesthesia in unstable cardiovascular patients suffering from hypovolemia, hemorrhagic shock, or cardiovascular depression in sepsis. Ketamine bronchodilation and profound analgesia allowing the use of high oxygen concentrations make ketamine an excellent choice for induction of anesthesia in patients with reactive airway disease. Patients who have sustained trauma with extensive blood loss are typical candidates for rapid-sequence anesthesia induction with ketamine. Patients with septic shock also may benefit from ketamine. The intrinsic myocardial depressant effect of ketamine may manifest in this situation if trauma or sepsis has caused depletion of catecholamine stores before the patient's arrival in the operating room.

All are true about Ranula EXCEPT:,Translucent,Retention cyst,Cyst of submandibular gland,Cyst of minor salivary gland,"ANSWER: (C) Cyst of submandibular glandREF: With text Ranula:A ranula is a sublingual swelling. Most consist of a mucus filled cyst that lies under the mucosa, just lateral to the frenulum. It is thought to be a retention cyst that arises from the obstruction of one of the several ducts draining the sublingual gland. It presents as an asymptomatic swelling of the floor of the mouth, but occasionally can get so large that it interferes with speech or eating. Treatment consists of uncapping and marsupialising it. Very occasionally, the ranula can penetrate through the mylohyoid muscle and into the neck, when it is known as a plunging ranula. This requires excision, as does a simple ranula if it recurs after uncapping. REF: Textbook of General and Oral Surgery by David Wray, David Stenhouse pahe 121Minor mucous retention cysts develop in the floor of the mouth either from an obstructed minor salivary gland or from the sublingual salivary gland. The term ranula' should be applied only to a mucous extravasation cyst that arises from a sublingual gland. It produces a characteristic translucent swelling that takes on the appearance of a 'frog's belly' (ranula). A ranula can resolve spontaneously, but many also require formal surgical excision of the cyst and the affected sublingual gland.

Which of the following is true regarding bone marrow transplantation?,Marrow is highly immunogenic and easily rejected by the non-immunosuppressed host,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of aplastic anemias,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of congenital immunodeficiency diseases,Marrow transplantation can be used as a successful therapy for stage IV breast cancer following high-dose chemotherapy,"Bone marrow cells are highly immunogenic. Successful engraftment requires the use of powerful immunosuppressants that permit the transplanted cells not only to survive the host's immune response, but also to mount a graft-versus-host response against recipient tissues. The graft-versus-host response is the major impediment to more widespread clinical use of this technique. Despite these barriers, human bone marrow transplantation has had important clinical application in the treatment of aplastic anemias and congenital immunodeficiency diseases and several hematologic malignancies. Stem cell transplantation involves harvesting of a patient's own pluripotent bone marrow cells and subsequent reestablishment of the marrow following high-dose, toxic chemotherapy for advanced cancer. This modality has been used in the treatment of recurrent breast cancer, but recent metanalyses of the results have failed to show any significant survival benefit. In experimental models, work with bone marrow transplantation for the induction of tolerance to organ allografts has proved highly promising. This may provide a key for the development of treatment protocols in organ transplant recipients that would avoid or reduce the need for toxic systemic immunosuppressants.",A

Which among the following is best method to assess intake of fluid in Polytrauma pt -,Urine output,CVP,Pulse,BP,"• Lets see each option one by one
Urine output

""Urine output is a quantitative and relatively reliable indicator of organ perfusion. Adequate urine output is 0.5 ml/kg/ h in an adult, lml/kg/h in a child and 2ml/kg/h in an infant less than 1yr. of age.""

Pulse-

""Although tachycardia may be the earliest sign of hypovolemia, individuals in good physical condition, and particularly trained atheletes with a low resting pulse rate, may manifest only a relative tachycardia, pts on blocking medication may not be able to increase their heart rate. In children, bradycardia or relative bradycardia can occur with severe blood loss. Conversely, hypoxia, pain, apprehension and stimulant drugs  produce a tachycardia""

B.P. -

Hypotension is not a reliable early sign of hypovolemia. in healthy pts.
Blood volume must decrease by 30 to 40 percent before hypotension occurs.
Younger pts with good sympathetic tone can maintain systemic blood pressure with severe intravascular deficit untill they are on the verge of cardiac arrest.

CVP

Treatment of choice for congenital hydrocele?,Sac eversion,Herniotomy,Conservative,Hernioraphy,"Ans. B. Herniotomy. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1382; 381).# In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.# Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously.# Established acquired hydroceles often have thick walls. Lord's operation is suitable when the sac is reasonably thin- walled. There is minimal dissection and the risk of haematoma is reduced. Eversion of the sac with placement of the testis in a pouch prepared by dissection in the fascial planes of the scrotum is an alternative (Jaboulay's procedure).# Herniotomy: In children who have lateral hernias with a persistent processus, it is sufficient only to remove and close the sac.

Which of the following is true regarding intravenous administration of chemotherapy?,Subcutaneous extravasation of carmustine (BCNU) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) usually causes ulceration,Extravasation of doxorubicin rarely causes serious ulceration because the agent binds quickly to tissue nucleic acid,Serious and progressive ulceration can be expected following extravasation of vincristine or vinblastine,Problems of wound healing should be anticipated if systemic 5-FU therapy is begun less than 2 week postoperatively,"Since chemotherapy is generally most effective in killing rapidly dividing cells, the rapidly dividing cells of a fresh surgical wound should be in jeopardy when chemotherapy is given in the early postoperative period. Each of the phases of normal wound healing is theoretically at risk from one or another class of chemotherapeutic agents. Immediately following wounding, inflammation and vascular permeability lead to fibrin deposition and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), monocyte, and platelet influx. Macrophages are attracted by the activated complement system. By the fourth day the proliferative phase begins, and for the next 20 days fibroblasts produce mucopolysaccharides and collagen. Cross-linking of the collagen fibers then continues for several months in the maturation phase. It seems logical to delay antineoplastic agents for 10-14 days unless there are compelling clinical indications (e.g., superior vena cava syndrome) for more urgent treatment. Administration of folinic acid simultaneously with methotrexate normalizes wound healing. Extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents during intravenous administration may result in severe ulceration and sloughing. The nature of the injury is largely related to the nucleic-acid binding characteristics of the agent. Those agents that do not bind to tissue nucleic acid (vincristine, vinblastine, nitrogen mustard, BCNU, 5-FU) generally cause only local damage from the immediate injury. These substances are quickly metabolized or inactivated, and usual patterns of wound healing can be expected. On the other hand, agents that bind the nucleic acid (doxorubicin, dactinomycin, mitomycin C, mithramycin, and daunorubicin) cause not only immediate toxic reaction in the tissues but, unless excised, continuing and progressive tissue damage. Though some authors have reported success with elevation and ice packs, most recommend surgical excision if there is severe pain, any sign of early necrosis, or significant blistering.",D

What gas is used to create pneumoperitoneum -,O2,Nitrogen,CO2,Nitrous dioxide,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., CO2 & ''d' i.e., Nitrous dioxide Choice of Gas for pneumoperitoneum* First Pneumoperitoneum was created by filtered room air. Carbon dioxide 8c N2O are now preferred gas because of increased risk of air embolism with room air.* CO2 is used for insufflation as it is 200 times more diffusible than O2, is rapidly cleared from the body by the lungs and will not support combustion.* N2O is only 68% as rapidly absorbed in blood as CO2. N2O has one advantage over CO2 that it has mild analgesic effect, and so causing no pain if diagnostic laparoscopy is performed under local anaesthesia. For short operative procedures like sterilization or drilling, under local anaesthetic N2O may also be used. During prolonged laparoscopic procedure N2O should not be a preferred gas for pneumoperitoneum because it supports combustion better than air.* CO2 when come in contact with peritoneal fluid converts into carbonic acid. Carbonic acid irritates diaphragm causing shoulder tip pain & discomfort in abdomen. Carbonic acid has one advantage also that it alters pH of peritoneal fluid (acidotic changes) and it is mild antiseptic so the chances of infection may be slightly less compared to any other gas.* Helium gas being inert in nature is also tried in many centers but it does not have any added benefit over CO2.",C

An 8-yrs-old male presents with multiple patches of alopecia and severe pruritus. A bright blue-green fluorescence is seen on examination of the scalp with a wood lamp. Pathogen most likely responsible is?,Epidermophyton floccosum,Microsporum canis,Candida albicans,Trichophyton tonsurans,"Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp that may cause multiple patches of alopecia and severe itching. The dermatophytoses are diseases caused by a group of closely related filamentous fungi with a propensity for invading the stratum corneum, hair, and nails. Dermatophyte infections are designated by the word tinea, followed by the Latin name of the site. Thus, tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the head. The three genera generally responsible for dermatophyte infections are Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton. Both Microsporum and Trichophyton species commonly cause tinea capitis. The most common pathogens are Trichophyton tonsurans followed by Microsporum canis. These two pathogens are distinguished by the fact that hairs infected with Microsporum species fluoresce a bright blue green color whereas those infected by Trichophyton species usually do not fluoresce. In addition, T. tousurans often causes a unique pattern on the scalp known as ""black dot ringworm,"" characterized by circular patches of alopecia with hairs broken off close to the follicle. Epidermophyton species usually iuvade the iuteriginous skin, not the scalp. Epidermophyton floccosum is a cause of tinea crnsis, not tinea capitis. Neither Candida nor Aspergillus species are dermatophytes. Candida albicans is responsible for oral thrush and, in infants, diaper dermatitis. Aspergillus species are inhaled agents rather than skin pathogens.",B

"All of the following conditions are indications of Radioactive iodine use, EXCEPT:",Age > 40 years,Elderly,Hypehyroid children,Presence of comorbidities,"Radioiodine (I 131) may be given safely after patient has been treated with antithyroid drugs and becomes euthyroid. Radioiodine is indicated for patients who are over 40 or are poor risk for surgery and patients with recurrent hypothyroidism. It is less expensive than the operative treatment and is effective. To date, radioiodine treatment at doses necessary to treat hypehyroidism has not been associated with an increase in leukemia or the induction of congenital anomalies. However, an increased incidence of benign thyroid tumors and rare cases of malignant thyroid tumors has been noted to follow treatment of hypehyroidism with radioiodine. In young patients, radiation hazard is ceainly increased, and the chance of developing hypothyroidism is viually 100%. The incidence of hypothyroidism increases about 3% per year after treatment with radioiodine. Steroids should be given to patients with grave's ophthalmopathy, whenever radioiodine is used.

"Which of the following condition is not indicated for 
surgical exposure of orbital floor in ZMC fracture?",Diplopia,Oedema,Enopthalamos,Non-resolving occulocardiac reflex,"The decision to intervene should be based on signs, symptoms,  and  functional  impairment. The decision need not be made hastily because ZMC fractures are not emergencies and treatment can be delayed, if necessary. However, during the first week following trauma, the soft tissue  undergoes  changes  consistent  with  the  usual sequence of wound healing. The form that they will ultimately  take  depends  on  the  underlying  bony architecture. Optimally,  fractures  are  treated  before the onset of edema from the traumatic incident. In practice, however, such timing of treatment is rarely possible. 
When  edema  is  moderate  to  severe,  postponement  of surgery  for  several  days  makes  thorough  examination and  surgical  treatment  reliable  and  much  easier  tasks. Therefore,  postponement  of  the  decision  to  operate until  facial  edema  resolves  is  recommended  when  the necessity for intervention is questionable. This approach may  be  used  in  fractures  that  are  minimally  displaced, when  radiographic  examination  of  the  internal  orbit shows  no  major  defects.  However,  if  the  radiographic findings  are  so  dramatic  that  intervention  is  definitely necessary, it may be advantageous to perform the surgery regardless of the facial edema present, because the final soft  tissue  contour  may  be  superior  to  that  which  may occur when surgery is postponed. If the surgeon decides not to intervene, the patient should be observed for 2 to 3 weeks and a soft diet should be prescribed.
One should always remember that if a force is sufficient to produce a fracture of the zygoma, it is also sufficient  to  produce  intracranial  injuries.  ZMC  fractures are not life-threatening injuries and should not be given priority over more acute problems. Treatment need not be hastened if the neurologic state of the patient is in question  because  zygomatic  fractures  can  be  satisfactorily  treated  in  several  days,  after  the  facial  edema  has resolved.

Testicles left longer in the undescended state not only have a higher incidence of malignant degeneration but are inaccessible for examination. If a malignancy should occur, diagnosis will be delayed. There is also a substantial psychological burden when children reach school age or are otherwise subjected to exposure of their deformed genitalia. Gel-filled prostheses are generally inserted when a testicle cannot be placed in the scrotum. Close follow-up by a physician until the late teens is indicated in all patients who have had an undescended testicle.

All true about pressure control ventilation except-,The desired inflation pressure is preselected,There is accelerating flow rate,Tidal volume can be variable,Alveolar pressure is fixed,"With pressure control ventilation (PCV), the desired inflation pressure is preselected, and a decelerating inspiratory flow rate provides high flows at the onset of the lung inflation, to attain the desired inflation pressure quickly. Pressure control modes of ventilation In a pressure controlled mode of ventilation, the inspiratory pressure is the control variable, and is maintained during the inspiratory phase. As a result of this, the pressure waveform is ""square"". This increases the mean airway pressure (i.e. the area under the pressure/time graph is greater). During the early inspiratory phase, the ventilator provides a high inspiratory flow rate to rapidly achieve the pressure limit variable (""PC above PEEP"" on a SERVO-i). In order to maintain this pressure, the flow rate needs to decrease over the course of inspiration, and it generally takes the shape of a downsloping ramp.

Paralytic ileus is a state in which there is failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure.
The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel with associated distention, vomiting, absent or diminished bowel sounds and absolute constipation.
Radiological picture shows dilated gas filled bowel loops with multiple air-fluid level.
The picture is similar to mechanical small bowel obstruction; the only differentiating point is presence of gas in colon and rectum in paralytic ileus.
Other clinical differentiating features of paralytic ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction are.

Epidermoid cyst results from proliferation of epidermal cells within a circumscribed space of dennis (which had got implanted within the dermis due to a variety of reasons)
Sebaceous cyst is a misnomer as the cysts are not of sebaceous origin and the white, creamy material filled within them is not sebum but is keratin (desquamated epithelial cells)
The walls of these cysts consist of a layer of epidermis oriented with the basal layer superficial and the more mature layers deep (i.e. the epidermis grows into the centre of the cyst). The desquamated cells (keratin) collect in the centre and form the creamy substance of the cyst.
Epidermoid cysts usually are asymptomatic unless they get infected or inflamed and become painful
They appear as firm, round, flesh coloured to yellow or white subcutaneous nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum is an inconsistent finding that may tether the cyst to the overlying epidermis and from which the white creamy material can be expressed.
Rarely malignancies (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell ca) can develop in epidermoid cysts.

Diagnosis is made by needle aspiration of pleural fluid.
Harrison writes that for making a diagnosis of hemothorax, the pleural fluid hematocrit should be > 50% of the peripheral blood.
Chest X rays are taken to assess the presence and extent of pleural cavity collection (blood or simple plural fluid)
a supine position with horizontal x-ray beam (k/a decubitus position) is better than an erect film, as about 400-500 ml of blood may be hidden by diaphragm on upright chest x-ray.

Management of hemothorax

Most of the hemothorax can be t/t effectively with a large bore chest tube drainage and in most of the cases the bleeding stops as the lungs re-expands.
A small number of cases will require thoracotomy
continued bleeding

The process of laparoscopy begins with the creation of pneumoperitoneum, which is achieved by two methods -

the closed technique with Veress needle or
Open mini-laparotomy technique (using Hasson's canula)
Closed technique - in this classical technique a special hollow insufflation needle (Veress needle) is inserted blindly into the peritoneal cavity through a supraumbilical incision.
Open technique - in the open technique the umbilical fascia and peritoneum are incised under direct vision in the manner of a mini-laparotomy.

The open technique has resulted in a reduction of trocar induced vascular and bowel injuries.

Bile duct injury

Which would lead to an increase in hepatocyte synthesis of primary bile acids?,An injection of cholecystokinin,An ileal resection,Stimulation of the vagus nerve,Lovastatin,"The rate of synthesis of primary bile acids from cholesterol is inversely related to the rate at which bile acids are extracted from the hepatic poal blood and resecreted into the bile canaliculi. Therefore, an increase in the rate of synthesis occurs following ileal resection. Ileal resection decreases the ability to absorb bile acids from the small intestine and causes a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of the bile acids. Therefore, secretion of new bile acids is increased.Injection of cholecystokinin or stimulation of the vagus nerve contract the gallbladder and relax the sphincter of Oddi, causing increased delivery of bile acids to the duodenum. These bile acids are absorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver in the hepatic poal blood. Therefore, synthesis of new bile acids is decreased. Lovastatin, which decreases the activity of 3 hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, decreases synthesis of cholesterol and, therefore, decreases the synthesis of bile acids. A decrease in dietary cholesterol would decrease the synthesis of primary bile acids.",B

To reach a near steady state more quickly requires a bolus be administered before the infusion is commenced (or increased). Remifentanil perhaps represents a paial exception to this general rule. Also, opioid concentrations will increase for many hours after an infusion is commenced; in other words, concentrations are typically increasing even though the infusion rate may have been the same for hours!

High airway resistance is seen in,Respiratory bronchiole,Intermediate bronchiole,Terminal bronchiole,Main bronchus,"Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is",Bell palsy,Muscular dystrophy,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"The paralysis of Guillain- Barre occurs about 10 days after a nonspecific viral illness. Weakness is gradual over days or weeks, beginning in the lower extremities and progressing toward the trunk. Later, the upper limbs and the bulbar muscles can become involved. Involvement of the respiratory muscles is life threatening. The syndrome seems to be caused by a demyelination in the motor and, occasionally, the sensory erves. Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis. Recovery is not always complete.

Which of the following is the best induction agent: September 2009,Ketamine,Diazepam,Nitrous oxide,Thiopentone,"Ans. D: Thiopentone Thiopental is an ultra-sho-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anaesthesia Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anaesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness.",D

Which drug of anesthetics causes hallucination,Ketamine,Trilene,Halothane,Trichioroethylene,"Ketamine causes postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A
A pt presents with acute rheumatic carditis with fever. True statements is,Increase troponin T,Reduced myocardial contractility,Signs of inflammation and necrosis,Valve replacement will ameliorate C.C.F.,"Valve replacement will ameliorate CCF The question is about carditis in Rheumatic .fever. carditis is one of the major criterias for the diagnosis of Rheumatic fever. Carditis Carditis occur in 50-60% patients with acute Rheumatic fever carditis and resultant chronic rheumatic hea disease are the most serious manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis is characterized by pancarditis with active inflammation of all the three layers of the hea : Myocardium - Pericardium - Endocardium Endocarditis Endocarditis (Valvulitis) which is manifested by one or more cardiac murmurs is universal findinv in rheumatic carditis whereas the presence of pericariditis or myocarditis is variable. Endocarditis or valvular damage is the hallmark of Rheumatic fever, the mitral valve is almost always affected sometimes together with Aoic valve. Serious and long tenn illness is entirely related to valvular hea disease. Pericarditis Pericarditis most commonly causes pericardial effusion which results in pleural friction rub on echocardiography and may occasionally cause pleuritic chest pain. Myocarditis Myocardial involvement is almost never responsible in itself for cardiac failure. Myocarditis perse plays little or any role in the morbidity of rheumatic fever. Evidence for absence of myocarditis playing any role in the morbidity and moality of rheumatic fever is based on the following. - Troponin 7(2-a marker of myocardial damage has been found not to increase during acute rheumatic .fever with carditis indicating absence of significant myocardial damage. - Radionuclide evaluations using antimyosin antibody indicates insignificant myocardial uptake (hence absence of significant damage) in the absence of pericarditis and C.C.F. - Myocardial biopsies during acute rheumatic fever with carditis have .failed to provide information regarding presence of myocarditis because of paucity of myocardial damage. - Echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricular function indicates that the myocardial contractility (the capacity of myocardium to contract) remains normalQ even in the presence of C.C.F. - Pathological evaluation (biopsy) of the myocardium indicates that the amount of myocardial damage is insufficient to explain the moality. - Surgical replacement of mitral and/or aoic valve during acute rheumatic fever results in rapid control of CCF and decrease in hea size, despite investigational evidence for ongoing active rheumatic .fever. The surgical findings thus indicate that it is the acute hemodynamic overload secondary to valvular regurgitation which is responsible .for CCF.",D

Vasopressor of choice in hypotension produced during sub-arachnoidblock,Ephedrine,Mephenteramine,Adrenaline,Dopamine,"A i.e. Ephedrine Most common complication of spinal anesthesia is hypotensionQ, which can be prevented by preloading with crystalloid. In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1.003 - 1.008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection,Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option.",A

Surgical treatment (ligation or stripping) is preferred for GSV diameter equal to or greater than,2 cm,3 cm,4 cm,5 cm,"SAPHENOFEMORAL LIGATION AND GREAT SAPHENOUS STRIPPING An oblique groin incision is made at the level of, and lateral to, the pubic tubercle, ideally above the groin crease. The GSV is identified and dissected to the SFJ, which should be clearly established before the vein is divided to avoid disastrous inadveent transection of the superficial femoral vein. The anatomy is often variable but six GSV tributaries may be encountered close to the SFJ: Laterally: * superficial inferior epigastric vein; * superficial circumflex iliac vein; Medially: * superficial external pudendal vein; * deep external pudendal vein; Distally: * anterior accessory saphenous vein; * posteriomedial thigh vein. Classically, these are ligated distal to their divisions. A flush SFJ ligation is then performed and the GSV retrogradely stripped to around the knee. Phlebectomy is performed as discussed above. Closure of the cribriform fascia, with sutures or synthetic patches over the ligated SFJ, does not reduce groin recurrence. Stripping to the lowest point of reflux may improve results, but at a cost of increased saphenous nerve complications and is not widely performed. More recently, some surgeons argue that surgical trauma and subsequent inflammation in the groin is associated with neovascularisation, which in turn may lead to recurrence. Fuhermore, others hypothesise that it is the loss of the normal groin tributaries that may be responsible for driving the process of neovascularisation. These concepts have led some to believe that ligation of the refluxing vein should be distal to the tributaries and that the junction itself should be left untouched. There is no clear clinical evidence to suppo these hypotheses. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 981",A

"Which of the following refinements of serum PSA is used to determine the need for TRUS guided biopsy of prostate, even though the level of serum PSA is still in normal range?",PSAD (prostate-specific antigen density),PSA velocity,Free/Total PSA,Complexed/Total PSA,"PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower ""upper"" limit of normal for younger males and higher ""upper"" limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0.15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0.75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the ""normal"" range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O .15, for complexed total PSA of <0.70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0.25 improved specificity in one study by 20%. These modifications are designed to reduce the frequency of biopsies in men without cancer.",B

Fastest acting agent,Sevoflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,None,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood. The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

Return of Bulbocavernous reflex in spinal shock,Sign of recovery from spinal shock,Paial lesion of spinal cord,Complete transection of spinal cord,Incomplete transection of spinal cord,"A i.e. Sign of recovery from spinal shock Spinal Shock Some times physical energy of the injury mechanism causes immediate depolarization of axonal membranes in the neural tissue. This results in functional neurological defecit that exceeds the actual tissue disruption. This condition is refered to as spinal shock. The presence of spinal shock causes the absence of all reflexesQ. And it typically lasts upto 24- 48 hours after the injuryQ. The bulbocavernosus reflex is the reflex that returns first, thus marking the end of spinal shockQ. This point has prognostic impoance because recovery from a complete neurological deficit that is still present at the end of spinal shock is extremely unlikely. In other words, a total absence of sensation & voluntary motor functions caudal to the level of spinal cord injury in the absence of spinal shock (i.e. bulbocavernosus reflex has recovered) is indicative of complete spinal cord injury and there is viually no likelihood of functional spinal cord recovery.",A

Which of the following substances is not used as an irrigant during transurethral resection of the prostate?,Normal Saline,1.5% Glycine,5% Dextrose,Distilled Water,"Ans. is (a) i.e. Normal Saline ""TUR is performed with a nonhemolytic fluid such as 1.5% glycine. Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate."" - Schwaz 8/e p1530 (not given in 9/e) During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of veru mon tan um. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & CI ions). So if it is used while performing TURF, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.) There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP. True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common Distilled water is being replaced by 1.5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available) Do not get confused by what is written in Bailey 241"" /e p. 1377, 1378 (23/e, p1245, 1246) - If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i.e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",A

Strictly it should be 'agenesis' and 'atresia' of the rectum and anus.)> One infant in 4500 is born with an imperforate anus, or with imperfect fusion of the post-allantoic gut with the proctodaeum.> The condition is divided into two main groups: the high and the low, depending on whether the termination of the bowel is above or below the pelvic floor.> Low varieties are easy to diagnose and relatively simple to treat, and the outlook is good.> High varieties often have a fistula into the urinary tract together with a deficient pelvic floor, and are difficult to treat.# Low abnormalities:> Covered anus. The underlying anal canal is covered by a bar of skin with atrack running forwards to the perineal raphe. The track should be opened with scissors, followed by routine dilatation of the anus.> Ectopic anus. The anus is situated anteriorly and may open in the perineum in boys, or more commonly in the vulva in girls, or rarely into thevagina. A plastic 'cut back' operation isrequired (Pena).> Stenosed anus. The anus is microscopic, but careful examination usually reveals a minute opening which responds to regular dilatation.> Membranous stenosis. Here the anus is normally sited, but is covered with a thin membrane which bulges with retained meconium. It is rare, and an incision will cure the condition.# High abnormalities:> These are often associated with a fistulous connection between the blind rectal stump and the bladder, or other abnormalities of the pelvic structures.> Anorectai agnesis. A blind rectal pouch lies just above the pelvic floor -- its anterior aspect in the male is attached to the bladder and often there is a rectovesical fistula manifested by the passage of gas or meconium in the urine. In the female, the fistula is usually into the posterior fornix.> Rectal atresia. The anal canal is normal but ends blindly at the level of the pelvic floor. The bowel also ends blindly above the pelvic floor without a fistulous opening. This anomaly is rare but must be treated by mobilisation of the rectum and excision of the stricture. After that, end-to-end anastomosis of the anus and rectum must be attempted.> More conservative measures are followed by an intractable stricture.> Cloaca.

What will you do for monitoring of treatment aEUR'",Venereal disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL),TPI,FTS-AB,ELISA,"VDRL The history of the patient suggests neurosyphilis. Diagnosis of Neurosvphilis No definitive tool / test exists to establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with 100% accuracy. Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C.S.F. finding and serological tests. C.S.F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - ""The VDRL C.S.F. test is the standard serological test for C.S.F. and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis"". -Since invasion of C.S.F by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C.S.F.. VDRL test can be performed on C.S.F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL*for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why ??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C.S.F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C.S.F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The CS.F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive .for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot he used in neurosyphilis.

Spondylolysis is more common in: March 2009,Interveebral disc,Anterior pa,Pars interaicularis,Annulus fibrosus,"Ans. C: Pars Interaicularis Normally the inferior aiculating fact of each lumbar veebral body lies posterior to the superior aiculating facet of the body below it. If the bony connection between the inferior and superior aiculating facets (pars interaicularis) is defective, the weight of the body may cause the upper veebra, including all of the veebral bodies above it, to slip forward for varying amounts on the body below (spondylolisthesis) The defect in the pars interaicularis is called spondylolysis Spondylolysis is not present at bih but increases in frequency with increasing age. When symptomatic, pain is the most frequent symptom of either spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis There are several different etiologies for spondylolisthesis: Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is the most common type and results from bilateral defects in the pars interaicularis. Degenerative spondylolisthesis -Most frequent at the L4-L5 level It is not the result of a pars defect but a complex interaction between the disk, facets joints and the ligamentous structures Dysplastic spondylolisthesis-Results from congenital abnormalities of the body and/or facets in the lumbar region such that the alignment of the facets allows spondylolisthesis to occur. The pars may or may not be intact Traumatic spondylolisthesis-Trauma can lead to an acute fracture through a normal pars interaicularis. Conventional radiography in the anteroposterior, lateral and both oblique projections is usually adequate to demonstrate both spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis Spondylolysis appears as a break in the ""neck"" of the Scottie Dog on the oblique view",C

Genu valgum is a condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. Normally, a child is born with genu varum. Therefore, neonates and infants normally have genu varum. When the infant begins to stand and walk, the lower limb straighten and this physiological genu varus disappear at around years of age. The leg become straight. Then, between the age of 2-3 years genu valgum stas developing gradually with maximum genu - valgum of 12deg at the age of 31/4 years. Finally genu-valgum spontaneously get corrected by the age of 7 years to that of normal adult genu valgum of 7 - 8deg. So upto 7 years, exagerated genu valgum is physiological.

Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007,Ankylosing spondylitis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Reiter's syndrome,Osteoahritis,"Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools.

Curative resections are rare. Therapy consists of diagnostic biopsy followed by radiotherapy to slow the tumor growth. The course of the disease progresses rapidly after presentation, with few patients living more than 2 years.",B

"Regarding propofol, which one of the following is false?",It is used as an intravenous induction agent,It causes severe vomiting,It is painful on injecting intravenously,It has no muscle relaxant propey,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., It causes severe vomiting Propofol Propofol is a milky white powder that is preservative free; therefore, it must be used within 6 hours. It is an oil based preparation, therefore injection is painful. Propofol is the most frequently used intravenous anaesthetic today.--Miller 6thie - 318 It can be used for both induction as well as maintenace. It does not possess anticonvulsive action (unlike thiopentone). It causes fall in BP and bradycardia. Like thiopental it does not possess muscle relaxant action. Propofol possess significant antiemetic and antipruritic action.-Miller 6th/e - 324 Propofol decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotoxis but not aherence, phagocytosis and killing (Thiopentone blocks all these) --) increased life threatning infections. Propofol is paicularly suitable for outpatient surgery. Intermittent injection or continuous infusion of propofol is frequently used for total Lv. anaesthesia (TINA) when supplemented by fentanyl. It is anaesthetics of choice for intubation in ICU and for patients with malignant hypehermia. Side effects - pain on injection, myoclonus, apnea, L BP and rarely thrombophlebitis. Propofol infusion syndrome A lethal syndrome, associated with infusion of propofol for 48 hours or longer. Occurs in children and critically ill.

True statements regarding Zenker's diverticulum include,Aspiration pneumonitis is unlikely,It is a congenital abnormality,The most common symptom is a sensation of high obstruction on swallowing,It is a traction-type diverticulum,"Zenker's diverticulum is an acquired abnormality. Premature contraction of the cricopharyngeus muscle on swallowing, which leads to partial obstruction, is believed to be the cause of this pulsion-type diverticulum of the pharyngoesophageal junction. High intraluminal pressure results in an outpouching of mucosa through the oblique fibers of the pharyngeal constrictors. Dysphagia is common and is the usual presenting symptom. The diagnosis is established by barium swallow. Treatment is surgical: diverticulectomy or suspension of the diverticulum is usually recommended. Because the diverticulum is located above the superior esophageal sphincter, no mechanism exists to prevent aspiration of the contents of the diverticulum. Pulmonary complications are common.",C
Pain during injection occurs all except,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,Etomidate,"Induction of anesthesia with propofol is often associated with pain on injection, apnea, hypotension, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the vein into which propofol is injected.Pain on injection is reduced by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, and adding lidocaine to the propofol solution or changing the propofol formulation. Multiple other drugs and distraction techniques have been investigated to reduce the pain on injection of propofol. Pretreatment with a small dose of propofol, opiates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ketamine, esmolol or metoprolol, magnesium, a flash of light, a clonidine-ephedrine combination, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide all have been tested with variable efficacy. Ketamine has been administered by the IV, intramuscular (IM), transcutaneous, oral, nasal, and rectal routes and as a preservative-free solution epidurally or intrathecally. Most clinical use involves the IV and IM routes, by which the drug rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations. The dose depends on the desired therapeutic effect and on the route of administration. There is no pain on injection. Although etomidate provides stable hemodynamics and minimal respiratory depression, it is associated with several adverse effects when it is used for induction, including nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, myoclonic movement, and hiccups. Etomidate has been associated with PONV. More recently, etomidate in a lipid emulsion was associated with equal or an increased incidence of postoperative nausea compared with propofol. The lipid formulation of etomidate is associated with a much less frequent incidence of pain on injection, thrombophlebitis, and histamine release. Pain on injection may be reduced by injecting IV lidocaine, 20 to 40 mg immediately before injection of etomidate. Ref: Millers anesthesia 8th edition",C

Not true about CPR?,Chest compressions at 100/min,Ratio 30:2,Chest compression > 6 inches,Breathing rate 8-10 breaths/min,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Chest compressions > 6 inches Management guidelines for CPR * The management of CPR should be done in following sequence: - A (Airway) - B (Breathing) - C (Circulation) - D (Defibrillation).* Management is divided into following parts: -A) Basic life support (Primary ABCD)# Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition of medical emergencies, activation of an emergency response system, and interventions made in response to sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, stroke and airway obstruction by a foreign body. ABCD of BLS are: -i) Airway management: - Most common cause of airway obstruction is tongue fall, i.e., tongue falling back on posterior pharyngeal wall and obstructing the airway. In BLS, this airway obstruction is managed manually: -a) Open mouth and clear airway if something is visible in oral cavity.b) Tilt the head backward (neck extension) and chin lift -> Head tilt and chin lift.c) Jaw thrust: - Mandible is pulled forward.# Note: In patient with cervical spine injury head tilt & chin lift is contraindicated and airway should be managed only by jaw thrust.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - After management of airway obstruction ventilation is provided. In BLS ventilation is provided by mouth to mouth or mouth to nose or bag and mask ventilation.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. It is done in supine position and compression over lower l/3rd of sternum is given by heel of two hands one locked over the other. The force generated during massage should be able to depress the sternum by 1 1/2 -2 inches (approximately 1/3 of chest wall diameter). The ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2(30 compressions followed by 2 breaths) irrespective of durationiv) Defibrillation: - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillatorB) Advanced life support (secondary ABCD)# Advanced airway support involves more advanced assessment and treatment. ABCD of advanced life support are: -i) Airway management: - Airway management is done by equipments like GuedeVs airway.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - Most definitive and best method of ventilation is endotracheal intubation. Other methods are LMA or tracheostomy. In severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation should be tried first, if orotracheal intubation is very difficult cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy can be used but only as a last resort.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. Compression will be continued at a rate of 100 compressions!minute and breathing at a rate of 8-10 breaths/minute with no synchronization, i.e., no pause for ventilation.iv) Defibrillation : - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillator.",C

Addisons's disease is associated with all except :,Cardiac atrophy,Decreased diastolic B.P.,Serum coisol < 8,Low renin levels,"low rennin levels 1 Ref Harrison 17th/e p 2264, 2263 & 16th/e p 2142] The normal serum coisol ranges between 5-23 lug/dl In addison's disease the coisol level is usually below (< 3 pg/dL). Patients tend to be hypotensive and ohostatic, about 90% have systolic blood pressure under 110 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure is also decreased, the B.P. is usually in the range of 80/50 or less. In addison's diseases the hea is usually smallQ. In addison's disease the plasma renin activity is usually elevated, - It indicates the presence of depleted intravascular volume. Addison's disease The predominant manifestations in Addison's disease occur due to mineralocoicoid deficiency but the symptoms are also contributed by glucocoicoid deficiency and increased ACTH FEATURES OF:- Mineralocoicoid deficiency lack of aldosterone secretion greatly decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorption and consequently allows sodium ions, chloride ions and water to be lost into urine in great profusion. The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia2, hyperkalemia0 and mild acidosis0 develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption. Glucocoicoid deficiency Loss of coisol secretion leads to hypoglycaemia because of decreased gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral utilization of glucose. Fuhermore, lack of coisol reduces0 the mobilization of both proteins and fats from the tissues thereby depressing many other metabolic functions of the body. This sluggishness of energy mobilization when coisol is not available is one of the major detrimental effects of glucocoicoid lack. Increased ACTH When coisol secretion is depressed the normal negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland is also depressed, therefore allowing tremendous rates of ACTH secretion as well as simultaneous secretion of increased amount of MSH. Probably the tremendous amount of ACTH cause most of the pigmenting effect because they can stimulate formation of melanin by the melanocytes in the same way that MSH does. REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen."" ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison's disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",D

Which of the following statements regarding symptomatic thyroglossal duct cysts is true?,Over 90% manifest themselves before age 12,Treatment includes resection of the hyoid bone,They usually present as a painful swelling in the lateral neck,Approximately 10-15% contain malignant elements,"Thyroglossal duct cysts result from retention of an epithelial tract between the thyroid and its embryologic origin in the foramen cecum at the base of the tongue. This tract usually penetrates the hyoid bone. There is no sex predilection, and although these cysts are more frequently detected in children, up to 25% do not become symptomatic until adulthood. The most common presentation is a painless swelling in the midline of the neck that moves with protrusion of the tongue or swallowing. The cysts are prone to infection and progressive enlargement. Although rare (less than 1%), epidermoid or papillary carcinomas do occur within thyroglossal duct cysts. Surgical resection is the standard therapy. The Sistrunk procedure, which involves local resection of the cyst and the central portion of the hyoid bone, is the operation of choice.

AV fistula leads to all except,Sinus tachycardia,Increased preload,Cardiac arrythmias,Increased cardiac output,"Pathophysiology of AV Fistula: When an aeriovenous fistula is formed involving a major aery like the abdominal aoa, it can lead to a large decrease in peripheral resistance. This lowered peripheral resistance causes the hea to increase cardiac output to maintain proper blood flow to all tissues. An aeriovenous fistula can increase preload. AV shunts also decrease the afterload of the hea. This is because the blood bypasses the aerioles which results in a decrease in the total peripheral resistance (TPR). AV shunts increase both the rate and volume of blood returning to the hea.",C
Tissue suturing glue contains-,Cyanoacrylate,Ethanolamine oleate,Methacrylate,Polychloroprene,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Cyanoacrylate o Most tissue adhesives or glue are cyanoacrylate polymers, such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl - PeriAcryl -) or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond - Surgiseal).o Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue,o Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair.Advantages:o Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injectiono More rapid application and repair timeo Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repairo Waterproof barriero Antimicrobial propertieso Better acceptance by patientso No need for suture removal or follow-upIndications and contraindications:o For use of tissue adhesives the wound needs to be clean, dry with near perfect hemostasis and under no tension,o Complex stellate lesions or crush injuries should not be closed with tissue adhesives since good wound approximation is difficult to achieve.o Tissue adhesives are not recommended for lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, since repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved.o Tissue adhesives are not recommended for the oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces or areas of high moisture such as the axillae and perineum.o Lacerations involving the hairline or vermilion border require more precision, and should be repaired with traditional sutures.",A

One of the following is characterised by RIM sign ?,Hydronephrosis (Gross),Hypernephroma,Chronic pyelonephritis,Polycystic kidney,"Ans is 'a' ie Hydronephrosis (Gross) We will write down, what we have got so far about the 'rim sign'. The rim sign is seen in cases of ureteral calculi. [The ""rim sign,"" originally repoed by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Reff*",A

The management of Colonic injuries in latest edition of Schwaz is: Currently 3 methods for managing the colonic injuries are used? a. Primary repair (it includes lateral suture repair or resection of the damaged segment with reconstruction by ileocolostomy or colocolostomy) b. End colostomy c. Primary reapir with diveing ileostomy Various trials have proven that the Primary repair is safe and effective in viually all patients with penetrating wounds. Schwaz writes- ""Numerous large retrospective and several prospective studies have now clearly demonstrated that primary repair is safe and effective in viually all patients with penetrating wounds. Colostomy is still appropriate in a few patients, but the current dilemma is how to select which patients should undergo the procedure. Currently, the overall physiologic status of the patient, rather than local factors, directs decision making. Patients with devastating left colon injuries requiring damage control are clearly candidates for temporary colostomy. Ileostomy with colocolostomy, however, is used for most other high-risk patients.""",B

"A 25-year-old man is involved in an automobile accident with resultant injuries including bilateral closed femur fractures, left pulmonary contusion, and closed head injury. On post-injury day 4, significant upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage begins. Endoscopic examination reveals an area of confluent ulceration with bleeding in the gastric fundus. Endoscopic hemostasis fails. Appropriate immediate management includes:",Lavage of gastric contents with iced saline,Urgent total gastrectomy,Selective aerial infusion of vasopressin the left gastric aery,Inseion of Sangstaken-Blakemore balloon,"Initial effos to control gastric hemorrhage consist of gastric lavage using warmed saline. Lavage serves to fragment existing clots and to remove any pooled blood, reducing fibrinolysis at bleeding sites. Over 80% of patients who present with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage stop bleeding using this approach. Definitive treatment of ongoing acute active stress bleeding by antacids is largely unsuccessful. Administration of H2-receptor blocking agents once active gastrointestinal bleeding has commenced is also usually ineffective as a definitive form of therapy. The endoscope has become the preferred therapeutic as well as diagnostic instrument with electrocautery and laser photocoagulation capabilities. If endoscopic therapy fails, angiography offers an additional means for the control of bleeding by selective infusion of vasopressin into the splanchnic circulation the left gastric aery. Vasopressin is administered by continuous infusion through the catheter at a rate of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/min for a maximum of 48 to 72 hours. About 10% to 20% of patients with acute stress ulcers continue to bleed or have recurrent bleeding despite these measures. In these patients, total gastrectomy has a moality ranging from 17% to 100%.

The prophylaxis can be mechanical or pharmacological. Prophylaxis for DVT Mechanical prophylaxis include Early ambulation Pneumatic compression devices * * * It is the simplest method of prophylaxis It acts by activating the calf pump mechanism It is the most common method of prophylaxis * Pneumatic compresses prevents the stasis by periodically compressing the calves Pharmacological prophylaxis includes: Use of unfractionated heparin * Now being replaced by fractionated low molecular weight hepatin Use of fractionated low molecular * Better efficacy than unfractionated heparin weight heparin * No laboratory monitoring is necessary Comparison of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with mechanical prophylaxis demonstrates superiority of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in reduction of the development of venous thromboembolic disease. Prospective trials evaluating LMWH in head injured and trauma patients have also proven safety of LMWH with no increase in intracranial bleeding or major bleeding at other sites. In addition, LMWH shows significant reduction in the development of venous thromboembolism compared to other methods. In sho, LMWH should be considered the optimal method of prophylaxis in moderate and high risk patients. Even the traditional reluctance to use heparin in high risk groups such as the multiply injured trauma patient and the injured patient must be reexamined, given the efficacy and safety profile of LMWH in multiple prospective trials.",C

Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebrae from cancers that originate in the lungs, breasts, prostate gland, kidneys, or thyroid gland. Metastases compress the spinal cord or nerve roots from the outside. Lymphomas may also spread to the spine and compress the spinal cord.> Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, possibly causing additional symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence. Spread to the lymph nodes can cause a swelling or lump, either under your arm or in another part of the body. If the lymph nodes in your armpit are affected, your hand and arm may swell. Secondary breast cancer in the bone can cause aching or pain in the affected bone. If the breast cancer has spread to your liver you may feel ill and tired. Women with secondary breast cancer in their lungs usually first notice a cough, or find that they get short of breath easily. If a secondary breast cancer develops in the brain, you may have headaches and feel sick. Secondary spinal cord tumors, which are more common, are metastases of cancer originating in another part of the body and thus are always cancerous. Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebrae from cancers that originate in the lungs, breasts, prostate gland, kidneys, or thyroid gland. Metastases compress the spinal cord or nerve roots from the outside. Lymphomas may also spread to the spine and compress the spinal cord. The liver is a common site for other gastrointestinal cancers to spread to, particularly colorectal cancer, resulting in so-called secondary deposits or metastatic cancer",C

Insulinoma is most commonly located in which pa of the pancreas -,Head,Body,Tail,Equally distributed,"Ans is 'd' i.e. is equally distributed Insulinomas invariably occur only in the pancreas, distributed equally in the pancreatic head, body and tail"". -- Harrison 17/e * Insulinomas are a cell endocrinal tumur of the pancreas. * Insulinomas are the most common pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. The symptoms are produced due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia Most of the insulinomas are solitary and benign, Only about 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. (keep in mind that all other endocrine tumours of pancreas are usually malignant). Symptoms of insulinoma ? - The most common symptom is due to the effect of hypoglycemia on the central nervous system. - These symptoms are - confusion, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, coma Other symptoms are due to increased secretion of catecholamines which includes sweating, tremor and palpitations. Classic diagnostic criteria is - Whipple's triad - Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting. - Blood glucose below 2.8 mmol/L (50mg/d1) during symptomatic episodes. - Relief of symptoms by intravenous administration of Glucose. The most useful diagnostic test and the only one indicated in almost all patients is demonstration of fasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately high level of insulin. - The patient is fasted for 72 hrs or till the symptoms of hypoglycemia develop. - When hypoglycemia develops, serum level of insulin is measured. A ratio of plasma insulin to glucose > 0.3 is diagnostic. Localization of the tumour Once the diagnosis has been made, localization of the tumour is must for surgery. The most impoant examination for localization of tumour is intraoperative ultrasound, which can indentify pancreatic tumour in all cases. It is more sensitive than any other method Other impoant methods of localization ? High resolution CT and MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound examination of pancreas. - Selective aeriography T/T - Surgical excision is the t/t of choice ? - Since most insulinomas are benign simple enucleation is done.",D

Most common cause of painful defecation is associated with,Fissure in ano,Fistula in ano,External haemorrhoid,Internal haemorrhoid,"ANAL FISSURE Definition An anal fissure (synonym: fissure-in-ano) is a longitudinal split in the anoderm of the distal anal canal, which extends from the anal verge proximally towards, but not beyond, the dentate line. Clinical features Although simple epithelial splits, acute anal fissures are, because of their location involving the exquisitely sensitive anoderm, characterised by severe anal pain associated with defaecation, which usually resolves spontaneously after a variable time only to recur at the next evacuation, as well as the passage of fresh blood, normally noticed on the tissue after wiping. Chronic fissures are characterised by a hyperophied anal papilla internally and a sentinel tag externally (both consequent upon attempts at healing and breakdown), between which lies the slightly indurated anal ulcer overlying the fibres of the internal sphincter. When chronic, patients may also complain of itching secondary to irritation from the sentinel tag, discharge from the ulcer or discharge from an associated intersphincteric fistula, which has arisen through infection penetrating the fissure base. Although most sufferers are young adults, the condition can affect any age, from infants to the elderly. Men and women are affected equally. Anterior fissures account for about 10% of those encountered in women (and many of these may occur postpaum) but only 1% in men. A fissure sited elsewhere around the anal circumference or with atypical features should raise the suspicion of a specific aetiology, and the inability to be able to conduct an adequate examination in the clinic should prompt early examination under anaesthesia, with biopsy and culture to exclude Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related ulcers (syphilis, Chlamydia, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, HSV, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma, B-cell lymphoma) and squamous cell carcinoma.

Sister Joseph Nodules are present at: March 2005,Umbilicus,Diaphragm,Lung,Liver,"Ans. A: Umbilicus Sister Mary Joseph nodule/node/ Sister Mary Joseph sign, refers to a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus as a result of metastasis of a malignant cancer in the pelvis or abdomen. Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about half of underlying sources (most commonly gastric cancer, colonic cancer or pancreatic cancer, mostly of the tail and body of the pancreas), and men are even more likely to have an underlying cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Gynecological cancers account for about 1 in 4 cases (primarily ovarian cancer and also uterine cancer). Unknown primary tumors and rarely, urinary or respiratory tract malignancies cause umbilical metastases. Proposed mechanisms for the spread of cancer cells to the umbilicus include direct transperitoneal spread, the lymphatics which run alongside the obliterated umbilical vein, hematogenous spread, or remnant structures such as the falciform ligament, median umbilical ligament, or a remnant of the vitelline duct. Sister Joseph nodule is associated with multiple peritoneal metastases and a poor prognosis. Virchow's node (or signal node) is an enlarged, hard, left supraclavicular lymph node which can contain metastasis of visceral (abdominal) malignancy.",A

"A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent.She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Persistent foramen ovale,Patent ductus aeriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Pulmonary stenosis,"Patent ductus aeriosus.The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-likemurmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",B

Inhalat ional anesthetic agent of choice in children is?,Sevoflurane,Methoxyflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sevoflurane * Unlike desflurane, sevoflurane poses no problem in induction, acceptability is good even in pediatric patients.* Therefore, sevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for induction.Anesthesia in Children -InductionInhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",A
All are indications for penile angiography except,Painful priapism,Peyronie's disease,Erectile dysfunction,Aerio-venous malformation,"Priapism Priapism means a persistent erection lasting longer than 4 hours and it is a surgical emergency. There are two main types of priapism. ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM Ischaemic or venogenic priapism is the commoner and is due to venous congestion, with consequent thrombosis and ischaemia. The penis remains erect and becomes painful. This is a pathological erection and the glans penis and corpus spongiosum are not involved. The condition is most commonly seen as a side effect of medication, most notably antipsychotic medication and intracavernosal injections, but it can also arise as complication of a hypercoagulable blood disorders such as sickle cell disease or leukaemia. A tiny propoion of cases are caused by malignant disease in the corpora cavernosa or the pelvis. The clinical features are of a painful erection not involving the glans penis. Blood taken from the penis shows hypoxia, hyercapnoea and acidosis, while Doppler scanning shows an absence of blood flow within the penis. An underlying cause should be excluded and the patient should be referred for specialist urological care. Treatment is an emergency, since delay beyond 6 hours results in progressive, irreversible damage to the corpus cavernosal tissue with subsequent fibrosis and ED. Aspiration of the sludged blood in the corpora cavernosa is the first-line therapy but if this fails, then intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine (an alpha adrenoceptor agonist) is the next line of therapy. If that proves ineffective, it may be necessary to decompress the penis by creating a shunt between the corpus cavernosum and either the glans penis or the corpus spongiosum. Treatment initiated after 24-36 hours rarely restores normal erectile function. NON-ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM This rarer form of priapism arises as a consequence of traumatic damage to the central penile aery, usually as a consequence of blunt perineal trauma. A fistula develops between the aery and the sinusoidal space, which results in a persistent erection that is painless, in contrast to the ischaemic priapism. Blood gas analysis shows the characteristics of aerial blood and Doppler scanning and selective aeriography will demonstrate the fistula. Treatment is not an emergency, since there is no ischaemia, and is most appropriate achieved by selective aerial embolisation. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1491",A

After Hyperventilating for some time holding the breath is dangerous because –,Decrease CO2 shift the O2 dissociation curve to the left,Alkalosis can lead to tetany,It can lead to CO2 Narcosis,"Due to lack of stimulation by CO2, anoxia can go into dangerous levels","In our body its not O2, but CO2 that maintains the respiratory drive (though main function of respiration is to maintain adequate oxygen level in the body)
Thus its not hypoxia but hypercarbia that is required to inform the brain that respiration is inadequate.
If normally a person holds his breath he will soon have decrease O2 level (hypoxia) and increase CO2 level (hypercarbia)
Hypercarbia will stimulate the brain and increase the respiratory drive, forcing the person to take breath.

Lets see what happens when a person hyperventilates

Decreased PaCO2 of blood
Normal O2 saturation (despite hyperventilation arterial O2 saturation remains same as blood is almost fully saturated at normal ventilation rate)

Lets see what happens when such a person holds his breath.
● Soon his blood O2, level will fall (hypoxia) but his blood CO2 level will be normal or below normal (as he was hypocapnic due to hyperventilation)
● His blood O2 level will continue to fall, but his CO2 level will still be not high enough to stimulate the brain for respiratory drive.

The person will continue to hold his breath and his O2 level may fall to lethal levels without any respiratory drive (his brain is still unaware that he is in danger of dying from hypoxia).",D

Bailey and Love 24th ed., 64.4)IDIOPATHIC RETROPERITONEAL FIBROSIS (Ormand's disease)# a rare condition in which one or both ureters become bound up in a progressive fibrosis of the retroperitoneal tissues.# The cause is unknown although some cases may be drug related.# A similar clinical picture occurs in patients with leaking aortic aneurysm and infiltrating retroperitoneal malignancy.# The patient complains of backache which is unremitting for several months, n ESR is markedly raised.# The onset of anuria and renal failure prompts investigation of the renal tract which reveals hydronephrosis.# The excretion urogram typically shows displacement of the obstructed ureters towards the midline.# The appearances on CT are diagnostic.# Treatment- It may be possible to insert ureteric stents as a temporary measure while renal function recovers.- If not, percutaneous nephrostomies will allow the obstructed kidneys to drain.- Some patients need renal replacement by dialysis.- Some advocate that these patients should be treated conservatively with high-dose steroids.- Surgical treatment involves careful dissection of the ureters from their entrapment (ureterolysis).- Wrapping omentum around the freed ureters make recurrent obstruction less likely.Educational Points:RUPTURE OF THE URETER# Injury during pelvic surgery is far more common.# Occurs most often during vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy.# Preliminary catheterisation of the ureters prevents such accidents.# Repair of the injured ureter- If there is no loss of length and the cut ends of the ureter can be brought together without tension, they should be joined by a spatulated anastomosis over a double pigtail catheter.- If the division is very low down, the bladder wall may be hitched up so that the ureter can be reimplanted into it. Extra length may be obtained by mobilising the kidney.- Boari's operation. A flap of bladder wall is fashioned into a tube to replace the lower ureter.- The ureter may be implanted end to side into the contralateral ureter. The disadvantage of a transureteroureterostomy is that it risks converting a unilateral injury into a bilateral one.- Occasionally, when conservation of all renal tissue is vital, replacement of the damaged ureter by a segment of ileum is necessary.- Nephrectomy may be the best course when the patient's outlook is poor and the other kidney is normal.",A

In addition to fever during anesthesia, the syndrome includes tachycardia, increased O2 consumption, increased CO2 production, increased serum K+ , myoglobinuria, and acidosis. Rigidity rather than relaxation following succinylcholine injection may be the first clue to its presence. Treatment of malignant hypehermia should include prompt conclusion of the operative procedure and cessation of anesthesia, hyperventilation with 100% O2 , and administration of intravenous dantrolene. The urine should be alkalinized to protect the kidneys from myoglobin precipitation.

Emergence delirium is associated with,Pentothal sodium,Ketamine,Droperidol,Halothane,"Ketamine causes postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Most patients with goiter are euthyroid (nonfunctional goiter), as hypehyroidism (toxic goiter') is relatively rare, in the early stages of goiter formation, there is diffuse hyperplasia of the small thyroid follicles, which histologically resembles the changes of Graves disease. This early stage is called a diffuse nontoxic goiter or simple goiter. * The thyroid gland then undergoes repeated episodes of involution and hyperplasia. Over time this produces an enlarged multinodular goiter that histologically consists of multiple nodules, some of which consist of colloid-filled enlarged follicles and others of which show hyperplasia of small follicles lined by active epithelium. * There are also areas of fibrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, and cystic degeneration.

True about the Oculocardiac reflex includes following EXCEPT:,Mediated by trigeminovagal route,Preperative glycopyrolate is not helpful for prevetion,Induced by pressure on eye ball,Mediated by traction on medial rectus,"Ans. B. Preperative glycopyrolate is not helpful for prevention. (Ref. Miller's Anesthesia 7th/Pg. 293; Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 1327).A variety of stimuli arising in or near the eye especially following traction on the medial rectus or pressure on the eye ball may cause bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In clinical practice this oculocardiac reflex (Trigeminovagal reflex) is most often encountered during squint surgery in children. OCR is also seen during eye muscle surgery, repair of detached retina, compression of gasserian ganglion 13, enucleation of eye and by contact lens and repair of nasal fracture under General Anaesthesia. Prophylactic anti cholinergic is recommended and adequate cardiac monitoring must accompany these interventions as immediate action may be required. OCR may be manifest by bradycardia, bigeminey, ectopic beats, nodal rhythm, AV block and cardiac arrest.Oculocardiac Reflex (Trigeminovagal Reflex)# Bernard Aschner and Guiseppe Dagnini first described the oculocardiac reflex in 1 908. This reflex is triggered by pressure on the globe and by traction on the extraocular muscles, as well as on the conjunctiva or the orbital structures.# This reflex is clinically significant during strabismus surgery in children, although the manifestations of this reflex are not consistent. The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is induced by pressure on the eyeball.# The afferent pathway follows the long and short ciliary nerves to the ciliary ganglion. From there, it travels to the gasserian ganglion body along the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The afferent pathway ends in the main trigeminal sensory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle.# Efferent impulses start at the vasomotor center and travel through the vagal nerve (CN X) and the sympathetic chain. Bradycardia is the result of increasing parasympathetic tone. Decreasing sympathetic tone causes vasodilatation.# The cardiac effect stops when eye pressure is relieved. Patients should be monitored to recognize ECG changes. Atropine should be available to reverse life-threatening bradycardia.",B

All are true regarding Xenon anesthesia except,Slow induction and recovery,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side-effects,Low blood solubility,"Xenon is a ""noble"" gas that has long been known to have anesthetic propeies. It is an ine element that does not form chemical bonds. It is an odorless, nonexplosive, naturally occurring gas with a MAC of .71 and a blood/gas coefficient of 0.115, giving it very fast onset and emergence parameters. Xenon's anesthetic effects seem to be mediated by NMDA inhibition by competing with glycine at the glycine binding site. Xenon seems to have little effect on cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal systems and has been found to be protective against neuronal ischemia. Cost and limited availability have prevented its widespread use.

Cause of paradoxical aciduria

Initially the kidney compensate for metabolic alkalosis by reabsorbing hydrogen and chloride ions in exchange for sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. But gradually as the body stores of sodium and especially potassium become depleted, kidney starts retaining these ions in exchange of hydrogen ions. thus the urine becomes acidic and metabolic alkaline state is further aggravated.",C

Diffusion hypoxia is a type of ...............hypoxia,Anemic,Histotoxic,Stagnant,Hypoxic,"Hypoxic hypoxia also called aerial hypoxiais a result of insufficient oxygen available to the lungs. Diffusion hypoxia occurs during recovery from nitrous oxide anesthesia when nitrous oxide is suddenly cut off. Nitrous oxide diffuses from the blood to the alveoli and replaces the oxygen which reduces alveolar O2 concentration, resulting in relative hypoxemia. This can be avoided by providing supplemental O2 for the first 10 minutes of recovery. Diffusion hypoxia is less common with xenon because its rate of diffusion from the blood to the alveoli is slower.",D

(Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced).* The pathogenesis of Achlasia is poorly understood.* It involves:# Neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach'smyentric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophagealvagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus)# Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxideand vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease.* Asa result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findings# Both sexes are equally affected # May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.# Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.# Regurgitation and Pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.# Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.# Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propuloine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.Diagnosis# Chest x-ray - shows absence of gastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.# Barium swallow - shows dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'birds' beak' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower two thirds of esophagus.# Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achlasiaeg. carcinoma, stricture at LES.Manometry# It's the most confrmatory investigation# it is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophagus# Manometric characteristics of Achlasia* Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (< 75% relaxation)* Elevated LES pressure* Loss of primary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present.* Increased intraesophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline.* Cholecystokinin (CCK) which normally causes a fall in the sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of the LES (the CCK test). This paradoxical response occurs because, in achlasia the neurally transmitted inhibitory effect of CCK is absent owing to the loss of inhibitory neurons.",B

Crystalloid required for replacement of 300ml of blood loss is:,300ml,600ml,900ml,1200ml,"For crystalloid replacement ratio is 3:1 For colloid replacement ratio is 1:1 Distribution of Body fluids. Total body fluid accounts for about 60% of the lower body weight in male and 50% of the lower body weight in females. Intracellular fluids accounts for 40% of total body fluids and extracellular accounts for 20% of which only 5% is intravascular. Thus volume of blood accounts for 6% to 7% of body weight and only 11-12% of total body fluid. The meager distribution of total body fluid in the vascular compament is an impoant factor in the intolerance to blood loss. Plasma vs interstitial fluid Extracellular fluid accounts for about 20% of the total body fluid, and is composed of extra vascular (interstitial) and intravascular (plasma) fluid compament Comparison of interstitial fluid and plasma volumes Plasma volume is about 25% of interstitial fluid volume. This relation is impoant for understanding volume effects of two types of fluid crystalloids and colloids. Crystalloid achieves a rapid equilibrium throughout the extracellular fluid compament thus only 25% remains intravascular 75% distribute in extracellular space.

Merkel cell carcinoma is due to,Cytokeratin: 7,Cytokeratin: 19,Cytokeratin: 20,Cytokeratin: 18,"Cytokeratin 20: *Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive, primary skin cancer exhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation. oThe histogenesis of MCC is controversial. Possible cells of origin include the epidermal MC, a dermal MC equivalent, a neural-crest- derived cell of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, and a residual epidermal stem cell. oCytogenetic abnormalities are present in 30-47% of MCCs. The most frequent change is loss of heterozygosity due to translocations or deletions of chromosome 1; specifically, 2 distinct regions in the most distal band 1 p36 on the sho arm of chromosome 1are implicated in MCC. Similar abnormalities near this site occur in several neuro cystic tumors, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. Other abnormalities described in MCC include losses at chromosomes 3, 13, and 22 and paial trisomy 01 chromosomes 1, 11, 18, and X. Unlike neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung, gene amplifications are rare in cutaneous MCC. oCytokeratin 20 is expressed in a dot like paranuclear or crescentic pattern; other low molecular weight (MW) cytokeratin antibodies (E.g., CAM5.2, MNF116), white less specific, react in a similar localization pattern. oElectron microscopic findings are char9- cteristic, revealing a lobulated nucleus that may contain rodlets. The cytoplasm is electron- lucent and contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous ribosomes. Intermediate filaments are numerous and often assume a parallel or whorled arrangement near the nucleus, accounting for the dot like pattern of cytokeratin distribution visualized by immunohistochemistry. Desmosomes may be present. Most diagnostic is the dense core granule (80-120 mn in diameter), the source and the locus of the neuroendocrine peptides.",C

Percentage of Halothane metabolized -,50%,5%,2.50%,25%,"The extent and location of inhaled anesthetic metabolism depends on multiple chemical factors. Inhaled anesthetics undergo varying degrees of biotransformation in various tissues. Methoxyflurane undergoes by far the greatest metabolism, estimated at 70%, and experiments indicate that only a small fraction of drug taken up into body tissues is exhaled. Given the remarkable lipophilicity of methoxyflurane, respiratory clearance of this drug from muscle and fat extends over a period of days. Halothane is the next most lipophilic drug and ranks second in metabolic clearance. Thus, prolonged residence in body tissues is an impoant factor in the biotransformation of inhaled anesthetics. Chemical stability is another impoant factor. Of the major organs involved in anesthetic biotransformation, the liver and kidneys are exposed to the highest metabolite concentrations and thus are most susceptible to damage from toxic metabolites. Clinically significant hepatotoxicity is primarily associated with exposure to halothane, and nephrotoxicity is associated with methoxyflurane. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition",D
Frey's procedure is done for,Meckel's diveicual,Auriculotemporal neuropathy,Ulcerative colitis,Chronic pancreatitis,"Treatment of chronic pancreatitis Most of the patients can be managed medically. There is no single therapeutic agent that can relieve symptoms Endoscopic, radiological or surgical interventions are indicated mainly to relieve obstruction of the pancreatic duct, bile duct or the duodenum, or in dealing with complications (e.g. pseudocyst, abscess, fistula, ascites or variceal haemorrhage). Decompressing an obstructed pancreatic duct can provide pain relief in some patients (the assumption is that ductal hypeension causes the pain). Endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy might be beneficial in patients with papillary stenosis and a high sphincter pressure and pancreatic ductal pressure. Patients with a dominant pancreatic duct stricture and upstream dilatation may benefit by placement of a stent across the stricture. The stent should be left in for no more than 4-6 weeks as it will block. The complication rate is high, and less than two-thirds of patients experience pain relief, but those who do get relief may benefit from a surgical bypass. Pancreatic duct stones maybe extracted at ERCP, and this may sometimes be combined with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Pseudocysts may be drained internally under EUS guidance. Percutaneous or transgastric drainage of pseudocysts under ultrasound or CT guidance may be performed. The role of surgery is to overcome obstruction and remove mass lesions. Some patients have a mass in the head of the pancreas, for which either a pancreatoduodenectomy or a Beger procedure (duodenum-preserving resection of the pancreatic head) is appropriate. If the duct is markedly dilated, then a longitudinal pancreatojejunostomy or Frey procedure can be of value. The natural evolution of the disease may not be altered significantly, but around half the patients get long-term pain relief. The rare patient with disease limited to the tail will be cured by a distal pancreatectomy. Patients with intractable pain and diffuse disease may plead for a total pancreatectomy in the expectation that removing the offending organ will relieve their pain. How- ever, one should keep in mind that pancreatic function and quality of life are significantly impaired after this procedure, and the operative moality rate is not tril. Moreover, there is no guarantee of pain relief (approximately a third of patients get resolution, a third show some benefit, and a third see no benefit at all). Total pancreatectomy and islet auto- transplantation has been repoed in selected patients, but it is difficult to demonstrate any overall benefit. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1231",D
Which of the following is a side effect of vagotomy?,Delayed gastric emptying,Gastric atony,Diarrhea,All of the above,"Ans. (d) All of the abovePost Vagotomy Complications:1. Post vagotomy diarrhea:# About 30% or more of patients suffer from diarrhea after gastric surgery.# Most patients with post-vagotomy diarrhea have their symptoms resolve over time, treatment should be symptomatic.2. Post vagotomy gastric atony:# After vagotomy, gastric emptying is delayed. This is true for both truncal and selective vagotomies but not in the case of highly selective or parietal cell vagotomy.# With selective or truncal vagotomy, patients lose antral pump function and therefore have a reduction in their ability to empty solids3.

Which is NOT true about femoral aery cannulation?,Common femoral aery is cannulated,Single wall puncture is indicated in those with normal coagulation profile,Femoral aery is catheterised at medial third of femoral head,Seldinger technique is used both for femoral aery and vein,"Single wall puncture is indicated in those with normal coagulation profile Single wall puncture is indicated in those with coagulopathy as there is more risk of bleeding in double wall puncture technique. Aerial access is obtained for hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure monitoring, blood gases monitoring) in an intensive care unit, or for the purpose of aeriography and intervention as in vascular surgical patients. The femoral aery is one of the most frequently cannulated aeries in the body. It is commonly used for aerial access for the purpose of aeriography in the vascular surgical patient. It is a large-caliber vessel that is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. It is also commonly used in cardiac catheterization for the purpose of coronary angiography and for coronary interventions. The radial aery is the most frequently used site of aerial cannulation for hemodynamic monitoring because it is technically easy to cannulate and has a low complication rate, in pa due to the good collateral circulation of the hand. The femoral aery is the second most cannulated aery for haemodynamic monitoring. It provides a more accurate estimation of central (aoic) pressure than the radial aery. Its large-caliber is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. Femoral aery catheter complications are infrequent but are more complicated than that of the radial aery. For femoral aerial access, the puncture is made in the common femoral aery. A puncture site above the inguinal ligament, in the external iliac aery, or distally in the superficial femoral or profunda femoris aery is problematic. Disadvantage of external iliac aery: - The external iliac aery is located in the retroperitoneal space, making this aery difficult, to compress and achieve postprocedure hemostasis. (a puncture in this region can result in potentially catastrophic complication of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.) Disadvantage with superficial femoral or external iliac aery: - these aeries are substantially smaller in caliber and have a higher incidence of postprocedure thrombosis. - higer incidence of pseudoaneurysm - Additionally, the superficial .femoral aery is often heavily diseased. Localization of Common femoral aery (CFA): The CFA begins immediately behind the inguinal ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. (A line connecting these two bony structures represents the inguinal ligament) Just below the inguinal ligament (one to two fingerbreadths distal to the inguinal ligament) the aery is closest to the surface of the skin and easily accessible. This is the optimal location of cannulation. The femoral aery is identified in the inguinal region by its pulsation. If fluoroscopy is being used, the femoral aery is typically located over the medial third of the femoral head. Note that the groin crease is unreliable in locating the ideal site of puncture and should not be used as a landmark. Femoral aery cannulation can be done using the Seldinger technique. The Seldinger technique is a medical procedure to obtain safe access to blood vessels (both aeries and veins) and other hollow organs. There are two methods of aerial wall puncture: the double-wall puncture and the single-wall puncture. The double-wall puncture involves penetrating both the anterior and posterior walls with the needle and then withdrawing the needle slowly until pulsatile blood flow is confirmed. This method is associated with a higher incidence of complications but is relatively easier. In the single-wall puncture technique, only the anterior wall of the aery is punctured with the needle, which is confirmed by pulsatile blood flow through the needle. Single wall puncture is usually the recommended technique. These two techniques can be used interchangeably and depends on the operator's preference, however-Single wall puncture is indicated in patients with coagulopathy or if thrombolysis is planned because of the increased risk of bleeding in double wall technique. Complications of femoral aery cannulation: - haemorrhage - Aeriovenous.fistulae - aerial dissection - pseudoaneurysm - aerial thrombosis",B

Most common presentation of Wilm's tumour?,Fever,Hematuria,Abdominal mass,UTI,"Ans. C. Abdominal mass. (Ref. Robin's Pathology 8th/pg. 271; Love and Bailey 26th/pg.l24; 1304).Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour)# Usually presents in the first five years of life# Typically presents with an abdominal mass# May cause haematuria, abdominal pain or fever# It extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs.# Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery.Wilms' tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from 1 to 4 years. A mutation in the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene (WT1) is responsible for some cases. It usually presents as an abdominal mass. The tumour extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs. Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery. Survival depends on tumour spread, completeness of surgical excision and histology but exceeds 70% even among patients with advanced tumours.Wilms' Tumor (nephroblastoma)# Most common primary tumor of the kidney in children.# malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from one to four years. Following are associated with an increased risk of developing Wilms' tumor:- WAGR syndrome: aniridia, genital abnormalities, and mental retardation, have a 33% chance of developing Wilms' tumor.- Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS):extremely high risk (?90%) of developing Wilms' tumor. Characterized by gonadal dysgenesis and renal abnormalities.- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS): enlargement of individual body organs (e.g., tongue, kidneys, or liver) or entire body segments (hemihypertrophy); enlargement of adrenal cortical cells (adrenal cytomegaly) is a characteristic microscopic feature. BWS is an example of a disorder of genomic imprinting. The genetic locus that is involved in these patients is in band pi5.5 of chromosome 11 distal to the WT1 locus.- Microscopically, Wilms' tumors are characterized by recognizable attempts to recapitulate different stages of nephrogenesis. The classic triphasic combination of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial cell types is observed in most lesions. Sheets of small blue cells, with few distinctive features, characterize the blastemal component.- Nephrogenic rests are putative precursor lesions of Wilms' tumors.- The prognosis for Wilms' tumor is generally very good, and excellent results are obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy.- Anaplasia is a harbinger of adverse prognosis, but careful analyses by the National Wilms' T\imor Study group in the United States have shown that as long as the anaplasia is focal and confined within the resected nephrectomy specimen, the outcome is no different from tumors without evidence of anaplasia. In contrast, Wilms' tumor with diffuse anaplasia the prognosis is poor.Additional Educational points:Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of neuroblasts in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia and typically presents as an abdominal or paravertebral mass. It metastasises to lymph nodes, bones and liver and causes elevated urinary catechola- mines. Small-localised tumours are excised. More advanced tumours are treated by chemotherapy and surgery. Survival is related to tumour biology and stage (>90% for small localised tumours, < 50% for advanced tumours).Neuroblastoma is the most common abdominal tumor of infancy. It is much less common than the relatively common hydronephrosis. The most common abdominal mass in a newborn infant is hydronephrosis. It is a common finding in prenatal ultrasounds. It will usually resolve without therapy. Hepatomas and Wilms tumors are even rarer than neuroblastoma.",C

"The study of human relationships and of human behavior for better understanding of the pattern of human life, is called:",Anthropology,Social Psychology,Social epidemiology,Sociology,"Sociology Sociology can be viewed from two angles: (a) First, it can be seen as the study of relationships between human beings, and how these relationships change or vary in different pas of the world and at different times. The unit of study can be a small group (e.g., family) consisting of parents and children, or the study can extend beyond the family or small groups into the complex society where a greater number of people interact and interdependent in terms of economics, political power, general organization and ways of living. (b) The other pa of sociology is concerned with the study of human behaviour. Human behaviour is determined not merely by biological and physical environmental factors but also by social factors. Every form of human behaviour has a social component. Sociologists are interested in the study of the social determinants of human behaviour. In the final analysis it may be stated that the aim of sociology is to search for the pattern of relationships between people in order to pave the way for the betterment of individuals in relation to society.",D

Staph. aureus produce a superantigen contributes to massive disease caused cytokines that are released from polyclonal T- cell activation. Which one of the following best fits this description of a superantigen?,Exfoliative toxin,Protein A,Coagulase,Toxic shock syndrome toxin,"Superantigens can bind to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules outside the peptide- bonding cleft, as well as to the T-cell receptor. Superantigen binding stimulates the release of large amounts of cytokines, including interleukin I and tumor necrosis factor. This mechanism is caused by stimulation of a high percentage of the pool of T lymphocytes (poly clonal activation) and explains to a large extent the pathogenesis of diseases caused by organisms with superantigens. Staphylococcus aureus produces both toxic shock syndrome toxin and enterotoxins (food poison ing), which exhibit the superantigen characteristics. Although toxic and harmful, exfoliative toxin, protein A, coagulase, and beta hemolytic hemolysin respond as regular antigens in the immune response and are specific in their destructive action in the body. Exfoliative toxin includes at least two proteins that cause the generalized desquamation seen in the scalded skin syndrome. Protein A nonspecifically binds to the Fe poion of munoglobulin G molecules and pre vents complement attachment and activation. Coagulase clots citrated plasma with the help of a serum factor, and probably assists in the development of the abscess lesion. S. aureus produces several hemolysis, or exotoxins.

B: Lateral border of anterior 2/3rd Carcinoma of the tongue is relatively common in India and forms a significant group. The anatomical sites that are frequently involved in mouth cancer include the floor of the mouth, the lateral border of the anterior tongue and the retromolar trigone. Although lesion is either ulcerative or proliferative on an easily visible organ with exceptional mobility,it usually present in late stages. Hence, even though the disease is curable and has a high five years survival rate, presenting in the late stages, reduces five years survival rate.

Which of the following statement about volvulus is False:,More common in psychiatric patients,Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal volvulus,Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus,All,"Ans is 'c'' i.e. Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus Volvulus describes a condition in which there is rotation of a segment of the intestine on an axis formed by its mesentery resulting in paial or complete obstruction of the lumen and may be followed by circulatory impairment of the bowel. Most common site is colon, among which following are involved in descending order - Sigmoid volvulus (- 75%) - Cecal volvulus (< 25%) - Transverse colon - Splenic flexure - Sigmoid volvulus Most common site of volvulus Volvulus can occur in any segment of large bowel that is attached to a long and floppy mesentery that is fixed to the retroperitoneum by a narrow base of origin. The mesenteric anatomy is such that volvulus is most commonly seen in sigmoid colon. Associated predisposing factors are : - age : average age of presentation is 60-70 yrs. - chronic constipation - institutionalized or neurologically impaired or psychiatric patients (their medication may decrease intestinal motility, or they may fail to pass stool regularly, leading to fecal loaded large bowel predisposing to volvulus) - diet high in fibre and vegetables (as in third world countries) Signs and symptoms are those of acute or subacute intestinal obstruction. X-ray picture is dramatic - there is a markedly dilated sigmoid colon with the appearance of a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance. Inferior convergence of the dilated loop points towards left side of pelvis. - contrast enema demonstrates the point of obstruction with the pathognomic 'birds beak' or 'bird of prey' or 'ace of spades' sign. Management of sigmoid volvulus Unless there are obvious signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the initial management is resuscitation followed by endoscopic decompression and detorsion. Decompression/detorsion can be achieved by placement of rectal tube through a proctoscope or the use of a colonoscope. If detorsion / decompression cannot be achieved with either the rectal tube or colonoscope, laprotomy with resections of the sigmoid colon is done. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid volvulus is successful, risk of recurrence is high (approx. 50%). Hence an effective sigmoid colectomy is indicated after the pt. has stabilized. Any evidence of bowel gangrene or perforation contraindicates non-operative decompression and an immediate surgical exploration is done. Cecal volvulus The condition commonly referred to as cecal volvulus is actually a cecocolic volvulus and consists of an axial rotation of the terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. Cecal bascule - is a condition in which the cecum folds in a cephalad direction anteriorly over a fixed ascending colon. This causes intermittent bouts of abdominal pain because the mobile cecum causes intermittent episodes of Isolated cecal obstruction. It is relieved spontaneously as the cecum falls back into its normal position. Cecocolic volvulus is possible because of lack of fixation of the cecum to the retroperitoneum. Associate predisposing factors are: - previous surgery - pregnancy - malrotation - obstructing lesion of the left colon Cecocolic volvulus affects a younger age group (late 50s) than sigmoid volvulus (60s & 70s). X-ray picture - dilated cecum usually occupying the left upper quadrant. - haustral markings can be seen in the distended cecocolic segment and is a distinguishing feature from sigmoid colon in which generally there are no haustra. Management According to Schwaz Surgery - Cecal volvulus, unlike sigmoid volvulus can almost never be detorsed / decompressed endoscopically. As vascular compromise occurs early in the course of cecal volvulus, surgical exploration is necessary when the diagnosis is made. Right hemicolectomy is the procedure of choice. Sabiston surgery writes that - 'Although there have been repos of detorsion of cecocolic volvulus with a colonoscope most cases require operation to correct the volvulus and prevent ischemia."" An aicle published in the journal 'Diseases of Colon and Rectum' - The management of Cecal Volvulus writes""Non-operative decompression of cecal volvulus is rarely achievable""",C

The disease occurs commonly in males in the age group of 5-10 years. Etiology of Pehe's disease Pehe's disease is the most common form of osteochondroses (osteochondroses are characterized by avascular necrosis (AVN) and defective endochondral ossification of primary or secondary ossification centers). The etiology remains unknown, but is currently accepted that the disorder is caused by an interruption of the blood supply to the capital femoral epiphysis, causing avascular necrosis. Clinical features of Pehes disease Pehes disease is common in male of age group 5-10 years. Pain in the hip, often radiating to knee. Limp (antalgic limp). Limitation of movement :- Abduction, internal rotation and extension are limited, therefore there is adduction, external rotation, and flexion deformity. Shoening of limb. Positive trendelenburg test. During the disease process, bone age is 1-3 years lower than the normal. After healing, bone age returns to normal. Radiological investigations for Pehe's disease Following radiological investigations are used : 1) X-ray hip Findings are :- Increased medial joint space Widening of femoral neck Lateral extrusion (lateral subluxation) Metaphyseal cysts and rarefaction of metaphysis Horizontal physis with speckled calcification lateral to it Fragmentation of femoral head with increased density (irregular densities in the epiphysis) 2) Bone scan May show a decrease uptake by femoral head. 3) MRI It is the investigation of choice as it can diagnose Pehes disease in early stages when X-ray is normal. MRI tells about :- Extent of area involved Sphericity of the head Subluxation of the head Thus MRI helps better in planning for management.",D

Most cardiotoxic local anesthetic is:,Bupivacaine,Lignocaine,Lidocaine,Ropivacaine,"Ref: L Mather LE, Chang DM. Cardiotoxicity with modem local anaesthetics: is there a safer choice ? Drugs. 2001;61(3):333-42. 2. Lied jam JJ. de la Coassay e JE, Bassoul B. Brugada J.Mechanisms of the cardiac toxicity of bupivacaine. Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 1988; 7(3):204-10Explanation:Bupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic of all the local anaesthetics.Associated with sudden increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine.It involves both electrical and mechanical structures within the heart.The main site of action on cardiac conduction tissue is the Vmax of phase 0 of the action potential of fast-reacting structures tlNa current).Bupivacaine, like lidocaine and the other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks the sodium channels, this block being more slowly reversible.The disturbance of sodium channels throughout the heart leads to a decreased conduction speed throughout the conduction system, thus explaining possible acute conduction disturbances originating below the bundle of His.The ventricular dysarrhythmias are due to a re-entry circuit secondary to a slowing in conduction speed.The sinus bradycardias and junctional disturbances seen in toxic accidents are probably due to an inhibition of the slow current of the atrial and atrio-ventricular nodes (Isi current!.Bupivacaine, at toxic levels, has a direct effect on contractility.The negative inotropic effects seem to be due to a fall in the intracytoplasmic calcium concentration on wrhich depends the excitation- contraction couple, as well as disturbed cellular energetic events dependent on the contraction.Bupivacaine is disproportionately more cardiotoxic than its shorter-acting counterparts like ropivacaine and levobupivacaine.While all local anaesthetics can cause direct negative inotropic effects, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.",A

"All of the following cause myocardial depression, except",Halothane,Propofol,Etomidate,Ketamine,"The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. The minimal effect of etomidate on cardiovascular function sets it apa from other rapid-onset anesthetics. Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. In patients receiving etomidate during induction of anesthesia, more hypeension and tachycardia occur after etomidate compared with propofol. The myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate lacks analgesic efficacy, however, and must be combined with an opiate to prevent hemodynamic peurbations during laryngoscopy and intubation. In the setting of hemorrhagic shock, etomidate has advantages for the induction of anesthesia. In contrast to other drugs, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of etomidate were minimally altered in a pig model of hemorrhagic shock.

The incidence is 1--2% in full-term infants and up to 30% in premature babies. Operation is indicated after 1 year. Prior to age one, the testis may continue to descend into the scrotum. The cause is unknown. Undescended testes fail in spermatogenic function, but may continue to secrete androgens. Spermatogenic failure is progressive; therefore, surgical exploration and scrotal placement of the testis should be performed before 2-years of age. If placement of the testicle into the scrotum is not possible, then orchiectomy is indicated because of the high risk of testicular cancer when the testis is left in an intraabdominal position.The incidence of testicular cancer in an abdominal testis is 30 times higher than the normal population.

The proper treatment for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) includes which of the following components?,Close follow-up.,Radiation after excision.,Mirror-image biopsy of the opposite breast,Mastectomy and regional node dissection,"LCIS is best thought of as a precursor lesion that confers increased risk for eventual cancer. The magnitude of this risk appears to be in the range of seven- to ninefold over baseline risk. The chance of breast cancer is equal in both breasts, not just in the biopsied breast, and the type of cancer is not confined to a lobular histology. After a diagnosis of LCIS, patients are at increased risk for invasive and noninvasive ductal carcinoma in both breasts. Therefore, mirror-image biopsy as practiced in the past has little to offer. Since LCIS is purely noninvasive, nodal dissection is not required if mastectomy is chosen. There are no data on the use of breast radiation therapy for LCIS. Most surgical oncologists recommend close follow-up for patients who have LCIS only; the alternative surgical treatment that makes most sense is bilateral simple mastectomies, with or without reconstruction.",A

This is not, however, a benign procedure as a negative appendectomy is associated with a 4% risk of fetal loss and a 10% risk of early delivery. The American College of Radiology recommends the use of nonionizing radiation techniques as front-line imaging in pregnant women. Serial examinations would be inappropriate as rates of fetal loss are considerably higher in patients with complicated appendicitis and the greatest oppounity to improve fetal outcomes is to improve diagnostic accuracy. Ultrasound Scan, being the easiest imaging option to carry out during pregnancy, is done to confirm that the condition is appendicitis. If results of the Ultrasound Scan are not conclusive, an MRI Scan is carried out. It also carries no risk of radiation, even to pregnant women.

Atherosclerosis (Senile gangrene) Seen in elderly people over 50 years of age. Thus because of age factor we can rule out atherosclerosis. Myocardial infaction Age factor again helps in ruling it out as MI is generally seen in elderly, though its incidence is increasing in young, but it cannot be a more common cause than Buerger's disease. Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans) Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers). Buerger ds is the inflammatory reaction in the aerial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the aery. It characterstically involves small and medium sized aeries (plantars, tibial and radial aery) Both upper and lower extremities are affected. In lower extremity the ds. occurs beyond the popliteal aery. In upper extremity the ds occurs beyond the brachial a.

They occur most frequently in the veebral column (30-50%) and skull (20%), whereas involvement of other sites (including the long bones, sho tubular bones, and ribs) is extremely rare. Peak incidence occur in the 50s. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as ""rare"". Veebral hemangiomas can cause neurological symptoms if they extend into the epidural space. Appearance on X-ray is depend on the location. The lesions are often poorly defined,appearing as a somewhat localized area of abundant, dilated vessels, some of which may on the surface of the bone, within the coex of the bone, or extend into the medullary cavity. However, the radiographic hallmark of bone hemangiomas is a prominent trabecular pattern. Despite the added diagnostic information available with CT scanning and MRI, the angiomatous nature of many extraspinal lesions can be confirmed only by histologic analysis. On gross examination, hemangiomas look like a disorganised collection of veins or vascular spaces. Grossly there are cystic, dark red cavities. The lytic areas are sharply defined and there is trabecular thickening. Under the microscope, there are four type of hemangiomas : capillary, cavernous, aeriovenous, and venous. Capillary and cavernous lesions are most common in bone. Treatment of hemangiomas is unnecessary unless the lesion is symptomatic. Hemangiomas: Most bonafide hemangiomas in bone are solitary lesions. Comprises less than 1.5 % of the total series. Female preponderance in a ratio of 3 : 2. Hemangiomas are usually found in adults. Many of the hemangiomas are asymptomatic. Hemangiomas that expands the bone and produce new bone may cause notable swelling. Local pain is sometimes a feature. There may be fracture, including compression fracture of veebra, Rarely, spinal cord compression may occur. Hemangiomas in veebrae characteristically cause polka-dot appearance on computed tomograms. Hemangiomas usually respond well to conservative procedures. Radiation may be required for lesions that ar in inaccessible sites.

All of the following diseases show abnormal folding of proteins except :,Creutzfeldt-jabok disease,Prion disease,Multiple sclerosis,Amylidosis,"Multiple sclerosis[Ref: Harrison 171h/e p. 2647; Harper 27th/e p. 38; Lippincott p. 20j The process of protein folding is remarkably efficient, but sometimes it can go wrong. Incorrectly folded proteins are considered to be the cause of many diseases. Amvloidoses The common characteristic of all amyloidoses is the collection of plaques of insoluble protein in the extracellular tissue which cannot be broken down by enzymes. Their ordered structure gives them a crystal like propeies and they are are made up of long filaments (fibrils) that are formed from densely packed p pleated sheets. There are about 20 different proteins that can act as the building block of these fibrils each of which is associated with a different disease. In the so called systemic amyloidoses, the precursors of these plaques are transpoed through the blood stream from their point of origin to the point of deposition. Localized amyloidoses are of greater clinical significance as they mainly affect the central nervous system, the extracellular tissue of which is paicularly susceptible to damage. Alzheimer's disease One of the main characteristics of Alzhiemer's disease is the accumulation of plaques of insoluble p amyloid in the brain. The p amyloid plaques are formed by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two different enzymatic activities which release amyloid - p peptide fragments that are 40 or 42 amino acids long. These then form fibrils which aggregate into insoluble clumps of p amyloid plaques that surround neurons and cause damage. But this cleavage also occurs in healthy individuals and soluble p amyloid proteins are normal constituents of brain tissue. How, then do the plaques form in Alzhiemer's patients? It is thought that the, mis folding of the protein, dramatically alters its propeies. In the normal protein, hydrophobic amino acids bury themsleves inside the protein right from the sta of the folding. However, if the protein folds wrongly, these hydrophobic amino acids are exposed and they rapidly seek out and bind to hydrophobic groups on other protein molecules forming the insoluble aggregates or plaques that are found in Alzhiemers patients. Prion disease : Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells. Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) (a glycoprotein rich in a helix). PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy. Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a PrPsc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in fi sheets). These PrPsc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another PrPsc. While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, PrPsc is shaped differently enough so that it can't be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These PrPsc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue. Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into PrPsc. Creutzfeldt Jabok disease is caused by prions.

The external spermatic fascia stops it getting into the inguinal canals. Extravasated urine collects in the scrotum and penis and beneath the deep layer of superficial fascia in the abdominal wall. CLINICAL FEATURES The signs of a ruptured bulbar urethra are perineal bruising and haematoma, typically with a butterfly distribution. There is usually bleeding from the urethral meatus and retention of urine is also typically present. MANAGEMENT If the diagnosis is suspected, the patient should be treated with appropriate analgesia and antibiotics should be administered. He should be discouraged from passing urine. A full bladder should be drained with a catheter placed by percutaneous suprapubic puncture using a Seldinger technique . This reduces urinary extravasation and allows investigations to establish the extent of the urethral injury. Diagnosis is made by urethrography using water-soluble contrast. If there is significant extravasation, then the perineal collection should be drained. The suprapubic catheter should remain in situ while the bruising and extravasation settle down and a stricture will typically develop at the site of the injury. The optimal treatment is delayed anastomotic urethroplasty after the swelling and bruising have settled down (typically 8-12 weeks later), with excision of the traumatised section and spatulated end-to-end reanastomosis of the urethra.

University of Wisconsin solution is used in:,Organ preservation,Virus isolation,Gene therapy,All of the above,"The most commonly used fluid worldwide is the University of Wisconsin solution. It contains lactobionate, raffinose, and hydroxyethyl starch. Lactobionate is impermeable and prevents intracellular swelling; it also lowers the concentration of intracellular calcineurin and free iron, which may be beneficial in reducing reperfusion injury. Hydroxyethyl starch, a synthetic colloid, may help decrease hypothermia-induced cell swelling of endothelial cells and reduce interstitial edema. Another solution that is now being used commonly is histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution Ref: Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition, chapter 11.",A
"A 24-year-old man presents in septic shock from an empyema. He is febrile to 103degF, tachycardic in the 120s, and hypotensive to the 90s. His oxygen saturation is 98% on 2-L oxygen. His white blood cell count is 25,000/mL and creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. His blood pressure does not respond to fluid administration despite a CVP of 15. Which of the following therapies is indicated in managing this patient?",Intubation,Recombinant human activated protein C,Epinephrine,Norepinephrine,") Early goal-directed therapy should be employed for patients with septic shock or severe sepsis. The tenets of resuscitation include intubation if hypoxic, fluid resuscitation to a central venous pressure target of 8 to 12 mm Hg if not intubated and infusion of vasopressors to maintain a mean aerial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the vasopressors of choice; epinephrine vasoconstricts peripherally as well as increases cardiac contractility and is not a first-line agent for septic shock. Inotropes such as dobutamine have been used if oxygen delivery is low, but should not be used to push delivery to supranormal levels. Fuhermore, cultures should be drawn immediately and empiric antibiotics initiated; if there is a surgical source of sepsis, then operative intervention for source control should be promptly performed after initial resuscitative effos. Recombinant-activated protein C is indicated in patients with severe sepsis with a predicted high risk of moality (ie, older age, increased severity of disease); this patient does not have evidence of end-organ dysfunction such as acute renal or respiratory failure at this time. The use of coicosteroids for septic shock is controversial, but should only be considered in the setting of shock nonresponsive to fluids and vasopressors.

Most common clinicopathologic class of melanoma during the radial growth phase is,Acral lentigines,Lentigo maligna,Superficial spreading,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Superficial spreading Melanoma - Morphology* Melanomas show striking variations in color, appearing in shades of black, brown, red, dark blue, and gray.* The borders of melanomas are irregular and often notched, unlike the smooth, round, and uniform borders of melanocytic nevi.* Central to understanding the progression of melanoma is the concept of radial and vertical growth phases.* Radial growth describes the horizontal spread of melanoma within the epider- mis and superficial dermis. During this initial stage the tumor cells seem to lack the capacity to metastasize.* Tumors in radial growth phase fall into several clinicopathologic classes, including:1) Lentigo maligna, usually presenting as an indolent lesion on the face of older men that may remain in the radial growth phase for several decades;2) Superficial spreading, the most common type of melanoma, usually involving sun-exposed skin; and3) Acral entiginous, these are mucosal lesions of melanoma and are unrelated to sun exposure.* After a variable (and unpredictable) period of time, melanoma shifts from the radial phase to a vertical growth phase, during which the tumor cells invade downward into the deeper dermal layers as an expansile mass. The vertical growth phase is often heralded by the appearance of a nodule and correlates with the emergence of a tumor subclone with metastatic potential.* Unlike melanocytic nevi, ""neurotization"" is absent from the deep invasive portion of melanoma.* The probability of metastasis in such lesions correlates with the depth of invasion, which by convention is the distance from the superficial epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest intradermal tumor cells; this measurement is known as the Breslow thickness.",C

ER/ PR status is used as a prognostic variable in -,Ca breast,Ca ovary,Ca endometrium,Ca cervix,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ca breast Prognostic factors of breast carcinoma:* The most important prognostic variables are provided by tumor staging.* The size of the tumor and the status of the axillary lymph nodes provide reasonably accurate information on the likelihood of tumor relapse.* There is rarely justification for adjuvant chemotherapy in most women with tumors <1 cm in size whose axillary lymph nodes are negative. HER2-positive tumors are a potential exception.* Detection of breast cancer cells either in the circulation or bone marrow is associated with an increased relapse rate.* Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are of prognostic significance. Tumors that lack either or both of these receptors are more likely to recur than tumors that have them.* Several measures of tumor growth rate correlate with early relapse. S-phase analysis using flow cytometry is the most accurate measure. Indirect S-phase assessments using antigens associated with the cell cycle, such as PCNA (Ki67), are also valuable.* Tumors with a high proportion (more than the median) of cells in S-phase pose a greater risk of relapse; chemotherapy offers the greatest survival benefit for these tumors.* Assessment of DNA content in the form of ploidy is of modest value, with nondiploid tumors having a somewhat worse prognosis.* Histologic classification of the tumor has also been used as a prognostic factor. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear grade.* Molecular changes in the tumor are also useful. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER2/neu) or have a mutated p53 gene have a worse prognosis. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 are more likely to respond to higher doses of doxorubicincontaining regimens and predict those tumors that will respond to HER2/neu antibodies (trastuzumab) (herceptin) and HER2/ neu kinase inhibitors.* The presence of more microvessels in a tumor, particularly when localized in socalled hot spots, is associated with a worse prognosis.* Other variables that have also been used to evaluate prognosis include proteins associated with invasiveness, such as type IV collagenase, cathepsin D, plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator receptor, and the metastasissuppressor gene nm23. None of these has been widely accepted as a prognostic variable for therapeutic decision-making. One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients.",A

Although x-rays are mandatory, it is important to realize that the fracture may not be seen on the initial x-ray and that a presumptive diagnosis can and should be made on clinical grounds alone. Typically, there will be tenderness to palpation over the navicular tuberosity and limitation of wrist flexion and extension. Immobilization of the wrist for about 16 week and sometimes up to 6 month is required. Nonunion or avascular necrosis is not uncommon and may require bone grafting for correction.Dislocation of the radial head with a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna is known as Monteggia's deformity. Usually, the radial head is dislocated anteriorly. The injury is usually caused by forced pronation. The injury can be treated by reduction and stabilization of the ulna followed by reduction of the radial head via supination and direct pressure.Anterior shoulder dislocations occur more frequently than posterior dislocations. However, posterior dislocations are seen in special situations, such as during an epileptiform convulsion and during electroshock therapy. Closed reduction followed by immobilization is usually sufficient therapyA spiral fracture, frequently seen in the tibia in skiers, results from the application of torque to a long bone.

A patient sustained injury to the upper limb 3 yrs back; he now presents with valgus deformity in the elbow and paresthesias over the medial border of the hand. The injury is likely to have been:,Supracondylar humerus,Lateral condyle humerus,Medial condyle humerus,Postr dislocation of the humerus,"B i.e. Lateral condyle humerus With out question the most frequent problematic complication of lateral condyle fracture is delayed union or nonunion. This is because the fracture is intro - aicular & is constantly exposed to synol fluid , has poor blood supply and there is displacemet and constant motion at the fracture site from the pull of wrist extensors on the distal fragment. So if left untreated there is high probability of delayed union or nonunionQ. The treatment of lateral condyle fractures depend on amout of fracture displacement. Although there is controversy regarding the treatment of non displaced & minimally displaced fractures, there is a consensus that displaced lateral condyle fractures requires open reduction and internal fixationQ.",B

What is veebroplasty ?,Stabilization of veebral compression fracture,Replacement of veebral body only,Replacement of veebral body with interveebral disc,Fusion of the adjacent veebrae,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Stabilization of veebral compression fracture Veebroplasty is an outpatient procedure for stabilizing compression fractures in the spine. Bone cement is injected into back bones (veebrae) that have cracked or broken, often because of osteoporosis. The cement hardens, stabilizing the fractures and suppoing jour spine. Veebroplasty and kvphoplasty Veebroplasty and kyphoplasty are interventional radiologic procedures for the treatment of the intense pain refractory to medical management or bracing caused by veebral compression fracture associated with osteoporosis, tumors, and trauma. Veebroplasty and kyphoplasty involve intraosseous injection of acrylic cementpolymethyl methacrylate under local anesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance. Pain reduction or elimination is immediate, and the risk of complications is low. Neither veebroplasty nor kyphoplasty are intended for the treatment of interveebral disc disease or ahritis. Veebroplasty may also be applied prophylactically to an at-risk veebra between 2 other abnormal veebrae. Veebroplasty does not restore the height of the compressed veebral body. A related procedure, kyphoplasty, is intended to restore lost height by inflating a balloon pump within and between the fracture fragments prior to the infusion of the cement. Both procedures result in similar relief of pain due to veebral compression fractures. The risks of the procedure are low and include extravasation of cement into the epidural space causing myelopathy, or fatal pulmonary embolism from extension of cement into paraspinous veins. Indications for percutaneous veebroplasty Osteoporotic veebral compression fractures more than two weeks old in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine causing moderate to severe pain and unresponsive to conservative therapy. Painful metastasis and multiple myeloma with or without adjuvant radiation or surgical therapy. Painful veebral hemangiomas Veebral osteonecrosis. Reinforcement of a pathologically weak veebral body before a surgical stabilization procedure. Contraindication for percutaneous veebroplasty Contraindications are : - 1. Absolute Osteoporotic veebral fracture that is completely healed or is clearly responding to conservative management. Presence of untreated coagulopathy. Presence of discitis/osteomyelitis (septic or tubercular) or sepsis. 2. Relative Significant compromise of the spinal canal by retropulsed bone fragment or tumor. Fracture older than one year.

Adrenal insufficiency may occur in a host of settings including tuberculosis (formerly the most common cause), autoimmune state, severe infections (classically, meningococcal septicemia), pituitary insufficiency, after burns, during anticoagulant therapy, and--most commonly today--aftEURr interruption of chronically administered exogenous steroids. Although the adrenal gland is an occasion3l site for distant metastases, such as from lung or breast, it is rare for there to be enough destruction of the glands to produce clinical adrenal insufficiency Chronic adrenal insufficiency (classic Addison's diease) should be recognizable preoperatively by the constellation of skin hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. Death may occur within hours of surgery if a patient with Addison's disease is operated on without cognizance of adreria! insufficiency and pretreatment with exogenous steroids. Patients who have adrenal insufficiency as a result of interruption of chronically administered exogenous steroids may not develop the classic electrolyte abnormalities until the preterminal period. Adrenal insufficiency may also develop insidiously in the postoperative period, progressing over a course of several days. This insidious course is seen when adrenal injury occurs in the perioperative period, as would be the case with adrenal damage from hemorrhage into the gland in a patient receiving postoperative anticoagulant PTT. therapy Measurement of blood coicosteroid levels, urinary coicosteroid secretion, urinary sodium levels, and response to exogenous steroids is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency pigmentation, weakness, weight loss, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia,",C

B: Always unilateral Indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia and occurs commonly in the young In the first decade it is more common on the right side. The hernia is bilateral in 12% of cases. In boys, differentiating between a hernia and a hydrocele is not always easy. Transillumination has been advocated as a means of distinguishing between the presence of a sac filled with fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele) and the presence of bowel in the scrotal sac. However, in cases of inguinal hernia incarceration, transillumination may not be beneficial because any viscera that is distended and fluid-filled in the scrotum of a young infant may also transilluminate. A rectal examination may be helpful if intestine can be felt descending through the internal ring. * Silk sign: When the hernia sac is palpated over the cord structures, the sensation may be similar to that of rubbing 2 layers of silk together.

Antonioli, "" Gastrointestinal Autonomic Nerve Tumors, expanding the spectrum of gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"" Arch Pathol Lab Med; 1989: 113: 831-833.Explanation:IntussusceptionInvagination of an intestinal segment (the intussusceptum) into the next distal part of the intestine forms a sheath around it (the intussuscipiens) producing a form of intestinal obstruction called 'intussusception'.The most common cause is hypertrophy of the Peyers patches in the terminal ileum front an antecedent viral infection.The hypertrophied lymphatic patch becomes drawn into the lumen of the terminal ileum and is moved progressively into the ascending and transverse colon.Other predisposing factors includePolypsMeckel's diverticulumBenign tumors like lipomaLeiomyomaMalignant tumors such as lymphoma w hich may act as lead points for intussusception.GI lipomas, most common in the ileum, are single intramural lesion, submucosal in location and usually small.One portion of the gut becomes invaginated within an immediately adjacent segment; almost invariably, it is the proximal into the distal.The condition is encountered most commonly in children, with a peak incidence between 5 and 10 months of age.About of cases are idiopathic but an associated upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis may precede the condition.It is believed that hyperplasia of Pever's patches in the terminal ileum.Weaning, loss of passively acquired maternal immunity and common viral pathogens have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of intussusception in infancy.Children Pathological lead pointsMeckel's diverticulumPolypduplication,Henoch-Schonlein purpuraAppendixAdult cases lead pointA polyp (e.g. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome)A submucosal lipomaother tumoursPathologyAn intussusception is composed of three parts:The entering or inner tube (intussusceptum)The returning or middle tube;The sheath or outer tube (intussuscipiens).The part that advances is the apex, the mass is the intussusception and the neck is the junction of the entering layer with the mass.An intussusception is an example of a strangulating obstruction as the blood supply of the inner layer is usually impaired.The degree of ischaemia is dependent on the tightness of the invagination, which is usually greatest as it passes through the ileocaecal valve.Intussusception may be anatomically defined according to the site and extent of invagination.In most children, the intussusception is ileocolicIn adults, colocolic intussusception is commonIntussusceptionMost common in childrenPrimary or secondary to intestinal pathology, e.g. polypMeckel's diverticulumIleocolic is the commonest varietyCan lead to an ischaemic segmentRadiological reduction is indicated in most casesThe remainder require surgery",A

Dye used in chromoendoscopy for detection of cancer:,Gentian violet,Toluidine blue,Hemotoxiline and eosine,Methylene blue,"Ans is d i.e. Methylene blue > Toluidine blue ""Chromoendoscopy, the intravital staining of gastrointestinal epithelia, provides additional diagnostic information with respect to the epithelial morphology and pathophysiology. Based on experience gathered mainly in Japan, chromoendoscopy is now in more widespread use, in paicular to identify preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. The most promising techniques are the depiction of squamous epithelium neoplasia of the esophagus with Lugol's solution, staining of Barrett's mucosa by methylene blue, including the potential to identify neoplasia, and the demarcation of neoplasia with indigo carmine in stomach and colon for local endoscopic resection.""- aicle: Chromoendoscopy: From a Research Tool to Clinical Progress U. Peitz, P. Malfeheiner at website: ikelNr=67480 ""Chromoendoscopy involves the use of agents that enhance the distinction between diseased and normal mucosa, either by filling surface cervices or by differential uptake by diseased epithelium. Many chromoendoscopy agents have been studied in the detection of esophageal carcinoma, of which Lugol's iodine and methylene blue have been most widely studied.""- Carcinoma of the Esophagus By Sheila C. Rankin p.31 Chromoendoscopy involves the use of stains or dyes during endoscopy to improve the visualization and characterization of the gastrointestinal mucosa. The stains are mainly Vital dyes- Lugol's solution, methylene blue, and toluidine blue or Contrast agents- indigo carmine and dilute acetic acid solution Lugol's solution Is absorbed by glycogen containing, nonketatinized squamous epithelium. Lugol's stained tissue will characteristically turn green-brown. Any condition that depletes glycogen, including inflammation, dysplasia, and early-stage cancer, will result in an absence of uptake of the dye. Lugol's iodine is used to determine the extent of BE, and to screen for squamous esophageal cancer in high-risk populations. Methylene blue dye is taken up by the cytoplasm or absorptive cells such as the normal epithelial cells of the colon and small intestine, and goblet cells, which are present in Barrett's epithelium. It will not stain nonabsorptive normal epithelium of the stomach as is found in the cardia and fundus, or normal squamous mucosa of the esophagus. Chromoendoscopy with methylene blue has been used to screen for colonic neoplasia , to diagnose BE and to screen for areas of precursor lesions and carcinoma in the stomach. Methylene blue stains barrett's epithelium as it is taken up by the cytoplasm of goblet cells. Dysplastic change is associated with a reduction in goblet cell numbers and an increasing nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio propoional to the degree of dysplasia, and such tissues absorb methylene blue to a lesser extent than surrounding cells. Increasing grades of dysplasia may appear as heterogeneous or unstained areas, allowing targeted rather than random biopsies to be taken and have been repoed to improve the detection of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia in Barrett's esophagus. Indigo carmine Unlike Lugol's iodine or methylene blue, indigo carmine is not taken up by tissues but instead pools in crevices between epithelial cells, thereby highlighting small lesions or irregularities in the mucosal architecture. Chromodendoscopy with indigo carmine has been used to diagnose BE, and to investigate polypoid and nonpolypoid lesion in the colon.Toluidine Blue Toluidine blue stains cellular nuclei. When applied topically it preferentially identifies malignant and inflammatory tissues, in pa because of their greater nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio.

"All of the following statements about Necrotizing fascitis are true, except",Infection of fascia and subcutaneous tissue,Most commonly caused by Group A beta hemolytic streptococci,Most common site is perineum followed by trunk and extremities,Surgical debridement is mandatory,"Necrotizing fasciitis

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening rapidly progressive bacterial infection of subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia that is potentially fatal if appropriate treatment measures are not instituted quickly.
Usually occurring after compromised skin integrity because of infection or trauma, necrotizing fasciitis is manifested by flagrant inflammatory features at the site of infection that may be accompanied by hemorrhagic bullae, necrosis, and crepitus, often unresponsive to antibiotic therapy Systemic septic features may arise.

Most common site

Necrotizing fasciitis frequently affects the lower limbs, although any site may be involved, including the head and neck. Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum is known as Fournier's Gangrene.

Etiological agents

Necrotizing fasciitis can be a polymicrobial infection with a mixture of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes (Type I) or it can be monomicrobial (Type II) with group A streptococcus being the most common isolate.

Predisposing, factors

Predisposing factors include trauma (often trivial), burns, splinters, surgery, childbirth, diabetes mellitus, varicella, immunosuppression, renal failure, arteriosclerosis. odontogenic infection, malignancy, and alcoholism. Nonsteroidal and inflammatory agents may alter the immune response, causing a minor infection to become fulminant.

Clinical manifestation

Extension from a skin lesion occurs in 80% of cases. The initial lesion is often trivial, such as a minor abrasion, insect bite, injection site (drug addicts) or boil; 20% of patients have no visible skin lesion.
Initially, there is a pain, erythema, edema, cellulitis, and high fever.
The patient may be disoriented and lethargic. The local site shows cellulitis (90% of cases), edema (80%), skin discolouration or gangrene (70%), and anaesthesia of involved skin.
A wooden-hard feel of the subcutaneous tissues is characteristic.
The most consistent clinical clue is unrelenting pain out of proportion to the physical findings even if there is only mild or no fever or erythema. Typically there is diffuse swelling of an arm or leg and intense pain on palpation. About 1 or 2 days after symptom onset, the patient has a high fever, leukocytosis, edema with central patches of dusky blue discolouration, weeping blisters, and borders with cellulitis. Bullae with clear fluid rapidly turn violaceous.
Septicemia may develop secondarily and should be strongly suspected in the presence of fever, anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, confusion, and hypotension. Progression to gangrene, sometimes with myonecrosis, and an extension of the inflammatory process along fascial planes are possible.
Twenty-five percent will die of septic shock and organ failure 

Treatment

Early supportive care, surgical debridement, and parenteral antibiotic administration are mandatory.
All devitalized tissue should be removed to freely bleeding edges, and repeat exploration is generally indicated within 24-36 hr to confirm that no necrotic tissue remains. The mortality rate is nearly 100% without surgical debridement.",C

The typical scar is 1.5 to 2 cm long and should be completely excised. The proximal and distal urethra can be mobilized for a tension-free, end-to-end anastomosis. This is a highly successful procedure in more than 95% of cases. Endoscopic incision (urethrotomy) through the scar tissue of an obliterated urethra is a hopeless procedure and uniformly fails. Partial urethral narrowing can initially be treated by endoscopic incision with higher success. It is now recognized that repeated urethrotomy and dilation is neither clinically effective nor cost-effective for the treatment of urethral strictures. Further, patients who have had repeated endoscopic procedures are also more likely to require complex reconstructive procedures such as grafts"" — Campbell's Urology

Secondary vesical calculus refers to stones formed due to:,Hypercalciuria,Injury,Infection,Migrating from above,"• Most vesical calculi are formed de novo within the bladder, but some initially may have formed within the kidneys as a dissociated Randall plaque or on a sloughed papilla and subsequently may have passed into the bladder, where additional deposition of crystals cause the stone to grow.
• Most renal stones that are small enough to pass through the ureters are also small enough to pass through a normally functioning bladder and an unobstructed urethra.
• In older men with bladder stones composed of uric acid, the stone most likely formed in the bladder.
• Stones composed of calcium oxalate are usually initially formed in the kidney.
• In adults, MC type of vesical stone (seen in >50% of cases) is composed of uric acid.
• Less frequently, bladder calculi are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, ammonium urate, cystine, or magnesium ammonium phosphate (when associated with infection).
Endemic Bladder Calculi
• In children, stones are composed mainly of ammonium acid urate, calcium oxalate, or an impure mixture of ammonium acid urate and calcium oxalate with calcium phosphate.
• The common link among endemic areas relates to feeding infants human breast milk and polished rice.
• These foods are low in phosphorus, ultimately leading to high ammonia excretion.
• These children also usually have a high intake of oxalate-rich vegetables (increased oxalate crystalluria) and animal protein (low dietary citrate).
• Vesical calculi may be single or multiple, especially in the presence of bladder diverticula, and can be small or large enough to occupy the entire bladder. They range from soft to extremely hard, with surfaces ranging from smooth and faceted to jagged and spiculated (“jack” stones).
• Most bladder stones are secondary, more common in older males (>50 years), usually because of bladder outlet obstruction.
• MC type: Uric acid (sterile urine) > Struvite stones (Infected urine)
• Bladder stones are usually solitary, multiple in 25% patients.
Etiology
• Bladder outlet obstruction (MC cause)
• Neurogenic bladder
• Foreign body (Foley’s catheter, forgotten DJ stents)
• Bladder diverticula
Clinical Features
• Typical symptoms are intermittent, painful voiding and terminal hematuria with severe pain at the end of micturition.
• Pain may be referred to the tip of the penis or to the labia majora.
Diagnosis
• A large percentage of bladder stones are radiolucent (uric acid).
• USG bladder: Identifies the stone with its characteristic shadowing and stone moves with changing body position.
Treatment
• Small stones: Removed or crushed transurethrally (Cystolitholapexy)
• Larger stones: Disintegrated by transurethral electrohydraulic lithotripsy or Cystolithotomy
Stones of Genitourinary Tract
• MC renal stone: Calcium oxalate
• MC primary bladder stone: Ammonium urate
• MC bladder stone: Uric acid >Struvite

Which aery is not ligated during caecum surgery,Ileocolic,Right colic,Left colic,Right branch of middle colic,"Right hemicolectomy Carcinoma of the caecum or ascending colon is treated by right hemicolectomy. At open surgery the peritoneum lateral to the ascending colon is incised, and the incision is carried around the hepatic flexure. The right colon and mesentery are elevated, taking care not to injure the ureter, gonadal vessels or the duodenum. The ileocolic aery is ligated close to its origin from the superior mesenteric aery ('high-tie') and divided. Where the right colic aery has a separate origin from the superior mesenteric aery (around 10% of patients) this is separately ligated. The mesentery of the distal 20 cm of ileum and the mesocolon as far as the proximal third of the transverse colon is divided. The greater omentum is divided up to the point of intended division of the transverse colon. When it is clear that there is an adequate blood supply at the resection margins, the right colon is resected, and an anastomosis is fashioned between the ileum and the transverse colon. If the tumour is at the hepatic flexure the resection must be extended fuher along the transverse colon and will involve dividing the right branch of the middle colic aery. Extended right hemicolectomy Carcinomas of the transverse colon and splenic flexure are most commonly treated by an extended right hemicolectomy. The extent of the resection is from the right colon to the descending colon. The mobilisation is as for a right hemicolectomy but dissection continues to take down the splenic flexure and the whole transverse mesocolon is ligated. Some surgeons prefer to perform a left hemicolectomy for a splenic flexure cancer. Left hemicolectomy This is the operation of choice for descending colon and sigmoid cancers . The left half of the colon is mobilised completely along the 'white line' that marks the lateral attachment of the mesocolon. As the sigmoid mesentery is mobilised, the left ureter and gonadal vessels must be identified and protected. The splenic flexure may be mobilised by extending the lateral dissection from below and completed by entering the lesser sac. The inferior mesenteric aery below its left colic branch, together with the related paracolic lymph nodes, is included in the resection by ligating the inferior mesenteric aery close to its origin ('high-tie'). For full mobility the inferior mesenteric vein is also ligated and divided at the lower border of the pancreas. The bowel and mesentery can then be resected to allow a tension-free anastomosis. A temporary diveing stoma may be fashioned upstream, usually by formation of a loop ileostomy. This is usually undeaken if the anastomosis is below the peritoneal reflection of the rectum, because healing is more likely to be impaired distally. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1264",D

True about midazolam as inducing agent,Increase in BP,Does not produce pain an IV injection,Increase cerebral Oxygen Consumption,Increase peripheral vascular resistance,"Benzodiazepines display minimal left-ventricular depressant effects, even at general anesthetic doses, except when they are coadministered with opioids (these agents interact to produce myocardial depression and aerial hypotension). Benzodiazepines given alone decrease aerial blood pressure, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance slightly, and sometimes increase hea rate. Benzodiazepines reduce cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure but not to the extent the barbiturates do. They are effective in controlling grand mal seizures. Sedative doses often produce anterograde amnesia. The mild muscle-relaxing propey of these drugs is mediated at the spinal cord level. The antianxiety, amnestic, and sedative effects seen at lower doses progress to stupor and unconsciousness at anesthetic doses. Compared with propofol or etomidate, induction with benzodiazepines is associated with a slower rate of loss of consciousness and a longer recovery. Benzodiazepines have no direct analgesic propeies. Intramuscular injections of diazepam are painful and unreliably absorbed. In contrast, midazolam and lorazepam are well absorbed after intramuscular injection, with peak levels achieved in 30 and 90 min, respectively. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Marble bone disease is an inherited disease of the skeleton which is accompanied by an increase in calcified bone tissue. It is also known as:,Osteoporosis,Osteochondritis,Osteopetrosis,Osteogenesis imperfecta,"Osteopetrosis or Albers-Schonberg Disease or Marble Bone Disease is an inherited disease of the skeleton which is accompanied by an increase in calcified bone tissue - namely osteosclerosis. The bone marrow cavity is almost completely filled with compact bone tissue and coex is thickened by periosteal bone deposition. Radiologically the bones are accordingly seen as complete shadows which give the name marble bone disease. The pathogenesis is insufficiency of osteoclasts. Hence the bone resorption is inadequate.

The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",C

It usually complicates femoral and, rarely, obturator hernias.Dual(saddie bag; pantaloon)herniaConsists of two sacs which straddle the inferior epigastric artery, one sac being medial and the other lateral to this vessel.MAYDL'S hernia (SYN. HERNIA-IN-W).Strangulated loop of the ""W"" lies within the abdomen, thus local tenderness over hernia is not marked.Spigelian herniaA variety of interparietal hernia occurring at the level of the arcuate line, it is very rare with only 1000 cases reported in the literature.The fundus of the sac, clothed by extraperitoneal fat, may lie beneath the internal oblique muscle where it is virtually impalpable. More often it advances through that muscle and spreads out like a mushroom between the internal and external oblique muscles, and gives rise to a more evident swelling. The patient is often corpulent and usually over 50 years of age, men and women being equally affected. Typically, a soft, reducible mass will be encountered lateral to the rectus muscle and below the umbilicus.Diagnosis is confirmed by computerised tomography (CT) or ultrasound scanning, the latter having the advantage of being able to stand the patient upright if no defect is visible in the reclining position. Owing to the rigid fascia surrounding the neck, strangulation may occur.Lumbar herniaMost primary lumbar hernias occur through the inferior lumbar triangle of Petit, bounded below by the crest of the ilium, laterally by the external oblique and medially by the latissimus dorsi.Less commonly, the sac comes through the superior lumbar triangle which is bounded by the twelfth rib above, medially by the sacrospinalis and laterally by the posterior border of the internal oblique.More commonly lumbar hernias are secondary to renal operations, when extensive incisional sacs may be present.Educational Points:The rule that constipation is present in intestinal obstruction does not apply in:# Richter's hernia;# Gallstone obturation;# Mesenteric vascular occlusion;# Obstruction associated with a pelvic abscess;# Partial obstruction (faecal impaction/colonic neoplasm) where diarrhoea may often occur.",B

Class ID wounds are similar except that a prosthetic device 9e.g. , mesh or valve) is inseed. Clean/ contaminated wounds (class II) includes those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary, or genitourinary tract with indigenous bacterial flora is opened under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. Contaminated wounds (class III) include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with the extensive introduction of the bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major break in the sterile techniques (e.g. Open cardiac massage), gross spillage of the viscus contents such as from the intestine, or incisio through inflamed, albeit nonpurulent, tissue. Diy wounds (Class IV) include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occured and in which the necrotic tissue is present, those created in the presence of ove infection as evidenced by the presence of purulent material, and those created to access a perforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. The microbiology of SSIs (surgical site infections) is reflective of the initial host microflora such that SSIs following creation of class I wound are invariable, due solely to skin microbes found on that poion of te body, while SSIs subsequent to a class II wound created for the purpose of elective colon resection may be caused by either skin microbes or colonic microflora, or both.

"About inguinal hernia surgery all of the following are true, except:",Hernia in children is treated with herniotomy,Absorbable mesh should not be used for surgery,Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic,Surgery can be done using laparoscopy,"Surgery can be done even if the patient is asymptomatic.
Non-absorbable mesh is used for hernia surgery.
Hernia in children can be treated with herniotomy only. Inguinal floor reconstruction can be needed in children with large hernias.
Coming to option 'c' i.e. ""Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic""
Surgery can be done even in asymptomatic patients. Let's see this in a little detail as future questions can be asked with little twists in the statement.
The decision to repair an asymptomatic hernia or go for 'watchful waiting' has been a matter of many research studies.
Surgery Vs Watchful waiting:

It's agreed that the definitive treatment of all hernias, regardless of their origin or type, is surgical repair. Outcomes are generally excellent with minimal short-term morbidity and rapid return to presurgical health. This is true even in elderly individuals, especially with the use of local anesthesia.
These surgical outcomes combined with limited outcome data in patients who do not undergo surgery have led to recommendations to offer surgery to most patients with a groin hernia, regardless of symptoms. The risks of delayed surgery are primarily related to the risk of incarceration and strangulation, which are the only true medical indications for repair of hernias. However, it is not possible to identify with any degree of reliability which hernias are likely to incarcerate or strangulate versus those that will remain uncomplicated.
The other school of thought favoring Watchful waiting say that: While surgery is clearly indicated for most patients with significant symptoms related to a hernia, it may be reasonable to delay surgery in patients with inguinal hernia who have minimal or no symptoms.
Various studies comparing ""watchful waiting"" vs ""immediate surgery in asymptomatic patients"" have found no difference in the rate of hernia accidents and pain scores between the surgery and watchful waiting groups, although patients who had immediate surgery responded that their general health had improved at one year, compared to a perception of health decline in the 'watchful waiting' group.
These findings suggest that a strategy of watchful waiting rather than referral for surgery can be considered in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia, as long as they are aware of the risk, albeit small, of hernia complications and understand the need for prompt medical attention should symptoms of these complications occur.
Although most authors agree that watchful waiting is a safe therapeutic option, some authors suggest elective surgery, rather than watchful waiting, for patients who are elderly, who have limited access to emergency care, or significant illness that would put them at greater risk for poor outcome after bowel strangulation.",C

""--Bailey 26/e p111""In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents.

All are true about radiological features of the intestinal obstruction except:,The small intestines are said to be dilated if the loops of bowel have a diameter of > 3cm.,The large bowel are said to be dilated if they are >5 cm for distal bowel and > 9 cm for proximal bowel.,Volvulus and mesenteric ischemia have characteristic signs on abdominal films.,The absence of air-fluid levels on plain supine radiographs does not rule out presence of an obstruction.,"The various threshold levels for bowel dilation are:
Small bowel -3cm
Cecum - 9cm
Distal large bowel -6cm (some books write 5cm)
Air-fluid levels in case of obstruction are seen on 'erect' abdominal films and not on 'supine', hence their absence on supine x rays would not rule out presence of obstruction.
About option 'c' 
Its very strange to combine 2 different pathologies in one generalization. Moreover volvulus can be of many types: gastric, midgut, cecal and sigmoid.
Whereas gastric, cecal and sigmoid volvulus can have specific plain x ray appearance, the midgut volvulus picture is usually non specific.
In mesenteric ischemia plain abdominal x-rays are relatively nonspecific and may be completely normal in more than it 25 percent of patients. Findings suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia include the presence of an ileus with distended loops of bowel, bowel wall thickening (particularly prominent in acute mesenteric venous thrombosis), and/or pneumatosis intestinalis.

Prolonged apnea may occur in patients with a genetically determined abnormal variant of cholinesterase following intravenous administration of,Pancuronium,Tubocurarine,Atracurium,Succinylcholine,"Both succinylcholine and mivacurium are completely and rapidly eliminated by plasma cholinesterase. Other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers, such as tubocurarine, pancuronium, and atracurium, are eliminated by renal or hepatic mechanisms or by spontaneous hydrolysis (atracurium). Patients with genetically determined atypical cholinesterase may be detected by measuring the inhibition of cholinesterase by dibucaine, a local anesthetic. Dibucaine inhibits the normal enzyme about 80%, but the abnormal variant is inhibited only 20%.",D

All true about CisATRACURIUM except-,It is pure Cis isomer of atracurium,It is more potent than atracurium,It is also causes histamine release like atracurium,Metabolism similar to atracurium,Cisatracurium is pure sis isomer of atracurium. It is more potent and has longer onset time than atracurium. Metabolism is similar to atracurium. It releases less histamine than atracurium. Cisatracurium does not cause histamine release unlike atracurium. Cisatracurium produces laudanosine but is about five times lesser than that of atracurium. Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent. Cisatracurium undergoes Hofmann Elimination which is a spontaneous non-enzymatic organ-independent degradation. So its clearance is independent of renal function. Hence it is the agent of choice in renal failure patients.,C
