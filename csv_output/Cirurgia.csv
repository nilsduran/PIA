"All of the following are true regarding post spinal headache, EXCEPT",Occurs within 48 hrs,Increased by sitting,Due to CSF Leak,Associated with photophobia,"(D) Associated with photophobia # SPINAL HEADACHES may occur after a procedure such as a spinal tap or spinal anesthesia.> During a spinal tap (lumbar puncture), a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is withdrawn from your spinal canal. During spinal anesthesia, medication is injected into your spinal canal to numb the nerves in the lower half of your body. Both procedures require a puncture in the tough sac (dura) that surrounds the spinal cord. If spinal fluid leaks through the tiny puncture site, you may develop a spinal headache.> Signs and symptoms> Spinal headaches vary in intensity from mild to incapacitating. The pain often gets worse when you sit up, stand or cough. H may decrease or go away when you lie down.> Spinal headaches are often accompanied by: Neck stiffness Ringing in the ears Sensitivity to light Nausea Hearing impairment",D
Least useful in Treatment of local anesthetic induced convulsions/seizures?,Phenytoin sodium,Thiopentone sodium,Midazolam,Propofol,"Ans. a (Phenytoin sodium) (Ref. Katzung pharma, 9th/Chapter 26; Anaesthesia by Ajay Yadav 3rd/pg. 111)When local anesthetic-induced seizures occur, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis develop rapidly. ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation) is the mainstay of treatment. Administration of O2 by mask, or ventilation support by bag and mask, is often all that is necessary to treat seizures. If seizures interfere with ventilation, benzodiazepines, small dose propofol or thiopental can be used. The use of succinylcholine effectively facilitates ventilation and, by abolishing muscular activity, decreases the severity of acidosis. However neuronal seizure activity is not inhibited and therefore, cerebral metabolism and oxygen requirements remain increased.LOCALANAESTHETICSMechanism of action of local anesthetics# Diffusion of the unionized (base) form across the nerve sheath and membrane# Re-equilibration between the base and cationic forms in the axoplasm# Binding of the cation to a receptor site inside of the Na+ channel, resulting in its blockade and consequent inhibition of Na+ conductance.Order of blockade: small fibre > large fibres; myelinated fibres > unmyelinated fibres.

"5 minutes before recovery from anesthesia, nitrous oxide is removed and 100% oxygen is administered to the patient to prevent -",Diffusion Hypoxia,Second gas effect,Hyperoxia,Bronchospasm,"Ans. is' a' i.e., Diffusion hypoxia Diffusion hypoxiao In initial part of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N2O), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intra-alveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli - Concentration effect.o During recovery reverse occurs - N2O having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air - partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced.o The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia (Fink effect).o Diffusion hypoxia occurs in first 5-10 minutes of recovery.o Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% O2 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N2O, instead of straight away switching over to air. Besides N2O, Xenon also causes diffusion hypoxia.",A

Which of the following anesthetic is safe in hea failure,Etomidate,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,"Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. In multiple studies, etomidate has been used for induction in patients with a compromised cardiovascular system who are undergoing coronary aery bypass surgery or valve surgery, as well as in patients requiring induction of general anesthesia for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aoic aneurysm repair, and thoracic surgery. For cardioversion, the rapid onset, quick recovery, and maintenance of aerial blood pressure in these sometimes hemodynamically tenuous patients, combined with continued spontaneous respiration, make etomidate an acceptable choice.

Maximum FiO2 which can be given through a nasal oxygen catheter:-,1,0.6,0.2,0.44,"A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask.

Which of the following local anaesthetic is a strong vasoconstrictor?,Procaine,Cocaine,Lignocaine,All of the above,"Cocaine inhibits the neuronal membrane transpoers for catecholamines, thereby potentiating the effect of NE at adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and reduced cocaine absorption in vascular beds where adrenergic effects predominate. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine also cause vasoconstriction. Cocaine is used only in the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, throat, and ear, where it uniquely produces vasoconstriction as well as anesthesia. The shrinking of mucous membranes decreases operative bleeding while improving surgical visualization. Comparable vasoconstriction can be achieved with other local anesthetics by the addition of a low concentration of a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine (0.005%). Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K.

Calcium oxalate stones can subsequently develop due to excessive absorption of oxalate from the colon. Normally, fatty acids are absorbed by the terminal ileum, and calcium and oxalate combine to form an insoluble compound that is not absorbed. In the absence of the terminal ileum, unabsorbed fatty acids reach the colon, where they combine with calcium, leaving free oxalate to be absorbed. Unabsorbed fatty acids and bile acids in the colon also promote oxalate uptake by the colon. Subsequently, the excess oxalate is excreted by the kidneys, promoting calcium oxalate stone formation. Hungry bone syndrome refers to rapid remineralization of bones leading to hypocalcemia and can be seen postoperatively in patients with secondary or teiary hyperparathyroidism. Pseudohyperparathyroidism refers to hypercalcemia associated with the production of parathyroidrelated peptide. A unicameral bone cyst is a benign lesion found in children",D

His hemodynamic parameters are as follows: systemic BP 70/40 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats per minute, CVP 18 mm Hg, PCWP 25 mm Hg, cardiac output 1.5 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance 1000 (dyne * s)/cm5 . Which of the following is the single best pharmacologic intervention for this patient?",Sublingual nitroglycerin,Intravenous nitroglycerin,A sho-acting b-blocker,Dobutamine,"This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the hea rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation. With minimal chronotropic effect, dobutamine only marginally increases myocardial O2 demand.",D

A Miller laryngoscope with a straight blade is introduced under the epiglottis. It fixes the larynx at the petiole of the epiglottis and lifts the larynx anteriorly to expose the glottis.# Other varieties of laryngoscopes now exist, but the Macintosh and the Miller are the most likely to be found on an emergency cart.# The right hand is used to insert the endotracheal tube, which should not be overly tight in the glottis. In children, an air leak around the tube is desirable.# Slight pressure on the cricoid cartilage by an assistant sometimes helps to visualize the larynx. This maneuver also can help to prevent aspiration of gastric contents by pressing the cricoid cartilage backward against the vertebral column to close the esophagus and help prevent regurgitation. This technique is desirable when a patient has a full stomach.TracheostomyFollowing induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient is positioned with a combination of head extension and placement of an appropriate sandbag under the shoulders. There should be no rotation of the head. Children's heads should nor be overextended as it is possible to enter the trachea in the fifth or sixth rings under thesecircumstances.REVIEW OF AIRWAY TECHNIQUES (Temporizing/Adjunctive Measures)# Chin lift/jaw thrust to open airway - caveat: no neck extension if suspected C-spine injury# Bag-valve-mask ventilation - probably the most important, yet under-appreciated, skill of airway management. In the ED, when bagging, use a two-hands on the mask technique for a tight seal, and always use an oral airway# Suctioning/removal of foreign bodies# Nasal airway - generally well-tolerated by the temporarily obtunded patient (e.g. post-ictal, post-procedural sedation, intoxicated)# Oral airway - aids in peri-intubation ventilation; not to be used in patient with intact gag reflex# Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) - this device is inserted into the mouth and has a cuff that occludes the hypopharynx. It has a port through which ventilation can then occur. A variation is the Intubating LMA - this allows the insertion of an endotracheal tube via the ventilation port.

Local anesthetic act by?,Na+ channel inhibition,Ca++ channel inhibition,Mg++ channel inhibition,K+ channel inhibition,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ channel inhibition * Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na+ channels from inside.Mechanism of action of LA* Local anesthetics act by blocking Na+ channels. By blocking Na+ channels they block nerve conduction by decreasing the entry (Influx) of Na+ ions during upstroke of action potential.* LAS prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover ->> refractory period of the fiber is increased.* LAS first penetrate the axonal membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel front inside.* Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.* So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.* Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.* Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.Sequence of events* Order of blockade of fibers B > C > Ad > Ag, b > Aa (i.e., Type B fibers are most susceptible).* Accordingly order of block is autonomic (Preganglionic sympathetic) > Sensory > motor. Order of recovery is in reverse order.* Among sensory afferents, order of block is Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure > proprioception.* When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.* Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated.* Smaller fibers are more sensitive than larger fibers.",A

Diffusion hypoxia is seen with -,Ether,Cyclopropane,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,"DIFFUSION HYPOXIA also known as FINK EFFECT OR THIRD GAS EFFECT At the end of general anesthesia, N2O is switched off so that inspired gas changes from N2O+O2 - N2+O2. As a result, N2O stas diffusing out of the blood into alveoli while N2 diffuses into blood. Due to the difference in solubilities of the two gases, N2O diffuses out more rapidly as it has high solubility. This diluted other gases present in alveoli and relative concentration of O2 falls. It is termed as diffusion hypoxia.

Most commonly used approach of brachial plexus block-,Interscalene,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus blocko This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia).Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries.o Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches : -Interscalene approachBrachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T1) may be spared.This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures, (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia).Complications include Homer syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections.Supraclavicular approachThis is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inserting the needle lateral to subclavian vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is particularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre.Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclavian artery or vein, Homer syndrome, hematoma formation.Infra-clavicular approachInfraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block.Axillary approachAxillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes.",B

Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?",Administration of hypeonic saline solution,Restriction of free water,Plasma ultrafiltration,Hemodialysis,"The initial, and often definitive, management of hyponatremia is free-water restriction. Symptomatic hyponatremia, which occurs at serum sodium levels less than or equal to 120 mEq/L, can result in headache, seizures, coma, and signs of increased intracranial pressure and may require infusion of hypeonic saline. Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).",B

Which of the following agent causes muscle rigidity,Fentanyl,Halothane,Ketamine,Droperidol,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

It consists of a fresh gas flow inlet, a narrow inner tube, a corrugated outer tube, a reservoir (breathing) bag, an adjustable pressure limiting valve and a facemask at the patient end. Itdoes nothave aCarbon dioxide absorberunlike the circle breathing systems. Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases.",B

Pneumothorax is seen most commonly with which approach of brachial block:-,Interscalene,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,"In supraclavicular approach of brachial block as pleura is in close vicinity. The anterior rami of C5 to T1 form the brachial plexus, which exits the cervical spine to form the superior, middle, and inferior trunks that travel between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk divides into an anterior and posterior branch, which subsequently rejoins to form the lateral, posterior, and medial cords as it travels distally to the clavicle. The supraclavicular approach blocks the brachial plexus from the distal trunks to the proximal cords but often is targeted at the divisions level. General complications to peripheral nerve blockade apply to supraclavicular blocks including risk for infection, bleeding, and neuropathy. With the advent of ultrasonography, constant visualization of the needle tip, first rib, and pleura can decrease the risk for pneumothorax. Common, self-limited, side effects associated with other proximal brachial plexus blockade include hoarseness due to an ipsilateral laryngeal nerve block, Horner syndrome from stellate ganglion block, and hemidiaphragmatic paresis from a phrenic nerve blockade.",B

Anesthetic of choice for day care procedures is?,Morphine,Ketamine,Propofol,Diazepam,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Propofol Ambulatory (outpatient/day care) anaesthesia -* Ambulatory or day care or outpatient anaesthesia means, patient comes on same day, gets operated and is discharged on same day. So, the drugs used in outpatient anaesthesia are those which have short duration of action. Anaesthetic techniques and agents ideal for day care surgery are: -Premedication* Usually premedication is not used. However in anxious patients, midazolam is the drug of choice, which should be given 1-2 hours before the surgery with sip of water by oral route or 30 min. before surgery by im route. If patient is prone to nausea and vomiting, dolasetron is the drug of choice. Ondansetron is an alternative.Airway* Laryngeal mask airway is preferred over intubation.Intravenous anaesthetics* Intravenous route is the preferred method for induction. Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for induction because of its smooth induction and rapid recovery. Antiemetic action of propofol is also beneficial - use of propofol for induction or maintenance of anaesthesia is associated with a reduced incidence of post- operative nausea and vomiting.Inhalational agents* Inhalational anaesthetics are preferred for the maintenance. Desflurane (1st choice) and sevoflurane (2nd choice are the agents of choice. These agents are used along with N2O as N2O decreases the requirement of other anaesthetics hence fastening the recovery. Halothane and isoflurane have largely been replaced by the less soluble desflurane and sevoflurane.Muscle relaxants* Mivacurium is the muscle relaxant of choice because of its short duration of action. Succinylcholine should be avoided as it causes post-operative myalgia. However, if intubation is required, succinylcholine remains the agent of choice.Opioid analgesics* Opioids compounds are frequently administered during anaesthesia to suppress autonomic responses to tracheal intubation and painful (noxious) surgical stimuli. These drugs are also useful supplements to inhaled anaesthetics during maintenance period. Alfentanil is the agent of choice because of rapid onset and shorter duration of action. Remifentanil is emerging as an alternative because of much shorter duration of action. Fentanyl or sufentanil can also be used.",C

Local anaesthetic injected directly into the tissue -,Infiltration anaesthesia,Nerve block,Field block,Bier's block,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Infiltration anaesthesia Infiltration anaesthesiao It is the injection of local anaesthetic directly into tissue without taking into consideration the course of cutaneous nerve.o It can be so superficial as to include only the skin, it also can include deeper structureso It is used for minor surgeries, e.g. incision & drainage, suturing etc.o Adrenaline can be used along with LA to prolong its duration of action and to prevent its systemic absorptiono However adrenaline containing solution should not be used into tissues supplied by endarteries, e.g. in fingers and toes, ear, nose, and penis because vasoconstriction may lead to gangrene.Conduction blockA. Field blocko Is produced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of local anaesthetic in order to anaesthetize the region distal to the injection.o For example, subcutaneous infiltration of the proximal portion of the volar surface of the forearm results in extensive area of cutaneous anaesthesia that starts 2 to 3 cm distal to the site of injection.B. Nerve blocko LA is injected around a peripheral nerve or a plexus. Examples are -Upper limb - brachial plexus and wrist blockHead & Neck - Stellate ganglion block, trigeminal nerve block.Thorax & abdomen - Interc4ostal nerve & celiac plexuso Note - Most common complication of brachial plexus block is pneumothorax.",A

A 45 year old male with h/o smoking is scheduled for elective surgery. All are true except,Effect of nicotine on aoic and carotid bodies can increase sympathetic tone,Carbon monoxide shift 02-lib dissociation curve to right,Muscle relaxant dose requirements are increased,Smoking dereases surfactant levels,"B i.e. Carbon monoxide shift 02-Hb dissociation curve to right Smoking increases airway irritability & secretions, decreases surfactant mucopulmonary transpo and increases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. - Cessation of smoking for 12 to 24 hrs before operation decreases the level of carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin, which shift oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the rightQ and increases the 02 available to tissue. (CO shift oxyHb dissociation curve to left). - Improvement in mucociliary transpo and small airway function and decrease in sputum production require prolonged abstinence (8-12 weeks) from smoking. So the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications decrease with abstinence from cigarette smoking for > 8 weeks in patients undergoing cardiac (coronary aery bypass) surgery and > 4 weeks in patients underging pulmonary surgery. - Smoking sholy before surgery may be a/w an increased incidence ST segment depression on ECG. Major action of nicotine consists initially of transient stimulation (at small doses) and subsequently of a more persistent depression of all autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) ganglia (at larger doses). Nicotine also possess a biphasic action on adrenal medulla i.e. small doses evoke whereas larger doses prevent the discharge of catecholamines in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation. The effect of nicotine on neuromuscular junction are similar to those on ganglia i.e. initial stimulant phase (contractions) f/b blockade by receptor desensitization (IA rapidly developing paralysis). Nicotine, like Ach, stimulates number of sensory receptors such as mechanoreceptors (to stretch or pressure) of skin, mesentry, tongue, lung and stomach; chemoreceptors of carotid and aoic body, thermal receptors of skin and tongue; pain receptors; and emetic chemorecepto trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema of medulle oblongata (causing vomiting). Nicotine markedly stimulates CNS i.e. weak analgesia at low doses; tremors and convulsion at higher doses followed by CNS depression and death from respiratory failure. So it can be assumed for the above description that smoking (low nicotine) can stimulate aoic and carotid body, increase sympathetic tone and stimulate NMJ thereby increasing the muscle relaxant dose requirements.",B

Venous Air Embolism is common in which position,Sitting,Supine,Prone,Left lateral,"(A) Sitting # Venous air embolism (VAE), the entry of gas into the peripheral or central vasculature, can occur secondary to iatrogenic complications, trauma, and even certain recreational activities.> VAE results when a large bolus of air entering the venous system can cause an air lock in the right atrium and ventricle, leading to outflow obstruction, decreased pulmonary venous return, and subsequent decreased left ventricular preload and cardiac output.> Pathogenesis of pulmonary endothelial injury may have components of platelet-fibrin thrombi from the right ventricle, cytokine release, neutrophil, platelet, and complement activation at the microvascular air-blood interface, and injury mediated by lipid peroxidation and oxygen radicals.> Physical examination may reveal the following signs: Tachycardia Tachypnea Cyanosis Altered level of consciousness Hypotension Cardiac ""mill wheel"" murmur-A loud, churning, machinery like murmur heard over the precordium (a late sign) Sudden loss of consciousness followed by convulsion in an intubated patient on positive-pressure ventilation Circulatory shock or sudden death (patients with severe VAE)> CAUSES:1. Primary cause of VAE is surgical procedures, especially neurosurgical procedures performed in the upright, sitting position. Anytime the operative site is more than 5 cm above the right atrium, VAE is a risk. Other surgical procedures that can lead to the infusion of air include obstetric/gynecologic procedures (cesarean section), craniofacial surgery, dental implant surgery, vascular procedures, liver transplantation, and orthopedic procedures (e.g., hip replacement, arthroscopy). The frequency of reported VAE in surgical procedures ranges from 10% in cervical laminectomy up to 80% in posterior fossa surgery.2. Second cause of VAE is iatrogenic creation of a pressure gradient for air entry. Examples include spinal needles in lumbar punctures (case report), peripheral intravenous lines, central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, hemodialysis catheters, and long-term (Hickman) catheters. Most cases occur during catheter manipulation, disconnection, or removal. A pressure difference of 5 cm of H2O across a 14-gauge needle allows 100 ml of air per second to enter the venous system. The frequency of reported VAE with central catheter use ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 3000.3. A third cause of VAE is mechanical insufflation or infusion. Insufflation has been documented to occur during arthroscopic procedures, CO2 hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, urethral insufflation, and orogenital sexual activity during pregnancy. Infusion air entry can occur during the injection of contrast agents for CT scans, angiography, and cardiac catheterization, and during cardiac ablation procedures.4. A fourth cause of VAE is positive-pressure ventilation, which can occur during mechanical ventilation and SCUBA diving.5. Finally, blunt and penetrating trauma to the chest, abdomen, neck, and face can lead to the entry of air and ultimately to VAE",A

"A 68-year-old hypeensive man undergoes successful repair of a ruptured abdominal aoic aneurysm. He receives 9 L Ringer lactate solution and 4 units of whole blood during the operation. Two hours after transfer to the surgical intensive care unit, the following hemodynamic parameters are obtained: systemic blood pressure (BP) 90/60 mm Hg, pulse 110 beats per minute, central venous pressure (CVP) 7 mm Hg, pulmonary aery pressure 28/10 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 8 mm Hg, cardiac output 1.9 L/min, systemic vascular resistance 1400 (dyne*s)/cm5 (normal is 900-1300), PaO2 140 mm Hg (FiO2 : 0.45), urine output 15 mL/h (specific gravity: 1.029), and hematocrit 35%. Given this data, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Administration of a diuretic to increase urine output,Administration of a vasopressor agent to increase systemic blood pressure,Administration of a fluid challenge to increase urine output,Administration of a vasodilating agent to decrease elevated systemic vascular resistance,"A ruptured abdominal aneurysm is a surgical emergency often accompanied by serious hypotension and vascular collapse before surgery and massive fluid shifts with renal failure after surgery. In this case, all the hemodynamic parameters indicate inadequate intravascular volume, and the patient is therefore suffering from hypovolemic shock. The low urine output indicates poor renal perfusion, while the high urine-specific gravity indicates adequate renal function with compensatory free-water conservation. The administration of a vasopressor agent would ceainly raise the blood pressure, but it would do so by increasing peripheral vascular resistance and thereby fuher decrease tissue perfusion. The deleterious effects of shock would be increased. A vasodilating agent to lower the systemic vascular resistance would lead to profound hypotension and possibly complete vascular collapse because of pooling of an already depleted vascular volume. This patient's blood pressure is critically dependent on an elevated systemic vascular resistance. A diuretic would exacerbate the patient's existing volume depletion. To properly treat this patient, rapid fluid infusion and expansion of the intravascular volume must be undeaken. This can be easily done with lactated Ringer solution or blood (or both) until improvements in such parameters as the PCWP, urine output, and blood pressure are noted.",C

The characteristic features of which of the following agent makes it ideal inhalational agent-,Xenon,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,N2O,"Xenon has quick onset of effect and minimal effect on cardiovascular and neural system. Xenon is Non- teratogenic. Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xenon produces no green house effect or ozone depletion and is environmentally safe, unlike the other inhaled anesthetics. Does not trigger malignant hypehermia Other advantages of xenon: Ine Minimal cardiovascular effects- It produces minimal cardiovascular depression, and it is not arrhythmogenic. Nonexplosive Has Analgesic activity - reduces intraoperative opioid requirements Disadvantages of Xenon High cost Low potency (MAC = 70%) Xenon gas has a very high density (5.9 g/L) resulting in increased flow resistance and work of breathing.

Time sparing methods of Preoxygenation described is-,Four vital capacity breath is 30 secs.,Eight vital capacity breath is 1 min,Two breath breaths,None of the above,"Preoxygenation before anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation is a widely accepted maneuver, designed to increase the body oxygen stores and thereby delay the onset of aerial hemoglobin desaturation during apnea. Because difficulties with ventilation and intubation are unpredictable, the need for preoxygenation is desirable in all patients. During emergence from anesthesia, residual effects of anesthetics and inadequate reversal of neuromuscular blockade can lead to hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and loss of airway patency. In accordance, routine preoxygenation before the tracheal extubation has also been recommended. time sparing method is to ask patient to take 4 full vital capacity breaths.",A
Which inhalational agent acts on NMDA receptor:-,Xenon,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Isoflurane,"acts on NMDA receptor Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and so produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. the disadvantage with Xenon gas is its high density (5.9 g/L), which is much higher than oxygen and nitrous oxide which leads to increased flow resistance and work of breathing. Thus it is not suitable for patients with compromised respiratory function. It has minimal cardiovascular effects- It produces minimal cardiovascular depression, and it is not arrhythmogenic- and so is safe in cardiac patients. Xenon produces no green house effect or ozone depletion and is environmentally safe, unlike the other inhaled anesthetics.

The following anaesthetic drug causes pain on intravenous administration,Midazolam,Propofol,Ketamine,Thiopentone sodium,"Induction of anesthesia with propofol is often associated with pain on injection, apnea, hypotension, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the vein into which propofol is injected. Pain on injection is reduced by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, and adding lidocaine to the propofol solution or changing the propofol formulation. Multiple other drugs and distraction techniques have been investigated to reduce the pain on injection of propofol. Pretreatment with a small dose of propofol, opiates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ketamine, esmolol or metoprolol, magnesium, a flash of light, a clonidine-ephedrine combination, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide all have been tested with variable efficacy.

Which of the following is the mechanism of action of local anaesthetic?,Block Na+ channel,Block K+ channel,Open Na+ channel,Block Ca++ channel,"preventing channel activation and inhibiting the Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Local anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. With increasing local anesthetic concentrations, an increasing fraction of the Na channels in the membrane bind a local anesthetic molecule and cannot conduct Na ions. As a consequence, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation and impulse conduction increases progressively. At high enough local anesthetic concentrations and with a sufficient fraction of local anesthetic-bound Na channels, an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished.

Best site for going spinal anaesthesia is interveebral space between.,L2 - L3,L3 - L4,L1 - L2,L5 - S1,"The spinal canal contains the spinal cord with its covering (the meninges), fatty tissue and venous plexus. The meninges are composed of three layers: the pia mater, the arachnoid mater and the Dura meter. The spinal subdural space is poorly demarcated. The epidural space is a better defined potential space within the spinal canal that is bounded by the Dura meter and ligamentum flavum. There is cerebrospinal fluid between pia meter and Archnoid meter and this space is called sub arachnoid space. The spinal cord normally extends from the foramen magnum to the level of L1 in adults. so in adults we can give spinal anesthesia below this level in L2/L3, L3/L4. L2/L3 IS BETTER SPACE In children the spinal cord ends at L3 and moves up with age. The blood supply to the spinal cord and nerve roots is derived from a single anterior spinal aery and pair posterior aeries.",A
Local anaesthetics act by?,Na channel inhibition inside gate,Na channel inhibition outside gate,K channel inhibition inside gate,K channel inhibition outside gate,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na channel inhibition inside gate Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na' channels from inside. Mechanism of action of LA Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all pa of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage. Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted. Mechanism of action Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases : Recovery Resting (close) - Active (open) - Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state --> channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased. LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Net' channel from inside. Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na' channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor. So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly. Degree of blockade is frequency dependent greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation. Exposure to higher concentration of Ca' reduces inactivation of Na' channels and lessens the block. Order of blockade of fibres B > C > AS> Ace, (3 & y (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order. Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure. When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all. Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated. Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

Pre-oxygenation is done to?,Increase the oxygen content of FRC,Decrease the nitrogen content of FRC,Both,None,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Both Pre-oxygenation* Pre-oxygenation is the administration of oxygen to a patient prior to intubation to extend 'the safe apnea time (duration of time following cessation of breathing/ventilation until critical arterial desaturation occurs).* The aim of pre-oxygenation is to increase to oxygen reserve of body which is in the form of functional residual capacity (FRC), i.e., the air remaining in the lungs after normal expiration. The oxygen content of the FRC filled with air is 21% i.e., at the end of the expiration oxygen content is 21 % in the air of lung. Normal FRC is 2.5 litres, therefore oxygen content is 500 ml (21% of 2.5 litres). Most of the remaining gas is nitrogen. This oxygen content will last only for 2 minutes (oxygen consumption is 250 ml/min).* By pre-oxygenation, we washout nitrogen (denitrogenation) with 100% O2 - O2 content of FRC is 2.5 litres (100%) - Lasts for 8 to 10 minutes.* Pre oxygenation is done for 3 minutes because 99% of denitrogenation (nitrogen wash out) takes place in 3 minutes.",C

Reason of difficult intubation in an obese patient is?,Difficult visualization,Decreased safe apnea time,Lower tidal volume,All of the above,"Ans is 'd' i.e. All of the aboveReasons for difficult intubation in obese patientsi) Increased soft tissue mass* The increased weight & volume of soft tissue can distort the airway in a supine obese patient, making visualization of vital structures harder.* This can also make ""lifting up"" on the laryngoscope handle harder, as there is more weight to lift.ii) Increased pressure on diaphragm* Obese abdomens prevent normal diaphragmatic excursion, more so in supine position. This leads to lower tidal volumes in spontaneously breathing patients, faster desaturation once sedated/paralysed, and more difficult bag-valve-mask ventilation.iii) Reduced ""Safe Apnoea Time""* This is the time between rendering a patient apnoeic with an anaesthetic, and the time they start to desaturate.* This happens more quickly in obese patients due to the poor mechanics of their airway (mentioned above), and their increased metabolic demands.",D

Inhalat ional anesthetic agent of choice in children is?,Sevoflurane,Methoxyflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sevoflurane * Unlike desflurane, sevoflurane poses no problem in induction, acceptability is good even in pediatric patients.* Therefore, sevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for induction.Anesthesia in Children -InductionInhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",A

Which of the following type of receptor is involved in malignant hypehermia ?,Nicotinic receptor,Ryanodine receptor,Muscarinic receptor,None,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. It is associated with mutations in 2 genes: RyR1 (ryanodine receptor type 1), which encodes the skeletal muscle isoform of the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and CACNA1S, which encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type calcium channel isoform of the sarcolemma (dihydropyridine receptor). The RyR1 gene is located on chromosome 19. Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a subclinical myopathy that allows large quantities of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle and cause a hypermetabolic state after exposure to triggering agents. Altered calcium channel gating kinetics in the SR is the underlying cause. The sustained elevation of calcium allows excessive stimulation of aerobic and anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, which accounts for respiratory and metabolic acidosis, rigidity, altered cell permeability, and hyperkalemia.",B

The disadvantage is that inspiratory time relatively sho, and this can lead to uneven filling of alveoli. Volume control modes of ventilation By definition, in volume control modes the tidal volume is the defined variable which is used by the ventilator to give feedback to the solenoid valve circuits. As volume and flow are inextricably linked, the volume control modes are generally constant flow modes, i.e. the ventilator delivers flow which is constant, and stops this flow when the desired volume is achieved. Because pressure is not controlled or regulated in any way, the pressure waveform takes a parabolic sloping shape as the lungs distend during a breath.",A
"Regarding the Royal College of Anaesthetists 4th National Project , True statement is",Airway complications in intensive care resulted in death or disability in less than 20% of cases,End-tidal CO2 monitoring (capnography) is not always necessary for intubation,Regular audit of airway complications should occur,Transfer of an intubated patient is deemed low risk for airway complications,"Only 20% of the total cases repoed to the NAP4 involved intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, when airway complications did occur within the ICU, they were more likely to be associated with a much higher incidence of death or severe disability (61%), when compared to the anesthesia or emergency depament. Capnography is paramount for monitoring anyone with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy. It may prevent significant harm by indicating oesophageal intubation or displacement of tracheostomy or endotracheal tube and is recommended by the Royal College of Anaesthetists as a standard of care in the UK. Regular audit and education are impoant to improve staff awareness and patient care when dealing with any intubated/tracheostomised patient. All staff undeaking any routine movement/turns or transfer of intubated patients, need to be ale to the potential risk of airway displacement and have an established management plan if this were to occur.Reference: RCOA/DAS. 4th National Audit Project, 2011.

The following modes of ventilation may be used for weaning off patients from mechanical ventilation except:,Controlled Mechanical ventilation (CMV),Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV).,Pressure suppo ventilation(PSV),Assist-control ventilation (ACV),"A i.e. Controlled mechanical ventilation Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) is best reserved for patients capable of little or no ventilatory effo. In this mode, VT and ventilatory rate are fixed (minute ventilation) regardless of patient effo, because patient can not breathe spontaneously. So this mode will pay no role in weaning a patient from mechanical ventilation, setling to limit inspiratory pressure guard against pulmonary barotraumaQ. In Assist control ventilation (ACV) by incorporating a pressure sensor in breathing circuit, the patients inspiratory effo can be used to trigger inspiration. The ventilator can be set for a fixed ventilatory rate, but each patient effo of sufficient magnitude will trigger the set VT (tidal volume). And if the spontaneous inspiratory effos are not detected the machine functions as if in the control mode.

Commonest complication of celiac plexus block is,Bradycardia,Hypotension,Seizures,Retroperitoneal hematoma,"Celiac plexus is a sympathetic ganglion thus blocking it will always cause hypotension. The celiac plexus is the largest plexus of the sympathetic nervous system. It contains preganglionic sympathetic fibers from greater and lesser splanchnic nerves (emerge from the thoracic sympathetic ganglia, T5 to T12) as well as postganglionic sympathetic and preganglionic parasympathetic fibers. It provides sensory innervation and sympathetic outflow to stomach, liver, spleen, pancreas, kidney and GI tract up to splenic flexure. Plexus is located at the level of T12-L2 (usually L1) and lies anterior to aoa in the retroperitoneal space. Indications Most common indication is treatment of pain caused by pancreatic cancer. Occasionally used in the treatment of pain from chronic pancreatitis (controversial). Can be used for pain from other GI malignancies from LES to splenic flexure, as well as liver, spleen and kidneys. Complications Ohostatic hypotension (most common, can be minimized with fluid hydration) and diarrhea (secondary to blockade of sympathetic fibers).

Rocuronium is the fastest acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Rocuronium (at a dose of 0.9-1.2 mg/kg) has an onset of action that approaches succinylcholine (60-90 s), making it a suitable alternative for rapid-sequence induction. Rocuronium is less potent than most other steroidal muscle relaxants (potency appears to be inversely related to speed of onset). Because rocuronium does not have active metabolites, it may be a better choice than vecuronium for prolonged infusions. Its duration of action is not significantly affected by renal disease, but it is modestly prolonged by severe hepatic failure and pregnancy. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.E., Mikhail M.S., Murray M.J. (2006).

True about midazolam as inducing agent,Increase in BP,Does not produce pain an IV injection,Increase cerebral Oxygen Consumption,Increase peripheral vascular resistance,"Benzodiazepines display minimal left-ventricular depressant effects, even at general anesthetic doses, except when they are coadministered with opioids (these agents interact to produce myocardial depression and aerial hypotension). Benzodiazepines given alone decrease aerial blood pressure, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance slightly, and sometimes increase hea rate. Benzodiazepines reduce cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure but not to the extent the barbiturates do. They are effective in controlling grand mal seizures. Sedative doses often produce anterograde amnesia. The mild muscle-relaxing propey of these drugs is mediated at the spinal cord level. The antianxiety, amnestic, and sedative effects seen at lower doses progress to stupor and unconsciousness at anesthetic doses. Compared with propofol or etomidate, induction with benzodiazepines is associated with a slower rate of loss of consciousness and a longer recovery. Benzodiazepines have no direct analgesic propeies. Intramuscular injections of diazepam are painful and unreliably absorbed. In contrast, midazolam and lorazepam are well absorbed after intramuscular injection, with peak levels achieved in 30 and 90 min, respectively. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Fulminant hepatic failure can be caused by,Halothane,Isoflurane,Nitrous oxide,Phenobarbitone,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Ketamine contraindicated in all except?,Head injury,Hypeension,Asthma,Glaucoma,"Ans. is `c' i.e., Asthma Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol&etomidate, which have cerebroprotectiveeffect, therefore ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, intracranial space occupying lesions and for neuroanaesthesia. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the aerial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT. Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant &vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and hea rate-Cardiac 02 demand is increased. Ketamine is contraindicated in aoic aneurysm, hypeensive and ischemic hea disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the hea to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur. As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation, it is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia. Ketamine increases intra-ocular tension - Contraindicated in glaucoma & open eye surgery. It is a potent bronchodilator and relieves bronchospasm - Intravenous anesthetic agent of choice in asthmatic (inhalational anaesthetic agent of choice in asthmatics is halothane) It increases uterine tone and intensity of uterine contraction - agent of choice in patients with obstetric haemorrhage and flaccid uterus.

Which of the following induction agent produce cardiac stability-,Ketamine,Etomidate,Propofol,Midazolam,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular systemEtomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",B

A 6 year old boy taken for ophthalmic examination under anaesthesia. His father told that he has lower limb weakness & his elder brother died at 14 years of age. Which anaethetic drug has to be avoided-,Succinylcholine,Pancuronium,Atracurium,Dexacurium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Succinylcholine Succinylcholine SCh is a depolarising skeletal muscle relaxant. It causes sustained paial depolarization of muscle end plate --> intially produce twitching and fasciculation followed by flaccid paralysis. It is the shoest and fastest acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It is the only muscle relaxant which stimulate autonomic ganglia and vagus. SCh is the most commonly used muscle relaxant for passing endotracheal tube (mivacurium and rocuronium are alternatives). SCh is rapidly hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase, some patients have genetically determined abnormality or deficiency of pseudocholinesterase, in them, SCh causes phase II block. It can cause muscle fasiculations and soreness, change in BP and HR, arrythmia, histamine release and IC efflux from muscles. Dangerous hyperkalemia can occur in patients with burn, crush injury, muscular dystrophy, GB. Syndrome, paraplegia or hemiplagia, mysthenia gravis and rhabdomyolysis contraindicated in such patients. o It can accentuate malignant hypehermia caused by halothane.

Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following surgeries except ?,Cochlear implant,Microlaryngeal surgery,Vitreoretinal surgery,Exentration operation,"Exentration operation One major problem with N20 is that it will exchange with N2 in any air containing cavity in the body. Moreover, because of their differential blood : gas paition coefficients, nitrous oxide will enter the cavity faster than nitrogen escapes, thereby increasing the volume and/or pressure in the cavity. Examples of air collections that can be expanded by nitrous oxide are : - Pneumothorax - Air embolus - Obstructed middle ear - Obstructed loop of bowel - lntracranial air - A pulmonary (bleep) Nitrous oxide should be avoided in these clinical settings: Now lets move on to the options Nitrous oxide in vitreoretinal surgery The use of nitrous oxide anaesthesia in patients with an intraocular gas bubble is potentially sight threatening. Patients who have vitreoretinal surgery often have a gas bubble deliberately left within the eyes as it helps keep the retina attached while adhesions develop. Filtered room air, Sulfur hexqfluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases. By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N20 replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N20 the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: ? - Serous otitis media - Disaiculation of stapes - Impaired hearing N20 anaesthesia is hazadrous to hearing iu patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Microlaryngeal surgery CO2and (Nd : YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia.

KDT 6th ed. Pg. 459.# Midazolam: The hepatic clearance of IV anesthetics with a high (e.g., etomidate, propofol, ketamine) or intermediate (e.g., methohexital, midazolam) extraction ratio is largely dependent on hepatic blood flow, with most of the drug being removed from the blood as it flows through the liver (so- called perfusion-limited clearance). Midazolam undergoes extensive oxidation by hepatic enzymes to form water-soluble hydroxylated metabolites, which are excreted in the urine. The hepatic clearance rate of midazolam is five times greater than lorazepam and 10 times greater than diazepam. Although changes in liver blood flow can affect the clearance of midazolam, age has relatively little influence on midazolam's elimination half-life..........

All are complication of PEEP except :-,Decreased urine ouput,Increased blood pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Increased intrathoracic pressure,"Positive end expiratory pressure decreases venous return and decreases cardiac output and hence blood pressure decreases and decreased perfusion so urine output can reduce. Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequentcomplicationofPEEPtherapy. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient maintained on mechanical ventilation with an already compromised respiratory status. Positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP is a mode of therapy used in conjunction with mechanical ventilation. At the end of mechanical or spontaneous exhalation, PEEP maintains the patient's airway pressure above the atmospheric level by exeing pressure that opposes passive emptying of the lung. This pressure is typically achieved by maintaining a positive pressure flow at the end of exhalation. This pressure is measured in centimeters of water. PEEP therapy can be effective when used in patients with a diffuse lung disease that results in an acute decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of gas that remains in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. FRC is determined by primarily the elastic characteristics of the lung and chest wall. In many pulmonary diseases, FRC is reduced because of the collapse of the unstable alveoli. This reduction in lung volume decreases the surface area available for gas exchange and results in intrapulmonary shunting (unoxygenated blood returning to the left side of the hea). If FRC is not restored, a high concentration of inspired oxygen may be required to maintain the aerial oxygen content of the blood in an acceptable range. Applying PEEP increases alveolar pressure and alveolar volume. The increased lung volume increases the surface area by reopening and stabilizing collapsed or unstable alveoli. This splinting, or propping open, of the alveoli with positive pressure improves the ventilation-perfusion match, reducing the shunt effect. After a true shunt is modified to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch with PEEP, lowered concentrations of oxygen can be used to maintain an adequate PaO2. PEEP therapy may also be effective in improving lung compliance. When FRC and lung compliance are decreased, additional energy and volume are required to inflate the lung. By applying PEEP, the lung volume at the end of exhalation is increased. The already paially inflated lung requires less volume and energy than before for full inflation. When used to treat patients with a diffuse lung disease, PEEP should improve compliance, decrease dead space, and decrease the intrapulmonary shunt effect. The most impoant benefit of the use of PEEP is that it enables the patient to maintain an adequate PaO2 at a low and safe concentration of oxygen (< 60%), reducing the risk of oxygen toxicity . Because PEEP is not a benign mode of therapy and because it can lead to serious hemodynamic consequences, the ventilator operator should have a definite indication to use it. The addition of external PEEP is typically justified when a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg cannot be achieved with an FIO2 of 60% or if the estimated initial shunt fraction is greater than 25%. No evidence suppos adding external PEEP during initial setup of the ventilator to satisfy misguided attempts to supply prophylactic PEEP or physiologic PEEP.",B

The misconception that the entire bowel does not function in the early postoperative period is still widely held. Intestinal motility and absorption studies have clarified the patterns by which bowel activity resumes. The stomach remains uncoordinated in its muscular activity and does not empty efficiently for about 24 hours after abdominal procedures. The small bowel functions normally within hours of surgery and is able to accept nutrients promptly, either by nasoduodenal or percutaneous jejunal feeding catheters or, after 24 hours, by gastric emptying. The colon is stimulated in large measure by the gastrocolic reflex but ordinarily is relatively inactive for 3 to 4 days. Well-nourished patients who undergo uncomplicated surgical procedures can tolerate up to 10 days without full nutritional suppo before significant problems with protein breakdown begin to occur. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because of decreased risks of nosocomial infections and catheter-related complications and increased benefit in preventing mucosal atrophy",B

The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in ""emergency airways management"". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. The better option of intubation in this patient is orotracheal intubation. The ideal management in this patient is cricothyroidotomy. Since that is not mentioned in the question intubation in the next best option. ""Orotracheal intubation would be preferred over nasotracheal intubation in these cases""",B

Complications of HIT are related to venous and/or aerial thromboembolic phenomena. Treatment of HIT consists of cessation of heparin (including low-molecular-weight heparins), institution of a nonheparin anticoagulant such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (examples include lepirudin and argatroban), and conversion to oral warfarin when appropriate. Cessation of heparin alone is inadequate to prevent thromboembolic complications, and warfarin should not be staed until the platelet count is above 100,000/mm3 .

All are true about ketamine except,Increases ICT,Decreases blood pressure,Increases intraocular pressure,Increases intragastric pressure,"Ketamine increases all the pressures. i.e intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, intragastric pressure. With the rise in CBF and the generalized increase in sympathetic nervous system response, ICP increases after ketamine use. The increase in CMRO2 and CBF can be blocked by the use of thiopental or diazepam. The received dogma about ketamine is that it increases cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. These effects would seem to preclude its use in patients with space-occupying intracranial lesions such as occur with head trauma; however, recent publications offer convincing evidence that when combined with a benzodiazepine (or another agent acting on the same GABA receptor system) and controlled ventilation (in techniques that exclude nitrous oxide), ketamine is not associated with increased intracranial pressure. Ketamine increases aerial blood pressure, hea rate, and cardiac output, paicularly after rapid bolus injections. These indirect cardiovascular effects are due to the central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine after release at nerve terminals. Accompanying these changes are increases in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Minimum &;starvation time&; required in general anaesthesia,4 hours,8 hours,12 hours,24 hours,"Traditionally, patients are considered to be at risk if their gastric volume is greater than 25 mL (0.4 mL/kg) and their gastric pH is less than 2.5. Some investigators believe that controlling acidity is more impoant than volume and that the criteria should be revised to a pH less than 3.5 with a volume greater than 50 mL. Patients who have eaten immediately prior to emergency surgery are obviously at risk. Traditionally, ""NPO after midnight"" implied a preoperative fast of at least 6 h. The current opinion allows clear liquids until 2 h before the induction of anesthesia. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guideline, breast milk is permitted up to 4 h before anesthesia. Infant formula, nonhuman milk, and a light meal are permitted up to 6 h before induction. Patients consuming a heavy meal including meat, fats, and fried foods should fast for 8 h. Ceain patient populations are paicularly likely to have large volumes of acidic gastric fluid: patients with an acute abdomen or peptic ulcer disease, children, the elderly, diabetic patients, pregnant women, and obese patients. Fuhermore, pain, anxiety, or opioids may delay gastric emptying. Note that pregnancy and obesity place patients in double jeopardy by increasing the chance of aspiration (increased intraabdominal pressure and distoion of the lower esophageal sphincter) and the risk of aspiration pneumonia (increased acidity and volume of gastric contents). Aspiration is more common in patients undergoing esophageal, upper abdominal, or emergency laparoscopic surgery. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail&;s clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Which of the following anesthetic agents does not trigger malignant hypehermia,Halothane,Isoflurane,Suxamethonium,Thiopentone,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a rare (1:15,000 in pediatric patients and 1:40,000 in adult patients) genetic hypermetabolic muscle disease, the characteristic phenotypical signs and symptoms of which most commonly appear with exposure to inhaled general anesthetics or succinylcholine (triggering agents). MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

The most suitable agent for IV induction and maintenance in a day care surgery,Etomidate,Ketamine,Propofol,Thiopentone,"PROPOFOL The active ingredient in propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/ml) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2.25% glycerol, and 1.2% purified egg phosphatide. In the United States, disodium EDTA (0.05 mg/ml) or sodium metabisulfite (0.25 mg/ml) is added to inhibit bacterial growth. The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. As with barbiturates, dosages should be reduced in the elderly and in the presence of other sedatives and increased in young children. Because of its reasonably sho elimination half-life, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. For sho procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Infusion rates should be tailored to patient response and the levels of other hypnotics. Sedating doses of propofol are 20% to 50% of those required for general anesthesia. However, even at these lower doses, caregivers should be vigilant and prepared for all of the side effects of propofol discussed below, paicularly airway obstruction and apnea. Propofol elicits pain on injection that can be reduced with lidocaine and the use of larger arm and antecubital veins. Excitatory phenomena during induction with propofol occur at about the same frequency as with thiopental, but much less frequently than with methohexital. Side Effects: Nervous System: The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO2, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Like thiopental, propofol has been used in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia; however, no human outcome studies have been performed to determine its efficacy as a neuroprotectant. Results from studies on the anticonvulsant effects of propofol have been mixed; some data even suggest it has proconvulsant activity when combined with other drugs. Thus, unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures. Cardiovascular. Propofol produces a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure that is significantly greater than that produced by thiopental. The fall in blood pressure can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. Propofol appears to blunt the baroreceptor reflex or is directly vagotonic because smaller increases in hea rate are seen for any given drop in blood pressure after doses of propofol. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure. Respiratory and Other Side Effects: At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Propofol appears to be less likely than barbiturates to provoke bronchospasm. It has no clinically significant effects on hepatic, renal, or endocrine organ systems. Unlike thiopental, propofol appears to have significant anti-emetic action and is a good choice for sedation or anesthesia of patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting. Propofol provokes anaphylactoid reactions and histamine release at about the same low frequency as thiopental. Although propofol does cross placental membranes, it is considered safe for use in pregnant women, and like thiopental, only transiently depresses activity in the newborn.",C

Warfarin to be stopped____________ days before surgery?,2 to 3 days,4 to 5 days,6 to 7 days,8 to 9 days,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 4 to 5 days Warfarin may increase peri- operative bleeding, except for minor procedures such as cataract surgery without bulbar blocks. No consensus exists on the optimal perioperative management of patients receiving warfarin. The usual recommendation is to withhold warfarin staing 4 to 5 days preoperatively (if the INR is between 2.0 and 3.0) to allow the INR to decrease to less than 1.5, which is a level considered safe for surgical procedures and neuraxial blockade. If the INR is greater than 3.0, it is usually necessary to withhold warfarin longer than 4 to 5 days. If the INR is measured the day before the surgical procedure and remains higher than 1.8, a small dose of vitamin K (1 to 5 mg administrated orally or subcutaneously) can reverse anticoagulation.

Capnography is useful for:,determining Vaporizer malfunction or contamination,determining circuit hypoxia,determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tube.,detetcing concentration of oxygen in the anesthetic circuit,"Ans. C. Determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tube. (Ref. Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th/pg. 670-671)Clinical Anesthesia by Paul 5th Edition/pg. 671..........""Capnography is an essential element in determining the appropriate placement of endotracheal tubes. The presence of a stable ETCO2 for three successive breaths indicates that the tube is not in the esophagus. A continuous, stable CO2 waveform ensures the presence of alveolar ventilation but does not necessarily indicate that the endotracheal tube is properly positioned in the trachea. For example, the tip of the tube could be located in a main-stem bronchus. Capnography is also a monitor of potential changes in perfusion or dead space, is a very sensitive indicator of anesthetic circuit disconnects and gas circuit leaks, and is a method to detect the quality of CO2 absorption"".Endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway insertion requires qualitative identification of carbon dioxide in the expired gas. During general anesthesia, capnography and end-tidal carbon dioxide analysis are encouraged. Capnometry is the measurement and numeric representation of the C02 concentration during inspiration and expiration. A capnogram is a continuous concentration-time display of the C02 concentration sampled at a patient's airway during ventilation.Capnography# is the continuous monitoring of a patient's capnogram.# The capnogram is divided into four distinct phases (Fi. The first phase (A-B) represents the initial stage of expiration. Gas sampled during this phase occupies the anatomic dead space and is normally devoid of CO2. At point B, CO2- containing gas presents itself at the sampling site, and a sharp upstroke (B-C) is seen in the capnogram. The slope of this upstroke is determined by the evenness of ventilation and alveolar emptying. Phase C-D represents the alveolar or expiratory plateau. At this phase of the capnogram, alveolar gas is being sampled. Normally, this part of the waveform is almost horizontal. Point D is the highest CO2 value and is called the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2). ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 (PACO2). As the patient begins to inspire, fresh gas is entrained and there is a steep downstroke (D-E) back to baseline. Unless rebreathing of CO2 occurs, the baseline approaches zero.# The utility of capnography depends on an understanding of the relationship between arterial CO2 (PaCO2), alveolar CO2 (PACO2), and ETCO2. If the PaCO2-PACO2 gradient is constant and small, capnography provides a noninvasive, continuous, real-time reflection of ventilation. During general anesthesia, the ETC02-PaC02 gradient typically is 5 to 10 mm Hg.# Maldistribution is a common cause of an increased PaCO2-PACO2 gradient. Other patient factors that may influence the accuracy of ETCO2 monitoring by widening the PaCO2-ETCO2 gradient include shallow tidal breaths, prolongation of the expiratory phase of ventilation, or uneven alveolar emptying.# Increases in ETCO2 can be expected when CO2 production exceeds ventilation, such as in hyperthermia or when an exogenous source of CO2 is present# A sudden drop in ETCO2 to near zero followed by the absence of a CO2 waveform is a potentially life-threatening problem that could indicate malposition of an endotracheal tube into the pharynx or esophagus, sudden severe hypotension, pulmonary embolism, a cardiac arrest, or an artifact resulting from disruption of sampling lines. During life-saving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the generation of adequate perfusion can be assessed by the restoration of the CO2 waveform.# Whereas abrupt decreases in the ETCO2 are often associated with an altered cardiopulmonary status (e.g., embolism or hypoperfusion), gradual reductions in ETCO2 more often reflect decreases in PaCO2 that occur after increases in minute ventilation where ventilation overmatches CO2 production.# Several methods for the quantification of CO2 have been applied to patient monitoring systems. One of the most commonly used methods is based on infrared absorption spectrophotometry (IRAS).Additional Educational points:# ETCO2 is the best reflection of the alveolar CO2 tension.# Increase in ETCO2 is the most sensitive early sign of malignant hyperthermia.6Most Sensitsive|||||Transesophageal echocardiographyPrecordial DopplerPulmonary artery catheter (| PAP)Capnography (|ETCO2)Mass spectrometry (| ETN2 most specific and quantitative)Least SensitivePAP= pulmonary artery pressure; ETCO2= end-tidal carbon dioxide; ETN2=end-tidal nitrogen.",C

In spinal anaesthesia the needle pierced upto,Subdural space,Extradural space,Epidural space,Subrachnoid space,"Ans. d (Subarachnoid space). (Ref. Harrisons, Medicine, 18th/735)SPINAL ANESTHESIA# The term ""spinal anesthesia"" was coined in 1885 by Leonard Corning.Technique of spinal anesthesia:# In spinal anaesthesia the spinal needle is pierced upto subarachnoid space where the anaesthetic agent is injected to produce the anaesthesia.# The selected level should be below LI in an adult and L3 in a child to avoid needle trauma to the spinal cord. As an anatomic landmark, the L3-L4 interspace is located at the line intersecting the top of the iliac crests. Either a midline or paramedian approach can be used.# The anatomic layers passed through include skin, subcutaneous structures, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, dura mater, and arachnoid membrane.# Once the needle tip is believed to be in the subarachnoid space, the stylet is removed to see if CSF appears at the needle hub. With small diameter needles (26 to 29 gauge) this generally requires 5 to 10 seconds, but may require >1 minute in some patients. Gentle aspiration may speed the appearance of CSF. If CSF does not appear, the needle orifice may be obstructed by a nerve root and rotating the needle 90 degrees may result in CSF flow. Alternatively, the needle orifice may not be completely in the subarachnoid space and advancing an additional 1 to 2 mm may result in brisk CSF flow. This is particularly true of pencil-point needles, which have their orifice on the side of the needle shaft proximal to the needle tip.# Finally, failure to obtain CSF suggests that the needle orifice is not in the subarachnoid space and the needle should be reinserted.# Common complications include hypotension, bradycardia, increased sensitivity to sedative medications, nausea and vomiting (possibly secondary to hypotension), postdural puncture headache, nerve injury, total spinal, and hematoma/abscess formation at the site of puncture.# Total spinal anesthesia results from local anesthetic depression of the cervical spinal cord and brain stem. Signs and symptoms include dysphonia, dyspnea, upper extremity weakness, loss of consciousness, pupillary dilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Eaily recognition is the key to management. Treatment includes securing the airway, mechanical ventilation, volume infusion, and pressor support.# Absolute contraindications include local infection at the puncture site, bacteremia, severe hypovolemia, coagulopathy, severe stenotic valvular disease, infection at the site of the procedure, and intracranial hypertension. Relative contraindications include progressive degenerative (demyelinating) neurologic disease (multiple sclerosis), low back pain, and sepsis.# Intrathecal opioids:- Opioids produce intense visceral analgesia and may prolong sensory blockade without affecting motor or sympathetic function.- Fentanyl and sufentanil have a rapid onset of action and an effective duration greater than 6 hours.- Morphine lasts 6-24 hours.- Side effects include respiratory depression (which may occur late with hydrophilic agents), nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention.",D

Percentage of thiopentone used for induction is,0.50%,1.50%,2.50%,4.50%,"The usual concentration of thiopental is 2.5%. The usual doses of thiopental (3 to 4 mg/kg) and thiamylal (3 to 4 mg/kg) are approximately twice the dose of methohexital (1 to 2 mg/kg). In dose-response studies, the ED50 for thiopental ranged from 2.2 to 2.7 mg/kg, and the ED50 for methohexital was 1.1 mg/kg. Less interpatient variability is seen in the dose-response to barbiturates than to benzodiazepines when used for anesthesia induction, but significant variability remains in the dose of thiopental required to induce anesthesia. Interpatient dose variability is related to the presence of hemorrhagic shock, cardiac output, lean body mass, obesity, gender, and age. Hemorrhagic shock, lean body mass, age, and obesity explain the variability of patients' responses resulting from a decrease in the central volume of distribution. Finally, patients who have severe anemia, burns, malnutrition, widespread malignant disease, uremia, ulcerative colitis, or intestinal obstruction also require smaller induction doses of barbiturates.

His CVP had been 12 to 14 but is now 6, in the face of diminished blood pressure and oliguria. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of his hypotension?",Pulmonary embolism,Hypervolemia,Positive-pressure ventilation,Gram-negative sepsis,"Determination of CVP can be helpful in the overall hemodynamic assessment of the patient. This pressure can be affected by a variety of factors, including those of cardiac, noncardiac, and aifactual origin. Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume all influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive-pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia all increase CVP. Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure. Sepsis, on the other hand, decreases CVP through both the release of vasodilatory mediators and the loss of intravascular plasma volume due to increased capillary permeability. Trends in CVP measurement are more reliable than isolated readings. CVP, along with other hemodynamic parameters, can also be useful in differentiating septic shock from other etiologies of shock; shock is inadequate tissue perfusion. Septic shock has two phases: (1) a hypodynamic phase that is characterized by hypovolemia and myocardial depression and (2) a hyperdynamic phase that follows fluid resuscitation and is characterized by a normal to increased cardiac output",D

Which one of the common side effects is seen with Fentanyl?,Chest wall rigidly,Tachycardia,Pain in abdomen,Hypeension,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

The best management is to provide mechanical ventilation, maintain anaesthesia, continue monitoring and wait for spontaneous recovery. 
If spontaneous recovery does not occur fresh frozen plasma or blood can be given which provide pseudocholinesterase. Purified preparation of pseudocholinesterase is also available. However because of the risk of associated with there infusion, blood, FFP or purified pseudocholinesterase is not recommended by some authorities.",B
Anaphylaxis occurring at the end of anaesthesia is due to:,Inhalational agents,Opioids,NSAIDs,Latex allergy,"Opioids - In Indian scenario - most common anesthetic agent causing anaphylaxis is opioids and then comes neuro muscular blockers - In world scenario - NMB's and then opioids - Most common non anesthetic drug causing anaphylaxis are antibioticsFirst, the time required to reach a substantial fraction of the ultimate steady-state concentration is very long in the context of intraoperative use. To reach a near steady state more quickly requires a bolus be administered before the infusion is commenced (or increased). Remifentanil perhaps represents a paial exception to this general rule. Also, opioid concentrations will increase for many hours after an infusion is commenced; in other words, concentrations are typically increasing even though the infusion rate may have been the same for hours! That remifentanil achieves a near steady state relatively quickly is ceainly pa of why it has emerged as a popular drug for total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA).",B
Effect of inhalational agent on neuromuscular system which is true -,They relax skeletal muscle and decreases the effect of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD),They contract skeletal muscle and potentiate the effect of NMBD,They directly relax skeletal muscle and they potentiate the action of NMBD,No effect on neuromuscular system,"Halogenated volatile anesthetics have a potentiating effect on nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The mechanism appears to be incompletely understood, but is likely a combination of: effect on central motor neurons augmentation of the NMB's affinity for the receptor site inhibition of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Clinically, the presence of inhaled anesthetics will decrease the ED50, as well as both prolong the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The degree of potentiation depends on the specific agent and concentration used. For example, desflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane. With deeper planes of anesthesia, the degree of potentiation is enhanced due to a dose-dependent inhibition of current through the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Studies attempting to quantify the magnitude of these effects have led to conflicting results due to the time factor, or duration of anesthesia. The older halogenated agents (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) may take up to 2 hours to equilibrate with muscle, so in practice the potentiating effects of these vapors might not be immediately apparent. In contrast, newer agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane equilibrate more rapidly with muscle, and the effects may be seen after as little as 30 minutes. Nitrous oxide has largely been considered as having no effect on neuromuscular blockade.",C

Venturi maskRef: Ajar Yadov, Short Textbook of Anesthesia, 1st edition. pg 37.Explanation:Oxygen delivery SystemsOxygen is given thru fixed and variable performance devices.Fixed performance devices deliver a flow of oxygen equal to or in excess of peak inspiratory flowVariable performance devices use the deadspace of the nasopharynx or face masks as a reservoir of oxygen. They cannot deliver high inspired concentrations of oxygen.The oxygen delivery systems are classified into High flow delivery & low flow delivery systemsHigh flow delivery systemsThese work on Venturi Principle which states that if a gas is passed through a narrow orifice at high pressure it creates shearing forces around the orifice which entrain room air in specific ratio.The inspiratory gas flow should be 3 - 4 times the minute volumeThese high flow system include venture mask which delivers accurate inspired oxygen (FI02) (Error is only 1-2%)Venturi Mask:These are 'Fixed performance' oxygen delivery devices, delivering accurate oxygen concentration.'Fixed performance' because the performance is not affected by changes in patient's tidal volume and respiratory rate.The venture mask are available in different colours:ColourFlow rate of O2 (Litre per min)Delivered O2(FiO2)Blue0224%White0428%Orange0631%Yellow0835%Red1040%Green1560%The maximum oxygen that can be delivered by venture mask is 60%.Low flow oxygen delivery systemsThese includeNasal cannulaSimple mask ('Mary Carterall mask)Oxygen tentsNon rebreathing maskRebreathing maskPoly maskThe advantage is that these are very cheap and can he used in wards, preoperative and postoperative rooms and these are better tolerated by patients as compared to high flow systems.The disadvantage is that the delivered oxygen (FiO2) accuracy cannot be predicted (Compared to venturi mask which delivers accurate concentration)These low flow systems are 'variable performance* devices, since their performance is affected by changes in patient's tidal volume and respiratory rate.Oxygen Mask: Very commonly used in wards.

"A 70 kg old athlete was posted for surgery, Patient was administered succinylcholine due to unavailability of vecuronium. It was administered in intermittent dosing (total 640 mg). During recovery patient was not able to respire spontaneously & move limbs. What is the explanation -",Pseudocholinesterase deficiency increasing action of syccinylcholine,Phase 2 blockade produced by succinylcholine,Undiagnosed muscular dystrophy and muscular weakness,Muscular weakness due to fasciculation produced by succinylcholine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block.Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug.(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong).Morgan's Anaesthesia 4th/e p. 112The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase II block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower.Millers Anaesthesia 6th/e p. 985After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, non depolarizing dual or phase II block occursProlonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiencyBut in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine.Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxantNormally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctionsAcetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potentialCompetitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential.On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i.e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate.At their first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarization would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so.With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinylcholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to further stimulation.Neuromuscular block with succinylcholine occurs in two sequential phasesAn initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and fasciculations.Maintained depolarization past the threshold for firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated.This is called phase I or depolarization blockIn the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized *Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restoredNonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptorsThis is known as phase II or desensitization blockThe mechanism for phase II block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected.Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drue usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 mg drug.Pseudocholinesterase deficiencySuccinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive.In certain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur.These are : -Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholineSmall proportion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine.In these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal form of the enzyme presentThe metabolism of succinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis.An important point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine.Other endogenous and exogenous causesPlasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as : -PregnancyLiver diseaseUremiaMalnutritionBurnsPlasma pheresisOral contraceptivesThese conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimportant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",B

Fluid of choice in shock is?,Albumin,Ringer lactate,Hydroxyethyl starch,Dextran,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Ringer lactate * Crystalloid solutions are first choice to resuscitate any type of shock patients.Fluid management in shockA) Hemorrhagic shock# Crystalloid solutions for intravascular volume replenishment are typically isotonic (eg, 0.9% saline or Ringer s lactate ). H2O freely travels outside the vasculature, so as little as 10% of isotonic fluid remains in the intravascular space. Both 0.9% saline and RL are equally effective;# Colloid solutions (eg, hydroxyethyl starch, albumin, dextrans) are also effective for volume replacement during major hemorrhage.

"A 72-year-old woman who is planning to undergo ventral hernia repair is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation.

Her prothrombin time (PT) is normal, but her activated paial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is elevated. An abdominal CT scan demonstrates a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Which of the following should be administered to reverse the effects of the heparin?",Thrombin,Vitamin K,Protamine sulfate,Aprotinin,"Heparin is reversed by the administration of protamine sulfate. Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a rare but potentially fatal complication of anticoagulation. Heparin is much more frequently associated with spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage than are oral agents. Advanced patient age and poor regulation of coagulation times also increase the likelihood of bleeding complications. Most cases of retroperitoneal hemorrhage present with flank pain and signs of peritoneal irritation suggestive of an acute intra-abdominal process. CT scans are most useful in confirming the diagnosis and following the course of the bleeding. Successful management is usually nonoperative and consists of the discontinuation of anticoagulants, reversal of anticoagulation, possible transfusion of clotting factors, and repletion of intravascular volume with intravenous fluids. Warfarin inhibits synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, whereas heparin potentiates antithrombin III activity. Aprotinin is a protease inhibitor that decreases the inflammatory and fibrinolytic response and is used in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to reduce bleeding complications. Lepirudin is an anticoagulant that is used in patients who develop heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Thrombin can be used topically as a hemostatic agent.",C
Fastest acting agent,Sevoflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,None,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood.

Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

apnography is used for assessment of ?,Oxygen saturation of blood,Amount of CO2 transpoed in blood,Ventilation of lung after intubation,Myocardial perfusion,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ventilation of lung after intubation Capnographv Capnography is the continuous measurement of end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), i.e., CO2 in exhaled air. Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%). Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. Uses of Capnography It is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETCO2 = 0.

A 62-year-old man is suffering from arrhythmias on the night of his triple coronary bypass. Potassium has been administered. His urine output is 20 to 30 mL/h. Serum potassium level is 6.2. Which of the following medications counteracts the effects of potassium without reducing the serum potassium level?,Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate),Sodium bicarbonate,50% dextrose,Calcium gluconate,"Calcium gluconate does not affect the serum potassium level but rather counteracts the myocardial effects of hyperkalemia. Reduction in an elevated serum potassium level, however, is impoant to avoid the cardiovascular complications that ultimately culminate in cardiac arrest. Kayexalate is a cation exchange resin that is instilled into the gastrointestinal tract and exchanges sodium for potassium ions. Its use is limited to semiacute and chronic potassium elevations. Sodium bicarbonate causes a rise in serum pH and shifts potassium intracellularly. Administration of glucose initiates glycogen synthesis and uptake of potassium. Insulin can be used in conjunction with this to aid in the shift of potassium intracellularly",D

Ketamine is contraindicated in?,Status asthmaticus,Obstetric hemorrhage,Glaucoma,Shock,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Glaucoma Contraindications of Ketamine1. CNS - Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol & etomidate which have cerebroprotective effect - Ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, Intracranial space occupying lesion and for neuro-anesthesia. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the arterial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT.2. Cardiovascular - Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant & vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and heart rate - Cardiac O2 demand is increased - Ketamine is contraindicated in aortic aneurysm, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the heart to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur. As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia.3.

Drug used in treatment of malignant hypehermia is,Dantrolene,Diazepam,Paracetamol,Phenobarbitone,"MH is a pharmacogenetic clinical syndrome that, in its classic form occurs during anesthesia with a volatile halogenated alkane such as halothane and/or the administration of the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine.The fulminant MH episode observed clinically produces rapidly increasing body temperature (by as much as 1deg C in 5 minutes) and extreme acidosis as a result of an acute loss of control of intracellular calcium levels and compensatory uncontrolled increases in skeletal muscle metabolism that may proceed to severe rhabdomyolysis. Although MH was initially associated with a moality rate of 60%, earlier diagnosis and the use of dantrolene have reduced the moality to less than 1.4%. Current cases of MH are restricted in severity because of diagnostic awareness, early detection through end-expired carbon dioxide (CO2), the use of less potent anesthetic triggers, and the administration of drugs that attenuate the progression of the fulminant episode. The incidence of fulminant MH was repoed to be 1 case per 62,000 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were not used, but the number of suspected cases was 1 case per 4500 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were administered.

The diagnosis can be made based on bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, a PaO2 /FiO2 ratio of less than 200, and pulmonary wedge pressures of less than 18 mm Hg (low filling pressures exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary edema). Three major physiologic alterations include (1) hypoxemia usually unresponsive to elevations of inspired O2 concentration; (2) decreased pulmonary compliance, as the lungs become progressively stiffer and harder to ventilate; and (3) decreased functional residual capacity. Progressive alveolar collapse occurs owing to leakage of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium and the alveolar spaces with the subsequent radiologic picture of diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally. Ventilatory abnormalities develop that result in shunt formation, decreased resting lung volume, and increased dead-space ventilation.",A

Diffusion hypoxia seen during ?,Induction of anesthesia,Reversal of anesthesia,Post operative period,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reversal of anaesthesia Second gas effect and diffusion hvpoxia In initial pa of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air.",B

After Hyperventilating for some time holding the breath is dangerous because –,Decrease CO2 shift the O2 dissociation curve to the left,Alkalosis can lead to tetany,It can lead to CO2 Narcosis,"Due to lack of stimulation by CO2, anoxia can go into dangerous levels","In our body its not O2, but CO2 that maintains the respiratory drive (though main function of respiration is to maintain adequate oxygen level in the body)
Thus its not hypoxia but hypercarbia that is required to inform the brain that respiration is inadequate.
If normally a person holds his breath he will soon have decrease O2 level (hypoxia) and increase CO2 level (hypercarbia)
Hypercarbia will stimulate the brain and increase the respiratory drive, forcing the person to take breath.

Ideal intubating position (modified chevalier Jackson position) is,Flexion of neck and extension of head,Extension neck and extension of head,Flexion of neck and neutral position of head,Extension of head and neutral position of head,"It is also called morning sniffing position or barking dog position. Explanation Prior to direct laryngoscopy and intubation, the patient is placed in the sniffing position which consists of cervical flexion with atlantooccipital extension. This is to ensure a line of sight from the mouth to the larynx so that intubation can be performed with ease. Cervical flexion of 35 degrees is provided by elevating the patient's head by 7-9 cm (folded sheet under the head). This aligns the pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. Atlantooccipital extension is provided by the head tilt. This brings into alignment the visual axis of the mouth with that of pharyngeal and laryngeal axes. Adequacy of head elevation can be estimated by checking the horizontal alignment between external auditory meatus and sternal notch.",A

Following spinal subarachnoid block a patient develops hypotension. This can be managed by the following means except –,Lowering the head end,Administration of 1000 ml of Ringers lacate before the block,Vasopressor drug like methoxamine,Use of ionotrope like dopamine,"This is the controversial one. Most of the guides have given option 'a' i.e. lowering the head end as the answer. Their logic is that, if the head end is lowered, the anesthetic drug will move up and will produce severe hypotension and bradycardia.
However, all texts books have mentioned that in the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia, head low position (Trendelenburg position) should be given to increase the venous return.

""Head low position (Trendelenburg position) to increase the venous return. Although the concern of trendelenburg position increases the chances of high spinal anesthesia, but number of studies have proven that the beneficial effects over weigh these problems and secondly head low up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15° is still the very vital part of management for the treatment of spinal hypotension"".

Preloading the patients with colloids prevent hypotension. Preloading with crystalloid does not prevent hypotension because large volumes of crystalloids quickly redistribute from intravascular to extravascular space.

""Studies of large volumes (12-30 ml/kg) of crystalloid infusion before spinal anesthesia have shown no difference in the incidence of hypotension probably because large volumes of crystalloid quickly redistribute from the intravascular to the extravascular compartment"".
—Lee 13th/e 509
""In contrast to crystalloid solutions, prophylactic volume loading with colloid solutions (500-100 ml) prior to spinal injection has consistently maintained blood pressure and volume expansion in both surgical and obstretic patients owing to a sustained increase in intravascular volume, maternal cardiac output and uteroplacental blood flow"".

Regarding thiopentone all are true except,Sodium carbonate is added to improve its solubility,Cerebro protective,Contraindicated in porphyria,Induction agent of choice in shock,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Induction agent of choice in shock Thiopentone is a short acting barbiturate used in the induction of anaesthesia.Anaesthetic barbiturates are derivatives of Barbituric acid with an oxygen or sulfur at 2 position.The three barbiturates commonly used for clinical anaesthesia are :Sodium thiopentalThiamylalMethohexitalThiopentone is supplied as powder containing the sodium salts with 6% sodium carbonate.The addition of sodium carbonate to the powder makes it water soluble.It prevents it from precipitatingThiopentone is used for the induction of anaesthesia because it has a very rapid onset of action.The typical induction dose (3-5 mg/kg) of thiopentone produces unconsciousness in 10-30 seconds with a peak effect in 1 minutes and duration of anaesthesia of 5-8 minutes.Action of this drug terminates quickly because of rapid redistribution.Thiopentone is highly lipid soluble, therefore its redistribution is very rapid and this accounts for its short duration of action.Sulphur is added to increase the lipid solubility of thiopentone.Thiopentone is given intravenously.It produces little to no pain on injection.Venoirritation can be reduced by injection into larger non hand veins and by prior intravenous injection of lidocaine.If sometimes thiopentone inadvertently enter intraarterial circulation it causes severe inflammatory and potentially necrotic reaction.Effects on systemC.N.S.Besides producing a general anaesthesia, barbiturates reduce the cerebral metabolic rate, as measured by cerebral oxygen consumption (CMR02) in a dose dependent manner.As a consequence of the decrease in (CMR02) cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure are similarly reduced.Because it markedly lowers cerebral metabolism, thiopentone has been used as a protectant against cerebral ischemia.Thiopentone also reduces intraocular pressure.Presumably in part due to their CNS depressant activity barbiturates are effective anticonvulsants.Thiopentone in particular is a proven medication in the t/t of status epilepticus.RespiratoryThiopentone is respiratory depressants.It causes dose dependent decrease in minute ventilation and tidal volume with a smaller and inconsistent decrease in respiratory rate.Thiopentone in cardiovascular system * Thiopentone produces dose dependent decrease in blood pressure.The effect is primarily due to vasodilation, particularly venodilation and to a lesser degree to direct decrease in cardiac contractility.Hypotension can be severe in patients with impaired ability to compensate for venodilation such as those with hypovolemia, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, cardiac tamponade and b adrenergic block.* Intravenous anaesthesia of choice in shock is ketamineKetamine increases blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output.These effects are mediated due to sympathomimetic activity of ketamine.Ketamine causes inhibition of both central and peripheral catecholamine reuptake.Ketamine has direct negative inotropic and vasodilatory activity but these effects usually are overwhelmed by sympathomimetic action.Adverse effectsThiopentone has no clinically significant effect on hepatic, renal or endocrine systems.Thiopentone (Barbiturates) can induce fatal attacks of porphyria in patients with acute intermittent porphyria and are contraindicated in such patients.",D

Least soluble anaesthetic agent is,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Halothane,Methoxyflurane,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood. The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

Anaesthetic agent that predisposes to maximum arrhhmias,Isoflurance,Enflurane,Halothane,Ether,"Halothane-catecholamine sensitization also promotes abnormal automaticity of dominant and latent atrial pacemakers. These effects may produce premature ventricular contractions and arrhythmias originating from the His bundle. Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

Which of the following induction agent produce cardiac stabilityaEUR',Ketamine,Etomidate,Propofol,Midazolam,"Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular system Etomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system. It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in aerial blood pressure. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol : The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in aerial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload). Propofol markedly impairs the normal aerial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload. Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental) The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, basline autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease. Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure. Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in hea rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes. However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia. congestive hea ,failure, 13 adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression. Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular system Ketamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased aerial blood pressure, hea rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work. Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary aery disease, uncontrolled hypeension, congestive hea failure and aerial aneurysms.",B

Increased risk of cardio toxicity associated with local anesthetics requires a dose reduction in all of the following except,Pregnancy,Acidosis,Pediatric,Increased cardiac output,"Life threatening cardiovascular toxicity, including left ventricular depression, atrioventricular hea block,ventricular arrhythmia is seen more in patients with deceased liver function, acidosis and in shock. The risk factors for developing LAST (Local Anesthetic systemic toxicity)can be categorized into those that are related to the injected drug, the patient, or the technique. Drug The cardiovascular collapse/CNS (CC/CNS) ratio is ""the ratio of drug dose required to cause catastrophic cardiovascular collapse to the drug dose required to produce seizures."" A low CC/CNS ratio is associated with more cardiotoxic agents, while LAs with a higher CC/CNS ratio have a greater safety margin. This is because the earlier presentation of CNS features may expedite earlier diagnosis (and thus, treatment) of LAST before cardiovascular collapse ensues. Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, for example, have higher CC/CNS ratios than racemic bupivacaine; therefore, it seems logical to preferentially use these drugs when long-acting LAs are desired. Vigilance is always required, however, as all LA drugs may cause LAST. Patient Age Patients at the extremes of age have consistently been shown to be at the greatest risk of LAST. Pregnancy Renal disease Patients with severe renal disease not only have a hyperdynamic circulation and reduced clearance of LAs, but also have an increased a1-acid glycoprotein concentration. As a result, free plasma concentrations are largely unchanged and dose reduction is often unnecessary, unless the patient is uremic with metabolic acidosis. Cardiac disease Dose reduction is unnecessary in mild-moderate hea failure where tissue perfusion is preserved, but is recommended in severe hea failure. Hepatic dysfunction",D

Local anaesthesia acts by -,Na+ channel inhibition,Ca++ channel inhibition,Mg++ channel inhibition,K- channel inhibition,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ channel Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensoiy but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted.o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases: RecoveryResting (close)-Active (open)-Inactive (open)LAs prolong the inactive state channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad > Aa, b& g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sw'eet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

Which of the following is a sign of early sepsis?",Respiratory acidosis,Decreased cardiac output,Hypoglycemia,Peripheral vasodilation,"It is impoant to identify and treat occult or early sepsis before it progresses to septic shock and the associated complications of multiple organ failure. An immunocompromised host may not manifest some of the more typical signs and symptoms of infection, such as elevated temperature and white cell count; this forces the clinician to focus on more subtle signs and symptoms. Early sepsis is a physiologically hyperdynamic, hypermetabolic state representing a surge of catecholamines, coisol, and other stress-related hormones. Changing mental status, tachypnea that leads to respiratory alkalosis, and flushed skin are often the earliest manifestations of sepsis. Intermittent hypotension requiring increased fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate urine output is characteristic of occult sepsis. Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during sepsis are typical in diabetic as well as nondiabetic patients. This relates to the gluconeogenic state of the stress response. The cardiovascular response to early sepsis is characterized by an increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased peripheral utilization of oxygen, which yields a decreased aeriovenous oxygen difference.",D

Which of the following indicates anticipated difficult bag mask ventilation,Age >30 yrs,BMI >20,Beard,None of the above,"Predicting difficulty in mask ventilation Mask ventilation is the most basic, and arguably most impoant, skill in airway management. Patients who have been identified as having DMV, or who are predicted to be difficult, are, or potentially are, at the highest risk in airway management. It is this facet of management that should influence our decision-making the most, potentially with consideration given to awake techniques. DMV can also be suggestive of difficulty in subsequent laryngoscopy. DMV occurs in up to 5% of patients, and there are several factors that are known to be predictive of this. An early study highlighted five independent factors Mnemonic OBESE to be used. Fuher study of DMV added modified Mallampati class of 3 or 4, limited jaw protrusion, and the male sex. Neck irradiation is the most significant predictor of impossible mask ventilation, defined as an inability to achieve gas exchange despite the use of adjuncts, multiple providers, and neuromuscular block, as it causes development of fibrotic non-compliant tissue affecting the airway. BMI itself is not a very useful predictor, although it can be a marker for potential oxygenation issues (due to reduced FRC) and increased aspiration risk. In predicting DA, the actual distribution of body fat should be considered, with fat deposition in the parapharyngeal tissues increasing airway collapsibility, predisposing to OSA. This is seen more in android pattern obesity with distribution of adipose tissue around the trunk, upper body, and neck. The increased fat deposits in neck tissue can fuher narrow the airway. OSA, snoring without apnoea, and increasing neck circumference, above 40 cm, are associated with DMV. The probability of DMV increases with increasing neck circumference.

During periods of starvation, electrolytes are shifted to the extracellular space to maintain adequate serum concentrations. With refeeding, insulin levels rise and electrolytes are shifted back intracellularly, resulting in potential hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia. Additionally, refeeding results in an increased cellular need for phosphorus for energy production (ATP) and glucose metabolism. Early complications of TPN also include hyperglycemia, hyperchloremic acidosis, and volume overload with resultant hea failure.

Which one of the following can provide 100 % oxygen?,Ventimask,Simple oxygen mask,Oxygen catheter,Anesthetic face mask,"Anaesthesia face mask FEATURES These facemasks have a cuff that allows for a complete seal to be achieved between the mask and the patient's face. Anesthetic facemasks can therefore be used to deliver non-invasive ventilation (NIV). In order to ventilate with an anesthetic facemask you'll need a pressurized gas source (anesthesia gas supplies)such as a cylinder or gas wall supply. If no pressurized gas source is available, a self-inflating bag will allow for positive pressure-ventilation through an anesthetic facemask. The cuff volume can typically be adjusted through a valve. A somewhat under-inflated cuff usually achieves a better seal than a fully inflated one. Most manufacturers supply these masks with a detachable hook ring, which allows for the mask to be held in place with a head strap for delivering NIV. USES Anaesthetic facemasks are generally used in two different settings/ scenarios: 1. For bag-mask ventilation (BMV) in the OR or resuscitation setting. 2.

What is the concentration of epinephrine added to local anesthetic solution-,0.736111111,"1:10,000",1 :200000,1.430555556,"Epinephrine 1:200,000 or 5 microg/ml may be added to local anesthetic solution to produce vasoconstriction. Epinephrine is used along with local anesthetics at a concentration of 5 mg/mL or 1:200,000. At this dose, epinephrine provides adequate vasoconstriction. It is added to local anesthetics to limit systemic absorption and the systemic side effects. It limits the diffusion of the drug away from the site thereby prolongs the duration of block and improves the depth of anesthesia. Epinephrine is also used to detect accidental intraaerial injection of a local anesthetic during the neuraxial block. The classic test dose combines local anesthetic and epinephrine, 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine. This epinephrine if injected intraaerially would increase the hea rate by 20% with or without the rise in blood pressure. Use of epinephrine can also enhance analgesia by acting on spinal a2 adrenergic receptors. The extent to which epinephrine prolongs the duration of anesthesia depends on the specific local anesthetic used and the site of injection. It can prolong the block caused by shoer acting agents as compared to longer acting ones. i.e. by adding epinephrine to lidocaine, the duration of the block is prolonged significantly than by the addition of epinephrine to bupivacaine.",C

"In a pregnant female, there is decreased requirement of the spinal anaesthetic agent because of all of the following except:",Exaggerated lumbar lordosis,Decreased volume of sub arachnoid space,Engorgement of epidural veins,Increased sensitivity of the nerves to anaesthetic agent,"Ans. a. Exaggerated lumbar lordosis In a pregnant female, there is decreased requirement of the spinal anaesthetic agent because of decreased volume of sub arachnoid space, engorgement of epidural veins and increased sensitivity of the nerves to anaesthetic agent (but not due to exaggerated lumbar lordosis). Spinal Anesthesia Spinal anesthesia blocks nerve roots as they course through the subarachnoid space. The spinal subarachnoid space extends from the foramen magnum to the S2 in adults and S3 in childrendeg. Injection of local anesthetic below Ll in adults and L3 in children helps avoid direct trauma to the spinal corddeg. Spinal anesthesia is also referred to a subarachnoid block or intrathecal injection Factors affecting the Level of Spinal Anesthesia Most impoant factors Other factors Baricity of anesthetic solutionQ Age Position of the patientQ CSF volumeQ During injectionQ Curvature of the spineQ Immediately after injectionQ Drug volumeQ Drug dosageQ Intra-abdominal pressureQ Site of injectionQ Needle directionQ Patient heightQ PregnancyQ CSF volume inversely correlates with level of anesthesia. Increased intra-abdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, thus decreasing CSF volume, are associated with higher blocksdeg. This would include conditions such as pregnancyQ, ascites, and large abdominal tumorsQ In these clinical situations, higher levels of anesthesia are achieved with a given dose of local anesthetic than would otherwise be expected. For spinal anesthesia on a term paurient, the dosage of anesthetic can be reduced by one-third compared with a non-pregnant patientQ. Age-related decreases in CSF volume are likely responsible for the higher than expected level, paicularly with a hypobaric technique or rapid injection. During pregnancy progesterone also increases sensitivity of nerves to local anesthetics thus decreasing the doseQ.",A

Post spinal headache lasts for ?,10 min,I hrs,10 days,1 week,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 10 days Post dural puncture headache is due to CSF leak. Typical location is bifrontal or occipital. Headache gets worsen on sitting or upright posture and is relieved by lying down position and abdominal pressure --> The hallmark of postdural puncture headache i.e., association with body position. The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days. PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure suppoing the brain, paicularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (paicularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia. Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH . Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position. If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologus blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect",C
Cardiac or central nervous system toxicity may result when standard lidocaine doses are administered to patients with circulatory failure. This may be due to the following reason –,Lidocaine concentration are initially higher in relatively well perfused tissues such as brain and heart,Histamine receptors in brain and heart gets suddenly activated in circulatroy failure,"There is a sudden out-burst of release of adreneline, noradreneline and dopamine in brain and heart",Lidocaine is converted into a toxic metabolite due to its longer stay in liver,"Lidocaine is a rapidly acting drug because of its rapid distribution to well perfused tissues such as brain and heart.
Circulatory failure is characterized by decreased cardiac output and a consequent decrease in hepatic blood flow. As a result metabolic clearance of Lidocaine in liver is diminshed and its elimination is increased. Consequently Lidocaine concentration is initially increased in these relatively well perfused tissues (brain and heart) even with usual doses and toxicity results.",A

The tube in trachea can be put nose (nasotracheal), oral cavity (orotracheal) or trachea itself (tracheostomy). - Ideally tracheostomy should be performed under GA. And technically tracheostomy with an awake local anesthetic in a patient with severe airway compromise is difficult because the ideal positioning with an extended head and supine is often not tolerated by patient, and the procedure is to be undeaken in a semi upright sitting position. Because tracheostomy is a relatively time taking procedure in comparison to intubation, it does not have much role in emergency airway managementQ. Tracheostomy is usually done when immediate 02 requirements are taken care of by rapid intubation and prolonged intubation is plannedQ (>1 to 2-3 weeks). However, if intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an emergency procedure. So option D is excluded. Orotracheal intubation using rapid sequence induction is the technique of choice for resuscitationQ. And nasotracheal intubation is preferred in awake patients. But it is impoant to understand that in case of maxillary fracture, awake intubation is not possible. Nasotrached intubation is contraindica in severe mid facial injuryQ.

Structure pierced to give caudal anaesthesia is?,Obturator foramen,Sacrococcygeal membrane,Dura mater,Lumbosacral ligament,"Caudal anesthesia is popular in pediatric anesthesia and is paicularly useful when sacral anesthetic spread is desired (e.g., perineal, anal, rectal procedures). Caudal anesthesia requires identification of the sacral hiatus. The sacrococcygeal ligament (i.e., extension of ligamentum flavum) overlies the sacral hiatus between the two sacral cornua. To facilitate locating the cornua, the posterior superior iliac spines should be located and, by using the line between them as one side of an equilateral triangle, the location of the sacral hiatus should be approximated. After the sacral hiatus is identified, the index and mid-dle fingers of the palpating hand are placed on the sacral cornua, and after local infiltration, the caudal needle (or Tuohy needle if a catheter is to be placed) is inseed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the sacrum. While the needle is advanced, a decrease in resistance to needle inseion should be appreciated as the needle enters the caudal canal.

What is the time period for perimoem cesarean section in pregnant female with cardiac arrest?,4 min,5 min,8 min,10 min,"If we are doing resuscitation of a pregnant female in cardiac arrest and no successful in return of spontaneous circulation within 4 min then we have to go for perimoem cesarean section. If attempts at maternal resuscitation fail, consider immediate cesarean section. Gestational age greater than 23 weeks is the recommended cut-off for immediate delivery. A fetus younger than 23 weeks has an extremely poor prognosis. Such instances of perimoem delivery are rare, and the chances of fetal survival are generally poor. The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest the better is the fetal survival. Delivery should be conducted in the mother's current location; transpoation to an operating room wastes valuable time. Cesarean section should be performed no later than 4 minutes after initial maternal arrest. A fetus delivered within 5 min from initiation of CPR has the best chance for survival. Deliveries occurring more than 5 min after cardiopulmonary arrest are unlikely to result in a normal ble infant. Resuscitative effos should continue during preparation for, and throughout, delivery of the fetus.

Which of the following represents the earliest clinical indication of hypermagnesemia?",Loss of deep tendon reflexes,Flaccid paralysis,Respiratory arrest,Hypotension,"The earliest clinical indication of hypermagnesemia is loss of deep tendon reflexes. States of magnesium excess are characterized by generalized neuromuscular depression. Clinically, severe hypermagnesemia is rarely seen except in those patients with advanced renal failure treated with magnesium-containing antacids. However, hypermagnesemia is produced intentionally by obstetricians who use parenteral magnesium sulfate (MgSO4 ) to treat preeclampsia. MgSO4 is administered until depression of the deep tendon reflexes is observed, a deficit that occurs with modest hypermagnesemia (over 4 mEq/L). Greater elevations of magnesium produce progressive weakness, which culminates in flaccid quadriplegia and in some cases respiratory arrest due to paralysis of the chest bellows mechanism. Hypotension may occur because of the direct aeriolar relaxing effect of magnesium. Changes in mental status occur in the late stages of the syndrome and are characterized by somnolence that progresses to coma.",A

Epidural anaesthesia is preferred over spinal anaesthesia because: September 2006,Prolonged duration of effect,Cheaper,Less incidence of intravascular injection,Less incidence of epidural hematoma,"Ans. A: Prolonged duration of effect Epidural anaesthesia, a form of regional anaesthesia involving injection of drugs through a catheter placed into the epidural space. The injection can cause both a loss of sensation (anaesthesia) and a loss of pain (analgesia), by blocking the transmission of signals through nerves in or near the spinal cord The anaesthetist may use epidural analgesia in addition to general anaesthesia. This may reduce the patient's requirement for opioid analgesics. This is suitable for a wide variety of surgery, for example gynaecological surgery (e.g. hysterectomy), ohopaedic surgery (e.g. hip replacement), general surgery (e.g. laparotomy) and vascular surgery (e.g. open aoic aneurysm repair) which are longer duration surgeries. Other features of epidural anaesthesia: Expensive compared to spinal anaesthesia More incidence of intravascular injection (epidural space has venous plexus of Batson) More incidence of epidural hematoma Level of block can be changed by increasing the dose through the catheter",A

Which of the following approach of brachial block is most suitable for catheter placement:-,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,All,"The infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks are an alternative to axillary block for anaesthetizing the elbow, forearm, and hand when positioning is compromised by limited abduction at the shoulder, for example, rheumatoid ahritis or an immobilized/traumatized arm. It is also an alternative to supraclavicular block for anaesthetizing the upper arm. The veical infraclavicular is better than the lateral approaches in this respect and has similar rates of pneumothorax but less frequent phrenic nerve paresis. The lateral approach performed with ultrasound control has a minimal risk of phrenic nerve paresis or pneumothorax and so may be a better choice in those with respiratory compromise, but provides less reliable upper arm anaesthesia. Complications are rare and less frequent than supraclavicular approaches and vary depending on the specific infraclavicular technique used. Although the axillary block provides safe and straightforward regional anaesthesia of the arm, the infraclavicular approach does offer an alternative in some specific situations and can be considered a ble routine alternative in experienced hands.

"In sepsis, management of fluid involves administration of?",Colloids,Crystalloids,Hydroxyethyl starch,None,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Crystalloids * Crystalloid solutions seem to be the most appropriate type of fluids for initial resuscitation of septic shock patients & have been recommended as a first choice to resuscitate septic shock patientsFluid resuscitation in septic shock* The landmark of septic shock is systemic vasodilation, with different levels of hypovolemia. Fluid administration is the first-line intervention to restore the systemic hemodynamics and increase oxygen delivery to match oxygen demand in septic patients.* Fluid resuscitation is initiated to achieve a CVP of 8 to 12 mmHg* According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, septic patients presenting tissue hypoperfusion, hypotension or signs of hypovolemia and admitted to the emergency department must receive an initial fluid load with 30mL/kg of body weight of crystalloids.* Crystalloid refers to solutions containing water, inorganic ions and small organic molecules. Crystalloids are composed of glucose or sodium chloride solutions, and can be hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic* They supply water and electrolytes to maintain osmotic gradient between extravascular and intravascular compartments as they contain fluids and electrolytes that are normally found in the body.* Colloids have larger molecular-weight particles that give them oncotic plasma pressures similar to natural plasma proteins. This theoretically allows for better volume resuscitation by remaining in the intravascular space and supporting circulating volume as compared to crystalloids, which may have extravascular shift causing pulmonary and interstitial edema. However, in patients with increased vascular permeability as seen in sepsis and late hemorrhagic shock, leakage of these larger colloid molecules also exist.* Hypo-oncotic albumin solutions can be used as an alternative for those who need large amounts of fluids during the initial resuscitation phase.* Hydroxyethyl starches solutions must be avoided in septic patients due to the increased risk of acute renal failure, increased need for renal replacement therapy and increased mortality.",B

In relation to Ethylene glycol poisoning,It may present with an acute ascending motor and sensory neuropathy,A normal anion gap acidosis is usually seen,Alcohol dehydrogenase catabolises the metabolism of EG into metabolites including oxalate and glycolic acid,Haemodialysis is not effective,"Ethylene Glycol poisoning presents in three phases depending on timing: initially (30-60 minutes) after ingestion acute intoxication occurs. This may also result in excitatory symptoms, cerebral oedema, convulsions and coma. The second phase occurs at 12-18 hours with predominantly cardiovascular effects including dysrhythmias and cardiac failure. Profound metabolic acidosis often causes death during this phase. Phase three occurs at 2-3 days with predominantly renal failure and acute tubular necrosis due to calcium deposition. Finally, a delayed neurologic phase can occur 5-20 days post-ingestion, presenting with neurological effects including profound limb weakness, cranial nerve palsies and sensory disturbance. EG causes an increased anion gap acidosis. Other causes of a raised anion gap acidosis include lactate, toxins (ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paraldehyde, aspirin, cyanide, iron, isoniazid), and ketoacidosis (diabetes, alcohol). Causes of a normal anion gap acidosis include gastrointestinal losses (diarrhea), renal loss of bicarbonate (proximal renal tubular acidosis), renal failure and hyperchloraemic acidosis. Renal replacement therapy is a very effective treatment for EG poisoning, as it corrects acid-base status and eliminates EG and some of the harmful metabolites. Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase preventing the production of toxic metabolites of EG. It is given as a loading dose 15mg/kg and then 10mg/kg every 12 hours for the next 48 hours. After which, the dose is increased to 15mg/kg 12hourly.

Itdoes nothave aCarbon dioxide absorberunlike the circle breathing systems. Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases. The reservoir bag as the name suggests, serves as a reservoir of anesthetic gases and to generate positive pressure ventilation. scheimmblebush mask is mask used for delivering ether",B

"All of the following are cardiac effects of succinylcholine when administered in a 12 year old child, EXCEPT:",Stimulates nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction,Second dose will cause profound tachycardia,Stimulates all ACh receptors,Higher doses increase hea rate and contractility of the hea,"Children are paicularly susceptible to profound bradycardia following administration of succinylcholine. Bradycardia will sometimes occur in adults when a second bolus of succinylcholine is administered approximately 3-8 min after the first dose. The dogma is that the succinylcholine metabolite, succinylmonocholine, sensitizes muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node to the second dose of succinylcholine, resulting in bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is normally given prophylactically to children prior to the first and subsequent doses, and usually before a second dose of succinylcholine is given to adults. Succinylcholine not only stimulates nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, it stimulates all ACh receptors. Low doses of succinylcholine can produce negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, but higher doses usually increase hea rate and contractility and elevate circulating catecholamine levels.

High airway resistance is seen in,Respiratory bronchiole,Intermediate bronchiole,Terminal bronchiole,Main bronchus,"Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

The nerve fibers which are most sensitive to local anesthetic belong to ----- group,A,B,C,D,"Classification of peripheral nerves is impoant in determining the sequence of local anesthetic blockade. B fibers are the most sensitive. Dilation of cutaneous blood vessels is often the first sign of local anesthetic onset. C fibers and A-d are next-in sensitivity. They result in the inability to feel cool sensations such as an alcohol wipe. Next-in sensitivity are the A-g, A-b, and A-a fibers, which result in the loss of sensation, pressure, proprioception, and finally motor paralysis. Local anesthetic concentration must be adequate to block nerve fibers. It takes approximately twice the concentration of local anesthetic to block motor fibers as it does to block sensory fibers, and sympathetic fibers require the least. The order of blockade onset is B fibers > C fibers = A-d fibers > A-g fibers > A-b fibers > A-a fibers.

Not true about CPR?,Chest compressions at 100/min,Ratio 30:2,Chest compression > 6 inches,Breathing rate 8-10 breaths/min,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Chest compressions > 6 inches Management guidelines for CPR * The management of CPR should be done in following sequence: - A (Airway) - B (Breathing) - C (Circulation) - D (Defibrillation).* Management is divided into following parts: -A) Basic life support (Primary ABCD)# Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition of medical emergencies, activation of an emergency response system, and interventions made in response to sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, stroke and airway obstruction by a foreign body. ABCD of BLS are: -i) Airway management: - Most common cause of airway obstruction is tongue fall, i.e., tongue falling back on posterior pharyngeal wall and obstructing the airway. In BLS, this airway obstruction is managed manually: -a) Open mouth and clear airway if something is visible in oral cavity.b) Tilt the head backward (neck extension) and chin lift -> Head tilt and chin lift.c) Jaw thrust: - Mandible is pulled forward.# Note: In patient with cervical spine injury head tilt & chin lift is contraindicated and airway should be managed only by jaw thrust.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - After management of airway obstruction ventilation is provided. In BLS ventilation is provided by mouth to mouth or mouth to nose or bag and mask ventilation.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. It is done in supine position and compression over lower l/3rd of sternum is given by heel of two hands one locked over the other. The force generated during massage should be able to depress the sternum by 1 1/2 -2 inches (approximately 1/3 of chest wall diameter). The ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2(30 compressions followed by 2 breaths) irrespective of durationiv) Defibrillation: - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillatorB) Advanced life support (secondary ABCD)# Advanced airway support involves more advanced assessment and treatment.

Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred cPAP might not help much. Therefore all pretenn infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on cPAP. Prophylactic cPAY Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic cPAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. ""Hence prophylactic cPAP is not recommended at present"". Beneficial effects of cPAP Increase in. functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on cPAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates.

Treatment of choice for Eale's disease ?,Antibiotics,Coicosteroids,Antihistaminics,Surgery,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Floor 1129] Blow out fractures of orbit Blow out fractures are caused by direct trauma to the globe which causes an increase in infraorbital pressure and decompression fracture of the orbital floor (or its walls). They are usually due to blunt trauma caused by a large object such as a cricket ball, human fist etc. o Most commonly the orbital floor blows, but it can also affect the medial wall of the orbit. The most common site for a blowout fracture to occur is the posteromedial aspect of the orbital floor, medial to the infraorbital neurovascular bundle where the maxillary bone is very thin. Lamina papyracea is also thin and the medial orbital wall is also prone to fracture. Although the lamina papyracea is thinner than the maxilla, the existence of ethmoid air cells reinforce the medial wall like corrugated paper or a beehive. The orbital floor overlies the maxillary sinus without reinforcement, therefore is weaker and more blowouts tend to occur here especially in the posteromedial floor (near the infraorbital groove), where it is the weakest area. Fracture of the floor causes the orbital contents to collapse into the maxillary sinus, causing enophthalmos and entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle. Blowout fractures are divided into pure and impure. The term pure orbital blowout fracture is used to describe a fracture of the orbital floor, the medial orbital floor or both, with an intact bony orbital margin. The term impure orbital blowout fracture is used when such fractures occur in combination with a fracture of the orbital rim.",A
Inducing agent of choice in DIC,Thiopentone,Ketamine,Methohexitone,Propofol,"The cardiovascular stimulatory effects make ketamine a desirable drug for the induction of anesthesia in unstable cardiovascular patients suffering from hypovolemia, hemorrhagic shock, or cardiovascular depression in sepsis. Ketamine bronchodilation and profound analgesia allowing the use of high oxygen concentrations make ketamine an excellent choice for induction of anesthesia in patients with reactive airway disease. Patients who have sustained trauma with extensive blood loss are typical candidates for rapid-sequence anesthesia induction with ketamine. Patients with septic shock also may benefit from ketamine. The intrinsic myocardial depressant effect of ketamine may manifest in this situation if trauma or sepsis has caused depletion of catecholamine stores before the patient's arrival in the operating room. The use of ketamine in these patients does not obte the need for appropriate preoperative preparation, including restoration of intravascular blood volume.

"Among the following local anaesthetics, the one that is associated with vasoconstriction and mydriasis is :",Cocaine,Bupivacaine,Procaine,Lignocaine,"Local application of cocaine causes blockage of initiation and conduction of nerve impulses. It also blocks neuronal re uptake of nor epinephrine thus potentiating adrenergic activity. Ocular effects of cocaine includes anaesthesia, mydriasis and vasoconstriction. Mydriatic effect of cocaine depends upon presence of a functioning adrenergic innervation. Procaine causes vasodilation hence it is usually given with adrenaline. The main shocomings of procaine are: Being a vasodilator, when it is given in the absence of a vasoconstrictor agent procaine is rapidly absorbed into the circulation and hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase. Hypersensitivity to procaine is commonly encountered. Ref: Clinical Ocular Pharmacology edited by Jimmy D. page 119. Principles of Pharmacology: A Tropical Approach By D. T. Okpako page 403.",A

Who coined term anaesthesia,Moon,Holmes,Morgan,Priestly,"Oliver Wendell Holmes coined the term anesthesia. In 1846, Holmes coined the word anesthesia. In a letter to dentist William T. G. Moon, the first practitioner to publicly demonstrate the use of ether during surgery, he wrote: ""Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names--or the name--to be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called ""Anaesthesia."" This signifies insensibility--more paicularly ... to objects of touch."" Ether was used for frivolous purposes (""ether frolics""), but not as an anesthetic agent in humans until 1842, when Crawford W. Long and William E. Clark independently used it on patients for surgery and dental extraction, respectively. However, neither Long nor Clark publicized his discovery. Four years later, in Boston, on October 16, 1846, William T.G. Moon conducted the first publicized demonstration of general anesthesia for surgical operation using ether. The dramatic success of that exhibition led the operating surgeon to exclaim to a skeptical audience: ""Gentlemen, this is no humbug!"" Joseph Priestley produced nitrous oxide in 1772, and Humphry Davy first noted its analgesic propeies in 1800. Gardner Colton and Horace Wells are credited with having first used nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for dental extractions in humans in 1844.

Index of potency of general anaesthesia -,Minimum alveolar concentration,Diffusion coefficient,Dead space concentration,Alveolar blood concentration,"Minimum alveolar concentration is defined as the alveolar concentration of an inhaled anesthetic agent that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized surgical stimulus. The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely propoional to its lipid solubility (oil: gas coefficient), in most cases. This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC. Acute alcohol intoxication and chronic amphetamine use have also been found to decrease MAC. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A
Which is wrong regarding somato sensory evoked potentials (SSEP)?,Can be used intraoperatively inside OT,Can be used to monitor CNS during intracranial surgery,Can be used during spinal cord surgery to detect spinal cord damage,Is contraindicated under general anaesthesia,"Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP or SSEP) is the electrical activity of the brain that results from the stimulation of touch. SEP tests measure that activity and are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the coex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by viually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingeip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early coical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory coex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional coical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory coex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal coices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures. It is done mostly under General Anaesthesia to monitor neural pathway.",D

"A resident at the emergency depament is preparing for a lumbar puncture in a 26 years old female with suspected subarachnoid bleeding. Although she presented with altered sensorium, CT brain was found to be normal. During LP, which structure is pierced after the spinal needle crosses interspinous ligament?",Ligamentum flavum,Arachnoid membrane,Areolar tissue,Subarachnoid space,Skin | Sub cutaneous fascia | Supra/inter spinous ligament | Ligamentum flava | Dura mater | Arachnoid mater | Return of CSF,A
Vasopressor of choice in hypotension produced during sub-arachnoidblock,Ephedrine,Mephenteramine,Adrenaline,Dopamine,"A i.e. Ephedrine Most common complication of spinal anesthesia is hypotensionQ, which can be prevented by preloading with crystalloid. In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1.003 - 1.008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection,Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option.",A

Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 1988; 7(3):204-10Explanation:Bupivacaine is the most cardiotoxic of all the local anaesthetics.Associated with sudden increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine.It involves both electrical and mechanical structures within the heart.The main site of action on cardiac conduction tissue is the Vmax of phase 0 of the action potential of fast-reacting structures tlNa current).Bupivacaine, like lidocaine and the other class I antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks the sodium channels, this block being more slowly reversible.The disturbance of sodium channels throughout the heart leads to a decreased conduction speed throughout the conduction system, thus explaining possible acute conduction disturbances originating below the bundle of His.The ventricular dysarrhythmias are due to a re-entry circuit secondary to a slowing in conduction speed.The sinus bradycardias and junctional disturbances seen in toxic accidents are probably due to an inhibition of the slow current of the atrial and atrio-ventricular nodes (Isi current!.Bupivacaine, at toxic levels, has a direct effect on contractility.The negative inotropic effects seem to be due to a fall in the intracytoplasmic calcium concentration on wrhich depends the excitation- contraction couple, as well as disturbed cellular energetic events dependent on the contraction.Bupivacaine is disproportionately more cardiotoxic than its shorter-acting counterparts like ropivacaine and levobupivacaine.While all local anaesthetics can cause direct negative inotropic effects, ropivacaine and levobupivacaine are less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine.",A

"Following surgery a patient develops oliguria. You believe the oliguria is due to hypovolemia, but you seek corroborative data before increasing intravenous fluids. Which of the following values suppos the diagnosis of hypovolemia?",Urine sodium of 28 mEq/L,Urine chloride of 15 mEq/L,Fractional excretion of sodium less than 1,Urine/serum creatinine ratio of 20,"A fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is calculated as (urine sodium x serum creatinine) / (serum sodium x urinary creatinine) x 100. A FENa less than 1% suppos a prerenal etiology for the patient's oliguria. When oliguria occurs postoperatively, it is impoant to differentiate between low output caused by the physiologic response to intravascular hypovolemia and that caused by acute tubular necrosis. A FENa of less than 1% in an oliguric setting indicates aggressive sodium reclamation in the tubules. Values above this suggest a tubular injury such that Na cannot be appropriately reclaimed. In the setting of postoperative hypovolemia, all findings would reflect the kidney's effos to retain volume: the urine sodium would be below 20 mEq/L, the urine chloride would not be helpful except in the metabolically alkalotic patient, the urine osmolality would be over 500 mOsm/kg, the urine/serum creatinine ratio would be above 20, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio would be above 20.",C

Which of the following inhalational anesthetics should be avoided because of accumulation in air-filled cavities during general anesthesia?,Diethyl ether,Nitrous oxide,Halothane,Methoxyflurane,"Nitrous oxide has a low solubility compared with other inhalation anesthetics; nitrous oxide is more soluble in blood than nitrogen and is the only anesthetic gas less dense than air. As a result of these propeies, nitrous oxide may cause progressive distension of air-filled spaces during prolonged anesthesia. Since nitrous oxide diffuses into gas-filled compaments faster than nitrogen can diffuse out, its use can lead to worsened distention, which may be undesirable (eg, in an operation for intestinal obstruction).",B

Most common complication of coeliac plexus block ?,Hypotension,Parasthesias,Diarrhea,Pneumothorax,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hypotension Celiac plexus block The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L, veebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T1, by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands. A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery. Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexus block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling. Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches : - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block. Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomival surgery. Postural hypotension is the Most common complication of classic retrocrural and splanchnic nerve block, Where as most common complication of Anterocrural approach is transient diarrhoea",A

"An elderly diabetic woman with chronic steroid-dependent bronchospasm has an ileocolectomy for a perforated cecum. She is taken to the ICU intubated and is maintained on broad-spectrum antibiotics, renal dose dopamine, and a rapid steroid taper. On postoperative day 2, she develops a fever of 39.2degC (102.5degF), hypotension, lethargy, and laboratory values remarkable for hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for her deterioration?",Sepsis,Hypovolemia,Adrenal insufficiency,Acute tubular necrosis,"Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur in patients with severe stress, infection, or trauma or as a result of abrupt cessation or too rapid tapering of chronic glucocoicoid therapy, and is classically manifested as changing mental status, increased temperature, cardiovascular collapse, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. The diagnosis can be difficult to make and requires a high index of suspicion. Its clinical presentation is similar to that of sepsis; however, sepsis is generally associated with hyperglycemia and no significant change in potassium. The treatment for adrenal crisis is intravenous steroids, volume resuscitation, and other suppoive measures to treat any new or ongoing stress. Dexamethasone should be used as steroid replacement when additional testing with an adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is planned, since hydrocoisone can interfere with measurement of coisol levels. Steroid treatment can be subsequently conveed to oral medication and tapered after treatment of the adrenal crisis",C

What is the concentration of oxygen supplied by oxygen concentrator:-,90% and 96%,100%,30 and 60%,60% and 90%,"oxygen concentrator They are also known as pressure swing adsorbers. They can be considered as an alternative to a traditional supply where no reliable liquid oxygen supply is available, such as an off-shore site or a site where the safety criteria for liquid installations cannot be met. These devices can be small, designed to supply oxygen to a single patient or they can be large enough to supply oxygen for a medical gas pipeline system. The components of this system are: Duplex compressors and molecular sieves, receivers, dryers, vacuum pumps, filters, line pressure regulators, control system, oxygen performance monitoring system and back up cylinder manifold. Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of adsorbing (under pressure) other gases in the atmosphere onto the surface of an adsorbent material, known as zeolite. Because oxygen is not adsorbed by the zeolite, it is free to pass through into the storage for use. Zeolite is hydrated aluminium silicates of the alkaline eah metals in a powder or granular form. The zeolite is sealed in a vessel known as sieve bed. The sieve beds operate in pairs, one adsorbs whilst the other regenerates. Ambient air is filtered and pressurised to about 137 kPa by a compressor and then exposed to a zeolite molecular sieve column, forming a very large surface area, at a ceain pressure. The sieve selectively retains nitrogen and other unwanted components of air. These are released into the atmosphere after heating the column and applying a vacuum. The changeover between the columns is made by a time switch. The process is capable of producing oxygen concentrations of about 95%. The remainder is made up of mainly argon with a small percentage of nitrogen. During closed circuit anaesthesia, argon accumulation could occur. Therefore, to avoid this, higher fresh gas flows are required. As the process generates a great deal of heat, hence ventilation and cooling are mandatory. If the plant fails, the emergency cylinder manifold will feed into the pipeline at higher concentrations (99.5%) than the plant's operating norm of 95%. This may have an effect on down line equipment, paicularly in the critical care areas. This low-flow (2-4 L/min), low-pressure system can provide continuous oxygen to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. A typical unit operates on mains supply and can provide up to 5 L/min of oxygen at a concentration of 94%. It can be piped around the home in small wall mounted outlets .",A

What is the fresh gas flow in Mapleson A circuit:-,Equal to minute ventilation,Twice the minute ventilation,2.5 times the minute ventilation,Half the minute ventilation,"Mapleson A or the Magill circuit is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. In all mapleson circuits, rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. Out of these, Mapleson A circuit is considered the best for spontaneous ventilation because it requires a fresh gas inflow rate of only 1 times minute ventilation to prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide. In mapleson circuits D, E, and F, the amount of fresh gas flow required is 2.5 times a minute ventilation and in mapleson circuits B and C, it is much higher. But the disadvantage of mapleson circuit A is that it is not very useful in controlled ventilation because a minute ventilation as high as 20 L/minute (fresh gas flow rate should be greater than 3 times a minute ventilation) is needed to prevent rebreathing.",A

The fibrin degradation products are not elevated, but the serum fibrinogen content is depressed and the platelet count is 70,000/mL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his bleeding?",Delayed blood transfusion reaction,Autoimmune fibrinolysis,A bleeding blood vessel in the surgical field,Factor VIII deficiency,"Whenever significant bleeding is noted in the early postoperative period, the presumption should always be that it is due to an error in surgical control of blood vessels in the operative field. Hematologic disorders that are not apparent during the long operation are most unlikely to surface as problems postoperatively. Blood transfusion reactions can cause diffuse loss of clot integrity; the sudden appearance of diffuse bleeding during an operation may be the only evidence of an intraoperative transfusion reaction. In the postoperative period, transfusion reactions usually present as unexplained fever, apprehension, and headache--all symptoms difficult to interpret in the early postoperative period. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia) would almost ceainly be known by history in a 65-year-old man, but, if not, intraoperative bleeding would have been a problem earlier in this long operation. Moreover, factor VIII deficiency causes prolongation of the paial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is normal in this patient.

Which of the following local anaesthetic causes methemoglobinemia?,Procaine,Prilocaine,Etidocaine,Ropivacaine,"Prilocaine similar to that of lidocaine. The primary differences are that it causes little vasodilation and thus can be used without a vasoconstrictor, and its increased volume of distribution reduces its CNS toxicity, making it suitable for intravenous regional blocks. The drug is unique among the local anesthetics in its propensity to cause methemoglobinemia. This effect is a consequence of the metabolism of the aromatic ring to o-toluidine. Development of methemoglobinemia is dependent on the total dose administered, usually appearing after a dose of 8 mg/kg. Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K. (2011). Chapter 20. Local Anesthetics. In L.L. Brunton, B.A. Chabner, B.C. Knollmann (Eds), Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12e.",B
Muscle rigidity is caused by which anaesthetic,Halothane,Ether,Sevoflurane,Alfentanil,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

There is no change with blood pressure, hea rate, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac output. Respiratory tidal volume decreases but respiratory rate is increased. By increasing CBF and cerebral blood volume, nitrous oxide produces a mild elevation of intracranial pressure. Nitrous oxide also increases cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2). Nitrous oxide appears to decrease renal blood flow by increasing renal vascular resistance. This leads to a drop in glomerular filtration rate and urinary output. During emergence, almost all nitrous oxide is eliminated by exhalation. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.E., Mikhail M.S., Murray M.J. (2006). Chapter 7. Inhalation Anesthetics. In G.E. Morgan, Jr., M.S.

Clinical features: contracture, rigidity, and heat production from skeletal muscle resulting in severe hypehermia, accelerated muscle metabolism, metabolic acidosis, and tachycardia. Mechanism: Uncontrolled release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle is the initiating event. Although the halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e.g., halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and succinylcholine alone repoedly precipitate the response, most incidents arise from the combination of depolarizing blocking agent and anesthetic. Susceptibility to malignant hypehermia, an autosomal dominant trait Treatment: Intravenous administration of dantrolene (DANTRIUM), which blocks Ca2+release and its sequelae in skeletal muscle.

It produces effects similar to other local anaesthetics reversible inhibition of sodium ion influx in nerve fibres. Ropivacaine is less lipophilic than bupivacaine and is less likely to penetrate large myelinated motor fibres, resulting in a relatively reduced motor blockade. Thus, ropivacaine has a greater degree of motor sensory differentiation, which could be useful when motor blockade is undesirable.

Cardiac arrest developed due to local anaesthetic systemic absorption. All are management except-,Cardiac compression,Adrenaline,20 % intralipid emulsion,Vasopressin,"Vasopressin not used Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms for cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be followed should cardiac arrest occur. Chest compressions should be initiated immediately and continued until return of spontaneous circulation. If epinephrine is used, small initial doses of <=1 ug[?]kg-1 are preferred to avoid impaired pulmonary gas exchange and increased afterload. Vasopressin is not recommended for use as it has been associated with adverse outcomes in animal models. In the absence of rapid recovery following advanced life suppo measures and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy, early consideration should be given to cardiopulmonary bypass for circulatory suppo. The inotropic effect of lipid emulsion therapy only occurs once the myocardial LA levels are below a threshold that corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations. This emphasizes the impoance of effective chest compressions to ensure coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce LA tissue levels in order to obtain the benefit of lipid emulsion therapy. If cardiac output is maintained but there are deleterious CVS effects - such as arrhythmias, conduction block, progressive hypotension, and bradycardia - standard Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms should be followed with the omission of LA, such as lidocaine, for the treatment of arrhythmia.

"Sho acting anesthetic agent used for day care surgery is: September 2005, 2010",Diazepam,Ketamine,Propofol,Sevoflurane,"Ans.: C: Propofol Propofol is a sho-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent. Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and ""clear"" when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia. Due to its amnestic effects and appearance as a white liquid, propofol has been humorously dubbed ""milk of amnesia"".",C

True about the Oculocardiac reflex includes following EXCEPT:,Mediated by trigeminovagal route,Preperative glycopyrolate is not helpful for prevetion,Induced by pressure on eye ball,Mediated by traction on medial rectus,"Ans. B. Preperative glycopyrolate is not helpful for prevention. (Ref. Miller's Anesthesia 7th/Pg. 293; Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 1327).A variety of stimuli arising in or near the eye especially following traction on the medial rectus or pressure on the eye ball may cause bradycardia, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In clinical practice this oculocardiac reflex (Trigeminovagal reflex) is most often encountered during squint surgery in children. OCR is also seen during eye muscle surgery, repair of detached retina, compression of gasserian ganglion 13, enucleation of eye and by contact lens and repair of nasal fracture under General Anaesthesia. Prophylactic anti cholinergic is recommended and adequate cardiac monitoring must accompany these interventions as immediate action may be required. OCR may be manifest by bradycardia, bigeminey, ectopic beats, nodal rhythm, AV block and cardiac arrest.Oculocardiac Reflex (Trigeminovagal Reflex)# Bernard Aschner and Guiseppe Dagnini first described the oculocardiac reflex in 1 908. This reflex is triggered by pressure on the globe and by traction on the extraocular muscles, as well as on the conjunctiva or the orbital structures.# This reflex is clinically significant during strabismus surgery in children, although the manifestations of this reflex are not consistent. The oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is induced by pressure on the eyeball.# The afferent pathway follows the long and short ciliary nerves to the ciliary ganglion. From there, it travels to the gasserian ganglion body along the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The afferent pathway ends in the main trigeminal sensory nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle.# Efferent impulses start at the vasomotor center and travel through the vagal nerve (CN X) and the sympathetic chain. Bradycardia is the result of increasing parasympathetic tone. Decreasing sympathetic tone causes vasodilatation.# The cardiac effect stops when eye pressure is relieved. Patients should be monitored to recognize ECG changes. Atropine should be available to reverse life-threatening bradycardia.",B

During G.A. shivering is abolished by suppression of,Hypothalmus,Thalmus,Cerebral Coex,Medulla,"A i.e. Hypothalmus Temperature regulation during G.A. OWI Normally hypothalmus maintain core body temperatureQ (central blood temperature) within very narrow range (intehreshold range). Temperature of patient undergoing G.A. should be monitored (except for < 15 minutes procedure) by thermistor or thermocouple with a probe placed over tympanic membrane, rectum, nasopharynx, esophagus, bladder & skin. Hypothermia (ie body temperatureprotective during times of cerebral or cardiac ischemiaQ Raising body temperature induces vasodialation & sweating while hypothermia triggers vasoconstriction & shivering as compensatory mechanism. During G.A. body cannot compensate for hypothermia because anesthetics inhibit central thermoregulation by interfering with hypothalamic function.Q Spinal & epidural anesthesia also lead to hypothermia by vasodialation & internal redistribution of heat. The accompanying thermoregulatory impairment from regional anesthesia is due to an altered perception of temperature in bloacked dermatomes by hypothalmus as opposed to central effect of G.A. Postanesthetic shivering or shaking that is not related to hypehermia can be abolished by ceain opioids e.g. meperidine, butrophanol & tramadol (but not morphine).",A

Inhalation agent of choice in children -,Methoxyflurane,Sevoflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sevoflurane ""Unlike desflurane, sevoflurane poses no problem in induction, acceptability is good even by pediatric patients"". Enflurane o It is a faster acting substitute of halothane. o It is halogenated ether. o Because of its propensity to provoke seizures, it has been superseded by isoflurane. Isoflurane o It is an isomer of enflurane with similar properties but 1 1/2 times more potent. o BP falls due to vasodilation, while cardiac output is maintained - inhalation anaesthetic of choice in cardiac surgery (intravenous anaesthetic of choice for cardiac surgery is etomidate). o It does not sensitize the heart to Adr - safe in pheochromocytoma. o It does not provoke seizures preferred in neurosurgery. o Uterine and skeletal muscle relaxant action is similar to halothane - can be used for assisting version as an alternative to halothane. o It causes significant respiratory depression. o Coronary circulation is maintained - safer in patients with MI. o It can cause coronary steal phenomenon. o It can be used for day care surgery (also sevoflurane and desflurane). o It is also used to produce controlled hypotension. Desflurane o It is a newer all flourinated congener of isoflurane which has gained popularity as an anaesthetic for out patient surgery. o It is fastest acting inhalation anaesthetic with blood : gas partition cofficient 0.42. o It is highly volatile - a thermostatically heated special vaporizer is used to deliver a precise concentration of pure desflurane vapour in carrier gas (N2O + O2) mixture. o It is less potent than isoflurane, higher concentration has to be used for induction - may induce coughing, and laryngospasm because of pungent odour - unsuitable for induction. o Degree of respiratory depression, muscle relaxation, vasodilation and fall in BP, as well as maintained cardiac contractility and coronary circulation are like isoflurane. o Both isoflurane and desflurane do not provoke seizures, are not arrhythmogenic and do not have liver and kidney toxicity. Sevoflurane o It is more potent than desflurane but less potent than isoflurane. o Unlike desflurane it poses no problem in induction, acceptibility is good even by pediatric patients - inducing agent of choice in children. o Sevoflurane is degraded by contact with the CO2 absorbent (soda lime) in anesthesia machines, yielding a vinyl ether called 4 Compound A ' which can cause renal damage. -- Katzung 10th/e - 401",B

It is an ine element that does not form chemical bonds. It is an odorless, nonexplosive, naturally occurring gas with a MAC of .71 and a blood/gas coefficient of 0.115, giving it very fast onset and emergence parameters. Xenon's anesthetic effects seem to be mediated by NMDA inhibition by competing with glycine at the glycine binding site. Xenon seems to have little effect on cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal systems and has been found to be protective against neuronal ischemia.

True About ketamine,Bronchodilator,Depressed airway reflexes,Causes hypotension,Decreases ICT,"Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

Drug of choice for Bier's block ?,Bupivacaine,Etidocaine,Ropivacaine,Lidocaine,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Lidocaine Intravenous regional Anaesthesia (Bier's block) Intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) is used most often for surgery of the forearm and hand, but can also be used for distal leg and foot. First IV canula is inseed usually in the dorsum of hand. Then tourniquet cuff is applied to proximal arm. Limb is elevated and exsanguinated with the help of an elastic bandage (Esmarch). Now tourniquet cuff is inflated above systolic pressure (so that no blood can enter in that limb and the limb remains exsanguinated). Now the local anaesthetic solution is slowly injected into cannula. The veins are filled with only local anaesthetic as there is no blood -ocal anaesthetic can not be drained out from upper limb and can not enter in systemic circulation because of inflated cuff in proximal arm. The arm is anaesthetized in 6-8 minutes. Lidocaine without adrenaline is the DOC for this technique. --Goodman & Gilman llthie 381 o A few clinician prefers prilocaine over lidocaine because of its higher therapeutic index - least toxic LA.

The condition occurs in known viral infections (herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus), following injections of tetanus toxoid, in putative viral infections; and as an autobnmune disorder following a surgical procedure.""- Basic neurology By John Gilroy 3/e p594 Brachial plexus neuritis usually is characterized by the acute onset of excruciating unilateral shoulder pain, followed by flaccid paralysis of shoulder and parascapular muscles several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly.",C

All of the following effects the height of block in spinal anesthesia except,Age,Height,Sex,Weight,"Explanation The gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, among the options given. Gender can affect the block height theoretically. The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of ""normal-sized"" adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height.",C

Most commonly used approach of brachial plexus block?,Interscalene,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,"Ans. is `B' i.e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus block This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia). Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries. Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches : - 1. Interscalene approach Brachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T 1) may be spared. This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures. (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia). Complications include Horner syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections. 2. Supraclavicular approach This is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inseing the needle lateral to subclan vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is paicularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre. Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclan aery or vein, Horner syndrome, hematoma formation. 3. Infra-clavicular approach Infraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block. 4. Axillary approach Axillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes.",B

Malignant hyperthermia is caused by:,Ryanodine receptor,Nicotinic receptor,Muscarinic receptor,NMDA receptor,"Ans. (a) Ryanodine receptor* Malignant hyperthermia is a condition that is usually triggered by exposure to certain drugs used for general anesthesia, specifically the volatile anesthetic agents and the neuromuscular blocking agent succinylcholine.* Succinylcholine is depolarizing / non competitive M.R. with shortest duration of action (3-5 min) due to rapid hydrolysis by pseudo cholinesterase.* It causes dual/biphasic block. It causes hyperkalemia, increased intraocular & intragastric pressure and temperature which leads to malignant Hyperthermia.* Susceptibility to MH is often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, for which there are at least 6 genetic loci of interest, most prominently the Ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1).* DOC for malignant hyperthermia: Dantrolene",A
Inhalational anesthetic of choice in children is?,Sevoflurane,Halothane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sevoflurane * Unlike desflurane, sevoflurane poses no problem in induction, acceptability is good even in pediatric patients.* Therefore, sevoflurane is the inhalational agent of choice for induction.* Ketamine is the i/v anesthetic of choice in children.Anesthesia in Children -InductionInhalational induction* Inhalational agent with mask is the induction method of choice in children.* Sevoflurane is the inhalation agent of choice for induction. Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",A

Highly lipid-soluble agent would be associated with,Potent anaesthetic action,Potent analgesic action,Excellent muscle relaxant action,Least respiratory depression,"Minimum alveolar concentration is defined as the alveolar concentration of an inhaled anesthetic agent that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized surgical stimulus. The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely propoional to its lipid solubility (oil: gas coefficient), in most cases. This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC.

The development of a clinically significant metabolic alkalosis is secondary not only to the loss of acid or addition of alkali but also to renal responses that maintain the alkalosis (paradoxical aciduria). The normal kidney can tremendously augment its excretion of acid or alkali in response to changes in ingested load. However, in the presence of significant volume depletion and consequent excessive salt and water retention, the tubular maximum for bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. Correction of volume depletion alone is usually sufficient to correct the alkalosis, since the kidney will then excrete the excess bicarbonate. HCl infusion is usually unnecessary. Acetazolamide can be utilized to increase renal excretion of bicarbonate but should be avoided in volume-depleted individuals. Moreover, to the extent that acetazolamide causes natriuresis, it will exacerbate the volume depletion.",A

Action of scoline is potentiated by?,Nitrous oxide,Sevoflurane,Isoflurane,Halothane,"Ans. A. Nitrous oxide. (Ref. Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428; Miller 7th/pg. 867)Paul's anaesthesia 5th/pg. 427-428 ..............'The mean dose of scoline producing 95% blockade (ED95) at the adductor pollicis is 0.30 to 0.35 mg/kg with opioid- nitrous oxide anesthesia. In the absence of nitrous oxide, the ED95 is increased to 0.5 mg/kg"".DEPOLARIZING DRUGS: SUCCINYLCHOLINENeuromuscular Effects# depolarizes presynaptic, postsynaptic, and extrajunctional receptors.# Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis is manifest, some disorganized muscular activity is observed frequently (""fasciculations"") and is probably a result of depolarization of the nerve terminal produced by activation of presynaptic receptors.# In some muscles, like the masseter and to a lesser extent the adductor pollicis, a sustained increase in tension that may last for several minutes can be observed (spasm).Characteristics of Depolarizing Blockade# After injection of succinylcholine, single-twitch height is decreased. However, the response to high-frequency stimulation is sustained: minimal train-of-four and tetanic fade is observed. The block is antagonized by nondepolarizing agents so that the ED95 is increased by a factor two if a small dose of nondepolarizing drug is given before.# Succinylcholine blockade is potentiated by inhibitors of acetyl cholinesterase, such as neostigmine and edrophonium.# Phase II Block: After administration of 7 to 10 mg/kg, or 30 to 60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, train- of-four and tetanic fade become apparent. Neostigmine or edrophonium can antagonize this block, which has been termed ""nondepolarizing,"" ""dual,"" or ""Phase II block."" The onset of Phase II block coincides with tachyphylaxis, as more succinylcholine is required for the same effect.Pharmacology of Succinylcholine# Succinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase (also called pseudocholinesterase), with an elimination half-life of <1 minute in patients. Because of the rapid disappearance of succinylcholine from plasma, the maximum effect is reached quickly.# Plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced by some anticholinesterases (e.g., neostigmine) so that the duration of succinylcholine given after neostigmine, but not after edrophonium, is increased.Side Effects# Sinus bradycardia with nodal or ventricular escape beats.- Anaphylaxis# Fasciculations- Muscle Pains# increases intragastric pressure- Hyperkalemia# increases intraocular Pressure & ICP Clinical Uses# to facilitate tracheal intubation (adult dose of 1.0 mg/kg; Children are slightly more resistant to succinylcholine than adults, and doses of 1 to 2 mg/kg are required to facilitate intubation. In infants, 2 to 3 mg/kg may be required. Precurarization is not necessary in patients younger than 10 years).# ""rapid sequence induction"" ( patient with full stomach and possibility of aspiration).# Succinylcholine, at a dose of 4 mg/kg, is the only effective intramuscular neuromuscular blocking agent in children with difficult intravenous access and provides adequate intubating conditions in about 4 minutes. However, this route of administration should not be the method of choice.Additional Educational points:Sevoflurane:# Fast induction and emergence# Rapid changes in depth can be achieved.# Acceptability is good by pediatric patients (agent of choice for induction in children).# Hepatic blood flow is maintained.# Does not cause sympathetic stimulation and airway irritation even during rapid induction.# Amount of fluoride liberated is safe for kidney and liver.# Degraded by sodalime - hence not recommended for use in closed circuit.",A

"In clinical anaesthesia, which nerve is the most popular site, and commonly used for monitoring neuromuscular response during anaesthesia & in intensive care units?",Ulnar nerve,Fascial nerve,Posterior tibial nerve,Median nerve,"(A) Ulnar nerve[Miller's Anaesthesia6-1557,1559,1559f)[?]Neuromuscular function is monitored by evaluating the muscular response to Supramaximal Stimulation of a Peripheral Motor Nerve.Two types of stimulation can be used: 1. Electrical & 2. Magnetic.Electrical nerve stimulation is by far the most commonly used method in clinical practice.[?]Patterns of Nerve Stimulation:For evaluation of neuromuscular function, the most commonly used patterns of electrical nerve stimulation are Single-Twitch, TOF, Tetanic, Post-Tetanic Count (PTC), & Double-Burst Stimulation (DBS).Advantages of Train-of-Four (TOF) stimulation are greatest during nondepolarizing blockade because the degree of block can be read directly from the TOF response even though a preoperative value is lacking.TOF stimulation has some advantages over tetanic stimulation: It is less painful &, unlike tetanic stimulation, doesnot generally affect the degree of neuromuscular blockade.Sites of Nerve Stimulation & Different Muscle Responses:Any superficially located peripheral motor nerve may be stimulated.In clinical anesthesia, the ulnar nerve is the most popular site.Median, posterior tibial, common peroneal, & facial nerves are also sometimes used.For stimulation of the ulnar nerve, the electrodes are best applied to the volar side of the wrist.Distal electrode should be placed about 1 cm proximal to the point at which the proximal flexion crease of the wrist crosses the radial side of the tendon to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Proximal electrode should preferably be placed so that the distance between the centers of the two electrodes is 3 to 6 cm.Electrical stimulation normally elicits only finger flexion & thumb adductionIf one electrode is placed over the ulnar groove at the elbow, thumb adduction is often pronounced because of stimulation of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Ulnar groove placement of electrodes (sometimes preferred in small children) is used, the active negative electrode should be at the wrist to ensure maximal response.Polarity of the electrodes is less crucial, placement of the negative electrode distally normally elicits the greatest neuromuscular response.Because different muscle groups have different sensitivities to neuromuscular blocking agents, results obtained for one muscle cannot be automatically extrapolated to other muscles.Diaphragm is among the most resistant of all muscles to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.Clinical significance is that onset time is normally shorter for the diaphragm than for the adductor pollicis muscle and the diaphragm recovers from paralysis more quickly than the peripheral muscles do.Other respiratory muscles are less resistant than the diaphragm, as are the larynx & the corrugator supercilii muscles.Most sensitive are the abdominal muscles, the orbicularis oculi muscle, the peripheral muscles of the limbs, & the geniohyoid, masseter, & upper airway muscles.From a practical clinical point of view, it is worth noting that:Response of the corrugator supercilii to facial nerve stimulation reflects the extent of neuromuscular blockade of the laryngeal adductor muscles & abdominal muscles better than the response of the adductor pollicis to ulnar nerve stimulation does.Upper airway muscles seem to be more sensitive than the peripheral muscles.Although three investigations using acceleromyography have indicated small differences in the response to TOF nerve stimulation in the arm (adductor pollicis muscle) & the leg (flexor hallucis brevis muscle), these differences are probably of little clinical significance.Remember: In assessing neuromuscular function, use of a relatively sensitive muscle such as the adductor pollicis of the hand has both disadvantages & advantages.During surgery it is a disadvantage that even total elimination of the response to single-twitch & TOF stimulation does not exclude the possibility of movement of the diaphragm, such as hiccuping & coughing.",A

"All of the following cause myocardial depression, except",Halothane,Propofol,Etomidate,Ketamine,"The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. The minimal effect of etomidate on cardiovascular function sets it apa from other rapid-onset anesthetics. Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. In patients receiving etomidate during induction of anesthesia, more hypeension and tachycardia occur after etomidate compared with propofol. The myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate lacks analgesic efficacy, however, and must be combined with an opiate to prevent hemodynamic peurbations during laryngoscopy and intubation. In the setting of hemorrhagic shock, etomidate has advantages for the induction of anesthesia. In contrast to other drugs, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of etomidate were minimally altered in a pig model of hemorrhagic shock.

"After induction of anesthesia, surgeon holds medial rectus and anesthetist looks at the monitor to check?",Oculocardiac reflex,Hypertension,O2 delivery,Response to Painful stimulus,"ANSWER: (A) Oculocardiac reflexREF: Miller's Anaesthesiology 7th Ed Ch 75OCULOCARDIAC REFLEXThe oculocardiac reflex was first described by Aschner and Dagnini in 1908.Traction on the extraocular muscles or pressure on the globe causes bradycardia, atrioventricular block, ventricular ectopy, or asystole. It is especially seen with traction on the medial rectus muscle, but can occur with stimulation of any of the orbital contents, including the periosteum.The reflex is trigeminovagal. The afferent limb is from orbital contents to ciliary ganglion to ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminal near the fourth ventricle. The efferent limb is via the vagus nerve to the heart.The reflex maybe seen more often with procedures under topical anesthesia. Retrobulbar block is not uniformly effective, however, at preventing the reflex. Orbital injections can trigger the response. The response is exacerbated by hypercapnia or hypoxemia.In the event of arrhythmia, the anesthesiologist first should ask the surgeon to stop manipulations. The ventilatory status is assessed. If significant bradycardia persists or recurs, intravenous atropine is administered in 7 ug/kg increments. Rarely, severe bradycardia or asystole occurs. Although chest compressions might be required to allow the atropine to circulate, usually the heart rhythm returns to normal isnth cessation of manipulation alone. The response fatigues with repeated stimulation.Pretreatment with intravenous atropineorglycopyrrolatecanbeeffective. Pretreatment may be indicated in patients with a history of conduction block, vasovagal responses, or b-blocker therapy",A

Drug contraindicated in renal failure is,Morphine,Pethidine,Fentanyl,Alfentanil,"B i.e. Pethidine Meperidine (pethidine, demerol), a phenylpiperidine is metabolized chiefly in liver to nonmeperidine, which is eliminated by the kidney and liver. In patients or addicts who are tolerant to the depressant effects of meperidine, large doses repeated at sho interval may produce an excitatory syndrome including hallncination, tremors, muscle twitches, dilated pupils, hyperactive reflexes and convulsions. These excitatory symptoms are d/t accumulation of normeperidine, which has a half life of 15-20 hours, compared to 3 hours for meperidine. In patients with cirrhosis, the bioavailability of meperidine is --80% increased and t1/2 of both meperidine and normeperidine are prolonged. Since normeperidine is eleminated by kidney and liver, decreased renal or hepatic function predispose to neurotoxic effects of nor-meperidineQ. Meperidine is also not recommended for the treatment of chronic pain b/o concerns of metabolite toxicity. It should not be used for longer than 48 hours or in doses > 600 mg/day. Major pathway for morphine metabolism is conjugation with glucuronic acid forming morphine -6- glucuronide and morphine -3- glucuronide. Morphine-6-glucuronide is twice as potent as morphine with somewhat longer t1/2. (t1/2 of morphine is 2 hours) and pharmacological actions indistinguishable from those of morphine. With chronic morphine administration, the 6-glucuronide accounts for most of analgesia and its blood levels exceed those of morphine. Morphine-6-glucuronide is excreted by kidney, so its levels increase in renal failure, perhaps explaining morphine's potency and long action in compromised renal function. So in patients with renal failure decreased protein binding of morphine (resulting in higher plasma free drug level) and accumulation of morphine -6- glucuronide predispose them to respiratory depression. So morphine is given cautiously in low doses in renal failure. Respiratory depression is also repoed in patients with CRF receiving sufentanyl. Except for slightly decreased protein binding, the free drug volume of distribution and clearance of alfentanil appears to be unaffected by renal failure. Fentanyl, has sho half life and its metabolites are inactive. Therefore, it is a good choice in patients with renal diseaseQ. In renal disease (renal failure) remifentanil > fentanyl > alfentanil > sufentanil are safe. Whereas morphine (d/t morphine 6 glucoronide) 1/t respiratory depression is used very cautiously in low dose and meperidine (pethidine) is contraindicated d/t very long acting metabolite nor-meperidine causing neurotoxic excitatory syndrome.",B

Site of action of vecuronium is?,Cerebrum,Reticular formation,Motor neuron,Neuro-muscular junction,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Neuro-muscular junction* Vecuronium, a non-depolarizing blocker, acts on nicotinic receptors at myoneural junction.* Neuro-muscular blocker act at myoneural junction1. Competitive (Non-depolarizing) blocker: -# They compete with Achfor Nm receptors - called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers as it increases the concentration of Ach by inhibiting its degradation by cholinesterase. Therefore, Neostigmine is used for the reversal of competitive (nondepolarizing) blockers.2. Depolarizing blockers (Succinylcholine, Decamethonium)# Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - So, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonize depolarising blockers (Therefore neostigmine cannot be used for reversal).Inf act neostigmine can potentiate the block as neostigmine and other anti-cholinesterase also inhibits pseudocholinesterase which metabolizes Sch.Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases :a) Phase I block* Rapid in onset* Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate - Typical mechanism of action of depolarizing blocker.* Has classical features of depolarization block.* Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine).b) Phase II block (Dual block)* Slow in onset* Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh - Ach can not act on Nm receptors (similar to competitive blocker).* Resembles block produced by competitive blockers - Therefore, has characteristics similar to non-depolarizing (competitive) block.* Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine).# In man, normally, only phase I block is seen - typical depolarizing block.# Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose.# SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",D

Dextrose is added to the spinal anesthetic drugs to,Increase duration of action,Reduce plasma levels of local anesthetic to prevent toxicity,Increase specific gravity,Hasten onset of action,"By adding dextrose we maKe local anaesthetic hyperbaric and prevent uncontrolled ascending of local anaesthetics The local anesthetic solutions can be made hyperbaric by the addition of glucose or hypobaric by the addition of sterile water or fentanyl. A hyperbaric solution of local anesthetic is denser (heavier) than CSF, whereas a hypobaric solution is less dense (lighter) than CSF. Significance: Hyperbaric solutions tend to move to the most dependent area of the spine. With the patient in a head-down position, a hyperbaric solution spreads cephalad, and a hypobaric anesthetic solution moves caudal. A head-up position causes a hyperbaric solution to settle caudally and a hypobaric solution to ascend cephalad. An isobaric solution tends to remain at the level of injection.",C

Although MH was initially associated with a moality rate of 60%, earlier diagnosis and the use of dantrolene have reduced the moality to less than 1.4%. Current cases of MH are restricted in severity because of diagnostic awareness, early detection through end-expired carbon dioxide (CO2), the use of less potent anesthetic triggers, and the administration of drugs that attenuate the progression of the fulminant episode. The incidence of fulminant MH was repoed to be 1 case per 62,000 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were not used, but the number of suspected cases was 1 case per 4500 anesthetics administered when triggering agents were administered.

Deepen the plane of anesthesia (Ref: Yao and Artusio's Anesthesiology: Problem oriented Patient Management, 7th edition, by Fun-Sun F. Yao. Vinod Malhotra, and Manuel L. Fontes)On doing laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient developed wheezing, which should be treated by deepening of the plane of anesthesia.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2. Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment. - Yao and Artusio's AnesthesiologyIn the middle of surgery, the patient developed a severe wheezing attack. How do you manage it?First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2, Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia.The patient with asthma has an extremely sensitive tracheobronchial tree. When the level of anesthesia is too light, the patient may develop bucking, straining, or coughing as a result of the foreign body (endotracheal tube) in the trachea and then bronchospasm.First, the blood pressure is taken to ensure it is normal or high, and then anesthesia is deepened by increasing the concentration of inhalation agents, such as sevoflurane, halothane, or isoflurane. which are direct bronchodilators as well.An incremental dose of ketamine maybe a quick way of maintaining blood pressure, rapidly deepening anesthesia, achieving bronchodilation, and avoiding the problem of delivering an inhaled anesthetic to a patient with poor ventilation.At the same time, oxygenation can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration and decreasing nitrous oxide. The patient should be continuously ventilated with a volume-cycled ventilator.Second, relieve mechanical stimulation. Pass a catheter through the endotracheal tube to suction secretions and determine whether there is an obstruction, kinking of the tube, or overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff.The cuff of the endotracheal tube can be deflated, the tube moved back 1 to 2 cm, and the cuff reinflated. Occasionally, the endotracheal tube slips down and stimulates the carina of the trachea, causing severe bronchospasm during light anesthesia.Surgical stimulation, such as traction on the mesentery, intestine, or stomach, should be stopped temporarily, because it causes vagal reflex and can cause bronchospasm.Third, medical intervention is necessary if the previously mentioned treatment cannot break the bronchospasm or the anesthesia cannot be increased because of hypotension.The cornerstone of the treatment of the intraoperative bronchospasm is inhalation of B2-agonists such as albuterol, which induce further bronchodilation even in the presence of adequate inhalational anesthesia.Fourth, bring in an intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator. Anesthesia ventilators are not designed for patients with high airway resistance. An ICU ventilator can generate inspiratory pressures as high as 120 cm H2O. With low tubing compliance, little ventilation is wasted into the circuit.",D

"A 33-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room from the scene of a severe motor vehicle accident. She is combative, confused, uncooperative, and appears dusky and dyspneic. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of her airway?",Awake endotracheal intubation is indicated in patients with penetrating ocular injury.,Steroids have been shown to be of value in the treatment of aspiration of acidic gastric secretions.,The stomach may be assumed to be empty only if a history is obtained indicating no ingestion of food or liquid during the prior 8 hours.,Intubation should be performed as soon as possible (in the emergency room) if the patient is unstable,"Securing a stable airway is one of the most fundamental and impoant aspects of the management of the severely injured patient. The level of control required will vary from a simple oropharyngeal airway to tracheostomy, depending on the clinical situation. Full control of the airway should be secured in the emergency room if the patient is unstable. Endotracheal intubation will usually be the method chosen, but the physician should be prepared to do a tracheotomy if attempts at perioral or perinasal intubation are failing or are impractical because of maxillofacial injuries. The most dangerous period is just prior to and during the initial attempts to get control of the airway. Manipulation of the oronasopharynx may provoke combative behavior or vomiting in a patient already confused by drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, or cerebral trauma. The risk of aspiration is high during these initial attempts, and the physician should make no assumptions about the state of the contents of the patient's stomach. Antacids are recommended just prior to the intubation attempt, if feasible. Although steroids have been recommended in the past, they are no longer considered of value in the management of aspiration of acidic gastric juice. The best management requires prevention of the complication of aspiration. In a reasonably cooperative patient, awake intubation with topical anesthesia may help to prevent some of the risks of hypotension, arrhythmia, and aspiration associated with the induction of anesthesia. If awake intubation is inappropriate, then an alternative is rapid-sequence induction with a thiobarbiturate followed by muscle paralysis with succinylcholine. If elevated intracranial pressure is suspected, or if a penetrating eye injury exists, awake intubation is contraindicated.",D
All are false about N20 except?,Least potent,Good muscle relaxant,Lighter than air,No diffusion hypoxia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Least potent Nitrous oxide N2Q It is colourless, odourless, heavier than air, nonirritating and noninflammable gas. o It is also called laughing gas. MAC is 105% (least potent) - even pure N20 at 1 atmospheric pressure can not produce adequate anaesthesia. o It has good analgesic but poor muscle relaxant activity. It is supplied under pressure in blue coloured steel cyclinders. It has very low blood solubility --> induction is quick and smooth with rapid recovery. Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia occur with N20 only. N20 is generally used as a carrier and adjuvant to other anaesthetics --> A mixture of 70% N20 + 25 - 30% 02+ 0.2 - 2% another potent anaesthetic is employed for most of the surgical procedures. Entonox is a mixture of 50% N20 and 50% 02. It has little effect on respiration, hea and BP. It can cause bone marrow depression and vit B12 deficiency. N20 is the only anaesthetic repoed to produce hematologic toxicity and neurotoxicity with long term administration. Both toxicities are the result of the interaction of N20 with vit B12. Complete bone marrow failure can be expected after several days of continuous exposure. Bone marrow changes are preventable by pretreating patients with large doses of folinic acid. Other manifestations of vit B 12 deficiency eg. megaloblastic anemia, subacute combined degeneration of cord may also occur. Methemoglobinemia and laryngospasm may occur. It is contraindicated in patients with air cavities like pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum and volvulus --> expansion and increase in pressure occur.",A

"A 63-year-old man with multiple rib fractures and a pulmonary contusion requires prolonged intubation. He is unable to be weaned from the ventilator and is on a volume control mode. He has a tracheostomy and a percutaneous gastrotomy in place through which he is being fed. The surgeon orders a respiratory quotient (RQ), which is the ratio of the rate of carbon dioxide production over the rate of oxygen uptake. The RQ is 1. Based on this information, which of the following is the next step in his management?",Decrease the inspired concentration of oxygen,Decrease the rate on the ventilator,Increase the rate on the ventilator,Decrease the carbohydrates in his enteral feeds,"The respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio of the rate of carbon dioxide production over the rate of oxygen uptake. An RQ of 0.75 to 0.85 is ideal. The RQ is dependent on the composition of nutritional suppo. An RQ of 0.7 indicates a diet comprised largely of lipids. An RQ of 1 or greater indicates a diet comprising primarily carbohydrates, which can impair weaning from the ventilator. Decreasing the carbohydrates in the enteral feeds would facilitate the patient's ventilator wean. Changing ventilator settings by decreasing the inspired concentration of oxygen or the rate may be indicated as pa of the ventilator wean, but these will not affect the RQ.",D
A child is posted for operative repair of exostrophy of bladder with renal failure. Which anesthetic should be preferred?,Pancuronium,Vecuronium,Ataracurium,Rocuronium,"C i.e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent.

"A 72-year-old man with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and coronary aery disease presents in septic shock from emphysematous cholecystitis. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 6-L nasal cannula and his hemoglobin is 7.2 mg/dL. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%. Which of the following treatment options will improve his oxygen delivery the most?",Increase his inspired oxygen concentration,Transfer him to a hyperbaric chamber,Administer an erythropoietic agent,Transfuse two units of packed red blood cells,"Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous. Correction of the patient's anemia by the most expeditious manner, that is, transfusion of blood, is the treatment of choice.",D

Aschners reflex is seen in,Cardiac surgery,Neurosurgery,Spinal anesthesia,Squint surgery,"Aschners reflex is also called occulocardiac reflex. Aschners reflex is called oculocardiac reflex. The Oculocardiac reflex, also known as Aschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisionsof the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially seen children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia,junctional rhythm and asystole, all of which may be life-threatening, can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.",D

Injury or weakness to this muscle leads to ptosis. This muscle is supplied by occulomotor (3') nerve. Deep pa of the elevator muscle is the Muller's muscle, which is sympathetically innvervated. In hypehyroidism, sensitization of the Muller muscle leads to upper eyelid retraction and pseudoproptosis. On the other hand, in Horner's syndrome loss of this muscle action leads to ptosis.

Local anaesthetics act by-,Na channel inhibition inside gate,Na channel inhibition outside gate,K channel inhibition inside gate,K channel inhibition outside gate,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na channel inhibition inside gate o Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na+ channels from inside.Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted,o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad > Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

A 42-year-old man sustains a gunshot wound to the abdomen and is in shock. Multiple units of packed red blood cells are transfused in an effo to resuscitate him. He complains of numbness around his mouth and displays carpopedal spasm. An electrocardiogram demonstrates a prolonged QT interval. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,Intravenous bicarbonate,Intravenous potassium,Intravenous calcium,Intravenous digoxin,"Hypocalcemia is associated with physical findings including spasm of the muscles of the forearm and hand when a blood pressure cuff is inflated (Trousseau sign) and spasm of the facial muscles when the facial nerve is stimulated (Chvostek sign). Hypocalcemia is also associated with a prolonged QT interval and may be aggravated by both hypomagnesemia and alkalosis. Additionally, massive transfusion is associated with hypocalcemia secondary to chelation with citrate in banked blood. Severe, symptomatic hypocalcemia, encountered most frequently following parathyroid or thyroid surgery or in patients with acute pancreatitis, should be treated with intravenous calcium gluconate. The myocardium is very sensitive to calcium levels; therefore, calcium is considered a positive inotropic agent. Calcium increases the contractile strength of cardiac muscle as well as the velocity of shoening. In its absence, the efficiency of the myocardium decreases. Hypocalcemia often occurs with hypoproteinemia, even though the ionized serum calcium fraction remains normal.",C

Which of the following determines the speed of recovery from IV anesthetic?,Liver metabolism of drug,Protein binding of drug,Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNS,Plasma clearance of the drug,"Ans. c. Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNSAn IV anesthetic completely bypasses the process of absorption, because the drug is placed directly into the bloodstream. Highly perfused organs (vessel rich) including the brain take up disproportionately large amount of drug compared to less perfused areas (the muscle, fat, and vessel-poor groups).Drugs bound to plasma proteins are unavailable for uptake by an organ.After the highly perfused organs are saturated during initial distribution, the greater mass of the less perfused organs continue to take up drug from the bloodstream.As plasma concentration falls, some drug leaves the highly perfused organs to maintain equilibrium.This redistribution from the vessel-rich group is responsible for termination of effect of many anesthetic drugs.",C

The most common cranial nerve involved in spinal anesthesia,1,6,9,10,"cranial nerve VI is most commonly affected during spinal Anaesthesia. Dural puncture - a critical step in performing spinal anesthesia - was first introduced by Quinke in 1891, and sholy thereafter, Bier repoed the first case of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH). Bier proposed that ongoing leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) causes the headache, ie, leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site exceeds the rate of CSF production and results in low CSF pressure. Magnetic resonance imaging has confirmed that this leads to intracranial hypotension with descent of the brain, thereby causing traction of the sixth cranial nerve and pain-sensitive structures. The stretching of the nerve is thought to cause local ischemia as well as nerve dysfunction and can be seen in association with other signs of intracranial hypotension such as veigo, nausea, and vomiting.",B

"All of the following are true about depolarizing agents, EXCEPT:",Rocuronium undergoes no metabolism,Pancuronium resembles noradrenaline,Atracurium's duration of action can be markedly prolonged by hypothermia,Vecuronium effect is not altered in renal failure,"Pancuronium consists of a steroid ring on which two modified ACh molecules are positioned. It resembles ACh enough to bind (but not activate) the nicotinic ACh receptor. Rocuronium undergoes no metabolism and is eliminated primarily by the liver and slightly by the kidneys. Because of its unique metabolism, atracurium's duration of action can be markedly prolonged by hypothermia and to a lesser extent by acidosis. Vecuronium is metabolized to a small extent by the liver. It depends primarily on biliary excretion and secondarily (25%) on renal excretion. Although it is a satisfactory drug for patients with renal failure, its duration of action is somewhat prolonged. Ref: Butterwoh IV J.F., Mackey D.C., Wasnick J.D. (2013). Chapter 11.

Which does not cause malignant hypehermia,Isoflurane,Desflurane,N2O,Enflurane,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a rare (1:15,000 in pediatric patients and 1:40,000 in adult patients) genetic hypermetabolic muscle disease, the characteristic phenotypical signs and symptoms of which most commonly appear with exposure to inhaled general anesthetics or succinylcholine (triggering agents). MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

Second gas effect is,Displacement of N20 by Oxygen,Displacement of oxygen by N20,Facilitation of inhalation of Halothane by N20,Removal of oxygen by N20 from alveoli during recovery from general anaesthesia,"The increase in the paial pressures of the other gases in the alveolar mixture resulting from the rapid uptake of high concentrations of nitrous oxide during inhalational anesthesia induction is known as the second gas effect. The second gas effect is also evident in this example: the rapid uptake of N2O and reduced alveolar gas volume sustains Piso near its original inspired value and increases alveolar PO2, thereby augmenting uptake of these gases. Note also that the rapid uptake of N2O into blood results in an effective increase in minute ventilation, because more circuit gas is passively drawn into alveoli as alveolar gas is absorbed rapidly. These effects have been demonstrated in humans and animals, and theoretically, are sho-lived and peain only to the period of initial rapid transfer of N2O from alveoli to blood. The second gas effect may persist beyond the initial rapid phase of N2O uptake. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",C

Cardiac or central nervous system toxicity may result when standard lidocaine doses are administered to patients with circulatory failure. This may be due to the following reason:,Lidocaine concentration are initially higher in relatively well perfused tissues such as brain and hea,Histamine receptors in brain and hea gets suddenly activated in circulatory failure,"There is a sudden out-burst of release of adreneline, noradreneline and dopamine in brain and hea",Lidocaine is conveed into a toxic meta-bolite due to its longer stay in liver.,"A i.e. Lidocaine concentration are initially higher in relatively well perfused tissues such as brain and hea - The highly perfused organs (as Brain, Lung, Liver, Kidney, hea) are responsible for initial rapid uptake (Alpha phase) which is followed by a slower redistribution (Beta phase) to moderately perfused tissues (muscle and gut). Amide Local anaesthetics (lidocaine) are metabolzied by Microsomal enzymes in liver Decrease in hepatic function (eg cirrhosis) or blood flow (eg. congestive Hea failure) will reduce metabolic rate and predispose patients to systemic toxicityQ Toxicity of Lidocaine is due to it's own concentration in blood not due to it's toxic metabolite that is why option 4 is wrong.",A

In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory' flow rate is set at:,140-160 L/min,110-130L/min,60-100 L/min,30-50L/mm,"In volume cycled ventilation the inspiratory flow rate is usually set at 60-100 U/min to allow greater expiration time for each breath. Use of high inspiratory flow rate can minimize end inspiratory lung volume and intrinsic PEEP, but it can cause higher peak airway pressures. Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

All of the following are advantages of LMA except-,More reliable than face mask,Prevent aspiration,Alternative to Endotracheal intubation,Does not require laryngoscope & visualization,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Prevent aspiration o LMA is intermediate between the face mask and Endotracheal intubation in terms of reliability, invasiveness and facilitation of gas exchance (face mask has minimum and endotracheal intubation has maximum)o LMA does not prevent aspiration - should not be used in full stomach patients.o LMA can be used as an alternative to endotracheal intubation for minor surgeries, where anaesthetist wants to avoid intubation.o LMA is introduced blindly (without laryngoscopy)Laryngeal Mask Airwayo The LMA is a supraglottic airway. It is also referred as Brain mask as it was invented by Dr. Archies Brain. LMA provides an airway intermediate between the face mask and tracheal tube in terms of anatomic position (face mask is on the face, LMA is in the larynx around inlet and tracheal tube is in the trachea), invasiveness, security to protect airway, and facilitate gas exchange. The principle of LMA is that it provides an effective gas tight seal around the laryngeal inlet without anything having to pass through vocal cord.o LMA is very effective in maintaining a patent airway in spontaneously breathing patient. Positive pressure ventilation may be applied if necessory without tracheal intubation.o LMA is available in 8 different sizes (Lee 13th/e 206).Mask sizePatient weight & ageMaximum inflation volume1< 5 Kg, neonates & infants4 ml1[?]55 - 10 kg, Infants7 ml210 -20 kg, Infants & children10ml2.520 - 30 kg, Children14330 - 50, Children & Small adults14450 - 70 kg, Adults30570-100 kg Adult406> 100 kg, Adult o After induction of anaesthesia with propofal (which depresses laryngeal reflexes) LMA is introduced blindly (without laryngoscopy) into the hypopharynx. One of the major disadvantage of LMA is that its seal around laryngeal inlet does not always prevent aspiration. Therefore, LMA should not be used where there is an increased risk of aspiration of stomach contents, e.g., full stomach patient.Indications of LMA1. As an alternative to intubation where difficult intubation is anticipated (difficult airway).2. To facilitate endo-tracheal intubation in a patient with difficult airways.3.

Tec 6 vaporizer is used with.........,Halothane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,Trielene,"The most common such vaporizer is the Ohmeda Tec 6, designed specifically for use with desflurane. Desflurane has two physical propeies, making it unsuitable for use with a conventional vaporizer. First, it has a very high SVP (88.5 kPa at 20degC). A conventional vaporizer would require high fresh gas flows to dilute it to within clinically useful concentrations, making it uneconomical. Secondly, it has a low boiling point (23.5degC). At room temperature, it will intermittently boil resulting in large fluctuations in agent delivery. When boiling, there will be excessive agent delivery; however, it will then cool due to a large loss of latent heat of vaporization, resulting in an exponential decrease in SVP and under-delivery of agent. The Ohmeda Tec 6 overcomes these problems by using an electrical filament that heats the desflurane to 39degC, raising its SVP to 194 kPa, that is, nearly 2 atm. In addition to providing a stable SVP, this high pressure removes the need for a pressurized carrier gas--instead, the fresh or diluent gas is entirely separate from the vaporizing chamber",B
The outcome following resuscitation of a cardiac arrest is worsened if during resuscitation patient is given -,Ringer's lactate,Colloids,5% Dextrose,Whole blood transfusion,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 5% Dextrose While performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardias arrest, therapy with hyperglycemic intravenous fluid should be avoided.Therapy with intravenous glucose solutions results in worse neurological outcome.Increase in blood and thus brain glucose during global cerebral ischemia will profoundly affect outcome of the patient.In high risk patients, intravenous glucose solutions should be avoided or used judiciously and blood glucose concentrations should be maintained within the normoglycemic range until the patients have passed the period of high risk for hemodynamic compromise.Most critically ill patients do not need acute glucose supplementations.In patients who require glucose, however we recommend administering it in a manner (e.g. mini drip devices, infusion pumps) that will avoid large infusions at the time of an ischemic event.Specifically, glucose containing solutions should not be used in intravenous lines that will facilitate volume expansion and drug administrations during t/t of shock or cardiac arrest.",C

Who coined term anaesthesia ?,Moon,Holmes,Morgan,Priestly,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reversal of anaesthesia Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia In initial pa of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli --> Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) --> Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air. Remember Concentration effect and secondary gas effect during induction. Diffusion hypoxia --> during recovering. All these occur with N20 only",A
The most suitable agent for IV induction and maintenance in a day care surgery?,Etomidate,Ketamine,Propofol,Thiopentone,"Ans. c (Propofol) (Ref: Morgan's 3rd edition, p. 173,804; Lee Anaesthesia 12th edition, p. 417).Currently, propofol has superceded thiopentone as an i.v. anaesthetic, both for induction as well as maintenance. It lacks airway irritancy and is particularly suited for outpatient surgery, because residual impairment is less marked and shorter-lasting. Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting patient acceptability is very good.DAY CARE ANESTHESIAMSIAPMMivacurium(Muscle relaxant of choice)Succinylcholine(for intubation)Isoflurane & Desflurane(Inhalation agent of choice)Alfentarnil(for Amnesia)Propofol(as inducing) agent of choice)Midazolam(For relief of anxietyand sedation)PROPOFOLChemistry and Formulations# The active ingredient in propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/mL) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2.25% glycerol, and 1.2% purified egg phosphatide.Dosage and Clinical Use# The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. For short procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Propofol elicits pain on injection.Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism# Propofol's shorter duration after infusion can be explained by its very high clearance, coupled with the slow diffusion of drug from the peripheral to the central compartment. The rapid clearance of propofol explains its less severe hangover compared with barbiturates, and may allow for a more rapid discharge from the recovery room. Propofol is metabolized in the liver to less active metabolites that are renally excreted; however, its clearance exceeds hepatic blood flow, and an hepatic metabolism has been demonstrated. Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics, like those of the barbiturates, may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels.Side Effects# Nervous System. The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO:, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures.# Cardiovascular. Causes fall in blood pressure that can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure.# Respiratory and Other Side Effects. At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Although propofol does cross placental membranes, it is considered safe for use in pregnant women, and like thiopental, only transiently depresses activity in the newborn.",C

The endocrine system reacts by releasing an excessive amount of hormones, ultimately resulting in carbohydrate, protein, and fat catabolism (destruction); poor glucose use; and other harmful effects. This reaction combined with inflammatory processes can produce weight loss, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, fever, shock, and death. Unrelieved pain prolongs the stress response, adversely affecting the patient's recovery.> Cardiovascular system responds to stress of pain by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which produces a variety of unwanted effects.> In the postoperative period, these include hypercoagulation and increased heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac work load, and oxygen demand.> Aggressive pain control is required to reduce these effects and prevent thromboembolic complications.> Cardiac morbidity is the primary cause of death after anesthesia and surgery",B
Agent causing malignant hypehermia,Succinyl choline,Dantrolene,Gallamine,Ketamine,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a rare (1:15,000 in pediatric patients and 1:40,000 in adult patients) genetic hypermetabolic muscle disease, the characteristic phenotypical signs and symptoms of which most commonly appear with exposure to inhaled general anesthetics or succinylcholine (triggering agents). MH may occasionally present more than an hour after emergence from an anesthetic, and rarely may occur without exposure to known triggering agents. Most cases have been repoed in young males; almost none have been repoed in infants, and few have been repoed in the elderly. Neveheless, all ages and both sexes may be affected. The incidence of MH varies significantly from country to country and even among different geographic localities within the same country, reflecting varying gene pools. The upper Midwest appears to have the greatest incidence of MH in the United States. Anesthetic drugs that trigger MH include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, and depolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used.

Ayer's T Piece is:,Mapelson A circuit,Mapelson B circuit,Mapelson D circuit,Mapelson E circuit,"Ans. D. Mapleson E. (Ref. Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 671)The Mapleson E is a modification of Ayre's T-piece, which was developed in 1937 by Phillip Avre for use in paediatric patients undergoing cleft palate repair or intracranial surgery.ConstructionA three-way T-tube whose limbs are connected to (F) the fresh gas supply from the anaesthesia machine, (R) a length of corrugated reservoir tube and (P) the patient connector. It has minimal dead space, no valves and minimal resistance.Function:Inspiration - The patient inspires fresh gas from the reservoir tube.Expiration - The patient expires into the reservoir tube. Although fresh gas is still flowing into the system at this time, it is wasted, as it is contaminated by expired gas. An expiratory limb volume greater than the patient's tidal volume prevents entrainment of room air (which would dilute anaesthetic gases and oxygen).Expiratory pause - Fresh gas washes the expired gas out of the reservoir tube, filling it with fresh gas for the next inspiration.A fresh gas flow greater than three times the minute ventilation prevents rebreathing.Spontaneous ventilationThe fresh gas and exhaled gas flow down the expiratory limb. Peak expiratory flow occurs early in exhalation. Thus, the proportion of fresh gas added to the exhaled gases increases. During the next breath, fresh gas is drawn from the fresh gas inlet and the expiratory limb.The original analysis of the Mapleson E system suggested that a gas flow rate of 2.5 to 3 times the minute volume was required to prevent rebreathing of expired gas. However, this assumed a square-wave respiratory pattern, and investigations using a more realistic breathing pattern have suggested that 1.5-2 times the minute volume is acceptable in spontaneously breathing patients:Body weight (kg)Fresh gas flow (L/min)51.4-1.8102.4-3.2204.1-5.4407.2-9.6Controlled ventilationIn contrast to Mapleson A systems, Mapleson D and E circuits are more efficient during controlled than spontaneous ventilation. This is because the tidal volume must be supplied during the expiratory pause. With the almost sinusoidal respiratory pattern of spontaneous respiration, there is relatively little time for this volume to be supplied, so the fresh gas flow rate must be high. The pattern of controlled ventilation, however, is usually one of a rapid inspiration, expiration and a relatively prolonged expiratory pause. This long expiratory pause gives ample time for the tidal volume requirement to be supplied, even with a fairly low fresh gas flow rate. Consequently, during controlled ventilation, the recommended fresh gas flow rate is similar to that of the Mapleson A systems during spontaneous ventilation.Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be performed by intermittently occluding the end of the reservoir tube.",D

A five year old is scheduled for strabismus surgery. As the surgeon grasps medial rectus muscle anesthesiologist carefully monitors the pulse. This is for,Assessing the depth of anesthesia,Detecting Aschners reflex,Rule out ventricular dysrrhythmias,Detecting hypotension,"Aschners reflex is called oculocardiac reflex. TheOculocardiac reflex, also known asAschner phenomenon, Aschner reflex, or Aschner-Dagnini reflex, is a decrease in pulse rate associated with traction applied to extraocular muscles and/or compression of the eyeball. The reflex is mediated by nerve connections between the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal cranial nerve the ciliary ganglion, and the vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system. Nerve fibres from the maxillary and mandibular divisions of the trigeminal nerve have also been documented. These afferents synapse with the visceral motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, located in the reticular formation of the brain stem. The efferent poion is carried by the vagus nerve from the cardiovascular centerof the medulla to the hea, of which increased stimulation leads to decreased output of the sinoatrial node. This reflex is especially sensitive in neonates and children, paicularly during strabismus correction surgery.However, this reflex may also occur with adults. Bradycardia, junctional rhythm and asystole all of which may be life-threatening,can be induced through this reflex. This reflex has been seen to occur during many pan facial trauma surgeries due to stimulation of any of the three branches of trigeminal nerve.",B

Which of the following is not true about Xenon anaesthesia,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side effects,slow induction and slow recovery,Low blood gas solubility,"Xe has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

"Drug of choice for sedation of a patient in ICU is: September 2009, March 2013 (a)",Diazepam,Lorazepam,Propofol,Alprazolam,"Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.",C

Induction agent of choice in bronchial asthma,Thiopentone,Methhexitone,Ketamine,Propofol,"Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

Local anesthesia acts by blockage of -,Na+ channel,Ca++ channel],K+ channel,Mg++ channel,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ channel Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contactr without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted.o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :RecoveryResting (close)-Active (open)-Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na"" channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only wrhen the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad> Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A
"A 43-year-old trauma patient develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has difficulty oxygenating despite increased concentrations of inspired O2 . After the positive endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) is increased, the patient's oxygenation improves. What is the mechanism by which this occurs?",Decreasing dead-space ventilation,Decreasing the minute ventilation requirement,Increasing tidal volume,Increasing functional residual capacity,"PEEP improves oxygenation by increasing functional residual capacity by keeping the alveoli open at the end of expiration. Extravascular lung water is shifted from the alveolar to the interstitial space. The overall result is to increase surface area for diffusive exchange of gases. Potential negative effects of increased PEEP include alveolar overdistention resulting in barotraumas (pneumothoraces), decreased venous return and decreased cardiac output, and increased minute ventilation requirements due to increased dead-space ventilation.",D

Levo-bupivacaine is administered by which of the following route:,Nasogastric,Epidural,Intravenous,All,"B i.e. (Epidural) Bupivacaine is a potent cardiotoxic and long acting (duration of action 120-240 min) amide linked local anestheticQ. It is used for infiltration, nerve block, epidural and spinal anaesthesia of long duration. Epidural anaesthesia using bupivaine is very popular. Bupivacaine is drug of choice for labour analgesia. Bupivacaine is prone to prolong QTc interval and induce ventricular tachycardia or cardiac depression. So bupivacaine is contraindicated in IV regional anaesthesia. Maximum tolerable dose is 175 mg without epinephrine and 225mg with epinephrine. Commercial bupivacaine is a racemic mixture of 'R' & 'S' isomer. Levo bupivacine being 'S' isomer has less potential for toxicity and is as effective as racemic one. Bupivacaine is most potent & best agent for isobaric spinal anesthesia but cannot be used as surface (topical) anesthetic agent.Q Bupivacaine is contraindicated in regional IV anesthesia d/t fear of cardiac arrhythmiaQ. It can be used by following routes- IntrathecalQ - EpiduralQ - Peripheral nerve block All local anesthetics (LAs) bind & inhibit cardiac Na channels, but bupivacaine binds more avidly & longer than lignocaine. The bupivacaine R (+) isomer binds cardiac Na channels more avidly than S (-) isomer. This finding lead to development of levobupivacaine & ropivacaine. Inhibition of epinephrine - Stimulated CAMP formation by LAs could explain the refractoriness of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity to standard resuscitation measures. Programmed electrical stimulation elicit more arrythmias with bupivacaine & levobupivacaine then with lidocaine or ropivacaine. Bupivacaine is most cardiotoxic local anaesthetic, so it should not be used for Beir's block.Q It's cardiotoxicity is enhanced in pregnancy. Intravenous bupivacaine and etidocaine may cause severe cardiac reactions which are A.V. hea block Dysarythmias e.g. ventricular fibrillation. - Circulatory collapse & primary cardiac failure (bradycardia, pallor, sweating & hypotension) Amiodarone (drug of choice)Q and Bretylium is used to treat bupivacaine induced ventricular tachycardias.

"An in-hospital workup of a 78-year-old hypeensive, mildly asthmatic man who is receiving chemotherapy for colon cancer reveals symptomatic gallstones. Preoperative laboratory results are notable for a hematocrit of 24% and urinalysis with 18 to 25 WBCs and gram-negative bacteria. On call to the operating room, the patient receives intravenous penicillin. His abdomen is shaved in the operating room. An open cholecystectomy is performed and, despite a lack of indications, the common bile duct is explored. The wound is closed primarily with a Penrose drain exiting a separate stab wound. On postoperative day 3, the patient develops a wound infection. Which of the following changes in the care of this patient could have decreased the chance of a postoperative wound infection?",Increasing the length of the preoperative hospital stay to prophylactically treat the asthma with steroids,Treating the urinary infection prior to surgery,Shaving the abdomen the night prior to surgery,Continuing the prophylactic antibiotics for 3 postoperative days,"The determinants of a postoperative wound infection include factors predetermined by the status of the patient (eg, age, obesity, steroid dependence, multiple diagnoses , immunosuppression) and by the type of procedure (eg, contaminated versus clean, emergent versus elective). However, there are several factors that can be optimized by the surgeon. Decreasing the bacterial inoculum and virulence by limiting the patient's prehospital stay, clipping the operative site in the operating room, administering perioperative antibiotics (within a 24-hour period surrounding operation) with an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum, treating remote infections, avoiding breaks in technique, using closed drainage systems (if needed at all) that exit the skin away from the surgical incision, and minimizing the duration of the operation have all been shown to decrease postoperative infection. Making a wound less orable to infection requires attention to basic Halstedian principles of hemostasis, anatomic dissection, and gentle handling of tissues as well as limiting the amount of foreign body and necrotic tissue in the wound. Although they are the most difficult factors to influence, host defense mechanisms can be improved by optimizing nutritional status, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.",B

Which of the following anesthetic agents causes a rise in the Intracranial pressure,Sevoflurane,Thiopentone sodium,Lignocaine,Propofol,"Sevoflurane's solubility in blood is slightly greater than desflurane (lb/g 0.65 versus 0.42). Nonpungency and rapid increases in alveolar anesthetic concentration make sevoflurane an excellent choice for smooth and rapid inhalation inductions in pediatric and adult patients. In fact, inhalation induction with 4% to 8% sevoflurane in a 50% mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen can be achieved within 1 min. Likewise, its low blood solubility results in a rapid fall in alveolar anesthetic concentration upon discontinuation and a more rapid emergence compared with isoflurane. Similar to isoflurane and desflurane, sevoflurane causes slight increases in CBF and intracranial pressure at normocarbia, although some studies show a decrease in CBF. High concentrations of sevoflurane (>1.5 MAC) may impair the autoregulation of CBF, thus allowing a drop in CBF during hemorrhagic hypotension. This effect on CBF autoregulation seems to be less pronounced than with isoflurane. Cerebral metabolic oxygen requirements decrease, and seizure activity has not been repoed. Propofol and thiopentone are cerebroprotective as they reduce ICP and CMRO2. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Even though asphyxia is the more common cause,pediatric resuscitation stas with chest compressions rather than rescue breaths as in adultsfor simplicity in training. This is because the cycle of30 chest compressionsbefore rescue breathing delays ventilation for only15 to 20 seconds. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. The initial energy to be set for defibrillation is at 2 J/kg for both monophasic and biphasic waveforms.It can be increased to 4 J/kg if a second shock is to be delivered. In adults, the ratio is 30:2irrespective of the number of rescuers. In infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants. The compression rate should be 100-120/ minute. Allow complete chest recoil after each compression. Minimize interruptions in compressions (10 seconds or less).

Which of the following is true about hypothermia during anesthesia?,Beneficial to patients,Prevented by giving warm fluids,Body looses heat mainly by conduction,Always occur irrespective of the type of anesthesia,"Ans. b. Prevented by giving warm fluids Hypothermia during anesthesia can be prevented by giving warm fluids. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Mild hypothermia is extremely common during anesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Of these, radiation is most significant and accounts for --60% of total heat loss. Drug metabolism can be markedly decreased by hypothermia. Although hypothermia is generally regarded as deleterious, it can be beneficial in some situations. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degC to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops and those tissues that have high oxygen consumption normally, such as brain and hea, have a propoionally greater reduction of oxygen use. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. Warm fluids are probably of benefit only when large amounts are administered for fluid replacement.",B

All of the following are the indications of non invasive ventilation except,GCS <8,Conscious and cooperative patient,COPD,ARDS,"Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the administration of ventilatory suppo without using an invasive aificial airway (endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube). The use of noninvasive ventilation (see the video below) has markedly increased over the past two decades, and noninvasive ventilation has now become an integral tool in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure, in both the home setting and in the critical care unit. Noninvasive ventilation has been used as a replacement for invasive ventilation, and its flexibility also allows it to be a valuable complement in patient management. Its use in acute respiratory failure is well accepted and widespread. It is the focus of this review. The role of noninvasive ventilation in those with chronic respiratory failure is not as clear and remains to be defined. The key to the successful application of noninvasive ventilation is in recognizing its capabilities and limitations. This also requires identification of the appropriate patient for the application of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Patient selection is crucial for the successful application of noninvasive ventilation. Once patients who require immediate intubation are eliminated, a careful assessment of the patient and his or her condition determines if the patient is a candidate for noninvasive ventilation. This requires evaluation on several levels, and it may involve a trial of noninvasive ventilation. The following variables and factors help identify patients who may be candidates for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Absolute contraindications are as follows: Coma Cardiac arrest Respiratory arrest Any condition requiring immediate intubation Other contraindications (rare exceptions) are as follows: Cardiac instability - Shock and need for pressor suppo, ventricular dysrhythmias, complicated acute myocardial infarction GI bleeding - Intractable emesis and/or uncontrollable bleeding Inability to protect airway - Impaired cough or swallowing, poor clearance of secretions, depressed sensorium and lethargy Status epilepticus Potential for upper airway obstruction - Extensive head and neck tumors, any other tumor with extrinsic airway compression, angioedema or anaphylaxis causing airway compromise Other considerations that may limit application are as follows: Implementation - Staff learning curve and time requirements (nursing and respiratory therapy), potential for delay in definitive therapy (limit trials of therapy) After eliminating unsuitable candidates for noninvasive ventilation, successful application of noninvasive ventilation mandates close assessment and selection of patients and identification of conditions best suited for treatment. Not all patients with diagnoses capable of management with noninvasive ventilation (eg, Patient inclusion criteria are as follows: Patient cooperation (an essential component that excludes agitated, belligerent, or comatose patients) Dyspnea (moderate to severe, but sho of respiratory failure) Tachypnea (>24 breaths/min) Increased work of breathing (accessory muscle use, pursed-lips breathing) Hypercapnic Hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2< 200 mm Hg, best in rapidly reversible causes of hypoxemia) NIV is indicated in adults as follows: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. ""Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity"". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an ""ideal"" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",C

True statement (s) about sugammadex:,Antisuccinylcholine in action,Selectively binds to rocuronium,Used along with rocuronium for rapid induction Anesthesia,Discovered to reverse the effects of atracurium,"B. Selectively binds to rocuroniumSugammadex Morgan 5th/23lSugammadex is a novel selective relaxant-binding agentIts three-dimensional structure resembles a hollow truncated cone or doughnut with a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic exterior.Hydrophobic interactions trap the drug (e.g., rocuronium) in the cyclodextrin cavity (doughnut hole), resulting in tight formation of a water-soluble guest-host complex in a 1:1 ratio. This terminates the neuromuscular blocking action and restrains the drug in extracellular fluid where it cannot interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.It is essentially eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.It produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in a consistent manner.* Barash 6th/Chap 20Sugammadex, previously called ORG 25969, leads to restoration of normal neuromuscular function not by interfering with acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor or acetylcholinesterase, but by selectively binding to rocuronium, and to a lesser extent to vecuronium and pancuronium.Selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery""-reference.medscape.comThe compound is a cyclodextrin, made up of eight sugars arranged in a ring to make a center to accommodate the rocuronium molecule. Once bound, rocuronium is held in place by polar side chains attached to the ring.Because sugammadex does not bind to any known receptory it is devoid of major cardiovascular or other side effects.It does not bind neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not have a steroid nucleus.The benzylisoquinolines, such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium, and succinylcholine are unaffected by sugammadex.After injection of sugammadex, evidence suggests that binding of rocuronium to sugammadex in plasma leads to a marked decrease in free (unbound) rocuronium concentration, 153 leading to the establishment of a concentration gradient of rocuronium between the neuromuscular junction and plasma. This favors movement of rocuronium from neuromuscular junction to plasma, producing less neuromuscular block. Vecuronium has less affinity for sugammadex than rocuronium does, and pancuronium has less still.Sugammadex could also be used in the case of a failed intubation. If rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given, sugammadex 8 mg/kg might be effective as early as 3 minutes after rocuronium injection, and if the dose of rocuronium is doubled to 1.2 mg/ kg, one might need 16 mg/kg of sugammadex. The availability of sugammadex might make succinylcholine obsolete for intubation.",B

The major advantage of volume control ventilation:-,Constant tidal volume,Variable minute ventilation,Patient comfo more,All of the above,"Volume - controlled ventilation, where the inflation volume is preselected, and the ventilator automatically adjusts the inflation pressure to deliver the desired volume. the rate of lung inflation can be constant or decelerating. Advantages of volume control ventilation Guaranteed tidal volumes produce a more stable minute volume.The reliability of the minute volume makes this mode of ventilation more appropriate in situations where careful control of PaCO2is of impoance. Volume controlled modes were the standard of care for patients with severe traumatic brain injury where tight PaCO2 control is necessary. The minute volume remains stable over a range of changing pulmonary characteristics.If airway resistance fluctuates significantly (eg. in the course of therapy for status asthmaticus) this mode has the advantage of maintaining a reliable minute volume. The initial flow rate is lower than in pressure-controlled modes. This is an advantage if airway resistance is high; blowing more slowly into the tight bronchi does not produce a high resistance-related early pressure peak, and potentially prevents an early termination of the breath by the pressure alarm limit. Disadvantages of volume control ventilation The mean airway pressure is lower with volume control ventilation,due to the slopy shape of the pressure waveform. This can theoretically be a disadvantage in patients who have severe hypoxia; in those people one might want to use a pressure-controlled mode instead. One wa of getting around this is to use an inspiratory pause, which is discussed elsewhere (in summary, it doesn't work and possibly increases the work of breathing). Recruitment may be poorer in lung units with poor compliance.Units with a long time constant and poor compliance may remain unrecruited until very late in the inspiratory phase when pressure approaches its maximum value. These units will have little time for gas exchange before the ventilator cycles to expiration. From this, one might expect that with a volume-controlled mode the degree of atelectasis will be greater than with a pressure controlled mode, peak aiway pressures being equal. In the presence of a leak, the mean airway pressure may be unstable.The constant flow used during VCV may not be able to compensate for an intermittent leak.Consider: if the leak flow rate is equal to the inspiratory flow rate, there will be no volume delivered. Insufficient flow may give rise to patient-ventilatordyssynchrony.In the presence of increased respiratory demand during the course of a breath, the ventilator may not meet the patient's need for increased flow.",A

The main controlling agent for respiratory drive is which of the following -,CO2,Oxygen,NO,HBO3,"Central chemoreceptors are situated in the deeper pa of medulla oblongata, close to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons. This area is known as a chemosensitive area, and the neurons are called chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are in close contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Central chemoreceptors are connected with respiratory centers, paicularly the dorsal respiratory group of neurons through synapses. These chemoreceptors act slowly but effectively. Central chemoreceptors are responsible for 70% to 80% of increased ventilation through chemical regulatory mechanisms. Main stimulant for central chemoreceptors is the increased hydrogen ion concentration. However, if hydrogen ion concentration increases in the blood, it cannot stimulate the central chemoreceptors because the hydrogen ions from blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. On the other hand, if carbon dioxide increases in the blood, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the interstitial fluid of the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid. There, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. Since carbonic acid is unstable, it immediately dissociates into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. CO2 + H2O - H2CO3 - H+ + HCO3- Hydrogen ions stimulate the central chemoreceptors. From chemoreceptors, the excitatory impulses are sent to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, resulting in increased ventilation (increased rate and force of breathing). Because of this, excess carbon dioxide is washed out and respiration is brought back to normal. Lack of oxygen does not have a significant effect on the central chemoreceptors, except that it generally depresses the overall function of the brain. Ref: Sembulingam - physiology 7th edition",A

"A patient aged 28 years, was given epidural anesthesia with 15 ml of 1.5% Lignocaine with adrenaline for hernia surgery. He developed hypotension, respiratory arrest and became unconscious within 3 minutes, most probable cause will be:-",Intravascular injection of Lignocaine,Total spinal block,Anaphylaxis to lignocaine,High spinal block,"Drug must have entered subarachnoid space and resulted in total spinal anesthesia. The occurrence of a high regional block or total spinal can be potentially catastrophic and require immediate management. They may occur following spinal or epidural anaesthesia and therefore can occur outside of the operating theatre. Both are due to the inappropriately high spread of local anaesthetic affecting spinal nerves and as such are on a continuum of severity: ? High spinal/regional block: spread of local anaesthetic affecting the spinal nerves above T4. The effects are of variable severity depending upon the maximum level that is involved, but can include cardiovascular and/or respiratory compromise. ? Total spinal: intracranial spread of local anaesthetic resulting in loss of consciousness. A total spinal can also occur following epidural anaesthesia/analgesia. As the above are different severities of the same process, they may both be referred to as high regional block. Left untreated, a high regional block can progress to a total spinal. TOTAL spinal anesthesia is a complication that follows inadveent introduction of local anesthetics into the intracranial subarachnoid space. Clinical features- Hypotension, bradycardia , respiratory depression followed by neurological symptoms.

A 39-year-old man is undergoing resuscitation with blood products for an upper GI bleed. He is suspected of having a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Which of the following is appropriate in the management of this patient?,"Removal of nonessential foreign body irritants, for example, Foley catheter",Fluid restriction,0.1 M HCl infusion,Fluids and mannitol,"Hemolytic transfusion reactions lead to hypotension and oliguria. The increased hemoglobin in the plasma will be cleared the kidneys, which leads to hemoglobinuria. Placement of an indwelling Foley catheter with subsequent demonstration of oliguria and hemoglobinuria not only confirms the diagnosis of a hemolytic transfusion reaction but is useful in monitoring corrective therapy. Treatment begins with discontinuation of the transfusion, followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation to suppo the hypotensive episode and increase urine output. Inducing diuresis through aggressive fluid resuscitation and osmotic diuretics is impoant to clear the hemolyzed red cell membranes, which can otherwise collect in glomeruli and cause renal damage. Alkalinization of the urine (pH >7) helps prevent hemoglobin clumping and renal damage. Steroids do not have a role in the treatment of hemolytic transfusion reactions.",D

Stage 2 block (Phase II block) is seen with:,Suxamethonium,Isoflurane,Sevoflurane,Enflurane,"Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th edition.Explanation:Succinyl Choline - Mechanism of action1. Phase 1 block (depolarizing)Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug.Its neuromuscular effects are like those of acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction.Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units.Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, the depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block).Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization (""reprintmg"") and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results.This so-called phase 1 (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors.2. Phase II block (desensitizing)With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized.Despite this re polarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it is desensitized.The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine' s neuromuscular blocking action.Later in phase II. the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of a nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",A

It should not be used when diathermy is needed in the airways because of risk of fire or explosion. Muscle relaxants need not be used as ether itself produces excellent relaxation.* Ether liberates catecholamines and tends to maintain blood pressure.

First Local anesthetic to be used for spinal block:,Cocaine,Procaine,Prilocaine,Lignocaine,"Cocaine was the first local anesthetic to be used for regional anaesthesia. In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (1857-1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (1852-1922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Also in 1885, James Leonard Corning (1855-1923) injected cocaine between the spinous processes of the lower lumbar veebrae, first in a dog and then in a healthy man. His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of neuraxial blockade. On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (1861-1949) performed surgery under spinal anesthesia in Kiel. Following the publication of Bier's experiments in 1899, a controversy developed about whether Bier or Corning performed the first successful spinal anesthetic.",A

Percentage of hepatitis after halothane use,20%,40%,1 in 30000,1 in 3000,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",C

Which of the following is most common complication of celiac plexus block aEUR',Hypotension,Retroperiton&al hemorrhage,Pneumothorax,Intravascular injection,"Hypotension The most common complication of celiac plexus is postural hypotension which is largely due to blockade of the lumbar sympathetic chain. Celiac plexus The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 veebrae, anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It is the main junction for autonomic nerves supplying the upper abdominal organs (Liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, small bowel and 2/3 of the large bowel). The ganglia lie on each side of LI (aoa lying posteriorly, pancreas anteriorly and inferior venacava laterally). The plexus is composed of network of neve fibres from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic supply :? It contains two large ganglia that receive sympathetic fibres from three splanchnic nerves - Greater splanchnic nerves (TIT, to TIT() - Lesser splanchnic nerves (Tio/T,,) - Least splanchnic nerves (Tii/T,2) Parasympathetic supply - From the left and right vagal trunks which pass through the celiax plexus but do not connect there. Technique The block is performed using X-ray screening, intravenous sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration of the superficial layers with the patient in the prone position. Indications of celiac plexus block For releief of pain from nonpelvic intraabdominal organs. Acute pain - may be performed during surgery for postoperative pain relief. Chronic pain - useful for any condition that causes chronic severe upper abdominal visceral pain e.g. chronic pancreatitis (local anaesthetic blocks only). Cancer pain - useful for upper abdominal organ cancer pain and is frequently used for carcinoma of the pancreas Complications of coeliac plexus block:- Ohostatic hypotension :? This is the most common complication of coeliac plexus block. It is more common when retrocrural pr splanchnic technique was used. Treatment includes resting in bed, avoiding changes in position and replacing fluids. Once compensatory vascular reflexes are fully activated this side effect disappears. Backache It results from retroperitoneal hematoma which is formed due to local trauma. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage (rare) Diarrhoea (due to sympathetic block of the bowel, quite common) Abdominal aoic dissection - It occurs due to direct damage by the needle. Paraplegia and transient motor paralysis - It has occurred after celiac plexus block. Intravascular injection Bleeding due to Aoa, inferior venacava.",A

A 53-year-old woman has been intubated for several days after sustaining a right pulmonary contusion after a motor vehicle collision as well as multiple rib fractures. Which of the following is a reasonable indication to attempt extubation?,Negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -15 cm H2O,PO2 of 60 mm Hg while breathing 30% inspired FiO2 with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O,Spontaneous respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute,A rapid shallow breathing index of 80,"There are multiple predictors that have been used to assess readiness for extubation. No single parameter is 100% predictive; attempted extubation should be based on correction of the underlying pathology, clinical status and hemodynamic stability, and a combination of the following parameters. The rapid shallow breathing index is the ratio of the respiratory rate to tidal volume. There is evidence to suggest that an index between 60 and 105 predicts successful extubation. The negative inspiratory force should be at least greater than -20 cm H2O. The patient should be weaned to 5 cm H2O PEEP before attempting extubation. The minute ventilation, which is the product of the tidal volume and respiratory rate, should be less than 10 L/min. The spontaneous respiratory rate should also be below 20 breaths per minute",D
Local anaesthetic acts by inhibition of,Na channels,Mg channels,Ca channels,K channels,"The nerve resting membrane potential is little affected by local anesthetics. As the concentration of local anesthetic applied to the nerve is increased, a decrease in the rate of depolarization and in the peak amplitude of the action potential occurs until the impulse is abolished. It is not possible, however, to derive data on the binding of local anesthetics to Na+ channels from measurement of the changes in nerve impulses. By using a ""voltage-clamp"" procedure, Na+ currents and their inhibition by local anesthetics can be directly assayed. When the membrane of isolated neurons is rapidly depolarized to a constant value, the time course of ionic currents is observed. Sodium currents during one initial depolarization are reduced by subclinical doses of local anesthetic (e.g., 0.2mM lidocaine) and totally abolished by clinical doses (e.g., 1% lidocaine, [?]40mM). If the test depolarization is applied repeatedly, for example, at frequencies higher than 5Hz (five pulses per second), the paially depressed (tonically inhibited) Na+ current is fuher reduced incrementally for each pulse until a new steady-state level of inhibition is reached. This frequency-dependent inhibition, also called phasic inhibition. Local anesthetics bind in the inner vestibule of the closed Na+ channel. Amino acid mutations in the S6 segments of D-1, D-3, and D-4 all modify local anesthetic action, thus suggesting either that these regions form a pharmacophore small enough to simultaneously contact the drug at three surfaces or that the local anesthetic molecule moves rapidly among these three segments.

Least absorbed from mucous membrane are,Lidocaine,Tetracaine,Procaine,Cocaine,"Hydrophobicity is a primary determinant of intrinsic anesthetic potency because the anesthetic molecule must penetrate into the nerve membrane and bind at a paially hydrophobic site on the Na+ channel. Clinically, however, the correlation between hydrophobicity and anesthetic potency is not as precise as in an isolated nerve. Differences between in vitro and in vivo potency may be related to a number of factors, including local anesthetic charge and hydrophobicity (which influence paitioning into and transverse diffusion across biologic membranes) and vasodilator or vasoconstrictor propeies (which influence the initial rate of vascular uptake from injection sites into the central circulation).

"An eye surgery was performed using propofol as the intravenous anesthetic agent and succinylcholine as the muscle relaxant. Recovery from anesthesia was uneventful. However, after 8 hours of surgery, patient complained of pain in legs on walking. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?",Propofol,Succinylcholine,Due to surgery,Early mobilization,"Ans. b. Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191)Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain.Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine)Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3.0-5.0 with a shelf life of 2 yearsQStored at 4degCQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ.Metabolism:Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use.It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min).Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered.The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ).Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase.The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ.Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i.e. quantity)Q.Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch.Side Effects:Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent.Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermiaQManagement of Side-effects:Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose.Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion.

Longest pa of optic nerve ?,Intraocular,Intracranial,Intraorbital,Intracranial,". Ans. is 'c' i.e., Intraorbital Optic nerve Each optic nerve (second cranial nerve) stas from the optic disc and extends up to optic chiasma, where the two nerves meet. It is the backward continuation of the nerve fibre layer of the retina, which consists of the second order neurons i.e., axon originating from the ganglion cells. It also contains the afferent fibres of the papillary light reflex. Morphologically and embryologically, the optic nerve is comparable to a sensory tract. Unlike peripheral nerves it is not covered by neurilemma (so it does not regenerate when cut). The fibres of optic nerve, numbering about a million, are very fine (2-10 m in diameter as compared to 20 mm of sensory nerves). Optic nerve is about 47-50 mm in length and can be divided into 4 pas : ? Intraocular pa (1 mm) : - It begins at optic disc (optic nerve head) and exits the nerve through a hole in sclera that is occupied by a mesh like structure called the lamina cribrosa. The nerve fibres from the retina leave the eye through pores (holes) in lamina cribrosa, a sieve-like structure made up of collagen meshwork. Intraorbital pa (30 mm) : - Extends from back of the eyeball (at lamina cribrosa) to the optic foramina. Intracanalicular pa (6-9 mm) : - It lies within the optic canal and closely related to ophthalmic aery which crosses obliquely over it. Intracranial pa (10 mm) : - It lies above the cavernous sinus and converges with its fellow from contralateral side to form optic chiasma. Like other pas of CNS, the optic nerve is covered by meningeal sheaths (Pia, archnoid and dura mater) as soon as the nerve leaves the eyeball.",C

Capnography is used for assessment of -,Oxygen saturation of blood,Amount of C02 transported in blood,Ventilation of lung after intubation,Myocardial perfusion,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ventilation of lung after intubation Capnographvo Capnography is the continuous measurement of end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), i.e., CO2 in exhaled air. Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%).o Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit.Uses of CapnographyIt is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETC02 = 0.Intraoperative displacement of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will become zero.Obstruction or disconnections of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will fall.Diagnosing malignant hyperthermia - ETCO2 increases significantly (more than 100 mg Hg).",C

An alcoholic patient with history diabetic nephropathy and liver failure is posted for open abdomen surgery. The most appropriate muscle relaxant in this patient is:,Cisatracurium,Rocuronium,Vecuronium,Rapacuronium,"Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent. Like atracurium, it undergoes degradation in plasma at physiological pH and temperature by organ-independent Hofmann elimination. The resulting metabolites (a monoquaternary acrylate and laudanosine) have no neuromuscular blocking effects. Because of cisatracurium's greater potency, the amount of laudanosine produced for the same extent and duration of neuromuscular blockade is much less than with atracurium. Nonspecific esterases are not involved in the metabolism of cisatracurium. Metabolism and elimination are independent of renal or liver failure hence can be given in hepatic and renal failure.

Reynolds number is related to,Laminar flow,Ventimask,Dissolved oxygen in blood,Intraalveolar tension,"Flow through a tube can be described by the modified Bernoulli Equation, which states: Po = P + 1/2 r*U^2 Where Po is a constant called the ""stagnation pressure,"" P is pressure, r is density, U and is equal to fluid velocity. Pressure does not always decrease in the direction of flow - if one assumes friction is negligible (and thus the total energy of the system remains constant), any change in the kinetic energy of a fluid (ex. a reduction as U^2 falls) must be accompanied by an oppositional change in potential energy increases(P rises) Whether flow is laminar or turbulent is dependent on the Reynolds Number (Re), defined as: Re = rUL/u Where r is density, U is equal to fluid velocity, L is the length of the tubing, and u is the viscosity of the fluid. Note that the modified Bernoulli Equation applies to laminar flow (ReD < 2300, parabolic flow profile), but not to turbulent flow (ReD > 4000, blunted flow profile) Flowmeters based on a Venturi tube (circular tube with a gradual contraction and expansion in diameter, ex. those used in aircraft) maintain laminar flow at normal flow rates - since conservation of mass and energy is assumed to apply, restriction of the diameter leads to increased speed of gas flow and a corresponding decrease in the pressure on the walls The floating bobbin rotameter that is familiar to anesthesiologists is known as the Thorpe tube - the sudden restriction caused by the bobbin leads to a propoional increase in velocity and the Bernoulli equation does not apply (flow is propoionate to the square root of the pressure drop). Because the pressure drop across the orifice is inversely propoional to orifice area squared, the pressure change across the bobbin will decrease as the bobbin rises (and the area of the tube increases). The bobbin reaches a steady state when the pressure drop exactly opposes the gravitational force on the bobbin - at this steady state the pressure drop is always the same (because gravitational forces are constant), however as flow rates increase, the bobbin will move higher because this critical pressure drop will occur over a larger cross-sectional area (since velocity is higher)",A
Fluoride levels which can cause renal toxicity is,Above 50 micromol/litre,Above 20 micromol/litre,Above 80 micromol/litre,Above 5 micromol/litre,"If a inhalational agent is highly metabolized and produces huge amount of fluoride it can cause nephrotoxicity. We need more than 50 micromol/litre of fluoride in blood to be nephrotoxic. Methoxyflurane is the most nephrotoxic among inhalational anesthetics- it causes polyuric renal failure due to a large amount of inorganic fluoride released, and it is no longer used in clinical practice. The renal toxicity of volatile anesthetics is due to their metabolic breakdown to free fluoride ions. The amount of fluoride ions produced: Methoxyflurane: 80uM Sevoflurane: 20-30 uM Enflurane: 20uM Isoflurane and desflurane: 5uMWhen compared to methoxyflurane, the lower incidence of nephrotoxicity among the newer inhaled anesthetics is due to lesser metabolic breakdown, lower solubility in the kidney which results in lesser amount of intrarenal fluoride which is liberated and also due to their faster clearance.",A

A 42-year-old man who was in a house fire is transferred to your burn unit. He has singed nose hairs and facial burns. Direct laryngoscopy in the emergency room demonstrates pharyngeal edema and mucosal sloughing. He has 60% total body surface area burns. Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?,Hyperbaric oxygen,Intravenous steroids,Inhaled steroids,Intubation,"The patient requires intubation because of suspicion of upper airway burns. Clinical suspicion should be increased given the singed nose hairs and facial burns. Intubation should be considered in the presence of posterior pharyngeal edema, mucosal sloughing, or carbonaceous sputum on direct laryngoscopy. Significant upper airway edema can result of upper airway burns, paicularly 12 to 24 hours post-injury. Bronchoscopy can be used to evaluate for lower airway burn injuries, but would not change management in this patient given the high clinical suspicion for airway burn injuries and the need for intubation. Inhaled or intravenous steroids for airway burn injuries are not indicated in patients with large burns due to the increased risk of infections. Carbon monoxide poisoning is treated with 100% inhaled oxygen; hyperbaric oxygen is used in patients with neurologic symptoms and small burns as it reduces the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin. However, the risks outweigh the benefits in patients with large burns. Miller&;s anaesthesia 9th edition page no 546",D
"A 24-year-old man presents in septic shock from an empyema. He is febrile to 103degF, tachycardic in the 120s, and hypotensive to the 90s. His oxygen saturation is 98% on 2-L oxygen. His white blood cell count is 25,000/mL and creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. His blood pressure does not respond to fluid administration despite a CVP of 15. Which of the following therapies is indicated in managing this patient?",Intubation,Recombinant human activated protein C,Epinephrine,Norepinephrine,") Early goal-directed therapy should be employed for patients with septic shock or severe sepsis. The tenets of resuscitation include intubation if hypoxic, fluid resuscitation to a central venous pressure target of 8 to 12 mm Hg if not intubated and infusion of vasopressors to maintain a mean aerial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the vasopressors of choice; epinephrine vasoconstricts peripherally as well as increases cardiac contractility and is not a first-line agent for septic shock. Inotropes such as dobutamine have been used if oxygen delivery is low, but should not be used to push delivery to supranormal levels. Fuhermore, cultures should be drawn immediately and empiric antibiotics initiated; if there is a surgical source of sepsis, then operative intervention for source control should be promptly performed after initial resuscitative effos. Recombinant-activated protein C is indicated in patients with severe sepsis with a predicted high risk of moality (ie, older age, increased severity of disease); this patient does not have evidence of end-organ dysfunction such as acute renal or respiratory failure at this time. The use of coicosteroids for septic shock is controversial, but should only be considered in the setting of shock nonresponsive to fluids and vasopressors.

Mechanism of action of Local anesthetics:,Inhibition of Na+ channels,Inhi bition of Na+ K+ ATPase,Inhibition of K+ channels,Inhibition of Ca2+channels,"Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th editionExplanation:Mechanism of action of Local anestheticsThe primary mechanism of action of local anesthetics is blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels.The excitable membrane of nerve axons, like the membrane ot cardiac muscle and neuronal cell bodies, maintains a resting transmembrane potential of -90 to -60 mV.During excitation, the sodium channels open, and a fast inward sodium current quickly depolarizes the membrane toward the sodium equilibrium potential t+40 mV).As a result of depolarization, the sodium channels close (inactivate) and potassium channels open. The outward flow of potassium repolarizes the membrane toward the potassium equilibrium potential (about -95 mV): repolarization returns the sodium channels to the rested state.Biologic toxins such as batrachotoxin. aconitine, veratridine. and some scorpion venoms bind to receptors within the channel and prevent inactivation. This results in prolonged influx of sodium through the channel and depolarization of the resting potential.The marine toxins tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin block sodium channels by binding to channel receptors near the extracellular surface. Their clinical effects superficially resemble those of local anesthetics (ie, block of conduction without a change in the resting potential) even though their receptor site is quite different.The blockade of sodium channels by most local anesthetics is both voltage- and time-dependent: Channels in the rested state, which predominate at more negative membrane potentials, have a much lower affinity for local anesthetics than activated (open state) and inactivated channels, w-hich predominate at more positive membrane potentials.Elevated extracellular calcium partially antagonizes the action of local anesthetics owing to the calcium-induced increase in the surface potential on the membrane (which favors the low-affinity rested state).Increases in extracellular potassium depolarize the membrane potential and favor the inactivated state, enhancing the effect of local anesthetics.",A

"A 73-year-old woman with a long history of heavy smoking undergoes femoral aery-popliteal aery bypass for rest pain in her left leg. Because of serious underlying respiratory insufficiency, she continues to require ventilatory suppo for 4 days after her operation. As soon as her endotracheal tube is removed, she begins complaining of vague upper abdominal pain. She has daily fever spikes of 39degC (102.2degF) and a leukocyte count of 18,000/mL. An upper abdominal ultrasonogram reveals a dilated gallbladder, but no stones are seen. A presumptive diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis is made. Which of the following is the next best step in her treatment?",Nasogastric suction and broad-spectrum antibiotics,Immediate cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram,Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to visualize and drain the common bile duct,"The development of acute postoperative cholecystitis is an increasingly recognized complication of the severe illnesses that precipitate admissions to the ICU. The causes are obscure but probably lead to a common final pathway of gallbladder ischemia. The diagnosis is often extremely difficult because the signs and symptoms may be those of occult sepsis. Moreover, the patients are often intubated, sedated, or confused as a consequence of the other therapeutic or medical factors. Biochemical tests, though frequently revealing abnormal liver function, are nonspecific and nondiagnostic. Bedside ultrasonography is usually strongly suggestive of the diagnosis when a thickened gallbladder wall or pericholecystic fluid is present; nonvisualization of the gallbladder on a nuclear medicine (HIDA) scan can also be diagnostic. If diagnosis is delayed, moality and morbidity are very high. Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is usually curative of acalculous cholecystitis and affords stabilizing palliation if calculous cholecystitis is present. Antibiotics without drainage are too cautious a choice for a patient with a potentially fatal complication. Operative intervention is indicated only if less invasive methods of treatment (percutaneous cholecystostomy tube) have failed, and ERCP is not indicated in the absence of ductal obstruction.",C
All of the following statement about neuromuscular blockage produced by succinylcholine are true except,No fade on Train of Four stimulation,Fade on tetanic stimulation,No post tetanic fecilitation,Train of four ratio 1,"Depolarizing neuromuscular blocker The only drug still in clinical use belonging to this group is succinylchloline. Mode of action The effects of succinylcholine (SCh)at the neuromuscular junction are depolarizing postsynaptic and extrajunctional receptors, normally, this desensitization process does not occur with acetylcholine because of its rapid breakdown. However, succinylcholine remains at the endplate for much longer, so desensitization develops after a brief period of activation. Neuromuscular blockade because a depolarized neuro muscular blockade cannot respond to subsequent acetylcholine release. SCh is endowed with two unique and critically impoant characteristics - 1.produces intense paralysis rapidly(fastest onset) 2.effect wanes before preoxygenated person beomes hypoxic (shoest duration). Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis are manifested, disorganized movements or fasciculation is seen. Characteristics of blockade 1. Simple twitch height reduces 2. No fade on train of four stimulation 3. No fade on tetanic stimulation 4. Potentiated by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase 5.

Proper planning and preparation of airway management is essential: Elevation of the patient's upper body, head and neck. Preoxygenation is mandatory in morbidly obese patients and should be followed by actions to counteract atelectasis formation. Use a rapid sequence induction, an awake intubation or a standard induction with hypnotics should depend on the thorough airway examination and comorbidity and should not be based solely on whether morbid obesity is present or not. Ensure sufficient depth of anaesthesia before initiating manipulation of the airway because inadequate anaesthesia depth predisposes to aspiration if airway management becomes difficult. Intubating laryngeal mask airway is more efficient in the morbidly obese patients than in lean patients and serves as a rescue device for both failed ventilation and failed intubation. In the 24 h following anaesthesia, morbidly obese patients experience frequent oxygen desaturation periods that can be counteracted by continuous positive airway pressure, noninvasive ventilation and physiotherapy.",C

IsoproterenolQ may effectively reverse some of electrophysiological abnormalities characteristic of bupivacaine toxicity. - If LA intoxication produces cardiac arrest, the ACLS (advanced cardiac life suppo) guidelines are reasonable; however, I suggest that amiodarone & vasopressin be preferredQ/substituted for lidocaine & epinephrine (ACLS prefers epinephrine) - Morgan/273. With unresponsive bupivacaine toxicity, intravenous lipid infusion (remarkable ability to effect resuscitation from overdose even after 10 min of unsuccessful conventional resuscitation) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be considered.

What is the mode of action of local anesthetics?,Prevents Na+ channel activation and the Na+ influx associated with membrane depolarization.,Change the voltage gated Na+ channel from conducting to non conducting,Destroys the Na+ channel,Close the Na+ channel,"Sodium channels are membrane bound proteins that are composed of one large and subunit through which Na ions pass, and one or two smaller b subunits. Voltage - gated Na channels exist in three stages - resting, open and inactivated local anesthetics bind a specific region of the & subunit and inhibit voltage - gated Na channels preventing channel activation and Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Main mechanism of action of local anesthetics is through inhibition ofActivated, voltage-gated Na channel. Local anesthetics have a greater affinity for the channel in the open or inactivated state than in the resting state. Local anesthetic binding to open or inactivated channels, or both, is facilitated by depolarization. The fraction of Na channels that have bound a local anesthetic increases with frequent depolarization (eg, during trains of impulses).This phenomenon is termed use-dependent block Local anesthetic inhibition is both voltage and frequency dependent, and is greater when nerve fibers are firing rapidly than with infrequent depolarizations Sodium passess through voltage gated sodium channel and cause change in membrane potential and cause depolarization. Local anesthetic attaches to sodium channel and prevents propogation & depolarization",A

Thiopentone is C/I in,Acute intermittent porphyria,Bronchial asthma,Shock,All the above,"Barbiturates promote aminolevulinic acid synthetase, which stimulates the formation of porphyrin (an intermediary in heme synthesis). This may precipitate acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria in susceptible individuals. Barbiturates incompletely depress airway reflex responses to laryngoscopy and intubation, and airway instrumentation may lead to bronchospasm (in asthmatic patients) or laryngospasm in lightly anesthetized patients. In situations where the baroreceptor response will be blunted or absent (eg, hypovolemia, congestive hea failure, b-adrenergic blockade), cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated peripheral pooling of blood and direct myocardial depression.

"A 62-year-old woman with a history of coronary aery disease presents with a pancreatic head tumor and undergoes a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postoperatively, she develops a leak from the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis and becomes septic. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed, which demonstrates an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. She also develops acute renal failure and oliguria. Which of the following is an indication to sta dopamine?",To increase splanchnic flow,To increase coronary flow,To decrease hea rate,To lower peripheral vascular resistance,"Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension.",B

The BPS is composed of three observational areas (facial expression, upper limb movements and compliance with mechanical ventilation). Each is scored from 1 to 4, with higher numbers indicating discomfo. The BPS score ranges from 3 (no pain) to 12 (most pain). It has been studied and validated in both deeply sedated and moderately sedated patients. The CPOT assesses four areas (facial expression, movements, muscle tension and ventilator compliance). Each area is scored from 0-2, with total scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 8 (most pain). It is validated in both intubated and non-intubated critical care patients. CPOT has superior reliability and validity when used in non-verbal critically ill adults. Chronic pain or delirium may make asceaining a pain level difficult with CPOT. Uncontrolled pain is common in critically ill patients.

Laughing gas is,Nitrous oxide,Halothane,Chloroform,Diethylether,"Humphry Davy coined the name ""laughing gas"" for nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or nitrous, is a chemical compound, an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N2O. At room temperature, it is a colourless, non-flammable gas, with a slight metallic scent and taste. At elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen. It is soluble in water. Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic, and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia, but used as a carrier gas (mixed with oxygen) for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane. It has a minimum alveolar concentration of 105% and a blood/gas paition coefficient of 0.46. The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia, however, can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide, with the purpose of causing euphoria and/or slight hallucinations, began as a phenomenon for the British upper class in 1799, known as ""laughing gas paies"". In rats, N2O stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway by inducing dopamine release and activating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, presumably through antagonistic of NMDA receptors localised in the system. This action has been implicated in its euphoric effects and, notably, appears to augment its analgesic propeies as well. It is remarkable, however, that in mice, N2O blocks amphetamine-induced carrier-mediated dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and behavioural sensitisation, abolishes the conditioned place preference (CPP) of cocaine and morphine, and does not produce reinforcing (or aversive) effects of its own. Effects of CPP of N2O in rats are mixed, consisting of reinforcement, aversion and no change. In contrast, it is a positive reinforcer in squirrel monkeys, and is well known as a drug of abuse in humans. These discrepancies in response to N2O may reflect species variation or methodological differences. In human clinical studies, N2O was found to produce mixed responses, similarly to rats, reflecting high subjective individual variability.",A

Which of the following can replace N2O as O2 carrier,Argon,Xenon,Helium,None,"Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects.15,332 For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

All of the following drugs are commercially marketed as racemic mixture except-,Bupivacaine,Thiopentone,Ropivacaine,Thiamylal,"Ropivacaine is pure s-isomer of bupivacaine. Enantiomers exist in two different spatial configurations, like right- and left-handed gloves, and are present in equal amounts in a racemic solution. They are optically active and can be differentiated by their effects on the rotation of the plane of a polarised light into dextrorotatory or levorotatory stereoisomers. The physicochemical propeies of the two enantiomeric molecules are identical, but the two enantiomers can have substantially different behaviours in their affinity for either the site of action or the sites involved in the generation of side effects. R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of local anaesthetics have been demonstrated to have different affinity for different ion channels of sodium, potassium, and calcium; this results in a significant reduction in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity (cardiotoxicity) of the S(-)enantiomer as compared with the R(+)enantiomer. The technological advancements have made it possible to develop Ropivacaine as an optically pure S(-) enantiomeric from the parent chiral molecule propivacaine.

"55 year old female a known case of thryotoxicosis in control posted for abdomino perinea] resection during surgery there was sudden drop in B.P., and end tidal CO2 decreased from 40 to 10 mmHg. On auscultation there was a mill wheel murmur, what is the diagnosis aEUR'",Thyroid storm,Bleeding,Hypoxia,Air embolism,"Air embolism [Ref Lee Synopsis of Anaesthesia 12rh/e p. 2741 Presence of Mill wheel murmur and decrease in End tidal CO2 during surgery suggests Air enzbolism:- ""If air enters the vein in sufficient amount, it will go to the right hea and lung causing on air-lock obstruction in the pulmonary aery. This may result in a found continuous precordial murmur, the so called ""Mill wheel murmur"". Two conditions must exist for venous air embolism to occur : - A direct communication between a source of air and the vasculature and - A pressure gradient ouring the passage of air into the circulation. Air embolism can occur whenever a blood vessel is open and a pressure gradient exists ouring entry of gas. Because the pressure in most aeries and veins is greater than atmospheric pressure an air embolus does not always happen when a blood vessel is injured. In the veins above the hea, such as in the head and neck, the pressure is less than atmospheric and an injury may let air in. This is one reason why surgeons must be paicularly careful when operating on the brain. The key factors determining the degree of morbidity and moality in venous air emboli are ? The volume of the gas entrapped. The rate of accumulation and The patient's position at the time of event. Generally small amounts of air are broken up in the capillary bed and absorbed from the circulation without producing symptoms. Traditionally it has been estimated that more than 5 ml/kg of air displaced into the intravenous space is required for significant injury (shock or cardiac arrest to occu). It a large amount of air gets lodged in the hea; it stops the flow of the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs. This results in significant rise in pulmonary aery pressures. This increase in pulmonary aery pressures can lead to right ventricular outflow obstruction and fuher compromise pulmonary venous return to the left hea. The diminished pulmonary venous return will lead to decreased left ventricular preload with resultant decreased cardiac output and eventual systemic cardiovascular collapse. In patients with patent foramen ovale the air entrapped can travel to the left side of the hea and on to the brain or coronary aeries. This can lead to most serious of air embolism symptoms. Diagnosis Dopple ultrasounddeg is the most sensitive noninvasive method to detect air embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive than Doppler ultrasound but is also more invasivedeg and technically more difficult to place and to interpret. The pulmonary aery catheter is the next most sensitive monitor. Mass spectrometry.for end tidal nitrogen is as sensitive as the pulmonary aery catheter. End tidal carbon di-oxide measurement decreases during air embolism. - But decrease in ETCO2 is not specific for air embolism. Hypoventilatiorz, low cardiac output, other types of emboli and COPD can also decrease ETCO2. The least sensitive method to detect air embolism is the precordial or esophageal stethoscope. On stethoscope - ""mill wheel murmur"" is detected Clinical signs of Air embolism Abrupt fall in end tidal CO2 is usually the first sign Hypotension Tachycardia Cyanosis Mill wheel murmur Cardiovascular collapse",D

All are stages of anaesthesia except-,Analgesia,Allodynia,Delirium,Surgical anesthesia,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Allodynia o Stages of anaesthesia are Stage of analgesia ( stage 1), stage of delirium or excitment (stage 2), stage of surgical anesthesia (stage 3) and stage of medullary'- paralysis (stage 4).o Guedel described four stages of ether anesthesia known as Guedel stages.Stages of anaesthesiao GAs cause an irregular descending depression of the CNS, i.e., higher functions are lost first and pregressively lower area of brain are involved. In spinal cord lower segments are affected earlier than upper segments. The vital centers located in the medulla are paralyzed the last as the depth of anaesthesia increases,o Guedel discribed four stages of ether anaesthesia dividing the Illrd stage into 4 planes. With faster acting GAs these clear cut stages are not seen nowr days as induction with these agents is too fast. Stage 1 (Stage of analgesia): - It extends from beginning of anaesthetic inhalation to the loss of conciousness. Stage 2 (Stage of delirium or excitment): - From the loss of conciousness to beginning of regular respiration. There is roving eye ball (maximum movement of eye). Pupil is partially dilated. Eye lashr eflex is lost - First reflex to be lost However eyelid reflex remains present.C) Stage 3 ( stage of surgical anaesthesia): - From beginning of regular respiration to cessation of spontaneous breathing. Most surgeries are done in this stage. It is divided into 4 planes : -Plane 1 : - From beginning of regular respiration to cessation of eye movement. There is roving eye ball. Eye lid reflex is lost. This plane ends when eye ball become fixed. Pupil size is normal.Plane 2 : - From cessation of eye movement to respiratory Paresis. Eye ball is fixed.

Anaesthetic of choice in asthma patients: March 2007,Halothane,Thipentone,Ketamine,Feanyl,"Ans. C: Ketamine Ketamine is classified as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspaate) receptor antagonist, and at high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to opioid (mu) receptors and sigma receptors. Like other drugs of this class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as ""dissociative anaesthesia"" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anaesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. It is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug. Ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly, but it is also effective when insufflated, smoked, or taken orally. When used at anaesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system, so I/ V anaesthetic of choice for shock. Ketainine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. At sufficiently high doses users may experience what is coined the ""K-hole"", a state of dissociation whose effects are thought to mimic the phenomenology of schizophrenia.",C

""""In the absence of a precise diagnosis, children presenting with an undiagnosed neuromusculardisease should not have elective surgery or anaesthesia other than as part of the diagnostic process.Ref: Vindra etal., Anaesthesia for Children with Neuromuscular Disease, Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care and Pain, Volume 10, Issue 5, 1 October2010, pages 143-147Inguinal hernia repair is the most common general surgical procedure performed by pediatric surgeons.Males are more frequently affected than females, and the incidence of inguinal hernia is highest in the first year of life.Right-sided hernias (60%) occur more frequently than left-sided (30%) and bilateral (10%) hernias.Risk factors associated with inguinal hernias are prematurity, chronic respiratory illness, and excessive intraperitoneal fluid (ventriculoperitoneal shunts, ascites, peritoneal dialysis).Anesthesia can be induced by mask inhalation of volatile agents or by IV or rectal technique.Endotracheal intubation is usually unnecessary for herniorrhaphy, except in infants younger than 1 year, in whom it may be difficult to maintain an adequate airway with bag and mask ventilation without distending the stomach.Premature infants have a particularly high incidence of inguinal hernias. In these infants, for whom an inhalation anesthetic may have increased risks, spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia have been used successfully to avoid general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation.The history is compatible with cerebral palsy or congenital myopathies. Since this is an elective surgical repair, complete neurological workup and diagnosis is necessary before anesthetic risk can be assessed.These children are ideal for assessment by a multidisciplinary team which include anaesthesiologists and pediatrician. A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children, including a discussion of postoperative pain management with the parents. Cognitive and communication problems may make preoperative assessment more difficult. Parents and caretakers are best to be involved during this period not only to gain information but also allay the fears of the child.Anesthetic Concern in Cerebral PalsyIntraoperative hypothermia and slow emergence.Suxamethonium does not cause hyperkalaemia in these patients, and a rapid sequence induction may be indicated.Anesthetic Concern in Neuromuscular DiseasesThe incidence of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis is significant.Succinylcholine and volatile agents should be avoided in at-risk children.",A

These tubes are commonly used for head and neck surgery.RAE endotracheal tubes, named after the inventors of the tube (Ring, Adair, and Elwyn), have a preformed shape to fit the mouth or nose. The ""armoured"" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced, silicone rubber tubes which are quite flexible but yet difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Armoured endotracheal tubes are frequently used during anaesthesia when bending or compression of the tube is likely to occur as in neurosurgery or head and neck and oral surgery.

Although exercise stress testing is an appropriate method for evaluating a patient's cardiac function preoperatively, this patient's functional status is limited by his peripheral vascular disease and therefore a pharmacologic stress test would be the preferred method of cardiac evaluation. An ECG should be performed in this patient with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypeension, and diabetes, but a normal ECG would not preclude fuher workup.

A 30 year old woman with coarctation of aorta is admitted to the labour room for elective caesarean section. Which of the following is the anaesthesia technique of choice -,Spinal anaesthesia,Epidural anaesthesia,General anaesthesia,Local anaesthesia with nerve blocks,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., General anaesthesia In coarctation of Aorta, Aorta narrows anywhere along its course.The most common site for coarctation of Aorta isJust distal to origin of left subclavian arteryNear the insertion of ligamentum arteriosusSo, the common clinical presentation in coarctation of Aorta isHypotension, ischemia, distal to the obstruction, (circulation is usually diminished in abdominal organs and pulses are absent in lower extremities)Hypertension proximal to the site of obstruction (the B.P. in upper extremities and head and neck is increased)Effect of coarctation of Aorta on Pregnancy.Coarctation of Aorta may lead to compromise of placental circulation, because the placental circulation is derived from uterine artery, which is a branch of internal iliac artery (all the vessels originating distal to coarctation will have diminished perfusion)So, the fetal circulation is in a compromised state in coarctation of Aorta.Anaesthetic considerations that should be taken into account in case of coarctation of Aorta.In coarctation of Aorta, am decrease in cardiac output or cardiac return is deleterious to the fetus because the placental circulation is already compromised on account of coarctation.So any anaesthetic procedure or drug which causes hypotension should be avoided in these patients.Regional anaesthetic procedures such as spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia should be avoided in these patients because hypotension is the most common side effect of these procedures. The consequence of decreased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of these procedures would be hazardous to the patientGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred technique for performing ceasarean section in a patient with coarctation of Aorta as it has the advantage ofmore rapid inductionless hypotensionbetter airway and ventilation.Here are the quoted lines from an internet site further supporting our answerUncorrected coarctation is rare in pregnancy but when present tends to be exacerbated by normal physiologic changes with fixed aortic outflow obstruction and distal hypoperfusion. These patients are at increased risk of left ventricular failure, aortic dissection and rupture, endocarditis and cerebrovascular accident. Anesthetic goals should center on maintaining normal to slightly elevated SVR and heart rate and adequate preload. Regional anesthesia is relatively contraindicated. General anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean section with invasive hemodynamic monitoring with post ductal intraarterial catheter, CVP or PA catheters to guide fluid administration and to assess left ventricular function and use of ephedrine and dopamine as vasopressors of choice.",C

Current mode of analgesia best for intrapartum pain relief:,Epidural analgesia,Spinal anaesthesia,Inhalational,Local analgesia,"Ans. a (Epidural analgesia)LUMBAR EPIDURAL ANALGESIAIndications for lumbar epidural analgesia :# Pain in labor, management of the patient with preeclampsia who does not have a coagulation abnormality, management of labor in patients with certain cardiac lesions, and management of breech delivery.# Of the various pharmacologic methods of pain relief used in labor and delivery, regional analgesia techniques--spinal, epidural and combined spinal epidural (CSE) are the most flexible, effective, and least depressing to the CNS, allowing for an alert, participating mother and an alert neonate.Absolute contraindications:# Patient refusal, hemodynamic instability, infection at the anticipated site of puncture, and absence of resuscitation equipment.Relative contraindications:# Fever, preexisting CNS disease, hypovolemia, hypotension, lack of experience by the anesthetist, and blood coagulation defects.# Although an arbitrary platelet count of 100,000 per mm3 has been advocated as the lower limit for safe lumbar epidural analgesia, successful blocks without epidural bleeding complications have been obtained with platelet counts as low as 50,000 per mm3.Three principal advantages of lumbar epidural analgesia:# The parturient remains awake and cooperative.# The incidence of complications is very low when the technique is used correctly.# Once an epidural catheter is in place, it can be used to provide analgesia or anesthesia for a vaginal or cesarean delivery.The disadvantages of lumbar epidural analgesia:# The possibility of poor perineal analgesia# The presence of ""hot spots"", where analgesia is insufficient# Delayed onset of action# Technical difficulty (Technical failure occurs in approximately 4% of cases)# Intravascular injection# Accidental dural puncture",A

Alkalization of local anesthetics solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate has following benefit except-,Speeds the onset,Improves quality,Decreases systemic toxicity,Decreases pain at site,"Addition of sodium bicarbonate prevents causation of drug and spreads the onset -, improves the quality, increases duration and decreased pain at site of injection. Explanation The addition of sodium bicarbonate to local anesthetics improves the speed of onset, reduces the minimum concentration of the local anesthetic required and improves the quality of block. Adding sodium bicarbonate increases the pH of the local anesthetic solution, and thus more amount of free uncharged drug is available which can increase the rate of diffusion across the nerve sheath and improve the onset of anesthesia. Subcutaneous injections of local anesthetics are painful. Alkalinization of the solution by adding sodium bicarbonate before injecting can decrease the pain. Addition of adrenaline or any vasoconstriction causes decrease in systemic toxicity.",C
A man presented with cut wound over scalp. The best anaesthetic agent for wound repair is:,1% xylocaine,2% xylocaine,Ketamine,Xylocaine + adrenaline,"In clinical practice, a vasoconstrictor, usually epinephrine, is often added to local anesthetics. The vasoconstrictor performs a dual service. By decreasing the rate of absorption, it not only localizes the anesthetic at the desired site, but also allows the rate at which it is destroyed in the body to keep pace with the rate at which it is absorbed into the circulation. This reduces its systemic toxicity. Must Know: The use of vasoconstrictors in local anesthetic preparations for anatomical regions with limited collateral circulation could produce irreversible hypoxic damage, tissue necrosis, and gangrene, and therefore is contraindicated.

Which of the following can be used in a patient with hepatic as well as renal failure?,Atracurium,Vecuronium,Pancuronium,Mivacurium,"Ans. a (Atracurium) (Ref.

Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation. It is the preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderly. Hypotension may occur due to histamine release.Cisatracurium, R-Cis enantiomer of atracurium is nearly 4 times more potent, slower in onset, but similar in duration of action. Like atracurium it undergoes Hofmann elimination, but in contrast it is not hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase.

"A 43-year-old woman develops acute renal failure following an emergency resection of a leaking abdominal aoic aneurysm.

Eight hours after these values are repoed, the following electrocardiogram is obtained. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment in the management of this patient?",10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate,0.25 mg digoxin every 3 hours for 3 doses,100 mg lidocaine,Emergent hemodialysis,"The electrocardiogram demonstrates changes that are essentially diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. Correct treatment for the affected patient includes discontinuation of exogenous sources of potassium, administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the myocardial effects of potassium), and administration of sodium bicarbonate (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium-potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy, given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would be not only ineffective but contraindicated, since they would fuher depress the myocardial conduction system.",A

Size of the laryngeal mask airway  for normal adults,2.5,3,1.5,4,"Voyagis have proposed an alternative method of size selection for the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) based on a common misconception that the No. 3 is for females and the No. 4 for males.
In fact, their new proposal strongly reflects current European practice, which is to use a No. 4 for normal adults and a No. 5 for large adults and to use the No. 3 rarely. We consider, however, that
further conclusive trials are required before the manufacturer's weight-based recommendations are altered.
Judging the correct size of LMA can be difficult since the relationship between gender, weight, height, and upper airway geometry appears inconsistent.
No factors have yet been identified that give an easy measurement of potential pharyngeal volume directly correlating with appropriate LMA size, and certainly, there is no known anatomical difference between the male and the female adult or child pharynx at a given weight.
Some practitioners consider that the smaller sizes are satisfactory for spontaneous ventilation since a less effective seal is required. However, too small a mask may still result in local soft tissue damage due to poor fit around the laryngeal inlet or misplacement into the upper oesophagus or the glottic inlet.
The problems associated with insertion of too large a mask (airway obstruction, airway reflex activation) are probably fewer than those associated with insertion of too small a mask.",D

It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

The excitatory neurological phase culminates in generalized convulsions. This may lead to the depressive phase of coma and respiratory depression. Cardiovascular system toxicity is classically in three phases. The initial phase includes hypeension and tachycardia. The intermediate phase is associated with myocardial depression and hypotension.

Hepatotoxic agent is,Ketamine,Ether,N2O,Halothane,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",D

A severely ill patient was maintained on an infusional anaesthetic agent. On the 2nd day he staed detiorating. The probable culprit may be,Etiomidate,Propofol,Opioid,Barbiturate,"A i.e. Etomidate; B i.e. Propofol Increased infection and moality in a group of patients sedated with etomidate infusion in an ICU was associated with low coisol levelsQ and is attributed to etomidate induced supression of adrenal coisal synthesisQ. Etomidate is a dose dependent but reversible inhibitor of 11 - hydroxylase in the adrenal coex and is more potent than metyrapone. This enzyme is required for both mineralocoicoid and coicosteroid production. Minor adrenocoical supressive effects (i.e. impaired response to ACTH) follow induction doses or sho infusion doses. Propofol is not recommended for sedation of critically ill pediatric patients in ICU. The drug has been associated with higher moality d/t propofol infusion syndrome. Its essential features are metabolic acidosis, multiple organ failure, hemodynamic instability, hepatomegaly, and rhabdomyolysis. Very rarely, it may occur in adults, and in patients undergoing long term propofol infusion (> 48 hours) for sedation at high doses (>5 mg/ kg/ hr).",A

"In a pregnant lady there is decreased requirement of anaesthetic agents because of all the following, EXCEPT:",Higher sensitivity of nerves to anaesthetics,Increased lumbar lordosis,Engorged spinal veins,Decreased sub arachnoid space,"During pregnancy there is a reduction in the requirement of anaesthetic agent. Factors contributing to this are -increased levels of B-EP -increased neuronal sensitivity -vascular congestion in spinal canal and -increased levels of progesterone. Increased lumbar lordosis has not been mentioned any where as a contributing factor for decreasing requirement of anaesthetic agents in pregnancy. During pregnancy enlarged uterus obstructs the inferior venacava and distends epidural venous plexus and increases epidural blood volume. This inturn results in decreased spinal CSF volume, decreased potential volume of subarachnoid space and increased epidural space pressure. The first two effects enhance the spread of LA solutions during spinal and epidural anaesthesia respectively whereas last may predispose to higher incidence of dural puncture with epidural anaesthesia.

The following is true of Mendelson's syndrome,Critical Volume of aspirate is 50 ml,Critical pH of gastric aspirate is 1.5,Onset of symptoms generally occurs within 2 hours,Opioids have been shown to improve outcome,"In Mendelson's syndrome, the critical pH is 2.5 and the critical volume is 25ml (0.3ml/kg body wt). Opioids will decrease the tone of LES and increase the risk rather than decrease. In 1946, Mendelson was the first to describe aspiration pneumonitis attributable to the pulmonary aspiration of acidic gastric secretions in pregnant women undergoing anesthesia. This potentially fatal complication, occasionally referred to as Mendelson syndrome, has since been the intense focus of preventive effos among the anesthesia community. Prevention of aspiration of gastric contents is primarily accomplished by adherence to established preoperative fasting guidelines, premedication with drugs that may decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, and specialized induction techniques. Traditionally, patients who were scheduled for elective procedures requiring sedation, regional anesthesia, or general anesthesia were instructed to remain NPO (Latin for nulla per os or nothing by mouth) after midnight to ensure an empty stomach to decrease the risk of regurgitation. Based on evidence that allowing ingestion of clear liquids 2 to 4 hours before surgery resulted in lower gastric volumes and higher gastric pH, the ASA published Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration in 1999 that liberalized the traditional NPO policy and allowed clear liquids up to 2 hours before beginning elective procedures requiring anesthesia. The guidelines, updated in 2011, recommend 4 hours of fasting from breast milk 6 hours of fasting from solid foods, infant formula, and nonhuman milk. Fried or fatty foods may require longer fasting times (e.g., 8 hours or more). Although the ASA guidelines do not specifically address chewing gum, hard candies, or smoking, guidelines published by the European Society of Anaesthesiology on the topic do not recommend delaying the sta of anesthesia if a patient has consumed any of these immediately before the induction of anesthesia. The routine use of drugs as prophylaxis against aspiration pneumonitis is not recommended by the ASA guidelines but may be beneficial in patients with specific risk factors for aspiration, such as a full stomach, symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, presence of a nasogastric tube, morbid obesity, diabetic gastroparesis, or pregnancy. The goal of aspiration prophylaxis is twofold: to decrease gastric volume and to increase gastric fluid pH. Commonly used agents include nonpaiculate antacids (e.g., Bicitra), promotility drugs (e.g., metoclopramide), and H2-receptor antagonists. These drugs may be used alone or in combination.

Most common complication of coeliac plexus block -,Hypotension,Parasthesias,Diarrhea,Pneumothorax,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hypotension Celiac plexus blocko The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 vertebrae anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T12. by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands.o A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery.o Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexns block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling.o Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches : - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block.o Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomiual surgery.o Postural hypotension is the Most common complication of classic retrocrural and splanchnic nerve block.

"In a pregnant female, there is decreased requirement of the spinal anaesthetic agent because of all of the following except –",Exaggerated lumbar lordosis,Decreased volume of subarachnoid space,Engorgement of epidural veins,Increased sensitivity of the nerves to anaesthetic agent,"A smaller dose of local anaesthetic is nedded to produce the same level of neuraxial block in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women.
The causes may be :-


Compression of the inferior vena cava by the pregnant uterus causes ""distension or engorgment"" of the epidural venous plexus. This decreases the volume of the epidural space and also the volume of the CSF per spinal segment. Therefore a given dose of epidural or intrathecal local anaesthetic will produce a greater degree of demiatomal involvement.
Pregnant women exhibit increase susceptibility to local anaesthetics.


Apex of lumbar lordosis cauded to thoracic kyphosis is reduced in supine position. This may enhance the cephalad spread of CSF.",A

It may develop in an otherwise healthy person who has tolerated previous surgery without incident. It should be suspected in the presence of a history of unexplained fever, muscle or connective tissue disorder, or a positive family history (evidence suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern). In addition to fever during anesthesia, the syndrome includes tachycardia, increased O2 consumption, increased CO2 production, increased serum K+ , myoglobinuria, and acidosis. Rigidity rather than relaxation following succinylcholine injection may be the first clue to its presence. Treatment of malignant hypehermia should include prompt conclusion of the operative procedure and cessation of anesthesia, hyperventilation with 100% O2 , and administration of intravenous dantrolene. The urine should be alkalinized to protect the kidneys from myoglobin precipitation.

Which of the following fluorinated anaesthetics corrodes metal in vaporizers and breathing systems?,Sevoflurane,Enflurane,Isoflurane,Halothane,"D i.e. Halothane Halothane (2- bromo - 2- chloro - 1, 1, 1 trifluoroethane) is a potent, non inflammable, non toxic (relatively), colourless liquid with relatively non pungent (pleasant) vapour. It is decomposed by light and stabilised by 0.01% thymolQ, but is stable when stored in amber coloured bottles. Although it is decomposed by soda lime, it may be used safely with this mixture. The vapour is absorbed by rubberQ (rubber/gas paition cofficient is 120). It corrodes metals in vaporizers and breathing systemsQ. In the presence of moisture, it corrodes aluminium, tin, lead, magnesium and alloysQ. It should be stored in a closed container away from light and heat. It is soluble in rubber, and plasticsQ commonly found in ansethetic circuits. This has obvious implications for patients with halothane sensitivity, or who are at risk for malignant hypehermia, in whom anesthetic free circuit should be used. Halothane, Ketamine & AtropineQ are bronchodialators. These agents decrease airway resistance and increase anatomical dead space.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's tetany?",Hyperventilation,Hypocalcemia,Hypomagnesemia,Essential fatty acid deficiency,"Magnesium deficiency is common in malnourished patients and patients with large gastrointestinal fluid losses. The neuromuscular effects resemble those of calcium deficiency--namely, paresthesia, hyperreflexia, muscle spasm, and, ultimately, tetany. The cardiac effects are more like those of hypercalcemia. An electrocardiogram therefore provides a rapid means of differentiating between hypocalcemia (prolonged QT interval, T-wave inversion, hea blocks) and hypomagnesemia (prolonged QT and PR intervals, ST segment depression, flattening or inversion of p waves, torsade de pointes). Hypomagnesemia also causes potassium wasting by the kidney. Many hospital patients with refractory hypocalcemia will be found to be magnesium deficient. Often this deficiency becomes manifest during the response to parenteral nutrition when normal cellular ionic gradients are restored. A normal blood pH and aerial PCO2 rule out hyperventilation. The serum calcium in this patient is normal when adjusted for the low albumin (add 0.8 mg/dL per 1 g/dL decrease in albumin). Hypomagnesemia causes functional hypoparathyroidism, which can lower serum calcium and thus result in a combined defect.",C

All are benefits of prone ventilation except-,Prone position recruits dorsal lung regions where greater lung mass is located,Displacement of cardiac mass away from lung tissue,Homogenous distribution of ventilation in prone position,Proper tolerance of enteral feeding,"Prone position (PP) has been used since the 1970s to treat severe hypoxemia in patients with ARDS because of its effectiveness at improving gas exchange. Compared with the supine position (SP), placing patients in PP effects a more even tidal volume distribution, in pa, by reversing the veical pleural pressure gradient, which becomes more negative in the dorsal regions. PP also improves resting lung volume in the dorsocaudal regions by reducing the superimposed pressure of both the hea and the abdomen. In contrast, pulmonary perfusion remains preferentially distributed to the dorsal lung regions, thus improving overall alveolar ventilation/perfusion relationships. Moreover, the larger tissue mass suspended from a wider dorsal chest wall effects a more homogeneous distribution of pleural pressures throughout the lung that reduces abnormal strain and stress development.",D

In coronary aery disease isoflurane should be avoided Wt coronary steel phenomenonQ. In ischemia of cardiac muscle selective vasodialation of vessels of Ischemic zone and maintained tone of non ischemic zone //t selective increase of blood supply to ischemic areas. But in coronary steal phenomenon (Isoflurane & Dipyridomole) there is dialation of vessels of non ischemic zone also so there is decrease of flow in ischemic zone.Q That is why isoflurane is avoided in ischemic hea disease. In Myocardial Infarction operation should be with held for 6 monthsQ. Goldman Index is for cardiac risk factor and when it is > 13 it is associated with poor prognosis. In hypeension, halothane is AOC (for hypotensive surgery) In hypovolumia, Light G.A. (preferably Ether and Cyclopropane) with IPPV is method of choice",B

Nirous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following except: September 2006,Volvulus surgeries,Pneumothorax,Patient in shock,Tympanoplasties,"Ans. C: Patient in shock Overall, nitrous oxide is a very safe drug with few absolute contraindications. Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock.",C

Most common cause of ptosis ?,Myasthenia gravis,Paralysis of 3rd nerve,Idiopathic,Congenital,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Congenital Ptosis Ptosis is drooping of upper eyelid. Ptosis occurs when the muscles that raise the eyelid (levator palpebrae superiors and muller's nuscles) are not strong enough to do so properly. Etiology of Ptosis may be :? A) Congenital myogenic ptosis :- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis :- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i.e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis :- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic :- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic :- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e.g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma. Aponeurotic ptosis :- It is due to defect of the levator aponeurosis in the presence of normal functioning muscle, e.g. involutional (senile) ptosis, post-operative ptosis.",D

Ch 25The most important information in the above question is that the patient is 70 yrs old, i.e, of a geriatric age. Geriatric patients have a lot of anaesthetic implications. As a rule, we must consider shorter acting agents in these patients.Our body can be considered to be divided into 3 compartments when we inject any drug. These compartments are formed on the basis of the speed with which the drug reaches various parts of the body.Three-compartment model (including the biophase) schematizing the basic pharmacokinetic processes that occur after intravenous drug administration.I = dosing scheme as a function of timekl0 = Rate constant reflecting all processes acting to irreversibly remove drug from the central compartmentVI = central compartment volume, usually expressed in liters or liters per kilogram.Central compartment-blood, highly vascular tissues like brain - The effect of Anaesthetic drugs primarily depends on the duration of drug in central compartment & volume of the compartment since they primarily act on CNSIntermediate compartment-intermediate blood supply organs like skeletal musclesPeripheral compartment-adipose tissue - responsible for storage & delayed release of drugs into circulationGeriatric patients have an increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass. Also, they are dehydrated leading to contraction of the central compartment. Thus, more drug is present in the central compartment on immediate injection (causing a profound effect at a normal dose), & more fat is available for delayed release of drugs back into the circulation, leading to prolonged action of drugs (see figure)They may have a decreased renal & hepatic clearanceDecreased cardiac output may contribute to a slow onset of drug effects followed by prolonged action secondary to delayed clearance (i.e.f barbiturates, benzodiazepines).Minimal alveolar concentration of inhalation anesthetics decreases with age (6% for each decade after age 40), which parallels loss of neurons and decreased cerebral metabolism.Short-acting intravenous drugs and volatile anesthetics with lower partition coefficients provide the advantage of more rapid elimination, brisk emergence, and reorientation to the patient's surroundings, and potentially lower incidence of confusion and delirium during recovery. However, the recovery of cognitive function, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, has not been shown to be different between various agents.Desflurane is associated with the most rapid emergence. (It has a low solubility hence faster onset & shorter time for emergence)A more predictable method of opioid titration may be to use a shorter acting opioid such as remifentanil. By adjusting the bolus and infusion doses, the variability in remifentanil pharmacokinetics is considerably less than for other intravenous opioids. (Morphine has a much longer duration of action)Similarly, it may be prudent to use shorter acting muscle relaxants. Studies show that there is an increased incidence of postoperative residual block and pulmonary complications in patients receiving pancuronium compared with atracurium or vecuronium. Atracurium depends to a small extent on hepatic metabolism and excretion, and elimination half-life is prolonged in elderly patients. Clearance is unchanged with age, however, suggesting that alternative pathways of elimination (ester hydrolysis and Hofmann elimination) assume importance in elderly patients.CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OF ANESTHETIC AGENTS IN ELDERLY PATIENTSDrugBrain SensitivityPharmacokineticsDoseinhaled agents|--|Thiopental--|Initial distribution volume|Etomidate--|Initial distribution volume| |Clearance Propofol||Clearance|Midazolam||Clearance|Morphine||Clearance|Sufentanil|--|Alfentanil| |Fentanyl| |Remifentanil||Clearance-- |Central compartment volume|PancuroniumNA|Clearance|AtracuriumNA----CisatracuriumNA----VecuroniumNA|Clearance|",D

"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the coronary care unit with an acute myocardial infarction. His postinfarction course is marked by congestive hea failure and intermittent hypotension. On the fouh day in hospital, he develops severe midabdominal pain. On physical examination, blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110 beats per minute and regular; the abdomen is soft with mild generalized tenderness and distention. Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?",Barium enema,Upper gastrointestinal series,Angiography,Ultrasonography,"In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop",C

Which fibers are affected earliest in spinal anaesthesia?,Sensory,Motor,Sympathetic preganglionic,Vibration,"Local anaesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space blocks conduction of impulses along all nerves with which it comes in contact, although some nerves are more easily blocked than others. Stimulation of the motor nerves causes muscles to contract and when they are blocked, muscle paralysis results. Sensory nerves transmit sensations such as touch and pain to the spinal cord and from there to the brain, whilst autonomic nerves control the caliber of blood vessels, hea rate, gut contraction and other functions not under conscious control. Generally, autonomic and sensory fibres are blocked before motor fibres.",C
Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following surgeries except?,Cochlear implant,Microlaryngeal surgery,Vitreoretinal surgery,Exentration operation,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Exenteration operation Filtered room air, Sulfur hexafluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases.By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed.If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia.Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeriesMiddle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube.When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N2O replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity.After discontinuation of N2O the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: -Serous otitis mediaDisarticulation of stapesImpaired hearingN2O anaesthesia is hazardous to hearing in patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery.Micro laryngeal surgeryCO2 and (Nd : YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea.Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia.

Which of the following produces the least damage to blood elements,Disc oxygenator,Membrane oxygenator,Bubble oxygenator,Screen oxygenator,"B i.e. Membrane Oxygenator Membranous (pump) oxygenators produce least damage to blood elements (RBCs, WBCs, platelets)Q and cause least denaturation of proteins. They have improved the efficiency of gas exchange while minimizing the trauma to blood elements. Due to these advantages membrane oxygenators have largely replaced bubble oxygenators. Oxygenators are devices used in cardiopulmonary bypass surgeries. Currently only two types of oxygenators -Membranous & bubble oxygenators are in use. Membranous oxygenators imitate the natural lung by interspersing a thin membrane between gas and blood phases. This eliminates gaseous micro emboli formation & minimizes blood element trauma. Hematological advantages of membranous oxygenator (vs bubble oxygenators) are - less trauma to RBC, WBC, platelet & less protein denaturation. Due to these advantages membranous oxygenators have largely replaced bubble oxygenators. Disc oxygenators & veical screen oxygenators were used in past.",B

He is taken emergently to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy and external fixation of his pelvic fracture. Which of the following is the best resuscitative strategy?,Infusion of another liter of crystalloid,Infusion of 500 mL of 5% albumin,Infusion of packed red blood cells followed by fresh-frozen plasma and platelets as indicated by the PT and platelet counts on laboratory values,Infusion of packed red blood cells and early administration of fresh-frozen plasma and platelets prior to return of laboratory values,"The patient is in class IV hemorrhagic shock, which represents a loss of more than 40% of circulating blood volume. He requires massive blood transfusion. The term massive blood transfusion is defined as a single transfusion greater than 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused over a period of 24 hours. There is evidence to suggest that severely injured trauma patients arrive at the hospital coagulopathic. Fuhermore, when large amounts of banked blood are transfused, the recipient develops dilutional thrombocytopenia and deficiencies in factors V and VIII. Recent studies have suggested that early administration of freshfrozen plasma (FFP) and platelets decreases moality and that a 1:1 ratio of PRBC:FFP should be initiated upon recognition of the need for massive transfusion. Waiting to administer FFP and platelets until laboratory values confirm coagulopathy is no longer recommended. Moreover, excessive crystalloid infusion should be avoided. Albumin has no role in damage control resuscitation. Vitamin K will take days to replace the clotting factors. This patient needs to have his coagulopathy corrected immediately to prevent death from hemorrhagic shock.",D

Disadvantage of ketamine is-,Increased hea rate,Increased ICT,Delirium,All of the above,"Ketamine increases all the pressures. i.e intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, intragastric pressure. With the rise in CBF and the generalized increase in sympathetic nervous system response, ICP increases after ketamine use. The increase in CMRO2 and CBF can be blocked by the use of thiopental or diazepam. Ketamine increases aerial blood pressure, hea rate, and cardiac output, paicularly after rapid bolus injections. These indirect cardiovascular effects are due to the central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine after release at nerve terminals.

Sodium Thiopentone is ultra sho acting d/t,Rapid absorption,Rapid metabolism,Rapid redistribution,Rapid excretion,"Barbiturate pharmacokinetics has been described in physiologic and compament models. Both these pharmacokinetic models describe rapid redistribution as the primary mechanism that terminates the action of a single induction dose. Physiologic models of barbiturates describe a rapid mixing of the drug within the central blood volume followed by a quick distribution of the drug to highly perfused, low-volume tissues (i.e., brain), with a slower redistribution of the drug to lean tissue (muscle), which terminates the effect of the initial (induction of anesthesia) dose. In these models, adipose tissue uptake and metabolic clearance (elimination) play only minor roles in the termination of the effects of the induction dose. The reasons are the minimal perfusion ratio of adipose tissue compared with other tissues and the slow rate of removal. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition",C

Which of the following does not cause malignant hypehermia,Isoflurane,Desflurane,N2O,Enflurane,"Anesthetic drugs that trigger Malignant Hypehermia include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, anddepolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used. Mild hypothermia and the preadministration of barbiturates, tranquilizers, propofol, or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers delay or prevent the onset of MH The two classic clinical manifestations of fulminant MH syndrome may sta with one of the following two scenarios:1. Rigidity after induction with succinylcholine but successful intubation, followed rapidly by the symptomslisted after scenario 22. Normal response to induction of anesthesia and uneventful anesthetic course until the onset of the following symptoms:* Unexplained sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias (or both)* Tachypnea, if spontaneous ventilation is present* Unexplained decrease in oxygen (O2) saturation (because of a decrease in venous O2 saturation)* Increase in end-tidal paial pressure of CO2 (Pco2) with adequate ventilation and, in most cases, unchanged ventilation* Unexpected metabolic and respiratory acidosis* Central venous desaturation* Increase in body temperature above 38.8deg C with no obvious cause. TREATMENTAcute management for MH can be summarized as follows:1. Discontinue all anesthetic agents and hyperventilate with 100% O2 with a fresh flow to at least 10 L/min. With increased aerobic metabolism, normal ventilation must increase. However, CO2 production is also increased because of neutralization of fixed acid by bicarbonate; hyperventilation removes this additional CO2.2. Reconstitute dantrolene in sterile water (not saline), and administer rapidly (2.5 mg/kg intravenously to a total dose of 10 mg/kg IV) every 5 to 10 minutes until the initial symptoms subside.3. Administer bicarbonate (1 to 4 mEq/kg IV) to correct the metabolic acidosis with frequent monitoring of blood gases and pH.4. Control fever by administering iced fluids, cooling the body surface, cooling body cavities with sterile iced fluids, and, if necessary, using a heat exchanger with a pump oxygenator. Cooling should be halted when the temperature approaches 38deg C to prevent inadveent hypothermia.5. Monitor urinary output, and establish diuresis if urine output is inadequate. Administer bicarbonate to alkalinize urine to protect the kidney from myoglobinuria induced renal failure.6. Blood gases, electrolytes, CK, temperature, arrhythmia, muscle tone, and urinary output guide fuher therapy. Hyperkalemia should be treated with bicarbonate, glucose, and insulin. Effective doses of dantrolene to reverse MH are the most effective way to lower serum potassium levels. In severe cases, calcium chloride or calcium gluconate may be used.7. Analyze coagulation studies (e.g., international normalized ratio , platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split degradation products). Safe anesthetics consist of nitrous oxide, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine must be avoided at all times, even in the presence of dantrolene. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",C

Which of the following can delivery 100% oxygen,Venturi mask,Anesthetic face mask,Hudson mask,Non - rebreather face mask,"Devices used foroxygen therapy Performance of these devices can be described according to 1. Themaximum oxygen concentrationachievable to be delivered to the patient, and the reliability/ variability with which the devices do that. Looking at the reliability and variability of oxygen delivery to the patient we can divide these pieces of equipment intofixed performance or variable performance devices. This means that the achieved inspired oxygen concentration is either more dependent on thepatient'speak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR)(variableperformance devices) or less so (fixedperformance devices). Fixed performance devices These devices deliver a fixed inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, independent of the PIFR. Even at the time of PIFR no random entrainment of room air will occur to unpredictably alter the FiO2 with this equipment. Devices in this group include: SS Venturi mask Thereisentrainment of room air with these devices, but it is fixed and not dependent on the patient's PIFR. Therefore the resulting delivered FiO2 is also constant. SS Non-rebreather facemask A reservoir bag supplies 100% oxygen and makes up for the deficit which occurs during times when the patient's PIFR is higher than the oxygen supply flow to the mask (usually around 20 L/min from an oxygen wall or tank source). Aflap valveon the mask prevent or at least reduce entrainment of room air. These masks do not achieve a perfect seal with the patient's face, sosomeroom air entrainment still occurs. FiO2 up to 70-80% can be achieved. SS Anesthetic facemask(with an anesthetic breathing circuit) These masks form a complete seal around the patient's airway so no entrainment of room air can occur. The delivered oxygen concentration is the same as in the gas mixture supplied to the mask (assuming no rebreathing occurs in the anesthetic breathing cicuit). We have also listed thePatil-Syracuseand theendoscopy maskunder this heading. Both of these devices allow instrumentation with a fiberoptic scope while maintaining a seal to the face with the mask. 2. Variable performance devices These devices deliver a variable inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, which depends on the PIFR. Depending on a patient's inspiratory effo (tidal volume, 'speed' of inspiration and respiratory rate) the PIFR can often exceed the flow rate at which oxygen or an oxygen/air mixture is supplied by the device, meaning that at the time of PIFR more or less entrainment of room air occurs, altering the resulting FiO2 in an unpredictable fashion Devices in this group are: SS Nasal cannulas Simple facemask/ 'Hudson' mask",B

A 21-year-old lady with a history of hypersensitivity to neostigmine is posted for an elective caesarean section under general anesthesia. Which is the BEST muscle relaxant of choice in this patient ?,Pancuronium,Atracurium,Rocuronium,Vecuronium,"Atracurium is a sho acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Neostigmine is given for reversal of the action of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Since this patient has a history of hypersensitivity to neostigmine, atracurium can be used in this patient as it does not require reversal. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants acts by blocking the postsynaptic receptors in a competitive manner so that acetylcholine cannot occupy the receptors to activate depolarization. Neostigmine acts by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase in the cleft of neuromuscular junctions which inturn leads to building up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft thereby reversing the effects of non depolarizing muscle relaxants that are competitive agonists.

"A patient after giving inhalational anaestheia developed fulminant hepatitis, patient was exposed to same drug previously. Which is the drug",Halothane,N20,Enflurane,Isoflurane,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, It is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, and massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Which of the following is a controlled delivery device which is used to deliver a fixed concentration of oxygen?,Venturi mask,Nasal cannula,Nasal mask,Non breathing mask,Venturi mask is a type of HAFOEmask (High Air Flow Oxygen Enrichment Devices). It is used to deliver a controlled oxygen concentration to a patient. The patient breathes a fixed concentration of oxygen enriched air because the gas flow is greater than the peak inspiratory flow rate of the patient. Thus there is minimal dilution from atmospheric air. The high gas flow flushes expired gas from the mask preventing rebreathing. Nasal cannula isused when a low-flow of oxygen is indicated. These do not increase dead space. Inspiratory oxygen concentration depends on the flow rate. No rebreathing occurs. Non-rebreathing mask has a one way valve prevents the exhaled air from entering the reservoir bag. It provides the patient with enriched oxygen during inhalations. Nasal masks are effective interfaces for non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in most pediatric patients. It allows better removal of CO2.,A

Such nonspecific or ""lipoid-based"" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that ""All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient"".

Which of the following is the best induction agent: September 2009,Ketamine,Diazepam,Nitrous oxide,Thiopentone,"Ans. D: Thiopentone Thiopental is an ultra-sho-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anaesthesia Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anaesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness.",D

In clinical practice, in the operating room and ICV setting, such high concentrations are usually not reached, out the patient in question has been on atracurium for 3 consecutive days before he develops epilepsy and hence high plasma concentration of Laudanosine could well be a probable cause for epilepsy.# Use Of Muscle Relaxants In The Intensive Care Unit:> Canadian Journal Of Anaesthesia : Laudanosine is a metabolite of Atracurium. Hofmann elimination of each molecule of Atracurium releases two molecules of laudanosine. Laudanosine is a central system stimulant and has caused seizures in dogs following large intravenous boluses The seizure threshold level in humans is not known but case reports suggest that clinical doses are unlikely to result in important central effects in humans.

What is ideal time for Preoxygenation?,3-5 min,1- 3min,5-8 min,2-3 min,"Preoxygenation entails replacement of the nitrogen volume of the lung (as much as 95% of FRC) with oxygen in order to provide a reservoir for diffusion into the alveolar capillary blood after the onset of apnea. To provide effective preoxygenation, a methodical approach is necessary. The impoance of preoxygenation with a tight-fitting mask should be explained to the patient beforehand. Once preoxygenation is initiated, EtO2 and FIO2 values should be monitored closely. If the EtO2 value does not increase as expected, the anesthesia provider may have to hold the mask with both hands and/or replace the mask with a better-fitting one. Whenever possible, the induction should not sta until the EtO2 value approximates or exceeds 90%.. the ideal time period is 3 minutes.",A

Treatment of bupivacaine toxicity includes: (PGI May 2011),Isoprenaline,Calcium channel blockers,Bretylium,Metoprolol,"Ans: C (Bretylium) TREATMENT OF BUP1VACA1NE INDUCED CARDIOTOXIC1TY MILLER 6TH/933""Many resuscitation drugs, including atropine, epinephrine, bretylium, lidocaine, amrinone, and phenytoin, have been used in animal studies and occasionally in humans for the treatment of bupivacaine overdose and cardiovascular collapse. In our view, beyond the established uses of epinephrine, vasopressin, and atropine in their designated steps in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and beyond the use of Intralipid as detailed later, there is no established role for anti arrhythmic drugs or other traditional resuscitation drugs in the setting of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest It is not recommended that bupivacaine-induced ventricular arrhythmias be treated with iidocaine or amiodaroneThe clinical implications for cardiac resuscitation after intravascular injection or overdose of local anesthetic are the following: Miller 6th/933No medications are uniformly effective in facilitating resuscitation from bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest or severe ventricular tachycardia. Basic principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be emphasized first, including attention to securing the airway; providing oxygenation and ventilation, and performing chest compressions if needed.Because resuscitation after local anesthetic-induced circulatory collapse is so difficult, prevention of massive intravascular injection or excessive dosing is crucial.Negative aspiration of the syringe does not always exclude intravascular placement, incremental, fractionated dosing should be the rule for all patients undergoing major conduction blockade. Although changes on the ECG are not always present before circulatory collapse, they often are, and continuous attention to the ECG (including changes in QRS morphology, rate, rhythm, or ectopy) may be lifesaving by terminating injection before a lethal dose is administered.If a patient experiences profound cardiovascular depression or circulatory arrest after the administration of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or by extrapolation, other local anesthetics, then along with initiation of basic life support and theACLS protocol we support the recommendation of Weinberg and colleagues that a rapid bolus of Intralipid 20%<t\ 1.5 mL/kg (or roughly 100 mL in adults), be administered without delay, followed if necessary by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for the next 10 minutesTreatment of Bupivacaine Induced Cardiotoxicity Barash Anesthesia 6th/545""Potent local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine! can produce profound cardiovascular depression and malignant dysrhythmias that should be promptly treated. Oxygenation and ventilation must be immediately instituted, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed. Ventricular dysrhythmias may be difficult to treat and may need large and multiple doses of electrical cardioversion, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone. The use of calcium channel blockers in this setting is not recommended, as its cardiodepressant effect is exaggerated""A novel and promising treatment for cardiac toxicity is the administration of intravenous lipid to theoretically remove bupivacaine from sites of action. Administration of 100 mL of 20% lipid solution has been reported to allow successful resuscitation of a patient from bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias refractory to conventional therapy.These findings raise the question of whether standard propofol in a 10% lipid solution would be a preferred treatment for cardiac toxicity. However, the dose of lipid in a standard induction dose of propofol would be too small and the dose of propofol would lead to unacceptable cardiac depression",C

However, the total body clearance of propofol is greater than the generally accepted hepatic blood flow and significant extrahepatic metabolism also occur in lungs, and excreted via kidney. Metabolic clearance of propofol by the kidneys accounts for almost one-third of total body clearance and may be the major contributor to the extra-hepatic elimination of this drug.HalothaneoHalothane is an inhalational anesthetic. Most of the inhaled anesthetics are eliminated from lung, though some metabolism in liver may occur. In terms of extent of hepatic metabolism, the rank of order is methoxyflurane (>50%) > Halothane (20%)> Ether (10-15%)> enflurane (3-5%)> Sevoflurane (3%)> Isoflurane (0.2%)> desflurane (<0.1%)>N2 O(0%). N2 O does not have any metabolism in the body.oHalothane is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP2E1, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A4 and CYP2A6 LignocaineoLidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. Lignocaine clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease and appears to be a sensitive index of liver dysfunction.AtracuriumoThe unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous non-enzymatic degradation (Hoffman elimination) in addition to that by alkaline ester hydrolysis. Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation - Preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderlyoThe major degradation product is laudanosine. Metabolites can be considered as pharmacologically inactive with the usual doses of atracurium.

Hoffman's elimination is feature of,Pancuronium,Thiopentone,Vecuronium,Atracurium,"Ans. d (Atracurium) (Ref KDT 6th !345; Anaesthesia by Ajay yadav, 2nd ed., p. 90)The unique feature of atracurium is inactivation in plasma by spontaneous nonenzymatic degradation (Hofmann elimination) in addition to that by cholinesterases. Consequently its duration of action is not altered in patients with hepatic/renal insufficiency or hypodynamic circulation. It is the preferred muscle relaxant for such patients as well as for neonates and the elderly. Hypotension may occur due to histamine release.Cisatracurium, R-Cis, R-Cis enantiomer of atracurium is nearly 4 times more potent, slower in onset, but similar in duration of action.

The addition of epinephrine to lidocaine, procaine, or bupivacaine not only doubles the duration of infiltration anesthesia, but increases the maximal safe total dose by one-third (eg, 7 mg/kg for lidocaine with epinephrine) by decreasing the rate of absorption of drug into the bloodstream. However, epinephrinecontaining solutions should not be injected into tissues supplied by end aeries (eg, fingers, toes, ears, nose, penis). Hypersensitivity to local anesthetics is uncommon and occurs most prominently with anesthetics of the ester type (procaine, tetracaine). While small nerve fibers seem to be most susceptible to the action of local anesthetics, these agents act on any pa of the nervous system and on every type of nerve fiber.

(ie hyperkalemiaQ 1/t diastolic cardiac arrest), intraocular & intragastric pressure and temperature (l/t) malignant Hypehermia)Q - Depolarizing block (phase I & II) caused by Succinyl cholineQ is also called Dual or Biphasic Block. In contrast to phase II depolarization block & Non depolarizing block, phase I depolarization block does not exhibit fade during tetanus or train-of-four, neither does it demonstrate post tetanic potentiation. Phase I block is potentiated by isoflurane, Mg, Li & Anticholine-esterase while phase II block is potentiated by enflurane. - The onset of paralysis by succinylcholine is signaled by visible motor unit contractions called fasciculation.Q Patients who have received suxamethonium have an increased incidence of postoperative myalgiaQ. This is more common in healthy female outpatients. Pregnancy & extremes of age seem to be protective. Succinylcholine releases a metabolite succinylmonocholine, causing excitation of the cholinergic receptors in the sinoatrial node resulting in bradycardia. Q Intravenous atropine is given prophylactically (paicularly in children, who are more susceptible) in children and always before a second dose of sch. - Prolonged apnea after suxamethonium is best managed by providing mechanical ventilation, maintaining anesthesia and continuous monitoring until muscle function returns to normal.Q Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma is beneficial (as it provides pseudocholinesterase) its infectious risks outweigh its potential benefits -Morgan Administration of purified pseudocholinesterase, blood or plasma may antagonize the block. However because of the risk associated with their use, infusion of banked blood or fresh frozen plasma cannot be recommended - Churchill. - Succinylcholine & mivacurium are metabolized by pseudocholinesterase, while esmolol and remifentanyl are metabolized by RBC es terase.(2 - Pseudo cholinesterase deficiency causes prolonged residual paralysis at normal Sch dose (1-2 mg/kg)Q whereas, phase 2 non-depolarization blockade occurs after administration of higher doses >6 (7-10) mg/kgQ Despite large decrease in pseudo cholinesterase activity (level) there is only moderate increase in duration of action of Sch. In contrast to the doubling or tripling of blockade duration seen in patients with low pseudo cholinesterase enzyme levels or hetozygous atypical enzyme, patients with homozygous atypical enzyme will have a very blockade (4-8 hrs) following Sch administration.",B

Which of the following is least affected by anesthesia,Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER),Visual Evoked Response (VER),Somatosensory Evoked potential (SSEP),Electroencephalogram [EEG),"EVOKED POTENTIALS: The purpose of intraoperative evoked potentials is to monitor neural pathways in hopes of avoiding iatrogenic injury to the nervous system. Sensory evoked potentials (SEPs) evaluate the integrity of ascending sensory tracts while motor evoked potentials (MEPs) deal with the functionality of descending motor pathways. SENSORY EVOKED POTENTIALS Three SEP modalities are used clinically: somatosensory (SSEP), auditory (BAEP), and visual (VEP). The amplitude of these potentials is much smaller than that of the background EEG and must be extracted from the surrounding ""noise"" using signal averaging. The compromise of a neurologic pathway is evident with an increase in the latency and/or a decrease in the amplitude of EP waveforms. All anesthetics influence EP waveforms to some degree. EPs of coical origin (i.e. the coical poion of SSEPs and VEPs) are considered more prone to modification by anesthetics than brainstem potentials (i.e. BAEPs and subcoical poions of SSEPs). It is imperative to maintain constant anesthetic drug levels during the recording of EPs. Bolusing IV infusions or abrupt changes in MAC values of inhaled agents can be detrimental, paicularly during critical poions of a procedure. When recording coical EPs (SSEPs and VEPs) one should generally incorporate intravenous techniques as high concentrations of volatiles can eliminate coical EPs. Neveheless, all volatile anesthetics increase coical latency and decrease coical amplitude. However, desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be more forgiving with SSEPs than agents such as enflurane and isoflurane. For instance, desflurane at up to 1 MAC without nitrous oxide is compatible with coical median nerve SSEP monitoring during scoliosis surgery. The use of nitrous oxide should probably be avoided during EP monitoring as it exhibits profound depressant effects on SSEPs and VEPs when combined with a volatile agent. SSEPs: Pathway = Dorsal columns (UE)/lateral funiculus (LE). Electrical stimulation of mixed nerve, coical sho-latency waveforms measured. Decreased amplitude of 50% + 10% prolongation in latency is significant. Signal averaged. Volatiles = dose-dependent decrease in amplitude, increase in latency (< 1.0 MAC is ideal, not required) Brainstem potentials are quite resilient about anesthetics and are considered compatible with most anesthetic regimens. Regarding IV agents, studies on thiopental have shown that even with doses far over what is required to produce an isoelectric EEG, SSEP, and BAEP waveforms are preserved even if there is a predictable increase in latency and decrease in amplitude. Propofol increases latency and decreases the amplitude of coical EPs, but is considered an integral component of balanced intravenous neurosurgical anesthesia. Opioids produce minimal changes in SEP waveforms, even in high doses. Because of this, they are recommended for use as infusions during EP monitoring. Both clonidine and dexmedetomidine decrease anesthetic requirements and have minimal effects on coical EPs and are considered safe to use during monitoring. For practical purposes, ALL intravenous agents have a negligible effect on coical SSEP's, except for etomidate and ketamine, which can increase the amplitude. Propofol, in concentrations sufficient to induce burst suppression, will abolish later coical responses, but not the primary coical responses (N20/P22 for median nerve, P40/N45 for tibial nerve), which are used for monitoring. MOTOR EVOKED POTENTIALS: Transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor strip is a reliable method of producing intraoperative motor potentials that can be recorded from the spinal cord, peripheral nerve, or muscle. MEPs are exquisitely sensitive to anesthetics, especially inhalational agents. Volatiles, therefore, should be avoided during the recording of myogenic MEPs. Benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and propofol all depress MEPs, however, adequate recordings can be obtained during propofol anesthesia by controlling serum levels and increasing stimuli rates. Muscle relaxants can affect the recorded EMG response by depressing myoneural transmission. isHowever, adequate MEP recordings can be achieved as long as one or two twitches on TOF can be maintained.

Which anesthetic agent is associated with the highest level of carbon monoxide formation?,Halothane,Influrane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Desflurane undergoes degradation to carbon monoxide in the presence of strong bases in dry CO2 absorbents ( like desiccated soda lime). The propensity for CO production correlates with anesthetic concentration in the breathing circuit (Desflurane > Isoflurane > enflurane). Though Sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and halothane also degrade in the presence of strong bases, they do not produce CO. CO production is predominantly seen with absorbents that contain barium hydroxide and when the water content of soda lime or Baralyme falls below 1.4% and 5%. Amsorb is a CO2 absorbent which is more ine than soda lime and baralyme and so associated with lesser degradation of anesthetics and so less carbon monoxide production.",C
Which of the following intravenous anaesthetic agent is highly protein bound and highly lipid soluble?,Etomidate,Barbiturates,Propofol,Ketamine,"Propofol is available only for intravenous administration for the induction of general anesthesia and for moderate to deep sedation. The high lipid solubility of propofol results in a fast onset of action. Because of its reasonably sho elimination t1/2, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. Propofol is highly protein bound, and its pharmacokinetics may be affected by conditions that alter serum protein levels. The sedative and hypnotic actions of propofol are mediated by its action on GABAA receptors; agonism at these receptors results in an increased chloride conduction and hyperpolarization of neurons. Propofol is metabolized in the liver by conjugation to sulfate and glucuronide to less active metabolites that are renally excreted. Ref: Patel P.M., Patel H.H., Roth D.M. (2011). Chapter 19.

Emergence delirium is associated with,Pentothal sodium,Ketamine,Droperidol,Halothane,"Ketamine causes postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

The mainstay treatment for succinylcholine apnea due to atypical pseudocholinesterase is to continue mechanical ventilation until muscle function returns to normal by clinical signs. Administration of neostigmine is controversial as the effects may be transient, possibly followed by intensified neuromuscular blockade. Fresh frozen plasma can augment the patient's endogenous plasma pseudocholinesterase activity but is not recommended because of the risk of iatrogenic viral infectious complications. If human plasma cholinesterase is available, it can be given to reverse neuromuscular blockade. Hence, the best option here would be to continue mechanical ventilation.",C

Mechanism of action of curare is ?,Reducing end plate potential,Reducing presynaptic potential,Inhibits K+ channels,Inhibits Na+ channels,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle ? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na.* channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca"" from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca"" binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca"" pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca"" from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases : a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",A
Diffusion hypoxia is seen during -,Induction of anaesthesia,Recovering anaesthesia,Preoperatively,Postoperatively,"DIFFUSION HYPOXIA also known as FINK EFFECT OR THIRD GAS EFFECT At the end of general anesthesia, N2O is switched off so that inspired gas changes from N2O+O2 - N2+O2. As a result, N2O stas diffusing out of the blood into alveoli while N2 diffuses into blood. Due to the difference in solubilities of the two gases, N2O diffuses out more rapidly as it has high solubility. This diluted other gases present in alveoli and relative concentration of O2 falls. It is termed as diffusion hypoxia. Clinical Significance : 100% oxygen should be given for at least 5-10minutes after switching off N2O in order to overcome the relative fall of O2 concentration in the alveoli during Recovery from general anesthesia.",B

"A 20-year-old woman with a family history of von Willebrand disease is found to have an activated paial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 78 (normal = 32) on routine testing prior to cholecystectomy. Fuher investigation reveals a prothrombin time (PT) of 13 (normal = 12), a platelet count of 350,000/mm3 , and an abnormal bleeding time. Which of the following should be administered in the perioperative period?",Factor VIII,Platelets,Vitamin K,Desmopressin (DDAVP),"The patient's elevated aPTT, normal PT, and abnormal bleeding time are consistent with her von Willebrand disease (vWD). von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an impoant stimulus for platelet aggregation at the site of tissue injury and a major carrier protein for circulating factor VIII. There are three major groups of vWD. Type I, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, has decreased levels of vWF. Type II is variably inherited and has qualitative defects in vWF. Type III is an autosomal recessive severe bleeding disorder with absent levels of vWF. Patients with vWD present with mucosal bleeding, petechiae, epistaxis, and menorrhagia. vWD produces a depressed ristocetin cofactor assay (which measures the effectiveness of vWF in agglutinating platelets when stimulated with the antibiotic ristocetin). These patients do not generally require treatment unless they need surgery or are severely injured. DDAVP, a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, activates receptors that result in release of vWF from storage sites and causes shoening in the bleeding time in patients with type I vWD and some patients with type II vWD. vWF prevents inactivation of factor VIII; administration of DDAVP results in normalization of factor VIII activities. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate provides vWF, whereas infusions of high-purity concentrates of factor VIII:C are not effective because of the lack of vWF. Vitamin K is used perioperatively to reverse coagulopathy due to warfarin or liver disease and is not indicated in this scenario. Aminocaproic acid inhibits fibrinolysis and is not indicated for treating vWD.",D
During rapid induction of anesthesia ?,Sellick's maneuver is not required,Pre-oxygenation is mandatory,Suxamethonium is contraindicated,Patient is mechanically ventilated before endotracheal intubation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Pre-oxygenation is mandatory During rapid sequence induction preoxygenation is done for full 3 minutes. Sch is the muscle relaxant of choice for intubation. Sallieck's maneuver is done to prevent aspiration. Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Rapid sequence anaesthesia When anaesthesia is given for emergency surgery, it is called a ""rapid sequence anaesthesia"". The patients have full stomach because there is no starvation for anaesthesia (it is an emergency surgery) and gastric emptying is delayed due to trauma, acute abdomen. Therefore, the objective of rapid sequence anaesthesia is to secure the airway rapidly and prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Procedure of rapid sequence has following steps : - Li The patient is preoxygenatedfor full 3 minutes. Intravenous induction agent (thiopentone or propofol) is given. Sellick's maneuver (cricoid/pressure) is done to prevent aspiration. After ensuring the correct position of tube cricoid pressure is released and maintenance anaesthesia (NCO 66%, 02% 33%, & inhalational agent) is given. A non-depolarizing blocker is now added. Suxamethenium (succinylcholine) is given as it quickly relaxes the laryngeal muscles so that rapid intubation can be done. Not done during rapid sequence anaesthesia : ? Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Premedications are not given.",B

About CPAP all are true except:,Given prophylactically in all preterm with respiratory distress,Staed with Fi02 50 to 60 percent,Given in infants less than 28 weeks and less than 1 kg weight,Improves oxygenation and improves lung compliance,"B. i.e. Staed with Fi0250-60% (Nasal CPAP or intubation at bih for very preterm infants. The new England journal of medicine Feb 08 vol 358: 700 - 708 nuber 07) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with ventilation (intubation) & 02 treatment. Infants who were born at 25 -28 weeks gestation and were breathing spontaneously were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) sholy (at 5 minutes) after bih. 50% were subsequently intubated. Infants in CPAP group had a better outcome at 28th day than did those in intubated group (i.e. required significantly lower rate of 02 treatment and underwent fewer days of ventilation) even though the rate of pneumothorae was higher in CPAP group. A CPAP of 8 - 12 cm of water was used to maintain functional residual capacity and for improving lung compliance and oxygenation. The study suggests that staing respiratory suppo with CPAP does not adversely affect, infants even if upto 50% of them subsequently undergo ventilation (intubation), some because of pneumothorax. Ammar et al also showed that 76% of infants < 1.251 kg and 50% of those weighing < 0.751 kg did not need to undergo ventilation (intubation). Previous research suggest that CPAP (nasal) application in preterm infants is associated with benefits in terms of reduced respiratory failure and reduced duration and invasiveness of respiratory suppo; without worsening of other standard measures of neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia & death). Among spontaneously breathing very premature infants, surfactant therapy administered within 10 hour of life along with nasal CPAP decreases the oxygen requirement, need for mechanical ventilation and may prevent chronic lung disease.",B

Which of the following is not an exception to Meyer Oveon rule,Non anaesthetics,Non immobilizer,cut off effect,Hydrophobic site,"Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or ""lipoid-based"" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that ""All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

"In a case of road traffic accident, emergency nasotracheal intubation is done.

A 78-year-old man with a history of coronary aery disease and an asymptomatic reducible inguinal hernia requests an elective hernia repair. Which of the following would be a valid reason for delaying the proposed surgery?,Coronary aery bypass surgery 3 months earlier,A history of cigarette smoking,Jugular venous distension,Hypeension,"The work of Goldman and others has served to identify risk factors for perioperative myocardial infarction. The highest likelihood is associated with recent myocardial infarction: the more recent the event, the higher the risk up to 6 months. It should be noted, however, that the risk never returns to normal. A non-Q-wave infarction may not have destroyed much myocardium, but it leaves the surrounding area with borderline perfusion, thus the paicularly high risk of subsequent perioperative infarction. Evidence of congestive hea failure, such as jugular venous distention, or S3 gallop also carries a high risk, as does the frequent occurrence of ectopic beats. Old age (>70 years) and emergency surgery are risk factors independent of these others. Coronary revascularization by coronary aery bypass graft (CABG) tends to protect against myocardial infarction. Smoking, diabetes, hypeension, and hyperlipidemia (all of which predispose to coronary aery disease) are surprisingly not independent risk factors, although they may increase the death rate should an infarct occur. The value of this information and data derived from fuher testing is that it identifies the patient who needs to be monitored invasively with a systemic aerial catheter and pulmonary aerial catheter. Most perioperative infarcts occur postoperatively when the third-space fluids return to the circulation, which increases the preload and the myocardial oxygen consumption. This generally occurs around the third postoperative day.",C

Ketamine contraindicated in all except-,Head injury,Hypertension,Asthma,Glaucoma,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Asthma o Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol&etomidate, which have cerebroprotectiveeffect, therefore ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, intracranial space occupying lesions and for neuroanaesthesia.o Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the arterial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT.o Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant & vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and heart rate-Cardiac 02 demand is increased.o Ketamine is contraindicated in aortic aneurysm, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the heart to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur.o As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation, it is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia.o Ketamine increases intra-ocular tension - Contraindicated in glaucoma & open eye surgery,o It is a potent bronchodilator and relieves bronchospasm - Intravenous anesthetic agent of choice in asthmatic (inhalational anaesthetic agent of choice in asthmatics is halothane)o It increases uterine tone and intensity of uterine contraction - agent of choice in patients with obstetric haemorrhage and flaccid uterus.o Injection of ketamine is not painful (all other i.v. inducing agents cause pain on injection).",C

Most of the anaesthetic drugs are detectable by entropy monitoring except:,Isoflurane,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,Sevoflurane,"Entropy monitoringis a method of assessing the effect of ceain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now pa of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in electroencephalogram(EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8Hz to 32Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, hea rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings.",C

All are hepatotoxic except,Halothane,Chlorform,Methoxyflurane,Isoflurane,"Isoflurane is metabolized to trifluoroacetic acid. Although serum fluoride fluid levels may rise, nephrotoxicity is extremely unlikely, even in the presence of enzyme inducers. Prolonged sedation (>24 h at 0.1-0.6% isoflurane) of critically ill patients has resulted in elevated plasma fluoride levels (15-50 mmol/L) without evidence of kidney impairment. Similarly, up to 20 MAC-hours of isoflurane may lead to fluoride levels exceeding 50 mmol/L without detectable postoperative kidney dysfunction. Its limited oxidative metabolism also minimizes any possible risk of significant hepatic dysfunction. Total hepatic blood flow (hepatic aery and poal vein flow) may be reduced during isoflurane anesthesia. Hepatic oxygen supply is better-maintained with isoflurane than with halothane, however, because hepatic aery perfusion is preserved. Liver function tests are usually not affected. The major effect of acute inhalation of chloroform is central nervous system depression. At concentrations from 1,500-30,000 ppm, chloroform exposure can induce anesthesia; at concentrations exceeding 40,000 ppm, it can be fatal. Chronic inhalation of chloroform in humans results in hepatotoxicity and central nervous symptoms such as depression and irritability. Meanwhile, chronic oral exposure to chloroform in humans results in effects on the blood, livers, and kidneys.

In porphyria all the following drugs are safe Except,Propofol,Midazolam,Alfentanyl,Pentazocine,"There are at least five different classes of precipitating factors in Acute intermittent porphyria: ALAS-N inducers: most precipitating factors can be related to an associated increase in the activity of ALAS-N in the liver. An overproduction of ALA then makes the paially deficient PBGD activity rate limiting. Endocrine factors: the clinical disease is more common in women, especially at the time of menses. The disease also hardly becomes manifest before pubey. Calorie intake: reduced calorie intake often leads to exacerbations of AIP. Additional calories on a diet may reduce PBG excretion and suppress clinical symptoms. Drugs and foreign chemicals: barbiturates, sex steroids, and other foreign chemicals that exacerbate porphyria have the potential to induce cytochrome P450. The resultant enhanced demand for heme synthesis may lead to induction of hepatic ALAS-N. Stress: stress is known to upregulate the heme oxygenase gene and leads to exacerbations of AIP. Similarly, other forms of stress, including intercurrent illnesses, infections, alcoholic excess, and surgery, are all known to contribute to the genesis of an acute attack of this disorder.",D

Anesthetic agent which is explosive in the presence of cautery,Nitrous Oxide,Ether,Trilene,Halothane,"Ether (Diethyl ether) It is a highly volatile liquid, produces irritating vapors which are inflammable and explosive. (C2H5 -- O -- C2H5) Ether is a potent anesthetic, produces good analgesia and marked muscle relaxation by reducing ACh output from motor nerve endings. The dose of competitive neuromuscular blockers should be reduced to about 1/3. It is highly soluble in blood. Induction is prolonged and unpleasant with struggling, breath-holding, salivation and marked respiratory secretions (atropine must be given as premedication to prevent the patient from drowning in his own secretions). Recovery is slow; postanaesthetic nausea, vomiting, and retching are marked. Respiration and BP are generally well maintained because of reflex stimulation and a high sympathetic tone. It does not sensitize the hea to Adrenaline and is not hepatotoxic. Ether is not used now in developed countries because of its unpleasant and inflammable propeies. However, it is still used in developing countries, paicularly in peripheral areas because it is--cheap, can be given by open drop method (though congestion of eye, soreness of trachea and ether burns on face can occur) without the need for any equipment, and is relatively safe even in inexperienced hands.

True about mechanical ventilation in ARDS is all except,Pressure control modes are preferred over volume control,Low tidal volumes and high respiratory rate is preferred,Paralysis can be helpful in severe ARDS,Inverse ratio ventilation is always considered,"VENTILATORY STRATEGIES in ARDS Low-Tidal-Volume Ventilation The cornerstone of ARDS management is a strategy of low-tidal-volume ventilation pioneered by the ARDSnet trial in 2000. This involves the following:  Tidal volume 6 ml/kg based on ideal body weight  Plateau pressure , 30 cm H2O  Permissive hypercapnoea tolerated as long as pH . 7.2 The lower tidal volumes were strongly associated with a decrease in moality and an increase in ventilator-free days. This was thought to be as a result of reducing excessive distension or stretch of the aerated lung, which could be associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines that could contribute to lung (volutrauma) and other organ injury. Positive End-Expiratory Pressure PEEP prevents alveolar derecruitment, minimising atelectrauma. It increases functional residual capacity, displaces fluid from the alveoli into the interstitium, and moves the lung to the steeper pa of the compliance curve. However, this has to be balanced against potential hyperinflation and decreased venous return, and thus cardiac output.PEEP is patient-specific and determining the ''optimal'' PEEP for each patient is challenging. A number of different strategies (none of which have proven superiority) have been suggested to set PEEP:  Use of PEEP/FiO2 tables  Titrating based on plateau pressure  Stepwise increase until maximal compliance  Recruitment manoeuvre followed by decremental titration  Based upon the inflection point of the pressure/volume curve Guidelines recommend use of high PEEP (defined variably, but on average 15 cm H2O) on patients with moderate and severe ARDS, in whom a moality benefit was demonstrated in clinical trials. Prone-Position VentilationAlthough this has long been known to improve oxygenation, evidence of moality benefit has been lacking until recently. There are a number of postulated physiological benefits: improved recruitment of atelectatic dorsal lung tissue leading to its increased compliance of lungs (total compliance may actually decrease), more even distribution of tidal volume, and improved V/Q (V 1/4 pulmonary ventilation; Q 1/4 pulmonary perfusion) matching. Prone ventilation also decreases alveolar hyperinflation, reduces cardiac compression of the underlying lung, and improves drainage of secretions.

All true about pressure control ventilation except-,The desired inflation pressure is preselected,There is accelerating flow rate,Tidal volume can be variable,Alveolar pressure is fixed,"With pressure control ventilation (PCV), the desired inflation pressure is preselected, and a decelerating inspiratory flow rate provides high flows at the onset of the lung inflation, to attain the desired inflation pressure quickly. Pressure control modes of ventilation In a pressure controlled mode of ventilation, the inspiratory pressure is the control variable, and is maintained during the inspiratory phase. As a result of this, the pressure waveform is ""square"". This increases the mean airway pressure (i.e. the area under the pressure/time graph is greater). During the early inspiratory phase, the ventilator provides a high inspiratory flow rate to rapidly achieve the pressure limit variable (""PC above PEEP"" on a SERVO-i). In order to maintain this pressure, the flow rate needs to decrease over the course of inspiration, and it generally takes the shape of a downsloping ramp.

A housewife presented with acute paronychia since two days. The BEST anaesthetic agent for acute paronychia is:,1% xylocaine,2% xylocaine,Ketamine,Xylocaine + adrenaline,"The addition of epinephrine along with anaesthetic agent causes vasoconstriction at the site of administration. The consequent decreased absorption increases neuronal uptake, enhances the quality of analgesia, prolongs the duration of action, and limits toxic side effects. The effects of vasoconstrictors are more pronounced with shoer-acting agents. For example, the addition of epinephrine to lidocaine usually extends the duration of anesthesia by at least 50%.

Pulse oximeter is used for monitoring,Oxygen content of the blood,Oxygen saturation,Partial pressure of oxygen,All of the above,"Ans. b (Oxygen saturation). (Ref. Anaesthesia by Ajay yadav, 2nd ed., 47)PULSE OXIMETER# Pulse oximeters give non-invasive estimation of the arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation.# Useful in:- anaesthesia,- recovery,- intensive care (including neonatal),- patient transport.# 2 principles involved:- Differential light absorption by haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin.- Identification of pulsatile component of signal.# No direct indication of a patient's ventilation, only of their oxygenation.# Lag monitor Time delay between potentially hypoxic event such as respiratory obstruction and a pulse oximeter detecting low oxygen saturation.# Inaccuracies: ambient light; shivering and vasoconstriction; abnormal haemoglobins; and alterations in pulse rate and rhythm.# Advances in microprocessor have led to improved signal processing.Uses of pulse oximetry1. Simple, portable ""all-in-one"" monitor of oxygenation, pulse rate and rhythm regularity, suitable for ""field"" use.2. As a safe, non-invasive monitor of the cardio-respiratory status of high-dependency patients - in the emergency department, during general and regional anaesthesia, postoperatively and in intensive care. This includes procedures such as endoscopy, where often frail patients are given sedative drugs such as midazolam. Pulse oximeters detect the presence of cyanosis more reliably than even the best doctors when using their clinical judgement.3. During the transport of patients - especially when this is noisy - for example in aircraft, helicopters or ambulances. The audible tone and alarms may not be heard, but if a waveform can be seen together with an acceptable oxygen saturation, this gives a global indication of a patient's cardio-respiratory status.4. To assess the viability of limbs after plastic and orthopaedic surgery and, for example, following vascular grafting, or where there is soft tissue swelling or aortic dissection. As a pulse oximeter requires a pulsatile signal under the sensor, it can detect whether a limb is getting a blood supply.5. As a means of reducing the frequency of blood gas analysis in intensive care patients- especially in paediatric practice where vascular (arterial) access may be more difficult.6. To limit oxygen toxicity in premature neonates' supplemental oxygen can be tapered to maintain an oxygen saturation of 90% Thus avoiding the damage to the lungs and retinas of neonates. Although pulse oximeters are calibrated for adult haemoglobin, HbA, the absorption spectra of HbA and HbF are almost identical over the range used in pulse oximetry, so the technique remains reliable in neonates.7. During thoracic anaesthesia - when one lung is being collapsed down To determine whether oxygenation via the remaining lung is adequate or whether increased concentrations of oxygen must be given.8. Fetal oximetry- a developing technique that uses reflectance oximetry, using LEDs of 735nm and 900nm. The probe is placed over the temple or cheek of the fetus, and needs to be sterile and sterilisable. They are difficult to secure and the readings are variable, for physiological and technical reasons. Hence the trend is more useful than the absolute value.",B

A 40 year old dental assistant presents with increased weakness and fatigue. Lab tests reveal megaloblastic anemia. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the presence of anemia?,Propofol,Nitrous oxide,Lignocaine,Halothane,"Answer: b) Nitrous oxideNITROUS OXIDE (laughing gas)Has second gas effect during induction & diffusion hypoxia after discontinuation of anesthesia in recovery phase.As N2O is used in high concentration (70-80%) it leads to entry of N2O in blood at a rate higher than minute (1 lit/min) volume.N2O has low blood solubility. So it rapidly diffuse into alveoli & dilutes the alveolar air-Partial Pressure of O2 in alveoli is reduced i.e. diffusion hypoxiaDiffusion hypoxia is prevented by administering 100% oxygen for 5-10 min after discontinuing N2OPoynting effect: Entonox (50% O2 & 50% N2O) & mixture of gases (O2 & N2O) keeps them in gaseous form.If another potent anesthetic eg. Halothane is added, it also will be delivered to the blood at a rate higher than minute volume & the induction will be faster.N2O is a good analgesic but weak anaesthetic and poor muscle relaxant. Hence it is not a complete anaesthetic.N2O has blood gas coefficient of 0.47 and has fast inductionIt has MAC value of 104; Hence Potency is lowN2O is used as a carrier gas given in a mixture of 33% O2 and 66% N2OContraindications for N2O:Middle ear surgeries and tympanoplastyLaparoscopic surgeriesAcute intestinal obstruction and volvulusMicrolaryngeal surgeriesPneumothorax, pneumoperitoniumEye surgeriesPneumoencephalos.It should be avoided in patients with pulmonary hypertensionAdverse effects: bone marrow depression (agranulocytosis, megaloblastic anemia) and even neurological deficiencies (peripheral neuropathies and pernicious anemia).NOTE:Nitrous oxide is one of the most common anesthetics used in dental procedures. Prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide results in the development of megaloblastic anemia.Mechanism: Nitrous oxide oxidizes the cobalt in methylcobalamin to produce physiologically inactive B12.The resultant deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia.

Exception of Meyer-Oveon rule are all except,Non anaesthetics,Non immobilizer,Cut off effect,Hydrophobic site of action,"Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or ""lipoid-based"" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that ""All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anaesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

One caveat of administering large volumes of normal saline is that a non-anion-gap metabolic acidosis can result from increased chloride concentrations. Hypotonic saline solutions such as 0.45% normal saline should not be used for acute resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock but are appropriate for postoperative fluid maintenance in the hemodynamically stable patient.

Which of the following induction agent may cause adrenal coex suppression?,Propofol,Ketamine,Etomidate,Thiopentione,"Etomidate is an induction anaesthetic which cause suppression of production of steroids from adrenals. It is therefore not suitable for continuous intravenous use. It has brief duration of action (5-10min) and produce little cardiovascular and respiratory depression. It produce prominent motor restlessness and rigidity. Use of etomidate should be restricted to clinical situations in which its hemodynamic stability offers a distinctive advantage over the other available induction drugs (e.g. elderly outpatients with clinically significant coronary aery or cerebrovascular disease).

Pulsatile proptosis is a feature of ?,Orbital varix,Retinoblastoma,Coico-cavernous fistula,Covernous sinus thrombosis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Coico-cavernous fistula Proptosis Proptosis is bulging of the eyeball (forward bulging) beyond the orbital margins. Though the word exophthalmos is synonymous with proptosis; some source define xophthalmos as a protrusion of globe greater than 18mm and proptosis as a protrusion equal to or less than 18 mm. Proptosis may be classified as follows : ? Unilateral Proptosis Proptosis of one eye. Inflammatory lesions :- Orbital cellulitis, abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, etc. Vascular disturbances :- Haemorrhage, varicose orbital veins, haemangioma, etc. Cysts and tumour :- Dermoid cyst, osteoma, lymphoma, lymphosarcoma, glioma, meningioma of optic nerve, retinoblastoma and metastatic deposits in orbit Neuroblastoma, breast, prostate, lung, GIT, Kidney, Ewing's tumor, melanoma, wilms tumor (Nephroblastoma)]. Systemic diseases - Leukemias and endocrine disturbances such as Graves' disease and thyrotropic exophthalmos in initial stages. Paralysis of extraocular muscles as in complete ophthalmoplegia. Mucocele of PNS' - Frontal (most common), ethmoid, maxillary. Bilateral Proptosis Proptosis of both eyes. evelopmental anomalies of the skull- Oxycephaly (tower skull). Endocrine exophthalmos, both thyrotoxic and thyrotropic. Inflammatory lesions - Cavernous sinus thrombosis. Tumours - lymphosarcoma, lymphoma, pseudotumour, nephroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma. Systemic disease - Histocytosis (Hand - schuller christon disease), amyloidosis, wegner's granulomatosis. Intermittent proptosis Proptosis developing intermittently and rapidly in one eye when venous stasis is induced by forward bending or lowering the head, turning the head forcibly, hyperextension of the neck, coughing, forced expiration with or without compression of the nostrils, or pressure on jugular veins. The most impoant casue is orbital varix (varicocele).

Patient with mitral stenosis is having surgery tomorrow. There is some liver compromise. Which of the following inhalational agent is preferred,Halothane,Enflurane,Xenon,Sevoflurane,"Xenon [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 781, 166, 167; Miller's Anaesthesia p 626, 6491 Xenon seems to be the best answer because all other inhalational anaesthetics mentioned in the question produce some cardiovascular effects that may harm the patient with mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the hea rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M.S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. ""Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity"". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an ""ideal"" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",C

Pain during injection occurs all except,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,Etomidate,"Induction of anesthesia with propofol is often associated with pain on injection, apnea, hypotension, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the vein into which propofol is injected.Pain on injection is reduced by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, and adding lidocaine to the propofol solution or changing the propofol formulation. Multiple other drugs and distraction techniques have been investigated to reduce the pain on injection of propofol. Pretreatment with a small dose of propofol, opiates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ketamine, esmolol or metoprolol, magnesium, a flash of light, a clonidine-ephedrine combination, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide all have been tested with variable efficacy. Ketamine has been administered by the IV, intramuscular (IM), transcutaneous, oral, nasal, and rectal routes and as a preservative-free solution epidurally or intrathecally. Most clinical use involves the IV and IM routes, by which the drug rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations. The dose depends on the desired therapeutic effect and on the route of administration. There is no pain on injection. Although etomidate provides stable hemodynamics and minimal respiratory depression, it is associated with several adverse effects when it is used for induction, including nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, myoclonic movement, and hiccups. Etomidate has been associated with PONV. More recently, etomidate in a lipid emulsion was associated with equal or an increased incidence of postoperative nausea compared with propofol. The lipid formulation of etomidate is associated with a much less frequent incidence of pain on injection, thrombophlebitis, and histamine release. Pain on injection may be reduced by injecting IV lidocaine, 20 to 40 mg immediately before injection of etomidate. Ref: Millers anesthesia 8th edition",C

Percentage of Halothane metabolized -,50%,5%,2.50%,25%,"The extent and location of inhaled anesthetic metabolism depends on multiple chemical factors. Inhaled anesthetics undergo varying degrees of biotransformation in various tissues. Methoxyflurane undergoes by far the greatest metabolism, estimated at 70%, and experiments indicate that only a small fraction of drug taken up into body tissues is exhaled. Given the remarkable lipophilicity of methoxyflurane, respiratory clearance of this drug from muscle and fat extends over a period of days. Halothane is the next most lipophilic drug and ranks second in metabolic clearance. Thus, prolonged residence in body tissues is an impoant factor in the biotransformation of inhaled anesthetics. Chemical stability is another impoant factor. Of the major organs involved in anesthetic biotransformation, the liver and kidneys are exposed to the highest metabolite concentrations and thus are most susceptible to damage from toxic metabolites. Clinically significant hepatotoxicity is primarily associated with exposure to halothane, and nephrotoxicity is associated with methoxyflurane. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition",D

It may be administered before surgery as a premedicant to relieve apprehension and impair memory, for induction of anaesthesia (although in comparison with barbiturates its use is associated with a slower onset of action and a more prolonged recovery time), and for conscious sedation. Midazolam may be administered by mouth,parenterally, or the intranasal or endorectal route in children; preservative free intrathecal midazolam has been used for postoperative analgesia in caesarean section delivery. It has been postulated that a possible mechanism for the anti-emetic effect of miazolam could be an action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone reducing synthesis, release and postsynaptic effect of dopamine. Whether midazolam reduce dopamine release centrally, or by blocking the re-uptake of adenosine, causing anadenosine-mediated reduction of dopamine release, has been matter of debate.",C

Spontaneous CSF leak occurs in all except aEUR',Increased intracranial tension,Paial or complete empty sella syndrome,Pseudotumour cerebri,Low risk encephalocoele,"Increased intracranial tension ???? We are not sure of the answer.We have gone for increased intracranial tension because spontaneous C.S.F. leak is associated with intracranial hypotension. Increased intracranial tension is not associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak. All other options mentioned in the question are associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak. Pseudotumor Cerebri Pseudotumour cerebri usually presents with triad of headache, papilledema and minimal or absent focal neurological signs, but rarely, the presenting feature may be a nasal C.S.F. leak. Empty sella syndrome In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica (the bony structure which contains pituitary enlarges). In this disease there is a defect in tissue barrier that normally keeps the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain separate from the sella turcica. As a result cerebrospinal fluid puts increased pressure on the pituitary glands and the walls of the sella turcica. The sella turcica enlarges and the pituitary shrinks. The empty sella syndrome may produce no symptoms at all and seldom produces serious symptom. About half of those affected have headaches. In rare cases there is leaking of the cerebrospinal fluid from the nose. Encephathcele Encephalocele may present with C.S.F. leak. More on spontaneous C.S.F. leak or spontaneous intracranial hypotension Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a condition where patient gets postural headache due to leak of the crebrospinal fluid in the spinal membrane. What happens is that the leak causes low C.S.F. pressure within the nervous system and thus causes a string of headache to the patient. The problem with SIH is that it is hard to diagnose and there is not a great deal of information on why it occurs. It has been associated with connective tissue diseases which may involve the dura causing tear in it. To summarize it, spontaneous C.S.F. leak is very rare and unlike other causes it does not occur due to any specific traumatic event or surgical procedure in the nervous system. Although there is not much information on the possible causes of C.S.F. leak, it is suspected that an intrinsic weakness of the spinal membrane or an abnormality of the brain structure causes the rare condition. The symptoms of 51H are so small and so common that it can often be misdiagnosed.",A

The left internal spermatic vein is longer than the right; in addition, it usually joins the left renal vein at right angles. The right internal spermatic vein has a more oblique insertion into the inferior vena cava. This particular anatomy in the standing man may cause higher venous pressures to be transmitted to the left scrotal veins and result in retrograde reflux of blood into the pampiniform plexus.Clinical pictureAge - young adultTall thin men are frequently affected* *Bag of worms* like feel on palpationThe veins empty in supine position (so examination is always done in standing position)* Infertility : The varicocele is the most common cause of male infertility worldwide. In approximately 70% of patients with secondary infertility, a varicocele is an underlying cause. ""The World Health Organization concluded that varicoceles are clearly associated with impairment of testicular function and infertility. "" Varicocele may be secondary to renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney. The growth from renal cell carcinoma blocks the renal vein by venous permeation.

Most common malignant lesion of the eyelid is,Squamous cell carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma,Malignant melanoma,Adenocarcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma This is usually a slow-growing, locally-invasive, malignant tumour of pluripotential epithelial cells arising from basal epidermis and hair follicles; hence, it affects the pilo-sebaceous skin. EPIDEMIOLOGY The strongest predisposing factor to BCC is UVR. It occurs in the elderly or the middle-aged after excessive sun exposure, with 95% occurring between the ages of 40 and 80 years. The incidence of BCC rises with proximity to the equator, although 33% arise in pas of the body not usually sunexposed. Other predisposing factors include exposure to arsenical compounds, coal tar, aromatic hydrocarbons, ionising radiation and genetic skin cancer syndromes. White- skinned people are almost exclusively affected. BCC is more common in men than women. PATHOGENESIS BCCs have no apparent precursor lesions and their development is propoional to the initial dose of the carcinogen, but not duration of exposure. The most likely model of pathogenesis for BCCs involves mesodermal factors as intrinsic promoters coupled with an initiation step. BCCs metastasise extremely rarely. MACROSCOPIC BCC can be divided into localised (nodular; nodulocystic; cystic; pigmented and naevoid) and generalised (superficial: multifocal and superficial spreading; or infiltrative: morphoeic, ice pick and cicatrizing). Nodular and nodulocystic variants account for 90% of BCC. MICROSCOPIC Twenty-six histological subtypes have been described. The characteristic finding is of ovoid cells in nests with a single 'palisading' layer. It is only the outer layer of cells that actively divide, explaining why tumour growth rates are slower thantheir cell cycle speed would suggest, and why incompletely excised lesions are more aggressive. Morphoeic BCCs synthesize type 4 collagenase and so spread rapidly Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 604",B

Keloids tend to occur 3 months to years after the initial insult, and even minor injuries can result in large lesions. They vary in size from a few millimeters to large, pedunculated lesions with a soft to rubbery or hard consistency. Although they project above surrounding skin, they rarely extend into underlying subcutaneous tissues. Ceain body sites have a higher incidence of keloid formation, including the skin of the earlobe as well as the deltoid, presternal, and upper back regions. They rarely occur on eyelids, genitalia, palms, soles, or across joints. Keloids rarely involute spontaneously, whereas surgical intervention can lead to recurrence, often with a worse result.

"A 70 year old man comes to clinical attention with progressive memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait instability. MRI of the brain shows dilatation of the ventricular cavities, while the cerebral coex appears normal. No infarcts are seen. Repeated lumbar punctures reveal occasional increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. A biopsy of the frontal coex demonstrates the absence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as tacrine,Aspirin,L-DOPA,Ventricular shunt,"This is an ""interdisciplinary"" question, which begins with a clinical scenario and ends by testing your knowledge of pathophysiology and pharmacology. The clinical presentation has the classic triad of memory loss, urinary incontinence, and gait abnormalities characteristic of normal pressure hydrocephalus (recently renamed intermittently raised pressure hydrocephalus). This condition results from intermittent increases in CSF pressure, leading to progressive damage to cerebral white matter and dilatation of the ventricles. No significant coical atrophy is present. The lack of Alzheimer-related changes in the biopsy and the measurements of CSF pressure suppo the diagnosis. Relief of CSF pressure can be obtained by placing a ventricular shunt, which usually improves clinical symptomatology. Tacrine and other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase are used in the symptomatic therapy of Alzheimer disease. The pathology of this disease includes degeneration of cerebral cholinergic systems, such as the basal nucleus of Meyne, which project to the neocoex and are involved in memory and learning. Acetylcholinesterase degrades acetylcholine after release from presynaptic boutons. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors therefore enhance the concentration of acetylcholine and amplify cholinergic neurotransmission. Aspirin is used to prevent aggregation and adhesion of platelets in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease. Prophylactic aspirin treatment lowers the incidence of transient ischemic attacks and brain infarcts. L-DOPA is a precursor of dopamine, the neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal neurons that degenerate in Parkinson disease. L-DOPA, especially in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor, is therefore used in the treatment of this disorder. Ref: Ropper A.E., Ropper A.H. (2012). Chapter 209.

They are generally divided into two types: (1) simple or capillary lymphangioma and (2) cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma. They are thought to represent isolated and sequestered segments of the lymphatic system that retain the ability to produce lymph. As the volume of lymph inside the cystic tumor increases, they grow larger within the surrounding tissues. Most of these benign tumors are present at bih, and 90% of them can be identified by the end of the first year of life. The cavernous lymphangioma almost invariably occur in the neck or the axilla and rarely in the retroperitoneum. The simple capillary lymphangioma also tend to occur subcutaneously in the head and neck region as well as the axilla. Rarely, however, they can be found in the trunk within the internal organs or the connective tissue in and around the abdominal or thoracic cavities. The treatment of lymphangioma is surgical excision, taking care to preserve all normal surrounding infiltrated structures. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare tumor that develops as a complication of long-standing (usually more than 10 years) lymphedema. Clinically, patients present with acute worsening of the edema and appearance of subcutaneous nodules that have a propensity toward hemorrhage and ulceration. The tumor can be treated, as other sarcomas, with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical excision, which usually takes the form of radical amputation. Overall, the tumor has a poor prognosis",C

The tear is paial thickness, extends through the mucosa and submucosa, but not through the muscular layer. The clinical picture consists of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding following bout of retching. The mean age of the patient is 60 years and 80% of them are males. Majority of patients are alcoholics. Other frequent associations with mallory weiss tear are hiatal hernia, NSAIDS abuse and disease related bleeding diathesis. Management: In majority of patients (90%) bleeding stops spontaneously and only suppoive therapy is required. Persistent bleeding is managed by endoscopic electrocoagulation if it fails angiographic techniques are used and if it fails surgery (laparotomy with high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear) is done. Also know: Boerhaave's syndrome: In this syndrome tear is full thickness penetrating completely through all the layers of esophageal wall with spillage of contents into the mediastinum.

A# Psoas abscessAn abscess in the psoas muscle of the abdomen may be caused by lumbar tuberculosis. Owing to the proximal attachments of the iliopsoas, such an abscess may drain inferiorly into the upper medial thigh and present as a swelling in the region. The sheath of the muscle arises from the lumbar vertebrae and the intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. The disc is more susceptible to infection, from tuberculosis and Salmonella discitis. Ihe infection can spread into the psoas muscle sheath.Treatment may involve drainage and antibiotics",A

A 75-year-old man is found by his internist to have an asymptomatic carotid bruit. The best initial diagnostic examination would be,Transcranial Doppler studies,Doppler ultrasonography (duplex),Spiral CT angiography,Arch aortogram with selective carotid artery injections,"Doppler ultrasonography (duplex) has become the best initial test for screening patients with carotid disease. It has become a highly accurate test, often obviating the need for carotid arteriography prior to carotid endarterectomy. Carotid arteriography remains the ""gold standard"" when quantifying the degree of carotid stenosis, but it is usually performed after noninvasive testing suggests significant stenosis. Spiral CT angiography is a new noninvasive modality that has been used to evaluate many segments of the vascular tree, but as yet its accuracy does not approach that of standard arteriography and it would certainly not be used in the initial evaluation of a patient with an asymptomatic bruit. Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) is also a relatively new modality that has enjoyed moderate success in the investigation of carotid disease. Although not quite as accurate as standard arteriography, it has been used in conjunction with the duplex as a complementary study. Once again, because of its cost, MRA would not be used as the primary screening modality. Transcranial Doppler studies are used to assess the intracranial vasculature.",B

Dumping syndrome is associated with-,Reduction of part of stomach,Decreased gastric secretion,Hyperglycemia,Decreased absorption,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reduction of part of stomach Dumping syndrome -o Symptom complex that occurs following ingestion of a meel wrhen part of stomach has been removed or the pyloric sphincter mechanism has been disrupted.o Dumping syndrome refers to a constellation of post-prandial symptoms occuring due to accelerated emptying (dumping) of hyperosmolar stomach contents into the small bowel.o It is usually seen in operation which destroy the pyloric sphincter (i.e. gastrectomy, antrectomy and drainage procedures). It also affects a small percentage of patients with highly selective vagotomy due to loss of receptive relaxation of stomach.o It is of 2 typesEarly dumping syndromeIt occurs immediately after meals (after about 15 to 30 min)Dumping of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel results in rapid fluid influx from the circulation into the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to acute intestinal distention and peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation.This gives rise to vasomotor & abdominal symptoms : epigastric fullness, sweating, light headedness, tachycardia, diarrhoea.Symptoms can be ameliorated by lying down or saline infusion.Late dumping syndromeIt is seen late - 2 to 3 hrs after mealOccurs due to reactive hypoglycemia. The carbohyrate load in the small bowrel causes a rise in plasma glucose, which in turn, causes high insulin levels. Hyperinsulinemia leads to hypoglycemia.Symptoms are relieved by administration of sugar,o ManagementDietary managmentDiet therapy is done to reduce jejunal osmolalityMultiple small mealsFood low in carbohydrate and rich in fat and protein are taken.Liquids during meals should be avoided.Somatostatin analogues (octreotide)Diet therapy is usually successful but if it fails, the patient is started on octreotide.SurgeryMost of the patients improve with time, dietary management and Octreotide. Only rarely surgery is needed,Surgical procedures used to treat dumping arePyloric reconstruction, takedown of gastrojejunostomy, interposition of a 10 cm reversed intestinal segment between the stomach & duodenum, conversion of Billroth II to Billroth I anastomosis, and conversion to Roux-en-Y-anastomosis.",A

"A 33-years-old woman presents to accident and emergency with severe right flank plain. The pain staed 3 hours ago and is not constant, occasionally moving towards her right iliac fossa. The patient also feels nauseous and has a low-grade fever. The most appropriate investigation is:",Abdominal x-ray,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan,Intravenous urography,Abdominal ultrasound (US) scan,"This patent has a suspected renal stone, the most useful investigation would be an abdominal ultrasound scan (D) specifically of the kidneys, ureters and bladder (KUB). The differential diagnosis should include other causes of abdominal pain, such as acute appendicitis. The most common stone consists of calcium oxalate and up to 80 per cent of renal stones are visible on ultrasound. The KUB US scan is poor at differentiating different stones and can often miss smaller stones. Intravenous urography (IVU) (C) is more useful for detecting obstructions in the renal tract and US scans should always be done before IVU as smaller stones often become nonvisible. IVU scans as it is able to differentialte upto 99 percent of renal stones and it is also useful for exploring other causes of an acute abdomen. However, the radiation risk to the patient makes this investigation much more invasive and is not as readily available as an US scan. An MRI scan (B) has only a few advantages over a CT scan, these include the ability to assess renal aeries and there is no risk form radiation. However, MRI has poor differentiation ability and stones can often appear similar to tumours of blood clots. Where it is paicularly impoant to avoid radiation x-ray (A) is reasonable in detecting renal stones (up to 80 per cent) since the majority consist of calcium which shows up well on radiograph films, however, there is again a radiation risk to the patient which is avoidable in USG scans.",D
"About Diaphragmatic injury, true statement is -",T/t is conservative,Resolves spontaneously,Left side is more common,Associated with pneumothorax,"Diaphragmatic rupture is more common on the left side.
Cause -
The right diaphragm is protected by two mechanisms:
The liver on the right and the heart in the centre have a buffering effect that diffuses the sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure.
Diaphragmatic Injuries
Diaphragmatic injuries are often caused by penetrating injuries. Patients sustaining penetrating injuries below the nipples and above the costal margins should be investigated to rule out diaphragmatic injury. Blunt injury to the diaphragm is usually caused by a compressive force applied to the pelvis and abdomen. the diaphragmatic rupture is usually large, with herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest. Herniation occurs as a result of the pressure differential between the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Most diaphragmatic injuries are silent and the presenting features are those of injury to the surrounding organs. The most accurate investigation is by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or laparoscopy. Operative repair is recommended in all cases. All penetrating diaphragmatic injury must be repaired via the abdomen and not the chest, to rule out penetrating hollow viscus injury.",C

Syndrome of internal iliac aery occlusion manifested by,Pain in calf,Absent pulse at the dorsalis pedis aery,Intermittent claudication,Gangrene,"Aerial pulses It is standard practice to examine the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis aeries together with the abdomen for an aoic aneurysm or renal aery bruit, which may coexist with lower limb occlusive disease. Diminution of a femoral and/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.

DNA sequencing by the Sanger method takes advantage of which propey of DNA synthesis to generate a sequencing ladder?,Addition of nucleotides requires a free OH group on the 3' end of the DNA strand,DNA has a free 5' phosphoryl group,DNA polymerase has proofreading capabilities,Nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds,"Addition of nucleotides requires a free OH group on the 3' end of the DNA strand The Sanger method of DNA sequencing is also known as chain termination sequencing. In this method, DNA strands are synthesized in the presence of a low concentration of dideoxynucleosides (ddNTPs) in addition to deoxynucleosides (dNTPs). Incorporation of a dNTP allows synthesis to continue as there is a free 3'-OH group for addition of the next nucleotide. Incorporation of a ddNTP terminates synthesis of the DNA strand as there is no free 3-OH group for addition of the next nucleotide. In Sanger sequencing, four reactions (A, C, T, and G) are run, each containing the appropriate ddNTP. The mixture of DNA strands generated in each reaction includes strands that are terminated at each given nucleotide (e.g., the A reaction contains DNA strands terminated at each A). The four reactions are run adjacent to one another on an acrylamide gel to separate the strands by size. The sequence of the DNA is determined by reading the order of the terminated chains going up the gel.",A

What is true about branchial cyst?,Present in anterior triangle of neck,Cauterization is done,Arises from 2nd cleft,Present in lower 3rd of neck,"BRANCHIAL CYST

It arises from the remnants of second branchial cleft. Normally, 2nd, 3rd, 4th clefts disappear to form a smooth neck. Persistent 2nd cleft is called as cervical sinus (of His) which eventually gets sequestered to form branchial cyst. 
Epithelial infusion within lymph node may be the other cause as branchial cyst contains lymphoid tissues in their wall. 
Six branchial arches with five pharyngeal pouches (endoderm lining) inside and five pharyngeal clefts (ectoderm lining) outside are present. 

Treatment

Excision under GA. 
Cyst is in relation to carotids, hypoglossal nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, spinal accessory nerve,  posterior belly of digastric and pharyngeal wall. Medially it is close to the posterior pillar of tonsils. During dissection, all these structures should be taken care of. 

Note:

A laparoscopic Heller myotomy allows excellent relief of symptoms in the majority of patients and should be preferred to pneumatic dilatation whenever surgical expertise is available. Botulinum toxin and medications should be used only in patients who are not candidates for pneumatic dilatation or laparoscopic Heller myotomy. ''Achalasia Achalasia cardia is a motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, & the esophageal body undergoes non peristaltic contractions. (Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced)The pathogenesis of Achalasia is poorly understood It involves:neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Auerbach's myenteric plexus) or extrinsic (extra esophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus)Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease.As a result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findingsBoth sexes are equally affected (Ref: Maingot's 10/e, p 846)May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.Regurgitation and Pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.Pain is infrequent in classical achalasia but a variant called vigorous achalasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propylamine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.DiagnosisChest x-ray - shows absence of gastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.Barium swallow - shows dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'birds' beak' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower two thirds of esophagus.Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achalasia eg. Carcinoma, stricture at LES.ManometryIt's the most confirmatory investigationit is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophagusManometric characteristics of AchalasiaIncomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (<75% relaxation)Elevated LES pressureLoss of primary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present.Increased intra esophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline.Treatment of AchalasiaThe aim of treatment is to be relieve the functional obstruction at the cardiaThe two main methods to achieve this areForceful dilatation orEsophageal myotomy (Heller's myotomy) with or without an antireflux procedureForceful dilatation (pneumatic dilatation)The aim is to weaken or rupture the circular muscle fibres of the LES by forceful stretch.Perforation and bleeding are potential complicationsExtra mucosal cardiomyotomy {Heller's myotomy)this involves surgical division of the muscle fibres of the lower esophageal sphincter.this procedure can be performed through a laparoscopic or thoracoscopic approach {Open surgical procedure i.e. Laparotomy or thoracotomy can also be done, but the videoscopic procedure is better)major complication is gastro-esophageal reflux.partial fundoplication is done to prevent reflux ""modified laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the operation of choice""- SabistonOther methods of treatmentDrugsNitrates and calcium channel blockers can be used, but are ineffective for long term use.

True about solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is alUexcept,Increased muscle layer proliferation,Crypt distoion,Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte,Subepithelial fibrosis,"Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte Histopathology of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome shows hypocellular lamina propria. There is relative absence of inflammatory cells Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology writes - ""There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), but without the dense lamina propria inflammation."" Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome The pathogenesis of mucosa/ prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS. SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age. Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction. Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa. Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration. The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, paicularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial poion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosa' hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium. In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudomembrane. The cells show enlarged, hyperchronzatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells",C

Which of the following substances is not used as an irrigant during transurethral resection of the prostate?,Normal Saline,1.5% Glycine,5% Dextrose,Distilled Water,"Ans. is (a) i.e. Normal Saline ""TUR is performed with a nonhemolytic fluid such as 1.5% glycine. Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate."" - Schwaz 8/e p1530 (not given in 9/e) During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of veru mon tan um. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & CI ions). So if it is used while performing TURF, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.) There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP. True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common Distilled water is being replaced by 1.5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available) Do not get confused by what is written in Bailey 241"" /e p. 1377, 1378 (23/e, p1245, 1246) - If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i.e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",A

The lesion appears as a hyperdense biconvex mass between the skull and brain on CT scan. Clinical presentation is highly variable and outcome largely depends on promptness of diagnosis and surgical evacuation. The typical history is one of head trauma followed by a momentary alteration in consciousness and then a lucid interval lasting for up to a few hours. This is followed by a loss of consciousness, dilation of the pupil on the side of the epidural hematoma, and then compromise of the brainstem and death. Treatment consists of temporal craniectomy, evaluation of the hemorrhage, and control of the bleeding vessel. The mortality of epidural hematoma is approximately 50%.",C

The initial fluid rate in burns patient for first 24 hours is -,TBSA x wt x 8,TBSA x wt x 4,TBSA x wt x 3,TBSA x wt x 2,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., TBS A x wt x 4 * Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",B

Trotters triad is seen in -,Angiofibroma,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Laryngeal carcinoma,Growth in fossa of Rosenmuller,"• Nasopharyngeal cancer is most common in China particularly in southern states and Taiwan.
• People in Southern China, Taiwan and Indonesia are more prone to this cancer.
• MC tumor to produce cervical LN metastasis
• MC tumor responsible for secondaries in the neck with no obvious primary malignancy
• Burning of incense or wood (Polycyclic hydrocarbon), use of preserved salted fish (Nitosamines) along with vitamin C deficient diet (vitamin C blocks nitrosification of amines and is thus protective) may be other factors operative in China.
Etiology
• Exact etiology is not known. The factors responsible are:
−− Genetic: Chinese
−− Viral: Epstein-Barr virus
−− Environmental: Air pollution, smoking of tobacco and opium, nitrosamines from dry salted fish, smoke from burning of incense and wood
Pathology
• Squamous cell carcinoma in various grades of its differentiation or its variants as transitional cell carcinoma and lymphoepithelioma, is the most common.
• MC site of origin: Fossa of Rosenmuller in the lateral wall of Nasopharynx.
• LN involvement is common because of rich lymphatic network in the nasopharynx.
Clinical features
• Age: It is mostly seen in fifth to seventh decades but may involve younger age groups.
• Sex: Males are three times more prone than females.
• Cervical lymphadenopathy is MC presenting symptom (60-90%).
• Nasal: Nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, denasal speech (rhinolalia clausa) and epistaxis.
• Otologic: Due to obstruction of Eustachian tube , there is conductive hearing loss, serous or suppurative otitis media.
• Presence of unilateral serous otitis media in an adult should raise suspicion of nasopharyngeal growth.
• Involvement of IX , X and XI cranial nerves may occur, constituting jugular foramen syndrome.
• Can cause conductive deafness (Eustachian tube blockage), ipsilateral temporoparietal neuralgia (involvement of CN V) and palatal paralysis (CN X)-collectively called Trotter’s triad.
• Cervical nodal metastases may be the only manifestation of nasopharyngeal cancer.
• Nodal metastases are seen in 75% of the patients, when first seen, about half of them with bilateral nodes.
• Distant metastases involve bone, lung, liver and other sites.
• Jaccods’s triad: Ipsilateral ophthalmoplegia + Amaurosis + Ipsilateral neuralgia
Diagnosis
• CT scan: Demonstrate erosion of bone at the base of skull and the extent of tumor.
• Biopsy is essential to show the exact histology of the malignancy.
• In absence of nasopharyngeal lesion but with strong suspicion of malignancy, nasopharynx is exposed by transpalatal approach and a strip of mucosa and submucosa from the region of fossa of Rosenmuller should be taken and subjected to histology.
Treatment
• Irradiation is treatment of choice.

"If caecum is involved as a pa of the wall of hernial sac and is not its content, then it will be known as:September 2009",Richter's hernia,Spigelian hernia,Sliding hernia,Interstitial hernia,"Ans. C: Sliding herniaIndirect inguinal herniaAn indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine.The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle.Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.Direct herniaA direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle.The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon.Femoral herniaThe femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament.Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated.Umbilical herniaThe umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years.Richter herniaThe Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel.As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting.The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional herniaThis iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%.Spigelian herniaThis rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle).Obturator herniaThis hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter.Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contentsSliding herniaAs a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.",C

Lab studies: Serum creatinine = 5.1 mg/dl, serum Na = 141, K = 5.6, chloride = 101, CO2 = 14, serum calcium = 11.7, and serum phosphorus = 6.0. Most likely etiology is:",Renovascular disease,Thrombotic renal disease,. Multiple myeloma,SLE,"Multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma is the most likely etiology. The combination of hypercalcemia and acute renal failure raises the possibility of multiple myeloma as the bone breakdown secondary to tumor involvement releases large amounts of calcium to the extracellular fluid and hypercalcemia ensues. The renal failure in myeloma is primarily related to hypercalcemia combined with proteinaceous cast formation within the renal tubules, producing a form of intratubu- lar obstruction as well as a tubular inflammatory lesion. The major diagnostic clue is the finding of dipstick mildly positive urine with a sulfosalicylic acid strongly positive urine. Dipstick testing does not detect the negatively charged light-chain proteins, only the alburnin.

All of the following are seen in persisting vomitting EXCEPT -,Hypokalemia,Decreased K+ in urine,Elevated pH of blood,Metabolic alkalosis,"Presistant vomitting causes loss of hydrochloric acid, K+ Na+ ions and body fluids.
Loss of HCl leads to metabolic alkalosis.
Loss of K+ leads to hypokalemia which further increases the pH of blood (intracellular K+ ions come out in the ECF by exchanging with H+ ions of ECF).
Hypokalemia should lead to decreased K+ in urine but this does not happen -
Low Na+ and hypovolemia would lead to increased aldosterone secretion which would increase the reabsorption of Na+ ions in the distal renal tubular in exchange of K+ ions. Thus K+ ions excretion in urine is increased despite hypokalemia.",B

A 35-year-old construction worker presents with complaints of nocturnal parasthesias of the thumb and the index and middle fingers. There is some atrophy of the thenar eminence.

The most likely diagnosis is,Carpal tunnel syndrome,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Rheumatoid ahritis of the wrist joint,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1984-1986.) Carpal tunnel syndrome results from median nerve entrapment and is usually due to excessive use of the wrist. The process has been associated with thickening of connective tissue as in acromegaly, or with deposition of amyloid. It also occurs in hypothyroidism, rheumatoid ahritis, and diabetes mellitus. As in this patient, numbness occurs in the distribution of the median nerve. Later in the process, atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis becomes apparent. The Tinel sign (parasthesia induced in the median nerve distribution by a reflex hammer hitting on the volar aspect of the wrist) is very characteristic. De Quervain's tenosynovitis causes focal wrist pain on the radial aspect of the hand and is due to inflammation of the tendon sheath of the abductor pollicis longus. It should not produce a postive Tinel sign. Amylotrophic lateral sclerosis may present with distal muscle weakness that is diffuse and not focal. Diffuse atrophy and muscle fasiculations would be prominent. Rheumatoid ahritis would not produce these symptoms unless inflammation of the wrist was causing median nerve entrapment in the carpal tunnel.",A

C: Cleft lip and cleft palate The typical distribution of cleft types is: Cleft lip alone-15% Isolated cleft palate-40% Cleft lip and cleft palate-45% Cleft lip alone (hare lip): It is due failure of fusion between the frontonasal (philtrum) and the maxillary processes. Types : - Unilateral 85% usually on the left side 75%, bilateral 15%. - Upper or lower: lower cleft lip is very rare and is due to failure of fusion between the mandibular processes. Complete or incomplete: according to whether it extends to the nostrils or not. - Simple or alveolar: if it involves the bony alveolus. - Complicated or not: If it is associated with cleft palate. Complications: - Disfigurement. - Difficult suckling if it is complicated. Treatment: - Timing of surgery for cleft lip alone: Unilateral-one operation at 5-6 months Bilateral-One operation at 4-5 months. - (Millard's operation- When the patient is 10 weeks old, Hb = 10 gm% and the weight is 10 pounds (rule of ten)). II. Isolated cleft palate: The palate is developed from - Premaxilla from the frontonasal process. - Two maxillary shelves: from the maxillary process Cleft palate occurs due to failure (total or paial) of fusion between the maxillary and frontonasal process or the 2 maxillary processes. Types : - Soft palate only, usually asymptomatic. - Intermaxillary : the cleft is only between the 2 maxillary shelves. - Bipaate : as intermaxillary but extends to one side of the premaxilla. Tripaate : as intermaxillary but extends to both sides of the premaxilla. Complications: - Impaired feeding due to: Difficult suckling. Wide pharynx : so the soft palate can't close the nasopharynx during swallowing leading to nasal regurgitation of food, leading to pharyngitis, rhinitis, otitis media and deafness. Difficult speech : specially consonant e.g. D, P, T, B, K, J. - Teeth malformation.

Which of the following tumors characteristically spreads by lymphatics?,Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid,Renal adenocarcinoma,Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"Papillary cancer of the thyroid characteristically spreads by lymphatics, rather than by vessel invasion.Dissemination of tumor occurs by seeding within body cavities, lymphatic spread, or hematogenous spread. Seeding is commonly seen with colorectal cancers and ovarian cancers. Lymphatic invasion is more common in carcinomas than sarcomas. Lymphatic spread initially goes to the regional lymph nodes (subcapsular sinus is the first site), and from there into the systemic circulation the thoracic duct. Hematogenous spread is ored by sarcomas (not exclusively), with spread to the lungs and liver a common finding. Carcinomas with a propensity for hematogenous invasion are: renal adenocarcinomas invading the renal vein, hepatocellular carcinomas invading the hepatic and poal veins, and follicular carcinomas of the thyroid, which commonly bypass the cervical lymph nodes and metastasize to the lungs and bone.",C

"Regarding urinary bladder, stone one is Not true -",Common in Paediatric pt in tropics than that of non tropical areas,Uric acid stones are dropped from above,Jack stone is due to urea splitting bacteria,Commonly distal passage obstruction cause stone,"It is the oxalate stones that are usually dropped from above (i.e. formed in the kidney and dropped in the bladder through ureter). Uric acid stones are mostly formed within the bladder.
In general most of the bladder calculi are formed within the bladder itself Only some stones are formed in the kidney and pass into the bladder, where they grow by additional deposition of crystals.

Etiology for Bladder calculi 

Bladder outlet obstruction is the most common cause of vesical calculi in adults. Other causes are
neurogenic bladder leading to urinary stasis
a foreign body eg. Foley catheter and forgotten DJ stent, which serve as nidi for stones.
bladder diverticula
Bladder stones are commonly seen in older men (>50 yrs.) usually because of bladder outlet obstruction
In the Western world bladder stones are rare in pediatric population but bladder stones are endemic in children in underdeveloped nations (in North Africa, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia i.e. found near the tropics). This is because of low-protein, high carbohydrate diet and chronic dehydration. These are usually ammonium urate stones.
Common vesical stones are
Uric acid stones &
Struvite stones
Other less common stone types are
Oxalate stones
Cystine stones
Struvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones.
Struvite stones are composed of ammonium, magnesium and calcium phosphates and occurs in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, eg. Proteus.
Bladder stones are usually solitary but may also be multiple.",B

Uncommon in Colle's fracture: March 2007,Non-union,Mal-union,Rupture of EPL tendon,Reflex sympathetic dystrophy,"Ans. A: Non-union A. CoIle's fracture is usually produced by a FOOSH (fall on an outstretched handy mechanism with the wrist in dorsiflexion. The fracture is dorsally displaced and may be comminuted. The fracture pattern is often described as a silver or dinner-fork deformity. Two classification systems are used: The Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) system The Frykman system. Complications of the Colles fracture include: Post-traumatic stiffness Mal-union Subluxation of the inferior radio-ulnar joint Acute carpal tunnel syndrome Sudeck's osteodystrophy. Rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon B. An impact to the dorsum of the hand or a hyperflexion or hypersupination injury results in Smith's fracture. A Smith fracture is usually called a reverse Colles fracture because the distal fragment is displaced volarly. It is often described as a garden-spade deformity. C. Baon fractures are classified as dorsal or palmar (always intra-aicular), and they always involve carpal subluxation. The volar Baon fracture is thought to occur with the same mechanism as the Smith fracture, with more force and loading on the wrist. The dorsal Baon fracture is caused by a fall on an extended and pronated wrist, increasing carpal compression force on the dorsal rim. The salient feature is a subluxation of the wrist. By definition, this fracture has some degree of carpal displacement, which distinguishes it from a Colles or Smith fracture. The palmar variety is more common than the dorsal type. D. The chauffeur's fracture derives its name from injuries that were acquired, in the days when motor vehicles were cranked, when a vehicle backfired. The force is described as a direct axial compression of the scaphoid into the radial facet. The radial styloid is fractured, with associated avulsion of the radial collateral ligament. A chauffeur's fracture represents an avulsion related to the attachment sites of the radiocarpal ligaments or of the radial collateral ligament. E. Galeazzi fracture results from a FOOSH mechanism with the forearm hyperpronated or from a direct impact to the dorsal radial wrist. The radial diaphysis at the distal and middle third junction is fractured, with associated subluxation of the distal radioulnar joint. On PA views, the radius is shoened and the radioulnar joint is disrupted. On the lateral view, the distal radius is angulated either volarly or radially as a result of the pull of the brachioradialis muscle with more than 3 mm of ulnar displacement. F. The Essex-Lopresti fracture consists of a comminuted and displaced radial head fracture along with disruption of the distal radioulnar joint and interosseous membrane.",A

All are features of Paget's disease except ?,Defect in osteoclasts,Common in female,Can cause deafness,Can cause osteosarcoma,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Common in female Paget disease Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). Clinical features of Paget's disease Paget's disease is slightly more common in males and is seen after 40 years of age. The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (veebrae) and clavicle the next commonest o Most of the patient with Paget's disease are asymptomatic, the disorder being diagnosed when an x-ray is taken for some unrelated condition or after the incidental discovery of raised serum alkaline phosphatase. When patients does present, they present because any of the three : - Pain : - Dull constant ache Deformities : - Bowing of long bones, platybasia. Complications of the disease Complications of Paget's disease Following complications can occur in Paget's disease : - Fracture : Are common in weight bearing bones Cranial nerve compression : - May cause impaired vision, facial palsy, trigeminal neuralgia or deafness.

Hemorrhage leads to: September 2005,Septicemic shock,Neurogenic shock,Hypovolemic shock,Cardiogenic shock,"Ans. C: Hypovolemic shock Hypovolemic shock refers to a medical or surgical condition in which rapid fluid loss results in multiple organ failure due to inadequate circulating volume and subsequent inadequate perfusion. Most often, hypovolemic shock is secondary to rapid blood loss. Acute external blood loss secondary to penetrating trauma and severe GI bleeding disorders are 2 common causes of hemorrhagic shock. Hypovolemic shock can result from significant fluid (other than blood) loss. Two examples of hypovolemic shock secondary to fluid loss include refractory gastroenteritis and extensive burns.",C

"In chronic secretory otitis media, the treatment of choice is:",Coical mastoidectomy,Radical mastoidectomy,Grommet tube inseion,Antibiotics and antihistaminic for 6 weeks,"Otitis media with effusion (glue ear) or non-suppurative otitis media or sero mucinous otitis media or exudative otitis media is a very common condition in children and majority of children experience at least one episode in their life. Primary cause is poor Eustachian tube function in children. As the O2 is continuously absorbed by the middle ear mucosa it results in negative middle ear pressure unless the Eustachian tube opens to replenish the ear. Negative pressure leads to transudation of fluid into the middle ear and if the hypoxia continues a mucoid exudate is produced by the glands of middle ear mucosa (glue ear). Majority of children need no treatment. but, if required, surgery is the only effective way of curing glue ear and both ventilation tube (grommet) and adenoidectomy are effective. Myringotomy should be followed by grommet inseion to maintain the aeration of middle ear. It should be left in situ for weeks or months or until it is spontaneously extruded.",C
"Micronodular cirrhosis is commonly seen in all except,",Chronic hepatitis B,Alcoholic liver disease,Hemochromatosis,Chronic extrahepatic biliary obstruction,"Chronic hepatitis B [Ref Robbin 7Th/e p. 8991 Cirrhosis of the liver is a pathological entity which clinically represents the end stage of chronic liver disease. It is characterized by three features. i) Bridging fibrous septa& in the form of delicate bands or broad scars linking poal tracts with one another and poal tracts with terminal hepatic veins. ii) Parenchymal nodulesQ containing proliferating hepatocytes encircled by fibrosis with diameters varying from very small to large. Cirrhosis is defined as micronodular or macronodular depending upon the size of parenchymal nodules Micronodular cirrhosisu - Parenchymal nodules < 3 mm in size Macronodular cirrhosisQ - Parenchymal nodules > 3 mm in size Viral hepatitis commonly causes macronodular cirrhosisdeg. In viral hepatitis the cirrhosis is characterized by irregularly large sized nodules separated by variable but mostly broad scars. This pattern of cirrhosis is historically called posnecrotic cirrhosise. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is not only applied to viral hepatitis but to all forms of cirrhosis in which the liver shows large irregular sized ntacronodules with broad scars regardless of the etiology. Also remember these Alcholic cirrhosis is typically micronodularQ, but can become macronodulare in later stages. Viral cirrhosis is typically macronodularQ. Cirrhosis associated with virus is called postnecrotic cirrhosis. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is also called posthepatitis cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis. Cirrhosis in hemochromatosis is typically micronodularQ (can be macronodular sometimes). Wilson's disease causes macronodularQ cirrhosis.

Antihistamines associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving erythromycin or ketoconazole include,Diphenhydramine,Clemastine,Loratadine,Terfenadine,"Terfenadine and astemizole are relatively new, nonsedating antihistamines that may prolong the QT interval of an electrocardiogram and cause cardiac arrhythmias. Erythromycin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole may inhibit the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in higher blood levels and increased risk of arrhythmia. Loratadine, another nonsedating antihistamine, apparently lacks the QT prolongation effect and no drug interactions with either erythromycin or the antifungal agents listed have been established. Diphenhydramine, clemastine, and chlorpheniramine are also free of these drug interactions. However, many antihistamines have some potential to cause tachycardia and palpitations because of their antimuscarinic activity.",D

One might also have expected some prior evidence of both of these congenital cysts, although that is not always the case. The location and characteristics strongly suggest a thyroid nodule. While follicular adenomas are much more common in adults than cancers they are rarer in children and a rapidly growing solitary nodule is likely to be a papillary carcinoma, the most common thyroid cancer in children.",B

Merkel cell carcinoma is due to,Cytokeratin: 7,Cytokeratin: 19,Cytokeratin: 20,Cytokeratin: 18,"Cytokeratin 20: *Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive, primary skin cancer exhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation. oThe histogenesis of MCC is controversial. Possible cells of origin include the epidermal MC, a dermal MC equivalent, a neural-crest- derived cell of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, and a residual epidermal stem cell. oCytogenetic abnormalities are present in 30-47% of MCCs. The most frequent change is loss of heterozygosity due to translocations or deletions of chromosome 1; specifically, 2 distinct regions in the most distal band 1 p36 on the sho arm of chromosome 1are implicated in MCC. Similar abnormalities near this site occur in several neuro cystic tumors, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. Other abnormalities described in MCC include losses at chromosomes 3, 13, and 22 and paial trisomy 01 chromosomes 1, 11, 18, and X. Unlike neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung, gene amplifications are rare in cutaneous MCC. oCytokeratin 20 is expressed in a dot like paranuclear or crescentic pattern; other low molecular weight (MW) cytokeratin antibodies (E.g., CAM5.2, MNF116), white less specific, react in a similar localization pattern. oElectron microscopic findings are char9- cteristic, revealing a lobulated nucleus that may contain rodlets. The cytoplasm is electron- lucent and contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous ribosomes. Intermediate filaments are numerous and often assume a parallel or whorled arrangement near the nucleus, accounting for the dot like pattern of cytokeratin distribution visualized by immunohistochemistry. Desmosomes may be present. Most diagnostic is the dense core granule (80-120 mn in diameter), the source and the locus of the neuroendocrine peptides.",C

Posterior drawer test: The examiner passively displaces the humeral head in a posterior direction. Pain, clicking, or an increase in humeral translation indicate a positive test. Posterior apprehension test: The patient lies supine, with the shoulder flexed and internally rotated and with the elbow flexed and resting on the trunk. A posterior force is transmitted by the examiner through the subject's elbow. A look of apprehension and resistance to fuher movement constitute a positive result. Push - pull test: The patient is positioned supine with the shoulder placed at a 90 degree of scapular plane abduction. The examiner grasps the subject's wrist with one hand while the other hand is placed anteriorly near the humeral head. The examiner simultaneously pulls upward through the long axis of the forearm while pushing the humeral head posteriorly. A look of apprehension or displacement of the humeral head greater than 50% represent a positive test. Circumduction test: The patient is in standing position. The examiner stands behind the patient grasping the patient's forearm with the hand. The examiner begins circumduction by extending the patients arm while maintaining slight abduction. As the circumduction continues into elevation, the arm is brought over the top and into the flexed and adducted position. As the arm moves into forward flexion and adduction from above. it is vulnerable to posterior subluxation if the patient is unstable posteriorly. if the examiner palpate the posterior aspect of the patient shoulder as the arm moves downward in forward flexion and adduction, the humeral head will be felt to subluxate posteriorly in a positive test. Jahnke test: A Posteriorly directed force applied to the forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder i sthe moved into the coronal plane as an anteriorly directed force is applied to the humeral head. A clunk occur as the humeral head reduces from the subluxed position. Test for inferior shoulder instability Sulcus sign: The patient stands with the arm by the side and shoulder muscles relaxed. The examiner grasps the patient's forearm below the elbow and pulls the arm distally. a positive test suggesting inferior instability of the shoulder is indicated if patient's pain reproduced and/or a sulcus appears distal to the acromion.

Staph. aureus produce a superantigen contributes to massive disease caused cytokines that are released from polyclonal T- cell activation. Which one of the following best fits this description of a superantigen?,Exfoliative toxin,Protein A,Coagulase,Toxic shock syndrome toxin,"Superantigens can bind to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules outside the peptide- bonding cleft, as well as to the T-cell receptor. Superantigen binding stimulates the release of large amounts of cytokines, including interleukin I and tumor necrosis factor. This mechanism is caused by stimulation of a high percentage of the pool of T lymphocytes (poly clonal activation) and explains to a large extent the pathogenesis of diseases caused by organisms with superantigens. Staphylococcus aureus produces both toxic shock syndrome toxin and enterotoxins (food poison ing), which exhibit the superantigen characteristics. Although toxic and harmful, exfoliative toxin, protein A, coagulase, and beta hemolytic hemolysin respond as regular antigens in the immune response and are specific in their destructive action in the body. Exfoliative toxin includes at least two proteins that cause the generalized desquamation seen in the scalded skin syndrome. Protein A nonspecifically binds to the Fe poion of munoglobulin G molecules and pre vents complement attachment and activation. Coagulase clots citrated plasma with the help of a serum factor, and probably assists in the development of the abscess lesion. S. aureus produces several hemolysis, or exotoxins.

"Patient presents with recurrent duodenal ulcer of 2.5 cm size, the procedure of choice -",Truncal vagotomy and antrectomy,Truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,Highly selective vagotomy,Laparoscopic vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,"This question is basically irrelevant in the first place itself as recurrences are very uncommon in the present era and if occur can be very effectively treated with antibiotics and anti-secretory drugs.
Here in this question, it's not mentioned whether the recurrence is after an acid-reducing operation or simply after medications.
Lets first take the case of recurrence after a previous acid reducing surgery (this is most probably what the examiner means by recurrent ulcer as this topic is described in quite a detail in Maingot's)

Recurrence after a prior acid reducing surgery:

The management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of
antibiotics directed at H. pylori + treatment with an antisecretory medication + limitation of NSAID use, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol intake.
Ulcer disease refractory to such treatment is unusual. If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated.
The choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive.
Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate.

Recurrence after prior treatment by medications:

If at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i.e. Highly selective vagotomy.

Recurrent gastric ulcer: 

Non-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion)",A

For vascular anastomosis sutures of choice -,Polypropylene,Chromic catgut,Silk,Nylon,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Polypropylene Vascular anastomoses:* Vascular anastomoses require an extremely accurate closure as they must be immediately watertight at the end of the operation when the vascular clamps are removed.* In many cases, some form of prosthetic material or graft may be used which will never be integrated into the body tissues and so the integrity of the suture line needs to be permanent.* For this reason, polypropylene is one of the best sutures as it is not biodegradable. It is used in its monofilament form, mounted on an atraumatic, curved, roundbodied needle.* Knot security is important, and as polypropylene is monofilament and the anastomosis often depends on one final knot, several throws (between six and eight) of a well-laid reef knot are required.* The suture line must be regular and watertight with a smooth intimal surface to minimise the risk of thrombosis and embolus, as well as to avoid any leakage.* Suture size depends on vessel calibre: 2/0 is suitable for the aorta, 4/0 for the femoral artery and 6/0 for the popliteal to distal arteries.* Micro vascular anastomoses are made using a loupe and an interrupted suture down to 10/0 size.",A

About 50% of hemangiomas of bone occur in veebrae and are most commonly situated in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Other common site of involvement (20%) is skull. Small bones of hands and feets may also be affected. Haemangioma of the veebra has a typical radiographic picture in the form of loss of horizontal striations and prominence of veebral striations. There is Polka dot appearance on CT. In the skull, hemangioma generally affects the calverium and is seen as an expansile lytic lesion which has a sunburst appearance with striation radiating from the centre. A hemangioma may be identified due to associated phlebolith and it may cause local gigantism of the invovled area. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as rare. Treatment is radiotherapy.",D

Marble bone disease is an inherited disease of the skeleton which is accompanied by an increase in calcified bone tissue. It is also known as:,Osteoporosis,Osteochondritis,Osteopetrosis,Osteogenesis imperfecta,"Osteopetrosis or Albers-Schonberg Disease or Marble Bone Disease is an inherited disease of the skeleton which is accompanied by an increase in calcified bone tissue - namely osteosclerosis. The bone marrow cavity is almost completely filled with compact bone tissue and coex is thickened by periosteal bone deposition. Radiologically the bones are accordingly seen as complete shadows which give the name marble bone disease. The pathogenesis is insufficiency of osteoclasts. Hence the bone resorption is inadequate. The primary spongiosa is not transformed into a secondary spongiosa. X-ray of lumbar spine shows 'sandwich veebra'.

Following a successful popliteal embolectomy, with restoration of palpable pedal pulses, the patient is still unable to dorsi- flex his toes. The next step in management should be",Electromyography (EMG),Measurement of anterior compartment pressure,Elevation of the left leg,Immediate fasciotomy,"This case illustrates two (among many) conditions that lead to the anterior compartment syndrome, namely, acute arterial occlusion without collateral inflow and rapid reperfusion of ischemic muscle. Treatment for a compartment syndrome is prompt fasciotomy Assessing a compartment syndrome and proceeding with fasciotomy are generally based on clinical judgment. Inability to dorsiflex the toes is a grave sign of anterior compartment ischemia. EMG studies and compartment pressure measurements would probably be abnormal but are unnecessary in view of the known findings and would delay treatment. Mere elevation of the leg would be an ineffective means of relieving compartment pressure, although elevation should accompany fasciotomy.

Which of the following statements is true for Nigro's regimen:,It is a regimen for anal canal neoplasm,It incorporates chemotherapy with radiation as an alternative to surgery,Has the advantage of preserving continence,All of the above,"Nigro regimen refers to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for primary treatment of malignant tumors of the anal canal.
In the 1970s, Nigro pioneered preoperative combination chemo radiation therapy to convert unrespectable cases to respective cases.
There was no surgical pathological evidence of tumor found in three out of three patients treated with this approach in an early report.
This led to the concept of definitive radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Prior to this, the standard definitive treatment for carcinoma of the anal canal was abdominal-perineal resection, which necessitated a permanent colostomy. The organ preservation concept following the discovery of a high complete response rate from combined chemoradiation saves a large number of patients from undergoing abdominal-perineal resection and colostomy.",D

Types of spinal tuberculosis Paradiscal (most common type; approx 98% - Ref' Ebnezar 3/e p503): In this the contiguous areas of two adjacent veebrae along with the intervening disc are affected. There is an embryological basis for this type of involvement. A veebra develops from sclerotomes which lie on either side of the notochord. Each pair of sclerotome develops into the lower half of the veebra above, upper half of the veebra below and the intervening IV disc; and has a common blood supply. Therefore hematogenous infections involve this `embryological' section as a whole. Central body type: In this type the central body of the veebra is involved which may lead to veebral collapse. IV disc space is normal. Anterior type: Here the disease stas at the anterior pa of the body and spreads up and down under the anterior longitudinal ligament.

Treatment of choice for congenital hydrocele?,Sac eversion,Herniotomy,Conservative,Hernioraphy,"Ans. B. Herniotomy. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1382; 381).# In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.# Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously.# Established acquired hydroceles often have thick walls. Lord's operation is suitable when the sac is reasonably thin- walled. There is minimal dissection and the risk of haematoma is reduced. Eversion of the sac with placement of the testis in a pouch prepared by dissection in the fascial planes of the scrotum is an alternative (Jaboulay's procedure).# Herniotomy: In children who have lateral hernias with a persistent processus, it is sufficient only to remove and close the sac. This is called a herniotomy. In adult surgery, herniotomy alone has a high recurrence rate and some form of muscle strengthening is added (herniorrhaphy).",B

PPI&;s for peptic ulcer disease should be taken:,Before breakfast,After breakfast,After lunch,After dinner,"PPIs are taken before breakfast Proton Pump Inhibitors Most potent antisecretory agents, substituted benzimidazoles also known as the Proton Pump inhibitors Covalently bind to the catalytic subunit of the proton pump and negate all types of acid secretion PPIs also provide more complete inhibition of acid secretion than the H2-receptor antagonists Inhibition of acid secretion is also prolonged because of the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme caused by the covalent bond to the proton pump PPIs are more effective during the day, generally prescribed before breakfast PPIs require an acidic environment within the gastric lumen in order to become activated and bind to the proton pump at the secretary canaliculus Utilization of antacids or H2-receptor antagonists in combination with PPIs could have deleterious effects by promoting an alkaline environment and thereby preventing activation of the PPI Consequently, antacids and H2-receptors antagonists should not be used in combination with PPIs.

In chronic prostatitis antibiotic therapy is given for how many weeks?,4-6 weeks,6-10 weeks,10-12 weeks,12-16 weeks,"Chronic prostatitis Many urologists find the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis and 'prostatodynia' very difficult, for many men present with perigenital pain, testicular pain, prostatic pain exacerbated by sexual intercourse or pain that apparently renders sexual intercourse out of the question. Psychosexual dysfunction in such patients may be the underlying problem. The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis has to be based on: * persistent threads in voided urine; * prostatic massage showing pus cells with or without bacte ria in the absence of urinary infection. Aetiology This is thought to be the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. While pus is present in the prostatic secretion, the responsible organism is often difficult to find. Other organisms such as Chlamydia species may be responsible for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Clinical features The clinical features are extremely varied. Only men with symptoms of posterior urethritis, prostatic pain and perigen ital pain accompanied by intermittent fever and pus cells or bacteria in the post-prostatic massage specimen should be diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis. Diagnosis The three-glass urine test is valuable. If the first glass with the initial voided sample shows urine containing prostatic threads, prostatitis is present. Rectal examination of the prostate may be normal or may show a soft, boggy and tender prostate. Examination of the prostatic fluid obtained by prostatic massage should show pus cells and bacteria. Urethroscopy may reveal inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and pus may be seen exuding from the prostatic ducts. The verumontanum is likely to be enlarged and oedematous. In many men with the symptoms described above, all investi gations are normal. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be administered only in accordance with bacteriological sensitivity tests. Trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin penetrate well into the prostate. If Trichomonas or anaerobes are the responsible agent, a rapid response is obtained from administration of metronidazole (200mg t.d.s. for 7 days to both paners). Treatment is continued upto 10-12 weeks. If Chlamydia is suspected, doxycycline is the antibiotic treatment of choice. There is little evidence that prostatic massage helps in eradicating the infection. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1475",C

The extracellular fluid and circulating blood volumes tend to be preserved with hypernatremic dehydration at the expense of the intracellular volume. Therefore, hypotension may not be observed, and neither are the other signs of circulatory inadequacy that are typical of isotonic or hypotonic dehydration. Signs suggesting involvement of the central nervous system (such as irritability or lethargy) are characteristic of hypeonic dehydration. Slow correction of this hypernatremia (over 24 to 48 h) prevents significant fluid shifts and increased intercranial pressure. Initial bolus therapy should be with isotonic fluid such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. Blood products such as fresh-frozen plasma are not indicated, and hypotonic solutions such as D10W and 1/4 NS could cause rapid fluid shifts, resulting in cerebral edema and death.

Branchial cyst arises from the which branchial cleft: September 2009,First,Second,Third,Foh,"Ans. B: Second Branchial cleft cysts are congenital cysts, that arise in the lateral aspect of the neck when the second branchial cleft fails to close during embryonic development. At about the fouh week of embryonic life, 4 branchial (or pharyngeal) clefts develop between 5 ridges known as the branchial (or pharyngeal) arches. These arches and clefts contribute to the formation of various structures of the head and neck. The second arch grows downwards and ultimately covers the third and fouh arches. The buried clefts normally disappear around the seventh week of development. If a poion of the cleft remains entrapped and fails to disappear, its remnants form a cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are the most common of congenital neck masses. They are bilateral in about 2-3% of the cases. Usually, they do not appear at bih, but become noticeable much later in life. They are usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. They are usually located at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate. If they get infected, they may form a deep neck abscess or a draining fistula. USG and fine-needle aspiration both aids diagnosis. The treatment of branchial cleft cysts is surgical excision.",B

A child is spinned around by holding his hand by his father. While doing this the child staed crying and does not allow his father to touch his elbow. The diagnosis is:,Pulled elbow,Radial head dislocation,Annular ligament tear,Fracture olecranon process,"Pulled elbow or Nursemaid's elbow occurs in children under 4 years old. It is caused by a sudden pull on the extended pronated arm, usually by an adult tugging on a reluctant toddler. The pronated radial head slips paially under the annular ligament and displaces into the radiocapitellar joint. The child suddenly stops using the arm, holding it in a flexed and pronated position. Radiographs show no abnormalities, since positioning for elbow films will often reduce the subluxation. Reduction is achieved by firmly supinating the forearm and flexing the elbow while pressing down on the radial head. Often, a ""click"" is felt when reduction is achieved. Soon after reduction the child becomes less apprehensive and gradually resumes use of the arm. Ref: Srinivasan R.C., Tolhurst S., Vanderhave K.L. (2010). Chapter 40. Ohopedic Surgery. In G.M.

False localizing signs occur in two major contexts: as a consequence of raised intracranial pressure, and with spinal cord lesions. Cranial nerve palsies (especially sixth nerve palsy), hemiparesis, sensory features (such as truncal sensory levels), and muscle atrophy, May all occur as false localizing signs. Sixth nerve palsies are the most common false-localizing sign of raised intracranial pressure. In one series of 101 cases of IIH, 14 cases were noted, 11 unilateral and 3 bilateral. Sixth nerve palsy, or abducens nerve palsy, is a disorder associated with dysfunction of cranial nerve VI (the abducens nerve), which is responsible for contracting the lateral rectus muscle to abduct (i.e., turn out) the eye. The inability of an eye to turn outward results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is double vision or diplopia in which the two images appear side-by-side.

"In case of choledochal cyst, bile diversion into the small intestine is not done because of the risk of -",Malignancy,Pancreatitis,Recurrent Cholangitis,All,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Recurrent Cholangitis Schwaz writes ? ""The cyst wall is composed of fibrous tissue and is devoid of mucosal lining. As a result, the treatment of choledochal cyst is surgical excision followed by biliary enteric reconstruction. There is no role for internal drainage by cystenterostomy, which leaves the cyst wall intact and leads to the inevitable development of cholangitis. Rarely, choledachal cyst can lead to the development of biliary tract malignancy. This provides a fuher rationale for complete cyst excision."" Thus we infer that a bypass procedure will inevitably lead to strictures and recurrent cholangitis. This can be prevented by complete excision of cyst and reconstruction procedure. Though by complete excision we also prevent malignancy (which may occur in future), but this is an added advantage",C

Which of the following surgical methods is used most often to treat patients with small tumors of the head of the pancreas with no evidence of metastasis?",Billroth l procedure,Billroth ll procedure,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,Whipple procedure,"Whipple procedure, also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this surgical procedure, the duodenum, proximal pancreas, gallbladder, and sometimes, the distal stomach are resected. The remaining pancreas, biliary tree, and stomach are then reattached to the small intestine. The Whipple procedure is only performed in the relatively small percentage of patients who may have resectable disease. Tumors of the tail of the pancreas might, in theory, be more easily resected, but this area tends to not produce any signs or symptoms until late in the disease, after metastasis has occurred. Pancreatic cancers that are not resectable can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy using a vaccine based on the patient's own cancer cells is also being tried experimentally, and shows promise. An impoant thing to remember when treating these patients (and other poor prognosis patients) is that long-term survivors have occurred, and that even if death eventually intervenes, a survival of several years may be very much wohwhile to both the patient and his family (paicularly if young children are indirectly involved). The Billroth I and II procedures are used to treat gastric carcinomas and intractable peptic ulcers of the duodenum and stomach. While you could argue that the gastric resection pa of the Whipple procedure resembles a Billroth II operation, you should pick the Whipple procedure if both answers are available, because it is much more specific for pancreatic carcinoma. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is used to treat obesity by reducing the effective stomach volume.",D

"After 4 weeks of Head trauma, pt. presents with features of irritability and altered sensorium. Commonest cause will be ?",Chronic subdural hematoma,Extradural hematoma,Intraparenchymal bleed,Electrolyte imbalance,"Ans. is 'a' Chronic subdural hematoma Chronic subdural hematoma is a type of traumatic intracranial heamorrhage. Traumatic Intracranial haemorrhage is of two types ? 1. Acute extradural hematoma & 2. Chronic subdural hematoma Acute Extradural hematoma Accumulation of blood b/w skull & dura Bleeding is from a branch of middle meningeal aery* in 90% of cases. Trauma is usually severe associated with concussion and skull fracture. With aerial bleeding, the hematoma expands rapidly, and symptoms appear within hours after injury. The clinical course is acute ? After a head injury often associated with a variable period of concussion - the patient appears normal for several hours (lucid interval). After this lucid interval, the pt. develops evidence of increased intracranial pressure with headache, vomitting, altered consciousness, and papilledema. Tentorial herniation rapidly follows, with occulomotor nerve palsy (pupillary inequality appears first, followed by failure of reaction to light k/a Hutchinson's sign and pyramidal tract compression. Compression of the brain stem follows, resulting in changes in hea rate, blood pressure and respiration. Coma and death rapidly ensue in untreated cases. Its an emergency and requires prompt diagnosis & surgical evacuation of the extradural blood collection. Chronic Subdural hematoma Accumalation of blood in the subdural space It occurs mainly in elderly patients with some degree of cerebral atrophy. The amount of trauma required is minimal. Bleeding is the result of rupture of communicating veins passing from the cerebral coex to the superior saggital sinus. Rupture occurs when there is movement of the brain relative to the fixed superior saggital sinus and is most likely when cerebral atrophy is present. Clinical course is slow (over days to month). - Pt. presents with slowly increasing intracranial pressure, causing headache, vomitting, papillcdema and fluctuating levels of consciousness. - Compression of the underlying brain may cause focal epileptic convulsions and neurological symptoms, most commonly contralateral spastic paralysis with prolonged but less severe compression, atrophy of the brain occurs and cause dementia. Treatment is by surgical evacuation of the subdural collection.",A

A 25-year-old male cigarette smoker has a history of respiratory infections and has also been found to have hematuria. A high value for diffusing capacity is noted during pulmonary function testing. This finding is consistent with which of the following disorders?,Anemia,Cystic fibrosis,Emphysema,intrapulmonary hemorrhage,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1450-1451.) Carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing capacity provides an estimate of the rate at which oxygen moves by diffusion from alveolar gas to combine with hemoglobin in the red blood cells. It is interpreted as an index of the surface area engaged in alveolar-capillary diffusion. Measurement of diffusing capacity of the lung is done by having the person inspire a low concentration of carbon monoxide. The rate of uptake of the gas by the blood is calculated from the difference between the inspired and expired concentrations. The test can be performed during a single 10-second breath holding or during 1 minute of steady-state breathing. The diffusing capacity is defined as the amount of carbon monoxide transferred per minute per millimeter of mercury of driving pressure and correlates with oxygen transpo from the alveolus into the capillaries. Primary parenchymal disorders, anemia, and removal of lung tissue decrease the diffusing capacity. Conversely, polycythemia, congestive hea failure, and intrapulmonary hemorrhage tend to increase the value for diffusing capacity. In this patient, the possibility of Goodpasture syndrome would be considered.",D

So it tends to stay in the stomach and over a period of time may form a large 'hair ball'. A trichobezoar may extend up to the pylorus, duodenum, or even jejunum. A part may break off into small bowel and cause small bowel obstruction.For discussion of other gastrointestinal foreign bodies, please see: bezoarsClinical presentationThe patient usually is an adolescent girl. The patient may have history of a psychiatric illness and occasionally a prior history of surgery may be present.The symptoms of Rapunzel syndrome is caused either by gastric outlet obstruction or its complications and includes:anorexia, bloating, early satietyweight lossvomiting immediately following mealsacute epigastric painpatchy hair loss seen in scalp hairComplicationsobstructive jaundicemechanical small bowel obstructionsmall bowel perforationperitonitisacute pancreatitis multiple complications of trichophagia included trichobezoars, malnutrition, intestinal obstruction, and ulceration with bleeding.

"A 60-year-old comes to the casualty complaining of bright red blood per rectum. The bleeding began abruptly several hours prior to his visit. He has lightheadedness when he stands up rapidly, but has no abdominal pain, cramping, fever, nausea, or vomiting. He has no history of previous episodes of bleeding or abdominal pain, but has a history of coronary aery disease and takes aspirin as a ""blood thinner"". He is afebrile, slightly hypotensive and tachycardic, but stable. On examination, he has decreased skin turgor, and dry mucous membranes. He has no abdominal tenderness. Rectal examination is positive for gross blood. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aeriovenous malformation,Diveiculitis,Infectious colitis,Ischemic colitis,"Painless hematochezia or bright red lower GI bleeding can come from many sources. While bright red lower GI bleeding tends to indicate lower GI bleeding (bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz), brisk upper GI bleeding can also be the source. The clinical manifestations of such bleeding range from negligible to hemodynamic instability, depending upon the rate of bleeding. The differential diagnosis for painless hematochezia includes AV malformations, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, esophagitis, duodenal or gastric ulcer, hemorrhoids, diveiculosis, and colonic neoplasm. Diveiculitis occurs when a colonic outpouching or diveiculum becomes inflamed. Patients tend to be elderly and present with fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal tenderness on examination. While painful, these lesions do not bleed significantly (unlike their uninflamed counterpas in diveiculosis). Infectious colitis may present as rectal bleeding, but this bleeding is typically accompanied by pain, cramping, and fever. Causative organisms may include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, E. coli, and Entamoeba histolytica. Ischemic colitis may have rectal bleeding, but the hallmark of ischemic colitis is severe abdominal pain out of propoion to examination findings.",A

They are mainly seen at the mesenteric border. Small bowel diveicula can be associated with bacterial overgrowth, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, malabsorption, and steatorrhoea. This is known as 'blind loop' syndrome and can be treated by a course of antibiotics. Mostly small bowel diveicula are symptomless unless some complication arises. Complications occur in 6 to 10% of patients and incldues diveiculitis, hemorrhage, perforation, intestinal obstruction and malabsorption. Duodenal diveicula are mainly seen on the medial border.

All of the following are true about rickets except:March 2010,Craniotabes,Rachitic rosary,knock-knees,Hypeonia,"Ans. D: HypeoniaThe history in patients with rickets may include the following:Generalized muscular hypotonia of an unknown mechanism is observed in most patients with clinical (as opposed to biochemical and radiographic) signs of rickets.Craniotabes manifests early in infants with vitamin D deficiency, although this feature may be normal in infants, especially for those born prematurely.If rickets occurs at a later age, thickening of the skull develops. This produces frontal bossing and delays the closure of the anterior fontanelle.In the long bones, laying down of uncalcified osteoid at the metaphases leads to spreading of those areas, producing knobby deformity, which is visualized on radiography as cupping and flaring of the metaphyses.Weight bearing produces deformities such as bowlegs and knock-knees.In the chest, knobby deformities results in the rachitic rosary along the costochondral junctions. The weakened ribs pulled by muscles also produce flaring over the diaphragm, which is known as Harrison groove. The sternum may be pulled into a pigeon-breast deformity.In more severe instances in children older than 2 years, veebral softening leads to kyphoscoliosis. The ends of the long bones demonstrate that same knobby thickening. At the ankle, palpation of the tibial malleolus gives the impression of a double epiphysis (Marfan sign). Because the softened long bones may bend, they may fracture one side of the coex (i.e., greenstick fracture).",D

Investigation of choice for esophageal rupture is?,Dynamic MRI,Rigid esophagoscopy,Barium contrast swallow,Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow,"ANSWER: (D) Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallowREF: with textUse of non ionic water soluble contrast medium instead of barium is warranted when there is any risk of aspiration or esophageal leak. (Ref: Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites By Giles W. Boland 4th ed page 2)Careful endoscopic assessment at the end of any procedure combined with a chest X-ray will identify many cases of perforation immediately. If not recognised immediately, then early and late suspected perforations should be assessed by a water-soluble contrast swallow. If this is negative, a dilute barium swallow should be considered. A CT scan can be used to replace a contrast swallow or as an adjunct to accurately delineate specific fluid collections. (Bailey 25th ed page 1015)Diagnosis of an esophageal perforation may be made radiographically. A chest roentgenogram may demonstrate a hydropneumothorax. A contrast esophagram is done using barium for a suspected thoracic perforation and Gastrografin for an abdominal perforation. Barium is inert in the chest but causes peritonitis in the abdomen, whereas aspirated Gastrografin can cause life-threatening pneumonitis. A surgical endoscopy needs to be performed if the esophagram is negative or if operative intervention is planned. (Ref: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 41)",D

Paget's disease commonly develops in which age group ?,1st decade,3rd decade,5th decade,7th decade,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 5th decade Paget's disease (Osteitis deformans) Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (veebrae) and clavicle the next commonest. Paget's disease occurs after 40 years of age and is more common in males.",C

Excretory Urography (IVU or IVP) - Campbell 11th edition P1151 Historically, excretory urography was the most commonly used modality to evaluate genitourinary injuries. Largely replaced by CT, a limited role includes the intra-operative ""sigle-shot"" IVP. The indications are uncommon, but when the surgeon encounters an unexpected retroperitoneal hematoma surrounding a kidney during abdominal exploration, the study can provide essential information. The main purpose of the one-shot IVP is to assess the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney and to radiologically stage the injured side. If findings are not normal or near normal , the kidney should be explored to complete the staging of the injury and reconstruct any abnormality found In the given problem, patient is having a non-pulsatile hematoma, which is not an indication for surgical exploration. On table IVU was done to see the functionn of contralateral kidney, the function of opposite kidney should be aseained before planning nephrectomy in any trauma patient.

It occurs in approximately 3 in 1000 live birth and is the most common surgical cause of vomiting in infancy.
M> F (4 : 1)*
Characteristically the first born male child is affected.


The condition is most commonly seen at 4 wks after birth ranging from the 3rd wk to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from birth, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after birth.


Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fourth week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t.
These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions.

All of the following factors fascilitate non union except:,Haematoma formation,Periosteal injuries,Absence of nerve supply,Chronic infection,"A i.e. Hematoma formation Fracture healing process passes through several stages. In which the, first is stage of hematoma formationQ and the last is stage of remodelingQ Fracture Healing Bone is a unique tissue because it heals by the formation of normal bone, as opposed to scar tissue. Infact it is considered a nonunion when a bone heals by fibroblastic response. The majority of fractures heal by secondary (callus) healing through a combination of intramembranous - ossification (hard callus formation) & endochondral ossificaion (soft callus formation). Bone healing can be divided into following phases depending on the biological events. * There are two sources of repair tissues (callus), medullary & periosteal. The former is most marked in cancellous hone, while the later predominates in diaphyseal fracture. Periosteal callus may be of two types - primary callus (from DOPC) & external bridging callus (from IOPC), its appearance is inhibited by rigid fixation as plate and is predominant form of healing in cast immobilization &intramedullary nailing. (i.e. micromovements present) * Late medullary callus is more dependent on intramedullary vascularity (not on external soft trissue) and is impoant in fractures immobilized by rigid plating (i.e. no micrmovements)* Phenomenon of Creeping Substitution occurs in cancellous bone (i.e. blood vessels invading the trabeculae of bone directly causing bone apposition)* The modification of previously undifferentiated soft tissue cells in to osteogenic cells (IOPC) is termed bone induction.",A
Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas?,Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Microcystic adenoma Mucinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (approx 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mutinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA ( Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference from IPMN where tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",A

"Delirium, mental confusion and nausea in patients who had undergone transurethral resection of prostate suggests: September 2009, September 2012",Hypernatremia,Sepsis,Hepatic coma,Water retention,"Ans. D: Water retention Water intoxication occurs in TURP. Significant amounts of fluid may be absorbed during a TURP, especially if venous sinuses are opened early or when the operation is prolonged. On average during a TURP, approximately 20 mL of fluid per minute is absorbed, or approximately 1000-1200 mL in the first hour of resecting time. One third of this fluid is absorbed directly into the venous system. This may lead to dilutional hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), which causes mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, hemolysis, hemoglobin nephropathy, coma, and shock. Symptoms of TUR syndrome generally do not occur until the serum sodium level has decreased to 125 mEq or less. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. Hemodynamically, this is characterized initially by increased central venous pressures, hypeension, bradycardia, and other signs of early vascular overload, including restlessness, tachypnea, and sometimes dusky skin changes of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, or fingernails. The incidence of this condition has been reduced since the introduction of isotonic glycine for performing the resections and the use of isotonic saline for postoperative irrigations.",D
Gall blader stone formation in influenced by AJE -,Clofibrate therapy,Hyperalimentation,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Hypercholesterolemia,"Hyper alimentation - decreases gall bladder motility, promotes stasis
Primary biliary cirrhosis - decreases bile salt secretion into bile
Clofibrate therapy - increases biliary cholesterol
thus these factors predispose to cholesterol stone formation.

Predisposing factors for cholesterol gall stone formation are
1. Demographic/genetic factors

Prevalence highest in North American Indians, Chilean Indians and Chilean Hispanics, greater in Northern Europe and North America than in Asia, lowest in Japan; familial disposition; hereditary aspects.

2. Obesity

Normal bile acid pool and secretion but increased biliary secretion of cholesterol

3.    Weight loss

Mobilization of tissue cholesterol leads to increased biliary cholesterol secretion while enterohepatic circulation of bile acid is increased

4. Female sex hormones

Estrogens stimulate hepatic lipoprotein receptors, increases uptake of dietary cholesterol, and increase biliary cholesterol secretion
Natural estrogens, other estrogens, and oral contraceptives lead to decreased bile salt secretion and decreased conversion of cholesterol to cholesteryl esters.

5. Increasing age

Increased biliary secretion of cholesterol, decreased size of bile acid pool, decreased secretion of bile salts.

6. Gallbladder hypomotility leading to stasis and formation of sludge

Prolonged parenteral nutrition
Fasting
Pregnancy
Drugs such as octreotide

7. Clofibrate therapy

Increased biliary secretion of cholesterol

8.    Decreased bile acid secretion

A man sustained injury and presented with fluid coming out through nose. What could be the possible fracture: March 2007,Fracture base of skull,Fracture of mandible,Fracture of maxilla,None of the above,"Ans. A: Fracture base of skull A basilar skull fracture/Basal skull fracture) is a linear skull fracture involving the base of the skull. It is most often associated with leakage in the cerebrospinal fluid of the brain into the ear (CSF otorrhea) or the nose (CSF rhinorrhea). These signs are pathognomonic for basilar skull fracture. Basilar skull fractures commonly involve the roof of the orbits, the sphenoid bone, or poions of the temporal bone. Due to the proximity of the cranial nerves, injury to those nerves may occur.This can cause palsy of the facial nerve or oculomotor nerve or hearing loss due to damage of cranial nerve VIII. Clinical manifestations: Battle's sign - is ecchymosis of the mastoid process of the temporal bone.

"In some old fractures, cailaginous tissue forms over the fractured bone ends with a cavity in between containing clear fluid. This condition is known as:",Delayed union,Slow union,Non union,Pseudahrosis,"Pseudahrosis is a false joint that may develop after a fracture that has not united properly due to inadequate immobilization. Inadequate immobilization permits constant movements at the fracture site so that the normal constituents of callus do not form consequently the callus may be composed mainly of fibrous tissue cailage, perpetuating the instability and resulting in delayed union or nonunion. If a non union allows for too much motion along the fracture gap, the central poion of the callus undergoes cystic degeneration and luminal surface can actually become lined by synol like cells, creating a false joint filled with clear fluid. This is known as pseudahrosis.

"A 40-year-old woman with inflammatory bowel disease has been receiving TPN for over 3 weeks. Workup reveals pelvic abscess. She undergoes exploratory laparotomy, resection of small bowel with anastomosis, and drainage of pelvic abscess. During surgery, TPN is maintained at the original rate of 125 mL/h. In the recovery room, the patient is found to have a urine output of 200 mL/h. CVP is 1, and laboratory results are Na,149;K,3.5;Cl,110;HCO3,18; BUN, 40; and creatinine, 1 mg/dL. Which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?",The patient's urine output is secondary to fluid overload during surgery.,The patient is in high-output renal failure.,Hyperosmolar-nonketotic coma will develop if the condition is not aggressively treated.,Diuresis is a normal response to stress of surgery.,"Hyperosmolar-nonketotic coma is a serious complication seen when an excessive amount of glucose is given, especially in the presence of sepsis, steroids, or inadequate insulin. Furthermore, the combination of surgery and sepsis results in an increased insulin- resistant state. The increased urine output is secondary to osmolar load from blood glucose. Low CVP, hypernatremia, and BUN-to- creatinine ratio over 20 suggest hypovolemia and not fluid overload. Normal creatinine level and BUN-to-creatinine ratio over 20 rules out high-output renal failure. The stress of surgery is characterized by water retention and not diuresis. Management consists of aggressive hydration, discontinuation of TPN, and insulin drip. Insulin drives the potassium intracellularly and potassium must be replaced.",C

The radial head is dislocated and the proximal third of the ulna is fractured. Select the type of fracture or dislocation with which it is most likely to be associated (SELECT 1 INJURY),Navicular (scaphoid) fracture,Monteggia's deformity,Greenstick fracture,Spiral fracture,"Fractures of the navicular bone of the wrist should be suspected in anyone, particularly a young person, who falls on an outstretched hand. Although x-rays are mandatory, it is important to realize that the fracture may not be seen on the initial x-ray and that a presumptive diagnosis can and should be made on clinical grounds alone. Typically, there will be tenderness to palpation over the navicular tuberosity and limitation of wrist flexion and extension. Immobilization of the wrist for about 16 week and sometimes up to 6 month is required. Nonunion or avascular necrosis is not uncommon and may require bone grafting for correction.Dislocation of the radial head with a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna is known as Monteggia's deformity. Usually, the radial head is dislocated anteriorly. The injury is usually caused by forced pronation. The injury can be treated by reduction and stabilization of the ulna followed by reduction of the radial head via supination and direct pressure.Anterior shoulder dislocations occur more frequently than posterior dislocations. However, posterior dislocations are seen in special situations, such as during an epileptiform convulsion and during electroshock therapy. Closed reduction followed by immobilization is usually sufficient therapyA spiral fracture, frequently seen in the tibia in skiers, results from the application of torque to a long bone. Greenstick fractures are common in children.

True about branchial anomaly:,Cysts are more common than sinuses,For sinuses surgery is not always indicated,Cysts present with dysphagia and hoarseness of voice,Most commonly due to 2nd branchial remnant,"Most commonly due to 2nd branchial remnants Repeat, from Nov 09 & Nov 06 Branchiogenic Anomalies Branchial anomalies are remnants of the branchial apparatus present during the embryonic life. Embryologically the structures of head and neck are derived from 5 pairs of branchial arches, their intervening clefts externally and pouches internally. A tract of branchial origin may form a complete fistula, or one end may be obliterated to form an external or internal sinus, or both ends may resorb forming a cyst. 2nd branchial remnant are the most common 1st branchial remnants are typically located in front or back of the ear or in the upper neck in the region of the mandible. Fistulas typically commence through the parotid gland and end in the external auditory canal. 2nd branchial cleft remnants cause fistulas/sinuses with external opening along anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal opening at the tonsillar fossa (The fistulous track passes in b/w internal & external carotid aeries) 3rd branchial cleft remnants usually do not have associated sinuses or fistulas and are located in the suprasternal notch or clavicular region. These most often contain cailage and present clinically as a firm mass or as a subcutaneous abscess. Rarely sinus may occur which open internally into pyrifon sinus. Branchiogenic anomalies occur with equal frequency on each side of the neck and 15% are bilateral. Clinical presentation - By definition, all branchial remnants are present at the time of bih although they may not become clinically evident until later in life. - Fistulas and sinus present at bih whereas cysts usually appear in late childhood and adults. - Fistulas and sinuses usually discharge a mucoid or purulent material - The cysts are characteristically found anterior and deep to the upper third of the sternocleidomastoid (interior to the angle of mandible) - Sinuses and cysts are prone to become repeatedly infected producing cellulitis and abscess formation. Treatment - Almost all branchial abnormalities should be excised early in life since repeated infection is common making resection more difficult. - Complete removal of the cyst and tract is necessary for cure and preventing recurrence. - A series of two or sometimes three small transverse incisions in a ''stepladder' fashion is preferred to a long oblique incision in the neck, which is cosmetically undesirable. About option 'a' - 'Cysts are more common than sinuses' - I am not sure what are more common. Sabiston write that in children ,fistulas are more common than sinuses which are more common than cysts.

A reasonable approach to this problem is to remove several sutures and gently explore the wound to determine the extent of the dehiscence. A small fascial dehiscence (1-2 cm) can be treated conservatively with local wound care and an abdominal binder to support the fascia. A larger dehiscence requires reoperation for formal reclosure of the fascia. High-risk patients with a large fascial dehiscence may be treated with an abdominal binder and modified bed rest, which allows both intraabdominal adhesion formation and local granulation. Although fascial dehiscence can occur from local infection, it is usually not an infectious process and does not require parenteral antibiotic therapy.",C

There is no role of medical t/t.
the basic operation is inguinal herniotomy which entails dissecting out and opening the hernial sac, reducing any contents and then transfixing the neck of the sac and removing the remainder.
herniotomy is employed either by itself or as the .first step in a repair procedure (herniorrhaphy). By itself herniotomy is sufficient for the treatment of hernias in infants, adolescents and young adults.

Deep inguinal ring

is situated 1.25 cm above the inguinal ligament, midway b/w the symphysis pubis & ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) 
Deep inguinal ring is an opening in the fascia transversalis

Superficial inguinal ring

lies immediately above the pubic tubercle as a triangle with its centre 1 cm above and lateral to the pubic tubercle
Superficial inguinal ring is a triangular gap in the external oblique aponeurosis.

Richter's hernia

In Richter's hernia only a part of the circumference of the bowel enters the hernial sac, therefore complete obstruction and absolute constipation is rare, even after the hernial contents get incarcerated and strangulated.
Bailey writes ""Strangulated Richter's hernia is particularly noteworthy as operation is frequently delayed because the clinical features mimic gastroenteritis. The local signs of strangulation are often not obvious, the patient may not vomit and, while colicky pain is present, the bowels are often opened normally or there may be diarrhea; absolute constipation is delayed until paralytic ileus sup ervenes.
For these reasons gangrene of the kunckle of bowel and perforation have often occurred before operation is undertaken""",C

• TURP (Gold standard) :
−− Cystoscopic removal of strips of prostatic tissue using diathermy loop. Two techniques; NESBIT technique (preferred maver mayer technique)
−− Best irrigant fluid is 1.5% glycine (Electrolyte solutions like NaCl are not compatible with electrocautery, so not used).
−− Glycine is composed of glycolic acid and ammonium, which can cause CNS (visual) toxicity.
TURIS: TUR in saline using bipolar cautery
• Verumontanum is the single most important anatomical landmark in TURP.
• Verumontanum lies immediately proximal to external sphincter and serve as the distal landmark for prostate resection to prevent injury to the external sphincter.
• Verumontanum: Distal landmark for prostate resection.
• Verumontanum: Landmark for proximal limit of external sphincter.
−− Risks of TURP: Retrograde ejaculation (75%)Q, impotence (5–10%) and incontinence (< 1%).
−− Complications: Bleeding, urethral stricture or bladder neck contracture, perforation of the prostate capsule with extravasation, and if severe, TUR syndrome.
TUR syndrome (Dilutional hyponatremia or water intoxication)
• TUR syndrome (Dilutional hyponatremia or water intoxication) resulting from a hypervolemic, hyponatremic state due to absorption of the hypotonic irrigating solution.
• Clinical Features: Nausea, vomiting, confusion, hypertension, bradycardia, and visual disturbances.
• The risk increases with resection times > 90 minutes or gland size > 75 gm.
• Treatment includes diuresis (furosemide) and in severe cases, hypertonic saline (3%) administration.
Late Complications of TURP
• Bladder neck stenosis (4%) > Urethral stricture (3.6%)
• Bladder neck stenosis is seen more often with small (< 30 gm) fibrotic prostates.
• Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP):
−− For posterior commissure hyperplasia (elevated bladder neck), involves two incisions using the Collins knife at the 5- and 7-o’clock positions.
−− The incisions are started just distal to the ureteral orifices and are extended outward to the verumontanum.
• TUIP lowers the incidence of bladder neck contracture when compared to TURP, so TUIP should be strongly considered in patients with smaller gland in place of TURP.
• TUIP is used for smaller (20 gm) prostate, young patients.
• Decreased incidence of retrograde ejaculation as compared to TURP.
• Open simple prostatectomy: Glands > 75 gm, concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.
−− Suprapubic prostatectomy: Performed transvesically (Frayer’s) and operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology (Bladder stones or diverticulum).
−− Retropubic prostatectomy (Millin’s): Transverse incision is made in surgical capsule of prostate and enucleation is done.
−− Perineal prostatectomy (Youngs): Abandoned now

True regarding indirect inguinal hernia are all except: March 2008,Most common type of hernia,Always unilateral,Inguinal herniotomy is the basic operation,Transillumination distinguishes it from hydrocele,"Ans. B: Always unilateral Indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia and occurs commonly in the young In the first decade it is more common on the right side. The hernia is bilateral in 12% of cases. In boys, differentiating between a hernia and a hydrocele is not always easy. Transillumination has been advocated as a means of distinguishing between the presence of a sac filled with fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele) and the presence of bowel in the scrotal sac. However, in cases of inguinal hernia incarceration, transillumination may not be beneficial because any viscera that is distended and fluid-filled in the scrotum of a young infant may also transilluminate. A rectal examination may be helpful if intestine can be felt descending through the internal ring. * Silk sign: When the hernia sac is palpated over the cord structures, the sensation may be similar to that of rubbing 2 layers of silk together.

Most common pituitary adenomas are prolactinomas.
Pituitary adenomas can be differentiated from hyperplasia by reticulin stain (Absence of reticulin network is seen in adenoma)
Pituitary adenomas are sellar lesions but larger adenomas can extend through the diaphragm sella into the suprasellar region and compress the optic chiasm (causing visual field abnormalities) and other cranial nerves.

It is the most common cause of hyperpituitarism.
Pituitary adenomas can be

- functional (i.e. associated with hormone excess and their clinical manifestations) or
- silent (i.e. without clinical symptoms of hormone excess. May or may not produce hormone)

Prolactinomas are the most common adenomas
Some pituitary adenomas can secrete two hormones - Growth hormone and prolactin being the most common combination
Rarely adenomas are plurihormonal
Age : usually found in adults
Gender

Prolactinomas have 4-5 : 1 female/male ratio

Management of labile diabetes0. Availability of health care professionals with appropriate expeisedeg. Patients who have kidney transplantation for diabetic nephropathydeg. Why is intensive management avoided in diabetes with autonomic neuropathy ???. Remember that hypoglycemia due to insulin ingestion is an impoant and dangerous side effect of diabetes therapy (especially in Diabetes type I) Diabetic patients who are on insulin are at an ongoing risk of hypoglycemia due to overingestion of insulin. Severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, but founately the patient quickly recognizes the symptoms of hypoglycemia before such serous levels are attained and abos the episodes of hypoglycemia by eating. Symptoms of hypoglycemia are produced due to the release of counterregulatory hormones. This is a physiological response. An intact autonomic nervous system is necessary for this counterragulatoty hormonal responses. So if the autonomic nervous system is not functioning properly patient cannot produce counterregulatory hormonal response, Thus he will not be able to experience hypoglycemia (hypoglycemic unawareness) and thus will not he able to abo the episodes of hypoglycemia. Thus hypoglycemia will reach dangerous levels jeopardizing the life of the patient. ""Advanced adrenergic neuropathy as evidenced by ohostatic hypotension, generally leads to decreased epinephrine secretion after hypoglycemia.

True regarding umbilical hernia is/are all except?,Mostly congenital,More common in males,Occurs due to increased intrabdominal pressure,Occurs via rectus abdominis diastesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., More common in malesoAn umbilical hernia mostly congetital, is a hernia present at the site of the umbilicus through a persistent umbilical ring.oBoys and girls are equally affected in congenital where as acquired is three times more common in women than in men. An acquired umbilical hernia directly results from increased intra-abdominal pressure.oIn congenital umbilical hernia, which is especially common in premature infants, the intestines return normally into the body cavity, but the musculature (rectus abdominis) of the ventral abdominal wall fails to close the umbilical ring (diastasis recti), thus allowing a varying amount of omentum or bowel to protrude through.oIf these hernias are asymptomatic, reducible, and don't enlarge, no surgery is needed (and in other cases it must be considered).Umbilical herniaoAn umbilical hernia, mostly congetital, is a hernia present at the site of the umbilicus through a persistent umbilical ring. The hernia sac is peritoneum, which is frequently adherent to the dermis of the umbilical skin. It can be congenital or acquired.oIn congenital umbilical hernia, which is especially common in premature infants, the intestines return normally into the body cavity, but the musculature (rectus abdominis) of the ventral abdominal wall fails to close the umbilical ring (diastasis recti), thus allowing a varying amount of omentum or bowel to protrude through.A) Congenital#More common type. Congenital umbilical hernia is a congenital malformation of umbilicus.; Common in infants. Low birth weight and premature infants are also more likely to have an umbilical hernia. Boys and girls are equally affected. It is also found to be more common in children of African descent.#Virtually all pediatric umbilical hernias are congenital.B) Acquired#Occur among adults. It is three times more common in women than in men.#An acquired umbilical hernia directly results from increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by obesity, heavy lifting, a long history of coughing, or multiple pregnancies. Another type of acquired umbilical hernias are incisional hernias, which are hernia developing in a scar following abdominal surgery, e.g. after insertion of laparoscopy trocars through the umbilicus.#Strangulation is uncommon.PresentationoHernias may be asymptomatic and present only as a bulge of the umbilicus. Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents. This results in abdominal pain or discomfort. These symptoms may be worsened by the patient lifting or straining.oIf a physician gently pushes on the bulge when a child is lying down and calm, it will usually get smaller or go back into the abdomen.oIncarceration refers to the inability to reduce the hernia back into the abdominal cavity because intestines get trapped within the umbilical hernia. Prolonged incarceration can lead to tissue ischemia (strangulation) and shock when untreated Sometimes the. When this occurs, the child usually has severe pain and the bulge may be firm and red.oThe size of the base of the herniated tissue is inversely correlated with risk of strangulation (i.e., a narrow base is more likely to strangulate).TreatmentoAlthough sometimes quite large, these hernias tend to resolve without any treatment by around the age of 2-3 years. Surgery is needed if they do not close by themselves by the age of 5 years.oIf these hernias are asymptomatic, reducible, and don't enlarge, no surgery is needed (and in other cases it must be considered).",B

Mondor's disease is?,Congenital breast disease,Carcinoma breast,Radiation induced carcinoma breast,Superficial thrombophlebitis of breast,"ANSWER: (D) Superficial thrombophlebitis of breastREF: Schwartz 9th ed chapter 17MQNDOR'S DISEASEMondor's disease is a variant of thrombophlebitis that involves the superficial veins of the anterior chest wall and breast. In 1939, Mondor described the condition as ""string phlebitis ,"" a thrombosed vein presenting as a tender, cord-like structure. Frequently involved veins include the lateral thoracic vein, the thoracoepigastric vein, and, less commonly, the superficial epigastric vein. Typically, a woman presents with acute pain in the lateral aspect of the breast or the anterior chest wall. A tender, firm cord is found to follow the distribution of one of the major superficial veins. Rarely, the presentation is bilateral, and most women have no evidence of thrombophlebitis in other anatomic sites. This benign, self-limited disorder is not indicative of a cancer. When the diagnosis is uncertain, or when a mass is present near the tender cord, biopsy is indicated. Therapy for Mondor's disease includes the liberal use of anti-inflammatory medications and application of warm compresses along the symptomatic vein. Restriction of motion of the ipsilateral extremity and shoulder as well as brassiere support of the breast are important. The process usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks. When symptoms persist or are refractory to therapy, excision of the involved vein segment is appropriate.",D

The surgical treatment for peptic ulcer disease has changed dramatically. The elective operations for peptic ulcer disease have been viually eliminated! Antibiotics have become primary anti-ulcer therapy with the realization that in most cased, peptic ulceration is an infectious disease. Operative interventions are now reserved for complications of the ulcer disease. 3 complications are most common: - hemorrhage - perforation - obstruction For gastric ulcers, surgical indications also include intractability or nonhealing of the ulcer because of the risk of cancer. Management of hemorrhage: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the intial diagnostic test if peptic ulcer is suspected, following resuscitation. Endoscopy is able to identify the site and source of bleeding in over 90 % of patients. First line of treatment for bleeding ulcer is endoscopic hemostasis. Methods of endoscopic therapy include: -Thermal coagulation by bipolar electrocoagulation or - Direct application of heat through a heater probe or - Injection of epinephrine into the base of the bleeding peptic ulcer Operative intervention is required when -The endoscopic treatment fails - There is massive hemorrhage leading to shock or cardiovascular instability - Prolonged blood loss requiring continuing transfusion - Recurrent hemorrhage requiring hospitalization Emergent operative therapy consists of duodenotomy with direct suture ligagtion of the bleeding vessel in the ulcer base. Post operatively patients are given antibiotic therapy against H. pylori. According to Maingot- role of acid reducing surgeries like vagotomy have decreased significantly. But steps like vagotomy combined with pyloroplasty or antrectomy are still being performed depending on individual preferences to cure the ulcer. Here this patient not controlled by endoscopic methods should undergo emergent surgery consisting of only duodenotomy and bleeding vessel ligation. But since this is not one of the options we would choose the one with the least morbidity. As mentioned above another indication for surgery in gastric ulcer is failure of a recurrent ulcer to respond to medical therapy. This is because of the risk of cancer in nonhealing gastric ulcer (there is no such risk in duodenal ulcer). For benign gastric ulcer, the elective operation of choice is usually a distal gastrectomy including the ulcer with either gastroduodenal (Billroth I) or gastrojejunal (Billroth 11) anastomosis.",C

"Regarding adhesive intestinal obstruction, TRUE is ?",Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours,Never operate,Operate after minimum 10 days of conservative treatment,Immediate operation,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours There are three main measures in the tit of acute intestinal obstruction. These are 1) Gastro intestinal drainage (Nasogastric suction) 2) Fluid and electrolyte replacement 3) Surgery for relief of obstruction The first two steps are always necessary prior to the surgical relief of obstruction. Surgical treatment is necessary for most cases of intestinal obstruction, but it should always be delayed until resuscitation is complete. The timing of surgical intervention is dependent on clinical picture. The classical clinical advice on a case of unrelieved intestinal obstruction is that ""Sun should not both rise and set"" i.e., the operative procedure should not be delayed beyond 24 hrs. But, there are ceain exceptions to this rule. In some cases operation is delayed in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In adhesive intestinal obstruction, usually occuring after surgery the upto 72 hours in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In these cases continued radiological evidence of obstruction.

It may also be seen in ascariasis, malaria, tumour and tuberculosis. Once the lymph channels are blocked, one may open into the kidney hilum or ureter or sometimes into the bladder and chyle can leak into the urinary tract resulting in milky white urine.It may also result in renal colic and hypoproteinemia. Blood sometimes mixes with the urine resulting in haemato-chyluria. Usually the condition is self limiting. If left untreated, chronic chyluria can lead to malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.",D

Either the individual poal structures can be identified and ligated early in the course of the procedure, or simply the entire poal triad can be circled with an umbilical tape tourniquet in preparation for the Pringle maneuver. If temporary poal inflow occlusion is used, intermittent 10 to 20 minute intervals of clamping with 3 to 5 minutes to reestablish blood flow is recommended. The division of the hepatic parenchyma begins with scoring of Glisson's capsule with cautery or knife and proceeds with division of the hepatic surface using either blunt dissection by finger fracture, the blunt edge of an instrument or suction tip, or using an ultrasonic dissector. Individual vessels and bile ducts are cauterized, sutured, or clipped in rapid succession from anterior to posterior. The hepatic veins are encountered in the hepatic substance near the vena cava and are carefully clamped and suture ligated to complete the resection. In addition, there are also several posterior accessory veins (up to 10 in number) which drain the medial aspect of the right lobe and empty directly into the right anterior surface of the IVC.",C

Which of the following explains why individuals with hyperlipidemia and/or gout should minimize their intake of sucrose and high fructose syrups?,Fructose is initially phosphorylated by liver fructokinase,"After intial modification, fructose is cleaved by a specific enolase",Fructose is conveed to UDP-fructose,Fructose is ultimately conveed to galactose,"Fructose is initially phosphorylated by liver fructokinase. Fructose is taken in by humans as sucrose, sucrose-containing syrups, and the free sugar. Fructose is mainly phos-phorylated to fructose-1-phosphate by liver fructokinase. Aldol cleavage by fructose-1-phosphate-specific aldolase, not enolase, yields glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triose kinase, and both triose phosphates can enter glycolysis. Excess fructose from commercial foods can exercise adverse effects by raising blood lipids and uric acid. Fructose phosphorylation bypasses phosphofructokinase, a regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and provides excess glycerol metabolites and excess triglyceride lipid biosynthesis. Fructose phosphorylation can also deplete liver cell ATP, lessening its inhibition of adenine nucleotide degradation and increasing production of uric acid. In adipocytes, fructose can be alternatively phosphorylated by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate. However, this reaction is competitively inhibited by appreciable amounts of glucose, as it is in other tissues.",A

"Shock sets in an adult above what percentage of burns, if untreated",10%,15%,25%,30%,"the overall effect of changes in burns is to produce a net flow of water, solutes and proteins from the intravascular to the extravascular space. As the burn size approaches 10-15 per cent of total body surface area (TBSA), the loss of intravascular fluid can cause a level of circulatory shock. Above 15 percent of the surface area, the loss of fluid produces shockFuhermore, once the area increases to 25 per cent of TBSA, the inflammatory reaction causes a fluid loss in vessels remote from the burn injury.Bailey and love 26e pg: 387",B

All of the following are indicators of adequacy of pre-operative resuscitation except,C-reactive protein level,Consciousness level,Urin output,Hematocrit level,"Pre-Operative Assessment * Full blood count. A full blood count (FBC) is needed for major operations, in the elderly and in those with anaemia or pathology with ongoing blood loss and chronic disease. In case of suspicion or history of sickle crisis, a sickle cell Test is needed in patients of Afro-Caribbean and Indian subcontinent origin. * Urea and electrolytes. Urea and electrolytes (U&Es) are needed before all major operations, in most patients over 65 years of age especially with cardiovascular, renal and endocrine disease, or if significant blood loss is anticipated. It is also needed in those on medications that affect electrolyte levels, e.g. steroids, diuretics, digoxin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intravenous fluid or nutrition therapy and endocrine problems. * Electrocardiography. Electrocardiography (ECG) is required for those patients over 65 years of age and symptomatic patients with a history of rheumatic fever, diabetes, cardiovascular, renal and cerebrovascular disease, with and without severe respiratory problems. It will also depend on if the surgery is minor/intermediate or major. * Chest radiograph. Cost-effectiveness and risks of radiationexposure mean that chest radiographs should be restricted to specific patients, such as those with cardiac failure, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory symptoms, pulmonary cancer, metastasis or effusions or those who are deemed to be at risk of active pulmonary tuberculosis. * Clotting screen. If a patient has a history suggestive of a bleeding diathesis, liver disease, eclampsia, cholestasis or has a family history of bleeding disorder, or is on antithrombotic or anticoagulant agents then coagulation screening will be needed. However, the effects of anti- platelet agents, low molecular weight heparins and newer agents affecting factor Xa cannot be measured by routine Laboratory tests. * Urinalysis. Dipstick testing of urine should be performed on all patients to detect urinary infection, biliuria, glycos- uria and inappropriate osmolality. * b-Human chorionic gonadotrophin. Women of child-bearing age should be asked sensitively about their pregnancy status. If in doubt a laboratory test or a reliable pregnancy kit (low cost) can be used, after obtaining consent from the patient, to avoid danger of exposure to surgery and anaesthesia on the foetus. * Blood glucose and HbA1c. Poor control of diabetes can lead to perioperative infection and slow recovery in patients with diabetes mellitus and endocrine problems. HbA1C indicates how well diabetes has been controlled over a longer duration. Early mobilisation, oral intake and return to routine medication should be the goals in management of diabetes. * Aerial blood gases. A low-cost tool that can give quick and vital information in acute or chronic severe respiratory conditions, acid-base disturbances and conditions where there is changing milieu, e.g. immediately before kidney transplant. * Liver function tests. These are indicated in patients with jaundice, known or suspected hepatitis, cirrhosis, malignancy or in patients with poor nutritional status. * Other investigations.

Dissociated sensory loss in a case of tumor ofcentral spinal cord is due to lesion of:,Dorsal column fibres,Anterior Spinothalmic tract,Decussating fibres of lateral spinothalmic tract,Cilio spinal centre of spinal cord,"Decussating fibres of lateral spinothalmic tract Dissociated sensory loss is a pattern of neurological damage which involves selective loss of pain and temperature with preservation of fine touch and proprioception. Pain and temperature are carried by lateral spinothalmic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord sholy after entering the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral side. Fine touch and proprioception are carried in dorsal column fibres which do not cross the cord until medulla. Since fibers conducting pain and temperature sensation cross the cord in the anterior commissure, a lesion in this location will characteristically abolish these modalities on one or both sides over several segments but will spare the tactile sensation (fine touch and proprioception). This is known as dissociated sensory loss and is a characteristic feature of the Central spinal cord syndrome (Syringomyelic Syndrome). The central spinal cord syndrome is best exemplified by syringomyclia, hydromyelia, hematomyelia, and intramedullary cord tumors.",C

Best way to diagnose gall bladder stones: March 2007,USG,Oral cholecystography,Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography,Intravenous cholangiogram,"Ans. A: USG In Europe and USA 80% of the stones are cholesterol or mixed type. In Asia, 80% of the stones are pigment stones On the basis of their contents, gallstones can be subdivided into the two following types: Cholesterol stones are usually green, but are sometimes white or yellow in color. They are made primarily of cholesterol. Pigment stones are small, dark stones made of bilirubin and calcium salts that are found in bile. Risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemia, cirrhosis, biliary tract infections, and hereditary blood cell disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and spherocytosis. Mixed stones-most of these are a mixture of cholesterol and calcium salts. Because of their calcium content, they can often be visualized radiographically. Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts. Besides a high concentration of cholesterol, two other factors seem to be impoant in causing gallstones: The first factor is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. Increased levels of the hormone estrogen as a result of pregnancy, hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder movement, resulting in gallstone formation. It is most common for a person to have gall stones if (s)he falls under the four F's: Fat, Female, (nearing) Foy, Feile. A diagnosis of gallstone is based on the history and physical examination with confirmatory radiological studies like USG Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved by oral ursodeoxycholic acid. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).",A

Asymptomatic umbilical hernia should be repaired by:,1 year,3 years,5 years,Need not be repaired,"Umbilical hernias are generally asymptomatic protrusions of the abdominal wall. More commonly, the child is asymptomatic and treatment is governed by the size of the defect, the age of the patient, and the concerns of the child and family regarding the cosmetic appearance of the abdomen. When the defect is small and spontaneous closure is likely, most surgeons will delay surgical correction until 4 or 5 years of age. If closure does not occur by this time, it is reasonable to repair the hernia. If a younger child has an extremely large hernia, or if the family or child is bothered by the cosmetic appearance, then repair is indicated.

No papillary structures are identified and neither colloid scalloping nor Huhle cells are present. Most likely diagnosis is?",Colloid carcinoma,Diffuse toxic goiter,Graves disease,Multinodular goiter,"* Goiter is a general clinical term that is used to describe any enlargement of the thyroid. Most patients with goiter are euthyroid (nonfunctional goiter), as hypehyroidism (toxic goiter') is relatively rare, in the early stages of goiter formation, there is diffuse hyperplasia of the small thyroid follicles, which histologically resembles the changes of Graves disease. This early stage is called a diffuse nontoxic goiter or simple goiter. * The thyroid gland then undergoes repeated episodes of involution and hyperplasia. Over time this produces an enlarged multinodular goiter that histologically consists of multiple nodules, some of which consist of colloid-filled enlarged follicles and others of which show hyperplasia of small follicles lined by active epithelium. * There are also areas of fibrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, and cystic degeneration. The last stage of goiter formation consists of nodules composed primarily of enlarged colloid-filled follicles. This stage is called a colloid goiter. * In contrast to the histologiC appearance of multinodular or colloid goiter, diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) is characterized by hyperplasia of the follicular cells with scalloping of colloid at the margin of follicles, while Hashimoto's thyroiditis has a marked Iymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and scattered oxyphilic (Huhle) cells.",D

A patient with autoimmune thyroiditis presents with hypothyroidism. Which of the following is true?,Thyroid peroxidase antibodies,Painful enlargement of thyroid,More common in men,"No risk, of malignancy","Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th: editionExplanation:HASHIMOTO THYROIDITISMost common cause of hypothyroidism in areas of the world where iodine levels are sufficient. Gradual thyroid failure due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.Common age group (45 - 65)Female predominance (10: 1 to 20: 1)Can occur in children and is a major cause of nonendemic goiter.It is associated with polymorphisms in multiple immune regulation-associated genes, the most significant of which is the linkage to cytotoxic T lymphocyte--associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) polymorphisms & Also functional polymorphism in protein tyrosine phosphatase-22 fPTPN22J gene that encodes a lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase, which is also thought to inhibit T- cell function.Susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes has been associated w ith polymorphisms in both Cl'LA 4 and PTPN22.PathogenesisHashimoto thyroiditis is caused by a breakdown in self-tolerance to thyroid auto-antigens.presence of circulating autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidaseInduction of thyroid autoimmunity is accompanied by a progressive depletion of thyrocytes by apoptosis and replacement of the thyroid parenchyma by mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis.MorphologyDiffusely enlargedThe capsule is intact, and the gland is well demarcated from adjacent structures. .Microscopic examination reveals extensive infiltration of the parenchyma by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate containing small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and w ell-developed germinal centersThe thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells distinguished by the presence of abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed Hurthle cells. This is a metaplastic response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to ongoing injury.In fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples, the presence of Hurthle cells in conjunction with a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes is characteristic of Hashimoto thyroiditis.In ""classic'"" Hashimoto thyroiditis, interstitial connective tissue is increased and may be abundant.A fibrous variant is characterized by severe thyroid follicular atrophy and dense ""keloid - like*' fibrosis, broad bands of acellular collagen encompassing residual thyroid tissue.Unlike Reidel thyroiditis, the fibrosis does not extend beyond the capsule of the gland. The remnant thyroid parenchyma demonstrates features of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.Clinical CoursePainless enlargement of the thyroid associated with some degree of hypothyroidismThe enlargement of the gland is usually symmetric and diffuseIn some cases, however, it may be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis caused by disruption of thyroid follicles, with secondary release of thyroid hormones (""hashi toxicosis""). During this phase, free T4 and T3 levels are elevated, TSH is diminished, and radioactive iodine uptake is decreased.As hypothyroidism supervenes. T4 and T3 levels fall, accompanied b\ a compensatory increase in TSH.Increased risk for developing other autoimmune diseases- Endocrine (type 1 diabetes, autoimmune adrenalitis)- Nonendocrine (systemic lupus erythematosus. myasthenia gravis, and Sjogren syndrome)Increased risk for the development of B-eell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, especially marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissuesThe relationship between Hashimoto disease and thyroid epithelial cancers remains controversial, with some morphologic and molecular studies suggesting a predisposition to papillary carcinomas.",A

Catgut is generally prepared from intestinal submucosa of:,Cat,Sheep,Human,Rabbit,"Ans: B (Sheep) Catgyt is generally prepared from submucosa of: Sheep or cattle: L & B 25th/ 238Sheep & beef- Sabiston 18th/271Bovine: CSDTllth/94CATGUT# It is a type of cord that is prepared from the natural fibre found in the walls of animal intestines. Usually sheep or goat intestines are used, but it is occasionally made from the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, ordonkeys.ManufactureCatgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants (cattle,sheep, goats) or from beef tendon2 The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with ethylene oxide gas & is of straw-coloredAlthough the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose.It is a type of surgical suture that is naturally degraded by the body's own proteolytic enzymes. Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly-healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.Catgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, anemia, and malnutrition. It also absorbed faster when used in the mouthand in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms.Catgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as Vicryl and polvdioxanone. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries.In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.VariantsChromic catgut suture is a variant treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch- bolding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full tensile strength is extended to 18-21 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.Fast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.",B

A newborn child presents with inveed foot and the dorsum of the foot cannot touch the anterior tibia. The most probable diagnosis is,Congenital veical talus,Ahrogryposis Multiplex,CTEV,Flat foot,"CTEV [Ref: Maheshwari Ohopaedics 3/e p195; Ebnezar 3/e p454J In a new born child it is possible to dorsiflex and eve the foot till the dorsum of foot touches anterior surface of tibia.This is not possible in CTEV. This is known as 'clorsillexion test' and can be used as a screening test. Ahrogryposis Multiplex Congenita is a rare congenital disorder that is characterized by multiple joint contractures and muscle atrophy and fibrosis. It is a non-progressive disease. CTEV can be seen as one of the components of AMC. So AMC can also be the answer but since it's much rarer than CTEV and in the question other joints involvement is not mentioned, answer would be `CTEV'. Congenital veical talus is a'rare disease usually affecting both feet, characterized by rigid flatfoot deformity, with the plantar aspect of the foot having a convex contour. The heel is in valgus, and the forefoot is abducted and dorsiflexed. In the newborn having this condition, the dorsal aspect of the foot may be in close approximation to the distal aspect of tibia. Flat foot or Pes planus is a condition characterized by varying degrees of loss of the longitudinal arch of the foot. This condition can be normal which usually disappears as the child grows, or can be pathological as seen in Congenital veical talus, tarsal coalition, inflammatory joint disorder or a neurological disorder. Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (Idiopathic club-food -Talipes is a term for any foot deformity that centres around the talus. - Equinus implies that the foot is flexed in the plantar direction. - Varus implies that the foot is inveed and adducted so that the sole faces inwards. CTEV is a complex deformity of the foot where the foot is both turned and twisted inwards so that the sole faces posteromedially. Deformities noted are: - plantar flexion (equines) - in version - adduction - supination - sometimes cavus (high medial arch) The involved foot is generally smaller than the opposite side with varying amounts of calf atrophy. More common in boys (2:1) Bilateral in 1/3 cases.(Ret Apley's Ohopaedics 11/e 591) Clinical tests in CTEV: 1)Dorsiflexion test: described above. 2)Plumbline test: This test helps to detect the tibial torsion. The child is made to sit on a table with both the lower limbs hanging from the edge. A line drawn from the centre of the patella to the tibial tubercle when extended down, should cut the foot at the first or second intermetatarsal space normally. This is called the pulmline. In CTEV, with medial rotation of the tibia. the plumbline cuts the zith or 5th intermetatarsal space. 3)Scratch test: This test is performed to detect muscle imbalance in an infant who cannot obey commands. - Medial scratch test- In a normal child when the medial sole is scratched, the foot eves. The tests the peroneals. - Lateral scratch test- When the lateral sole is scratched, the child inves the foot. This tests the inveors. X-ray: Radiographs AP and Lateral are obtained in maximally corrected position. The talo-calcaneal angle (Kite's angle) obtained in both AP and lateral views is reduced in CTEV.",C

Possible diagnosis is -",Ileocaecal tuberculosis,Diverticulosis,Intussusception,Carcinoid,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ileocaecal tuberculosis o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms :# Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis# Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis.A) Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate.o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumeno It usually occurs in the ileocecal region.Clinical features# Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea.# Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mass in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.# Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction.Barium meal radiography will reveal# Persistent narrowing of the affected segment i.e. the terminal ileum and the caecum.# The caecum is pulled up * and may become subhepatic.# As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caecal angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecal angle is 900. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 1500.*Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.# ATT is given in both cases.# If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)B) Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis)o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved.o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt losso Barium meal shows absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment.Treatment# A course of A TT is adequate# Operation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",A

What will you do for monitoring of treatment aEUR'",Venereal disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL),TPI,FTS-AB,ELISA,"VDRL The history of the patient suggests neurosyphilis. Diagnosis of Neurosvphilis No definitive tool / test exists to establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with 100% accuracy. Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C.S.F. finding and serological tests. C.S.F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - ""The VDRL C.S.F. test is the standard serological test for C.S.F. and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis"". -Since invasion of C.S.F by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C.S.F.. VDRL test can be performed on C.S.F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL*for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why ??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C.S.F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C.S.F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The CS.F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive .for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot he used in neurosyphilis.

LDH


Beta HCG - concentration is increased in both seminoma & non-seminoma
AFP - concentration is increased in only non-seminoma
LDH - is increased in both, it is not as specific as either of AFP or Beta HCG.

Animal and clinical studies have shown that administration of lactated Ringer's solution to patients with hypovolemic shock may,Increase serum lactate concentration,Impair liver function,Improve hemodynamics by alleviating the deficit in the interstitial fluid compartment,Increase metabolic acidosis,"Infusion of lactated Ringer's solution is an effective immediate step, both clinically and experimentally, in managing hypovolemic shock. Use of this balanced salt solution helps correct the fluid deficit (in the extracellular, extravascular compartment) resulting from hypovolemic shock. This procedure may decrease requirements for whole blood in patients with hemorrhagic shock. If blood loss has been minimal and is controlled, whole blood transfusion may be avoided entirely. The theoretical objection to infusion of lactated Ringer's solution is that it will increase lactate levels and compound the problem of lactic acidosis. This has not been borne out in animal or clinical studies. Along with the hemodynamic improvement that follows volume restitution, liver function improves, lactate metabolism is improved, excess lactate levels drop, and metabolic acidosis improves.",C

The most common type of mode of meniscal injury is,Extension of knee,Flexion of knee,Flexion and rotation movement,Extension and rotation of movement,"C i.e. Flexion & rotation movement The twisting force (rotation) in a weight bearing flexed knee is the commonest mode of meniscal (semilunar cailage) injuryQ. Menisci follow the tibial condyles during flexion & extension, but during rotation, they follow the femur and move on the tibia; consequently the medial meniscus becomes distoed. Its anterior and posterior attachments follow the tibia, but its intervening pa follows the femur, thus it is likely to be injured during rotation. However, the lateral meniscus b/o firm attachment to popliteus muscle, ligament of Wrisberg or Humphry, follows the lateral femoral condyle during rotation and therefore is less likely to be injured. In addition popliteus muscle, by way of arcuate ligament, draws the posterior segment of lateral meniscus backward there by preventing it from being caught between the condyles of femur & plateau of tibia when tibia is rotated internally and knee is flexed(2.",C

True about thermal burn injury:,Zone of stasis is the innermost layer,Zone of hyperaemia is the middle layer,Zone of coagulation is the outermost layer,Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage,"Ans is D (Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage) Pathophysiology of Burns Burn causes coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and underlying tissues, with the depth depending on the temperature to which the skin is exposed and the duration of exposure. The area of cutaneous injury has been divided into three zones: zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia Zone of coagulation: The volume injured most severely, in the center of the wound, is the zone of coagulation. This is the area of necrosis where the cells have been disrupted. The tissue is irreversibly damaged at the time of injury. Zone of stasis: Outside the zone of coagulation is the zone of stasis. The zone of stasis is ischemic but potentially salvageable. Depending on the wound environment, can either survive or progress to coagulative necrosis. The zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage and vessel leakage.. Zone of hyperaemia: Beyond the zone of stasis lies the zone of hyperaemia This area is characterized by minimal cell injury but with vasodilatation due to neighboring inflammation-induced mediators. This region contains clearly ble tissue from which the healing process begins and is generally not at risk for fuher necrosis. In practice, attentive wound care and careful fluid resuscitation may salvage the zone of stasis and prevent a superficial injury from becoming full thickness",D

Classification of Surgical Wounds
Clean Wound (Class I)

include those in which no infection is present; only skin microflora potentially contaminate the wound. No hollow viscus is entered. No inflammation
examples: Hernia repair, breast biopsy

Clean/contaminated wounds (Class II)

include those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary or genitourinary tracts with indigenous bacterial flora is opened, but under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. No inflammation.
examples: Cholecystectomy, elective GI surgery.

Contaniinated.wounds (Class III)

include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with the extensive introduction of bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major breaks in sterile technique (eg. open cardiac massage); uncontrolled spillage of viscous contents such as from the intestine. Inflammation is apparent
examples: Penetrating abdominal trauma, large tissue injury, enterotomy during bowel obstruction.

Dirty wounds (Class IV)

include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occurred and in which necrotic tissue is present. Includes wounds in which pus is present. Includes those wounds created to access a perforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. Severe inflammation is seen

"Radiographic studies of a 2 year old child brought to an emergency room reveal a new fracture of the humerus and evidence of multiple old fractures in ribs and long bones of the extremities.

A very careful, directed, physical examination reveals that the toddler has ""peculiar teeth,"" a blue tinge to the sclera, and unusually mobile joints. The disease that the physician suspects the child has is characterized by an abnormality of which of the following biochemical functions?",Collagen type I synthesis,Collagen type II synthesis,Collagen type III synthesis,Collagen type IV synthesis,"The child has the most common variant (type I) of osteogenesis imperfecta, which is an autosomal dominant genetic defect in the synthesis of type I collagen, due to decreased synthesis of the procollagen alpha1(1) amino acid chain. This defect (unlike that of the perinatal, lethal, type II form of osteogenesis imperfecta) is compatible with survival, but does cause skeletal fragility, dentinogenesis imperfecta (abnormal teeth), blue sclera, joint laxity, and hearing impairment. Unfounately, a number of families with this defect have had their children removed because of ""abuse,"" only to find that the broken bones continue in the new environment. Type I collagen is found in skin, bone, tendons, and most other organs. Type II collagen is found in cailage and vitreous humor. Type III collagen is found in blood vessels, uterus, and skin. Type IV collagen makes basement membranes. Ref: Barbul A., Efron D.T. (2010). Chapter 9. Wound Healing. In F.C. Brunicardi, D.K. Andersen, T.R. Billiar, D.L. Dunn, J.G. Hunter, J.B. Matthews, R.E.

Treatment of Simple rib fracture includes following EXCEPT,Analgesics,Physiotherapy,Early ambulation,Strapping of chest,"Ans. d. (Strapping of chest) (Ref Bailey and Love 25th/343)Localised rib fracture due to direct trauma. A simple rib fracture may be serious in elderly people or in those with chronic lung disease who have little pulmonary reserve. Uncomplicated fractures require sufficient analgesia to encourage a normal respiratory pattern and effective coughing. Oral analgesia may suffice but intercostal nerve blockade with local anesthesia may be very helpful. Chest strapping or bed rest is no longer advised and early ambulation with vigorous physiotherapy (and oral antibiotics if necessary) is encouraged. A chest radiograph is always taken to exclude an underlying pneumothorax. It is useful to confirm the skeletal injuries but routine chest radiography may miss rib fractures. However, once a pneumothorax and major skeletal injuries are excluded, the management is the same - the local control of chest pain.THE COMPONENTS OF CHEST INJURY IN BLUNT TRAUMAMajor chest wall traumaa. Flail chest: This occurs when several adjacent ribs are fractured in two places either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum. The flail segment moves paradoxically, that is, inwards during inspiration and outwards during expiration, thereby reducing effective gas exchange. The net result is poor oxygenation from injury to the underlying lung parenchyma and paradoxical movement of the flail segment. This creates a right-to-left shunt and prevents full saturation of arterial blood. In the absence of any other injuries and, if the segment is small and not embarrassing respiration, the patient may be nursed on a high-dependency unit with regular blood gas analysis and good analgesia until the flail segment stabilises. In the more severe case, endotracheal intubation is required with positive pressure ventilation for up to 3 weeks, until the fractures become less mobile. Thoracotomy with fracture fixation is occasionally appropriate if there is an underlying lung injury to be treated at the same time. An anterior flail segment with the sternum moving paradoxically with respiration can be stabilised by internal fixation but operative management is not usual for either.b. First rib fracturec. Fractures of the sternum.d. Vertebraee. Pleuraf. Traumatic pneumothoraxg. Continuing blood loss in excess of 200 mL/hour may require urgent thoracotomy within the first few hours.h. Lung contusion.It is important to prevent infection of the underlying lung by early mobilisation (if the patient's condition permits), prophylactic antibiotics, suction drainage and physiotherapy.MANAGEMENT OF BLUNT CHEST TRAUMAMost chest injuries where the heart is not injured are managed conservatively with underwater seal drainage if necessary, and oxygen and physiotherapy to help the patient to expectorate while the underlying lung parenchyma heals. In about 10 per cent of cases a thoracotomy is required. The indications for thoracotomy following blunt thoracic trauma are the following:# 50--1000 mL of blood at the time of initial drainage is common and may need no further action, but greater volumes, especially if the blood is fresh, require intervention;# continued brisk bleeding (>100 mL/15 minutes) from the intercostal drains indicates a serious breach of the lung parenchyma and urgent exploration is required;# continued bleeding of >200 mL/hour for 3 or more hours may require thoracotomy under controlled conditions;# rupture of the bronchus, aorta, esophagus or diaphragm;# cardiac tamponade (if needle aspiration is unsuccessful).All explorations following trauma should have double-lumen tube endotracheal intubation to facilitate surgery on the injured side and to protect the undamaged lung.",D

There are no other findings except for bony enlargement at the distal interphalangeal joint. The patient is 5 feet 9 in. tall and weighs 88 kgs. The best way to prevent disease progression is,Weight reduction,NSAID's and Calcium supplementation,Total knee replacement,Oral prednisone,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1987-1993.) The clinical picture of a noninflammatory ahritis of weight-bearing joints is suggestive of degenerative joint disease, also called osteoahritis. Crepitation over the involved joints is characteristic, as are bony enlargements of the DIP joints. In this overweight patient, weight reduction is the best method to decrease the risk of fuher degenerative changes. Aspirin or acetominophen can be used as symptomatic treatment, but do not affect the course of the disease. Calcium supplementation may be relevant to associated osteoporosis, but not to the osteoahritis. Oral prednisone would be contraindicated; intraaicular coicosteroid injections may be given two to three times peryear for symptom reduction.

Which of the following is NOT a TRUE statement about fibrous dysplasia?,Characterised by replacement of normal lamellar bone by an abnormal fibrous tissue,The polyostotic form is common in adults,Thin coices,Ground-glass appearance,"The polyostotic form typically manifests in children < 10 years of age and may progress with age. Good to know: Fibrous dysplasia: It is characterized by the replacement of normal lamellar cancellous bone by an abnormal fibrous tissue that contain small, abnormally arranged trabeculae of immature woven bone. It may affect one bone (monostotic form) or several bones (polyostotic form) The monostotic form is the most common and is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without associated skin lesions. The polyostotic form typically manifests in children Monostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the femur paicularly the femoral neck as well as the tibia and ribs. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal poions of the femur or tibia. Radiological findings: In the long bones, the fibrous dysplasia lesions are typically well-defined, radiolucent areas with thin coices and a ground glass appearance. The aicular ends are usually spared. Involvement of the facial bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leonine appearance ( leontiasis sea). Treatment: There is no established effective treatment. IV bisphosphonates therapy- improvement in bone pain and paial or complete resolution of radiographic lesions have been repoed after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Surgical stabilization is used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a joint space to relieve nerve root or cranial nerve compression or sinus obstruction. Complication: Most common complication is pathological fracture Shepherd's crook deformity- if fracture occur at the femoral neck, it commonly lead to a deformity called ""shepherd crook"". Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, deformity and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous transformation of either form of fibrous dysplasia is extremely rare, but it may occur spontaneously or, more commonly, after radiation therapy.

Diversion of urinary bladder is best done at,Jejunum,Ileum,Cecum,Colon,"Permanent urinary tract diversion is most commonly performed by conduit diversion. The ureters are implanted into a sho, isolated segment of ileum or, less commonly, colon. The conduit dives the urine onwards to a cutaneous stoma for collection in an ileostomy bag. Ileal segment is the best for urinary diversion after cystectomy. Still better method is ""Continent cutaneous diversion"" method. But the best method is ""Ohotopic neobladders"". ""Incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion"" by ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is exteriorized in the form of a stoma through the abdominal wall, around which an appliance is secured and into which urine continuously drains. ""Continent cutaneous diversions"" -- All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin, designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantages of this type of diversion are the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage and the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. No stomal appliance is usually required. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the ohotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when the urethra or bladder neck is non-functional or involved by tumor, and avoidance of an external appliance is desired. ""Ohotropic neobladders""-- Ohotropic neobladders are internal reservoirs that are connected to the native urethra and rely upon the external striated sphincter for continence. These reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) anastomosed to the native urinary outflow tract. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, construction of an ohotropic neobladder has become the procedure of choice for most patients following cystectomy for bladder cancer in both men and women. It is contraindicated if the urethra is nonfunctional or involved with tumor. Bailey and Love Pg : 1336",B

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreasaEUR',Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Microcystic adenoma [Ref. Robbin's Pathology 8/e p899; Schwaz 9/e p1232) Mutinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (appro. 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) d. solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA (<200 ng/mL). Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference .from 1PMN there tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",A

Total Nissen's fundoplication is used for the surgical management of -,Achlasia cardia,Gastroesophageal reflux,Gastric ulcer,Esophageal diverticula,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Gastroesophageal reflux Surgical management of Gastroesophageal reflux disease:* There are many operations for GORD, but they are virtually all based on the creation of an intra-abdominal segment of oesophagus, crural repair and some form of wrap of the upper stomach (fundoplication) around the intraabdominal oesophagus. The contribution of each component to operative success is widely debated, but it is clear that operations that fail to address all three components have inferior success rates.* Total Nissen's fundoplication used for the surgical management of GERD, tends to be associated with slightly more short-term dysphagia but is the most durable repair in terms of long-term reflux control.* Partial fundoplication, whether performed posteriorly (Toupet) or anteriorly (Dor, Watson), has fewer short- term side-effects at the expense of a slightly higher long-term failure rate.* One disadvantage of total fundoplication is the creation of an overcompetent cardia, resulting in the 'gas bloat' syndrome in which belching is impossible.",B

Beevor sign is seen in aEUR',Abdominal muscle,Respiratory muscle,Facial muscle,Hand muscle,Abdominal muscle Beevor's Sign Movement of the umbilicus towards the head on flexing the neck. It is caused by weakness of the lower abdominal muscles. Physiology Beevor's sign is characteristic of spinal cord injury b/w T6-T10levels. This occurs because the upper abdominal muscles such as rectus abdominus are intact at the top of the abdomen but weak at the lower poion. Thus when the patient is asked to do a sit up only the upper muscles contract pulling the umbilicus towards the head in patients who are abnormal. It has also been described in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and fascioscapulohunzeral muscular dystrophy.,A

Most common cause of Pseudocyst of pancreas is,Pancreatitis,Post-pancreatic surgery,Trauma,Tumours,"PSEUDOCYST A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue. Pseudocysts typically arise following an attack of mild acute pancreatitis, lie outside the pancreas, and represent an APFC that has not resolved and matured. Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. The Term 'pseudocyst' is often used more loosely, to include sterile WON that has failed to resolve, or a collection that has developed in the context of chronic pancreatitis or after pancreatic trauma. If carefully investigated, more than half of these will be found to have a communication with the main pancreatic duct. Pseudocysts are often single but, occasionally, patients will develop multiple pseudocysts. A pseudocyst is usually identified on ultrasound or a CT scan. It is impoant to differentiate a pseudocyst from an APFC; the clinical scenario and the radiological appearances should allow that distinction to be made. Occasionally, a cystic neoplasm may be confused with a chronic pseudocyst. EUS and aspiration of the cyst fluid is very useful in such a situation. The fluid should be sent for measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, amylase levels and cytology. Fluid from a pseudocyst typically has a low CEA level, and levels above 400 ng/mL are suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. Pseudocyst fluid usually has a high amylase level, but that is not diagnostic, as a tumour that communicates with the duct system may yield similar findings. Cytology typically reveals inflammatory cells in pseudocyst fluid. If there is no access to EUS, then percutaneous FNA is acceptable (just aspiration, not percutaneous inseion of a drain). ERCP and MRCP may demonstrate communication of the cyst with the pancreatic duct system, demonstrate ductal anomalies, or diagnose chronic pancreatitis and thus help in planning treatment. Pseudocysts will resolve spontaneously in most instances, but complications can develop. Pseudocysts that are thick-walled or large (over 6 cm in diameter), have lasted for a long time (over 12 weeks), or have arisen in the context of chronic pancreatitis are less likely to resolve spontaneously,but these factors are not specific indications for intervention. Therapeutic interventions are advised only if the pseudocyst causes symptoms, if complications develop, or if a distinction has to be made between a pseudocyst and a tumour. There are three possible approaches to draining a pseudocyst: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical. Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance should be avoided. It carries a very high likelihood of recurrence. More over, it is not advisable unless one is absolutely ceain that the cyst is not neoplastic and that it has no communication with the pancreatic duct (or else a pancreaticocutaneous fistula will develop). A percutaneous transgastric cystgastrostomy can be done under imaging guidance, and a double-pigtail drain placed with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. This requires specialist expeise but, in experienced hands, the recurrence rates are no more than 15%. Endoscopic drainage usually involves puncture of the cyst through the stomach or duodenal wall under EUS guidance, and placement of a tube drain with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. The success rates depend on operator expeise. Occasionally, ERCP and placement of a pancreatic stent across the ampulla may help to drain a pseudocyst that is in communication with the duct. Surgical drainage involves internally draining the cyst into the gastric or jejunal lumen. Recurrence rates should be no more than 5%, and this still remains the standard against which the evolving radiological and endoscopic approaches are measured. The approach is conventionally through an open incision, but laparoscopic cystgastrostomy is also feasible. Pseudocysts that have developed complications are best managed surgically. There is a small group of patients who, having suffered an attack of necrotising pancreatitis with duct disruption, go on to suffer repeated complications in the form of recurrent fluid collections, pseudocysts, pleural effusions or pancreatic ascites. Very often disruption of the main pancreatic duct in the neck, body or tail is compounded by a stricture or a stone in the head that cannot be treated endoscopically. In such patients, some form of surgical resection and/or a drainage procedure even though it may be technically challenging may be the only way to achieve lasting resolution.

Therefore, before the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis can be made, cultures must be taken from affected tissues, and there must be no growth of any organism that may produce granulomas. In patients with Sarcoidosis, blood levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme are increased, and this may also be used as a clinical test.* In the past, the Kveim skin test was used to assist in the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, but since it involves injecting into patients extracts of material from humans, it is no longer used.Note: Don't get confuse with 'cut potato appearance'of lymphoma",A

The idiopathic syndrome refers to a rare set of symptoms resulting from inflammation of unknown etiology of the brachial plexus. (The brachial plexus is a complex network of nerves through which impulses reach the arms, shoulders and chest.)> This syndrome can begin with severe shoulder or arm pain followed by weakness and numbness. Those who suffer from Parson- age-Turner experience acute, sudden-onset pain radiating from the shoulder to the upper arm. Affected muscles become weak and atrophied, and in advanced cases, paralyzed.> Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) is a rare syndrome of unknown cause, affecting mainly the lower motor neurons of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a group of nerves that conduct signals from the spine to the shoulder, arm, and hand PTS is usually characterized by the sudden onset of severe one-sided shoulder pain, followed by paralysis of the shoulder and lack of muscle control in the arm, wrist, or hand several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement.> PTS characterized by inflammation of a network of nerves that control and supply (innervate) the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and arms. Individuals with the condition first experience severe pain across the shoulder and upper arm. Within a few hours or days, weakness, wasting (atrophy), and paralysis may affect the muscles of the shoulder.> MRI may assist in diagnosis.> Prognosis: Despite its wasting and at times long-lasting effects, most cases resolve themselves and recovery is usually good in 18-24 months. Although individuals with the condition may experience paralysis of the affected areas for months or, in some cases, years, recovery is usually eventually complete.",D

The severity, duration, and anatomic extent of the inflammation are risk factors for the development of dysplasia and cancer. These cancers do not seem to follow the adenoma carcinoma sequence and can arise in flat mucosa making them difficult to detect even with regular colonoscopies. After 8-10 years of colitis surveillance colonoscopy should be performed with multiple random biopsies. The finding of dysplasia is an indication for immediate total proctocolectomy. Centers have reported up to 42% of colons removed for dysplasia also had colon cancer.",D

"A 12-year-old girl fractures her right radius and ulna in a motor accident. Her arm is placed in a cast extending over the elbow, which nearly eliminates movement of her forearm muscles. Which of the following will occur in her forearm muscles after several weeks in the cast?",Decreased capillarity,Decreased intracellular pO2,Decreased myoglobin oxygen saturation,Increased metabolic rate,"The primary function of blood vessels in skeletal muscles is to supply nutrients and remove metabolic waste products from the muscle tissues. Prolonged increases in metabolic rate lead to growth of the vasculature; decreases in metabolic rate lead to vascular rarefaction, i.e., loss of capillaries as well as other types of blood vessels. In other words, blood vessels grow where they are needed and regress when they are not needed. When a limb is immobilized in a cast, the muscles are inactive and their metabolic rate decreases. This decrease in metabolic rate leads to a decrease in capillarity in the skeletal muscles by mechanisms that are poorly understood. When the metabolic rate of immobilized skeletal muscle decreases, the oxygen consumption of the muscle decreases, which is likely to cause an initial increase in both myoglobin oxygen saturation and intracellular pO2.",A

All of the following are predisposing factors for breast carcinoma except: September 2008,Family history of breast carcinoma,First child at a younger age,Early menarche and late menopause,Nulliparous women,"Ans. B: First child at a younger age Risk factors for the development of invasive breast cancer include: Female gender: The incidence of breast cancer in women exceeds that in men. Age: Risk increases with age between the third and eighth decades. Age at bih of first child: If aged 30 years or older, relative risk is 2 times that of patients who gave bih when younger than 20 years.So first child at early age is protective. Nulliparous women is more prone for breast carcinoma. Personal history of breast cancer: This factor depends on patient age at time of diagnosis. Risk is increased for younger women. Noninvasive carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)/lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)) on previous biopsy: This also is a marker for development of invasive lesions. Benign proliferative changes with atypical hyperplasia: These may increase relative risk by 4 times. Early menarche and late menopause: These also are associated weakly with increased relative risk of breast cancer. Menopausal hormone replacement therapy: the combination use of estrogen with progestin has been associated with an greater risk of breast cancer, paicularly of lobular carcinoma. Increased risk is also related to increased duration of use; this risk can be reduced over time, following the termination of hormone replacement therapy. Family history: Degree of relativity of the family member with breast cancer affects individual risk. Genetic predisposition: Approximately 5-10% of breast cancer cases are primarily attributable to inherited factors. The risk of breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 mutation is estimated to be 36-87%.",B
Most impoant prognostic factor for breast carcinoma is: March 2005,Age of the patient,Lymph node involvement,Genetic factors,Family history,"Ans. B: Lymph node involvement Prognostic factors include staging, (i.e., tumor size, location, grade, whether disease has traveled to other pas of the body), recurrence of the disease, and age of patient. The best indicators of likely prognosis in breast cancer remain tumour size and lymph node status, which are components of stage of a tumour. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the worse is the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10yr disease free survival.",B

Not true regarding sub dural haematoma,Occurs on both sides,X-Ray not visible,Surgery can be done,Unilateral surgery,"Acute subdural haematoma Acute subdural haematoma encountered in two broadly distinct contexts. Firstly, high-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of coical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration anddeveloping signs of raised ICP, reminiscent of extradural haematoma without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. In a second group of patients, older and often anticoagulated, a lower-energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic sub- dural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. This latter group may present much later with a fuher 'acute-on- chronic' subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significant associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively, at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7-10 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holesSince the dura is not adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface giving a diffuse concave appearance.

What is the most common complication following TIPSS?,Encephalopathy,Hepatic ischemia,Infection,Life-threatening hemorrhage,"TIPSS is a percutaneous procedure used for treatment of patients who have gastroesophageal varices in the setting of poal hypeension. It has largely replaced surgical poosystemic shunts due to the fact that it is both safe and effective while also providing a minimally invasive alternative to major abdominal surgery. TIPSS functions by creating an intrahepatic shunt between the poal and systemic circulation which causes a reduction in the poal pressure and ultimately in the blood flow through varices. It is accomplished by endovascular access through the jugular vein to a hepatic vein radical and subsequent creation of a needle tract that connects it to a branch of the poal vein. After dilation of the tract, a metallic stent is deployed to hold the new poosystemic connection open. Because this shunt reduces first pass metabolism of the liver, the most common complication of TIPS is encephalopathy which occurs in 25 to 30% of patients. Other complications such as hepatic ischemia, infection, renal failure, and hemorrhage may occur, but are rare",A
"Hari ram a 70 year old male presents with h/o lower GI bleed for the last 6 months. Sigmoidoscopic examination shows a mass, of 4 cms about 3.5 cms above the anal verge. The treatment of choice is:",Colostomy,Anterior resection,Abdominoperineal resection,Dysfunctional anastomosis,"Treatment of rectal cancer: Surgical and oncological management varies greatly depending on the stage of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. Low anterior resection: This is a sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed. The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper ? rd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower ? of rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesions but above the dentate line. 1 cm of margins can be adequate, provided the carcinoma is well differentiated. Abdominoperineal resection (also known as Miles procedure): In this procedure there is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by the concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for LAR cannot be obtained i.e. for carcinoma in lower rectum. Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transrectal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Palliative procedures: unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulguration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. ""In this patient the tumor lies 3.5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is just 2 cms from the anl verge so the tumor is just 1.5 cm from the dentate line.

Which of the following does not help in the prevention of reflux esophagitis?,Long intraabdominal esophagus,Increased intraabdominal pressure,Right crus of diaphragm,Increased intrathoracic pressure,"The principal barrier to reflux is the lower esophageal sphincter. LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure. Factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES: Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus: these muscles differ from those in the other area of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of the a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction. Sling fibres of cardia Crura of the diaphragm Intra Abdominal pressure: the intra abdominal pressure compresses the abdominal segment of the esophagus and is probably the most impoant factor in preventing the reflux. The gastroesophageal angle: the oblique entry of the esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when gastric fundus distends. Folds of the mucosa at the cardia : helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure arises. Intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux as it is too low ranging from -5 to + 5mm of Hg Ref: Sabiston 18/e, Page 1108 ; Essential of Surgery By Sunil Chumber 1/e, Page 7 ; Textbook of Surgery By S.

Post-transplant cytomegalovirus infection may cause,Pyelonephritis,GI ulceration and hemorrhage,Cholecystitis,Intraabdominal abscess,"Overall, 30% of all infections contracted in the posttransplant period are viral. The most common viral infections are DNA viruses of the herpesvirus family and include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus. CMV infections may occur as either primary or reactive infections and have a peak incidence at about 6-week post-transplant. The classic signs include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukopenia. CMV infection can affect several organ systems and result in pneumonitis; ulceration and hemorrhage in the stomach, duodenum, or colon; hepatitis; esophagitis; retinitis; encephalitis; or pancreatitis. The risk of developing posttransplant CMV depends on donor-recipient serology, with the greatest risk in seronegative patients who receive organs from seropositive donors. Pyelonephritis, cholecystitis, intraabdominal abscesses, and parotitis are caused by bacterial infections or GI perforation and not primarily by CMV infection.",B

Post-CPR rib fractures are often bilateral. The site of rib fracture is dependent on: the position of the hands; force used; and method of chest compression (manual or device-assisted). The vast majority (90%+) offractures occur in ribs 2 to 7; fractures in the bony pas of rib numbers 1 and 8 to 10 are possible but probably very rare; it is difficult to see how fractures can occur in rib numbers 11 and 12 following standard manual CPR. The vast majority of fractures (90%+) occur in the anterior third of the bony pa of the rib, some occur in the middle third but - following standard manual CPR - none in the posterior third of the bony pa of the rib. Posterior rib fractures occur following automated band-type CPR. Lateral fractures i.e. those occurring between the anterior and posterior axillary lines, do occur after standard CPR. If a fracture is noted in rib numbers 10 to 12 or in the posterior third of the bony pa of a rib, then non-resuscitation trauma should be suspected. Chest x-ray is unreliable as a diagnostic tool for detecting rib fractures. CT is better than x-ray and may complement the post-moem detection of rib fractures.

Sabiston 18/e p1995 writes-""Although control of active hemorrhage is always a top priority, reconstruction of injured vessels must be carefully orchestrated with the management of bone and soft tissue injuries. It is preferable to achieve bone alignment before vascular reconstruction because ohopedic manipulation and reconstruction takes time and may disrupt the vascular repair. Thus, if the limb is not grossly ischemic, reduction and fixation of fractures is performed first.

Most cases are caused by laryngeal oedema. The most important cause of laryngeal oedema is a tension haematoma.TransientHypocalcemiaCommonly occurs 24 to 48 hours after thyroidectomy but infrequently requires treatment.Markedly symptomatic or serum calcium < 7 mg/dL are given 1-2 ampules (10 to 20 mL) of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 1 to 2 min, followed by temporary' oral calcium carbonate (500 mg orally TDS).More prolonged IV replacement by mixing 6 ampules of 10% calcium gluconate in dextrose 5% in water (D5W), 500 mL, for infusion at 1 mL/kg'hour.PermanentHypocalcemiaPermanent hypoparathyroidism is uncommon after total thyroidectomy. Incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism is < 1%. Present dramatically 2-5 days after operation. Normal parathyroid tissue removed or devascularized at the time of total thyroidectomy must be minced into 1 x 3-mm fragments and autotransplanted into individual muscle pockets in the sternocleidomastoid muscle to maximize the chances that the patient will not develop postoperative hypoparathyroidismRLN injuryUnilateral RLN injury causes hoarseness, and bilateral injury compromises the airway, necessitating tracheostomy. Unilateral or bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis will not cause immediate postoperative respiratory obstruction unless laryngeal oedema is also present but it wall aggravate the obstruction. RLN palsy rate of 1.8% at 1 month declining to 0.5% at 3 months for first-time operations. RLN can be repaired primarily or with a nerve graftSuperior laryngeal nerve injuryVoice changes, huskiness, poor volume voice fatigue, and inability to sing at higher rangesThyroidinsufficiencyTnis results from a change in the autoimmune response, from stimulation to destruction of the thyroid cells.Thyrotoxic crisis (storm)It occurs if a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy and is now extremely rare. Symptomatic & supportive treatment is for dehydration, hyperpyrexia & restlessness.Specific treatment is with carbimazole 10-20 mg 6-hourly, Lugol's iodine 10 drops 8-hourly by mouth or sodium iodide 1 g IV. Propranolol TV (1-2 mg) or orally (40 mg 6-hourly) will block P-adrenergic effects.WoundinfectionCellulitis requiring prescription of antibiotics, often by the general practitioner, is more common than most surgeons appreciate. A significant subcutaneous or deep cervical abscess is exceptionally rare and should be drainedHypertrophicor keloid scarThis is more likely to form if the incision overlies the sternum and in dark-skinned individuals. Intradermal injections of corticosteroid should be given at once and repeated monthly if necessary.StitchgranulomaThis may occur with or without sinus formation and is seen after the use of nonabsorbable, particularly silk, suture material. Absorbable ligatures and sutures must be used throughout thyroid surgery.

Fundoplication is used in treatment of,Hiatus hernia,Achalasia cardia,CHPS,Ca oesophagus,"Ans. a (Hiatus hernia). (Ref. LB 25th ed., 1024)PARAOESOPHAGEAL ('ROLLING') HIATUS HERNIA# Rolling hiatus hernias are dangerous# Unlike sliding hiatus hernia a rolling hiatus hernia is a true hernia that is prone to complications. True paraoesophageal hernias in which the cardia remains in its normal anatomical position are very rare and confined to museum exhibits and personal collections of interesting cases. The hernia is commonest in the elderly, but may occur in young fit people.# The symptoms of rolling hernia are mostly due to twisting and distortion of the oesophagus and stomach. Dysphagia is common. Chest pain may occur due to distension of an obstructed stomach. Classically the pain is relieved by a loud belch. Symptoms of GORD are variable.# The hernia may be visible on a plain X-ray of the chest as a gas bubble, often with a fluid level behind the heart. Fluid levels are not seen in sliding hernias. A barium meal is the best method of diagnosis. Endoscopic look may be confusing, especially in large hernias endoscopist feels as if have lost sense of direction.# Rolling hernias always require surgical repair as they are potentially dangerous. However, major surgery may not be an attractive prospect in frail elderly patients or in someone who has few symptoms. The essential part of the operation is reduction of the hernia and some form of gastropexy. Some surgeons perform a fundoplication arguing that this is a very effective means of maintaining reduction and that it deals with the associated GORD.# Laparosopic repair has recently become popular. Full anatomical repair of a large rolling hernia can be tedious and difficult by the laparoscopic approach and it is more common simply to reduce the hernia and perform a gastropexy. Some surgeons lay a sheet of prosthetic mesh across the hiatal opening to stop the bowel entering it.# Total or partial fundoplication? The disadvantage of the Nissen fundoplication is that it can produce an overcompetent cardia resulting in dysphagia or the gas bloat syndrome in which belching is prevented. As a result the stomach fills with air and the patient feels very full after meals and passes excessive flatus. The problem of the overcompetent cardia has been largely overcome by the floppy Nissen in which the fundoplication is made very loose around oesophagus and also by making a short fundoplication of 1 cm or so.",A

Metabolic abnormalities are also a cause. b) Abdominal distention, usually without the colicky abdominal pain, is the typical & most notable finding. c) Vomiting may occur but may also be absent. d) Absent or hypoactive bowel sounds. e) Multiple air fluid levels on x-ray. Points b & e help in ruling out adynamic ileus. Pseudoobstruction a) This condition describes an obstruction, usually of the colon in the absence of any mechanical cause b) This may occur in acute or chronic form (Acute form is k/a Ogilivie syndrome*) Acute form usually involves only the colon. c) Vomitting appear late or even absent. d) Abd. cramps appear late. e) Abd. distention is the chief symptom. f) Since it usually involves the colon air fluid level are not seen if the ileo-cecal valve is intact. Points c, d, e help in ruling out Pseudoobstruction in this pt. Ca Rectum : a) Usually a ds. of old age b) Obstruction is not a common presentation Even if obstruction occurs, it is insiduous in onset with pain & vomiting a late feature. There will be abdominal distention. These point help in ruling Ca Rectum out. Duodenal obstruction Features of this pt. match perfectly with duodenal obstruction as Pain and vomitting are early features. No distention of bowel No air fluid level. (There is no distention of bowel and no air fluid level as whole of the intestinal tract distal to the obstruction is patent allowing free passage to gas and the fluids out of body. Obstruction to duodenum prevent fuher entry of gas or fluids into the intestines).",B
The response to shock includes which of the following metabolic effects?,Increase in sodium and water excretion,Increase in renal perfusion,Decrease in cortisol levels,Hyperkalemia,"The biochemical changes associated with shock result from tissue hypoperfusion, endocrine response to stress, and specific organ system failure. During shock, the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla are stimulated to release catecholamines. Renin, angiotensin, antidiuretic hormone, adrenocorticotropin, and cortisol levels increase. Resultant changes include sodium and water retention and an increase in potassium excretion, protein catabolism, and gluconeogenesis. Potassium levels rise as a result of increased tissue release, anaerobic metabolism, and decreased renal perfusion. If renal function is maintained, potassium excretion is high and normal plasma potassium levels are restored.",D

Hyperextensibility with normal elastic recoil is a feature of aEUR',Ehlers Danlos syndrome,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,Cutis laxa,Scleroderma,"Ehlers Danlos syndrome Ehlers - Danlos syndrome (EDS) Ehler's danlos syndrome comprise a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of disorder that result from some defect in the synthesis or structure of fibrillar collagen. The basic abnormality in Ehler's Danlos syndrome (EDS) is some defect in the synthesis or structure of collagen Biosynthesis of collagen is a complex process It involves numerous structural collagen genes or enzymes. Which are used in post transcriptional modification of collagen. Therefore it can be disturbed by no. of genetic errors that may affect any of the numerous genes or enzymes necessary for collagen synthesis. At the molecular level, a variety of defects, varying .from mutations involving structural genes or collagens to those involving enzymes that are responsible for post transcriptional modification of mRNA have been detected. Such molecular heterogenecity result in expression of EDS as a clinically variable disorder with several patterns of inheritance. On the basis of clinical and molecular characteristics six variants of Ehler's Danlos syndrome have been identified. The common thread in all forms of EDS is some abnormality in the synthesis of collagen. Clinical features - As might be expected tissues rich in collagen such as skin, ligaments and joints are frequently involved. - Because the abnormal collagen fibre lacks adequate tensile strength, skin is hyper extensible and the joints are hypermobile. The skin is extraordinarily stretchaeble, extremely fragile and vulnerable to trauma. - Minor injuries produce gaping defects and surgical repair or intervention is accomplished with great difficulty because of the lack of normal tensile strength. - The defect in connective tissue may lead to serious internal complications which include:? - Rupture of the colon and large aeries - Occular.fragility with rupture of cornea and retinal detachment - Diaphragmatic hernia EQS type Gene defect Inheritance Clinical findings Classical Defect in type V collagen Mutation in COL5A gene Autosomal dominant Skin and joint hypermo? bility, atrophic scars, Easy bruising Hypermobility Unknow Autosomal dominant Joint hypennobility, pain, dislocations Vascular Defect in collagen type 111 Autosomal The skin, aerial or Collagen ill is abundant in Blood vessels and intestine ( *.. severe defect of these organs dominants uterine rupture, bru? ising, small joint hyperextensibility Kyphoscoliosis Reduced level of lysyl hydroxylase essential for cross linking of collagen fibres Autosomal recessive Hypotonia, joint laxity, congenital scoliosis, ocular fragility Ahrochalasia - Defect in conversion of Autosomal Severe joint hypenno?

Autosomal Recessive Severe skin fragility, cutis laxa, bruising Cutis laxa The inelastic hyperextensible skin fails to resume its normal shape after stretching and hence appears pendulous. Therefore affected newborn infants appear ""prematurely aged"". The skin abnormality is most prominent around eye, face neck. Therefore patients with cutis laxa have characteristic facial features including an aged appearance with sagging jaws (blood hound appearance) a hooked nose with eveed nostrils, a sho columella, a long upper lip and eveed lower eyelids. Hypermobility of the joint is not present. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum It is a rare group of disorders affecting the elastic tissue. It primarily affects the dermis, retina, and cardiovascular system. The skin has characteristic ""plucked chicken skin"" appearance. - It tends to loose its elastic recoil when stretched.",A
"A pipe smoker is found to have a white, elevated plaque on his buccal mucosa during a general medical examination. The area cannot be wiped away with sterile gauze. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Squamous cell carcinoma,Thrush,Gingivitis,Leukoplakia,"Leukoplakia is a precancerous lesion that appears as a white, elevated, plaque-like growth. It usually has asymmetric borders and usually affects the oral mucosa. It cannot be wiped off. The lesions tend to occur on the lip, mouth, buccal mucosa, and vaginal mucosa. Those at risk are cigarette smokers, pipe smokers, smokeless tobacco users, and heavy alcohol users. Others at risk include those with chronic oral infections, chronic malocclusion, or chronic ultraviolet light exposure. If suspected, these lesions should be biopsied to rule out malignancy. Approximately 10% may show malignant transformation. Candida infections can resemble leukoplakia, but candida can be removed using a cotton swab.",D

HER2-positive tumors are a potential exception.* Detection of breast cancer cells either in the circulation or bone marrow is associated with an increased relapse rate.* Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are of prognostic significance. Tumors that lack either or both of these receptors are more likely to recur than tumors that have them.* Several measures of tumor growth rate correlate with early relapse. S-phase analysis using flow cytometry is the most accurate measure. Indirect S-phase assessments using antigens associated with the cell cycle, such as PCNA (Ki67), are also valuable.* Tumors with a high proportion (more than the median) of cells in S-phase pose a greater risk of relapse; chemotherapy offers the greatest survival benefit for these tumors.* Assessment of DNA content in the form of ploidy is of modest value, with nondiploid tumors having a somewhat worse prognosis.* Histologic classification of the tumor has also been used as a prognostic factor. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear grade.* Molecular changes in the tumor are also useful. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER2/neu) or have a mutated p53 gene have a worse prognosis. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 are more likely to respond to higher doses of doxorubicin- containing regimens and predict those tumors that will respond to HER2/neu antibodies (trastuzumab) (herceptin) and HER2/ neu kinase inhibitors.* The presence of more microvessels in a tumor, particularly when localized in so-called hot spots, is associated with a worse prognosis.* Other variables that have also been used to evaluate prognosis include proteins associated with invasiveness, such as type IV collagenase, cathepsin D, plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator receptor, and the metastasis- suppressor gene nm23. None of these has been widely accepted as a prognostic variable for therapeutic decision- making. One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients.",A

Which of the following statements concerning imperforate anus is true?,Imperforate anus affects males more frequently than females,"In 90% of males, but only 50% of females, the rectum ends below the level of the levator ani complex",The rectum usually ends in a blind pouch,The chance for eventual continence is greater when the rectum has descended to below the levator ani muscles,"Imperforate anus affects males and females with equal frequency, occurring in 1 of each 20,000 live births. It is due to failure of descent of the urorectal septum. Imperforate anus may be broadly classified into ""high"" or ""low,"" depending on whether the rectum ends above or below the level of the levator ani complex. In 90% of females, but only 50% of males, the lesion is of the low variety. The rectal fistula may end in the prostatic urethra or vagina in the high cases, while the low cases terminate in a perineal fistula. For the low cases, only a perineal operation may be required and these children will be expected to be continent. A pull-through procedure will be required for the high imperforate anus and the likelihood of continence is smaller. If there is doubt about the level or location of the termination of the rectum, it is better to perform a temporary colostomy than to compromise the ultimate chances of continence by an injudicious perineal approach.",D

"In Duchennes muscular dystrophy, calf muscle is: September 2009",Hyperophied,Atrophied,Pseudoatrophied,Pseudohyperophied,"Ans. D: Pseudohyperophied Duchenne muscular dystrophy is by far the most common childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, afflicting 1 in 3300 boys with an overall prevalence of 63 cases per million. One third of these cases are due to spontaneous mutations, while the rest are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinically manifests in patients aged 3-7 years, with development of lordosis, a waddling gait, and the Cowers sign. Calf pseudohyperophy follows 1-2 years later. Most patients are wheelchair bound by age 12 years. Diagnostic criteria include: Weakness with onset in the legs; Hyperlordosis with wide-based gait; Hyperophy of weak muscles; Progressive course over time; Reduced muscle contractility on electrical stimulation in advanced stages of the disease; and (6) absence of bladder or bowel dysfunction, sensory disturbance, or febrile illness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is much more than a disease of skeletal muscles. Dystrophin is also found in the hea, brain, and smooth muscle.

In complete (classic) moles, all the chorionic villi are abnormal and fetal pas are not found. * They have a 46,XX diploid pattern and arise from the paternal chromosomes of a single sperm by a process called androgenesis. * In paial moles, only some of the villi are abnormal and fetal pas may be seen. These moles have a triploid or a tetraploid karyotype and arise from the feilization of a single egg by two sperm. * About 2% of complete moles may develop into choriocarcinoma, but paial moles are rarely followed by malignancy Invasive moles penetrate the myometrium and may even embollze to distant sites. * A similar lesion is the placental site trophoblastic tumor, which is characterized by invasion of the myometrium by intermediate trophoblasts. * Gestational choriocarcinomas, composed of malignant proliferations of both cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblasts without the formation of villi, can arise from either normal or abnormal pregnancies: 50% arise in hydatidiform moles, 25% in cases of previous aboion, 22% in normal pregnancies, and the rest in ectopic pregnancies or teratomas. * Both hydatidiform moles and choriocarcinomas have high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG); the levels are extremely high in choriocarcinoma unless considerable tumor necrosis is present.",B
what % of testicular carcinoma is associated with crytorchidism?,10%,30%,70%,90%,"Testicular Tumours: Epidemiology and Risk Factors Of all primary testicular tumours, 90-95% are germ cell tumours (seminoma and nonseminoma) More common in whites and individuals of higher socioeconomic class Slightly more common on the right side than on the left, which parallels the increased incidence of cryptorchidism on the right side. Of primary testicular tumours, 1-2% are bilateral, and about 50% of these tumours occur in men with a history of unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism Seminoma is the most common germ cell tumour in bilateral primary testicular tumours, while malignant lymphoma is the most common bilateral tumour of the testis The strongest association has been with the cryptorchid testis. Approximately 7-10% of testicular tumours develop in patients who have a history of cryptorchidism; seminoma is the most common form of tumor these patients have. However, 5-10% of the testicular tumors occur in the contralateral, normally descended testis. The relative risk of malignancy is highest for the intraabdominal testis (1 in 20) and is significantly lower for the inguinal testis (1 in 80) Orchipexy doesnot alter the malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis; however, it does facilitate examination and tumor detection Ref: Smith 18th edition Pgno: 380",A

Sister Joseph Nodules are present at: March 2005,Umbilicus,Diaphragm,Lung,Liver,"Ans. A: Umbilicus Sister Mary Joseph nodule/node/ Sister Mary Joseph sign, refers to a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus as a result of metastasis of a malignant cancer in the pelvis or abdomen. Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about half of underlying sources (most commonly gastric cancer, colonic cancer or pancreatic cancer, mostly of the tail and body of the pancreas), and men are even more likely to have an underlying cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Gynecological cancers account for about 1 in 4 cases (primarily ovarian cancer and also uterine cancer). Unknown primary tumors and rarely, urinary or respiratory tract malignancies cause umbilical metastases. Proposed mechanisms for the spread of cancer cells to the umbilicus include direct transperitoneal spread, the lymphatics which run alongside the obliterated umbilical vein, hematogenous spread, or remnant structures such as the falciform ligament, median umbilical ligament, or a remnant of the vitelline duct. Sister Joseph nodule is associated with multiple peritoneal metastases and a poor prognosis.

Metastasis from follicular carcinoma should be treated by: September 2007,Radioiodine,Surgery,Thyroxine,Observation,"Ans. A: Radioiodine Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated tumor. In fact, FTC resembles the normal microscopic pattern of the thyroid. FTC originates in follicular cells and is the second most common cancer of the thyroid, after papillary carcinoma. Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are considered to be differentiated thyroid cancers; together they make up 95% of thyroid cancer cases. Papillary/follicular carcinoma must be considered a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (mixed form), and Huhle cell carcinoma should be considered a variant of FTC. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, follicular carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, FTC tumors may spread easily to other organs. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years. Patients with FTC are more likely to develop lung and bone metastases than are patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The bone metastases in FTC are osteolytic. Older patients have an increased risk of developing bone and lung metastases. The initial treatment for cancer of the thyroid is surgical. The exact nature of the surgical procedure to be performed depends for the most pa on the extent of the local disease. A total thyroidectomy is performed if the primary tumor is larger than 1 cm in diameter or if there is extrathyroidal involvement or distant metastases. Clinically evident lymphadenopathy should be removed with a neck dissection. If the primary tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter, a unilateral lobectomy might be considered. About 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients must have radioiodine to detect and destroy any metastasis and any residual tissue in the thyroid.",A
Cholesterol gall stones are due to -,Decreased motility of Gall bladder,Hypo secretion of bile salts,Hyper cholesterolemia,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., .AH of the above o Bile salts and phospholipids in bile keep cholesterol in solution by the formation of micelles,o An excess of cholesterol relative to bite salts and phospholipids allows cholesterol to form crystals and such bile is called Lithogenic or super-saturated bile.Pathogenesis of Cholesterol gall stoneso There are three elements necessary for the formation of cholesterol gall stonesLithogenic bileNucleation andStasis or gall bladder hypomotilityAll three are necessary! for cholesterol stone formation.Lithogenic {stone-forming) bileo Cholesterol is insoluble in water (water is major constituent of bile. 85-95%). It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterolo So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i.e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones,o Factors which increase biliary cholesterolObesityHigh calorie and cholesterol rich dietClofibrate therapyo Factors which decrease bile acidsPrimary biliary cirrhosisOral contraceptive pillsGenetic factorsA mutation in CYP7A1 gene which results in deficiency1 of enzyme cholesterol 7 -hydroxylase. It results in impaired hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, thus it increases the cholesterol/bile acid ratio.Decreased/impaired enterohepatic circulation of bile acids:Ileal diseaseIleal resectionCholestyramine, colestipol (bile acid sequestrants) therapy.Deoxycholateo Factors which decrease biliary lecithin- A mutation in MDR3 gene leads to defective phospholipid (lecithin) secretion into bile.Nucleationo Nucleation refers to the process by wrhich cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals.o Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors.o Mucin and certain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins AI and All and certain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor.C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotilityo Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely.o Gall bladder hypomotility is caused byProlonged parenteral nutritionFastingPregnancyDrugs such as octreotideOral contraceptive pillsSurgery, bums",D

The course of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is best described by which of the following statements?,Metastases are rare; local growth is rapid; erosion into the trachea and large blood vessels is frequent,"Local invasion and metastases almost never occur, which makes the term carcinoma misleading",Bony metastases are frequent and produce an osteolytic pattern particularly in vertebrae,Metastases frequently occur to cervical lymph nodes; distant metastases and local invasion are rare,"Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes, but distant metastasis is uncommon. The nonaggressive nature of this tumor locally and the infrequency of distant metastases combine to produce an 80-95% 5-year survival rate. A contributing factor to the success of thyroid surgery for papillary carcinoma is the easy accessibility of cervical nodes for examination and dissection. Slow growth and a predilection for local extension are characteristics of this tumor that contribute to a high survival rate in affected persons. This is true even of patients who have limited surgery, which has led to considerable controversy regarding the extent of the indicated surgical procedure.",D

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm.
An aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta with a diameter of at least 1.5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aortic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal.
A most common site is infrarenal.
More common in males than females.
Incidence increases with age.
At least 90% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms >4.0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease.
Prognosis is related to both the size of an aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease.
The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of an aneurysm.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons.
As abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening.
Contrast-enhanced CT is an investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if the use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size
Operative repair of an aneurysm with the insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aortic stent graft is indicated for:
abdominal aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms.
for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5.5 cm.
The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in part on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions.
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has a lower short-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e)

Not only is physeal growth inhibited, but also the Hueter-Volkmann effect upon the entire epiphysis prevents its normal expansion. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle, continuous or excessive compressive forces upon the epiphysis have an inhibitory effect upon growth. Consequently, growth in the lateral condyle of the femur is suppressed globally, resulting in a shallow femoral sulcus and a propensity for the patella to tilt and subluxate laterally.",B

Positive hepatojugular reflux is found in all of the following conditions except aEUR',Tricuspid regurgitation,Right hea failure,Decreased after load,Increased capillary bed pressure,"Associated with decreased afterload Hepatojugular reflux This is done by applying firm pressure with the palm of the hand to the right upper quadrant of the abdomen for 1030 seconds with the patients breathing quietly while the jugular vein is observed. In normal subjects (Negative hepatojugular reflux) - Jugular venous pressure rises only transiently with rapid return to the baseline. Positive hepatojugular reflux (Left ventricular,failureQ) - A positive abdominojugular reflux sign is defined by an increase in the jugular venous pressure of greater than 3 cm, sustained for greater than 15 seconds. Explanation Pushing on the liver (or even midabdomen) for about 15 seconds increases the amount of blood returned to the right atrium and right ventricle (increased preload). Concurrently, there is increase in right ventricle afterload, owing to upward movement of the diaphragm which reduces intrathoracic volumes. (Pulmonary aery pressure is increased due to reduced intrathoracic volumes).(Leading to increased right ventricle afterload) In a normal person the jugular venous pressure would rise temporarily and then normalize quickly as the healthy right ventricle pumps out the additional blood i.e. it handles the increase in preload and afterload quite well. A dysfunctioning right ventricle however fails to accept this increase in preload and afterload and therefore there is persistent elevation of systemic venous pressure. The abdominojugular reflux is not specific to any disorder but rather is a reflection of the inability of the right ventricle to accept or reject the transiently increased venous return. ""Positive abdominojugular reflux is most commonly associated with left ventricular failure"". In the absence of left hea failure a positive abdominal jugular reflex sign should prompt consideration of :- Impaired right ventricular proload - A Decrease in right ventricular compliance. - A decrease in right ventricular systolic function or - An elevation in right ventricular afterload.

Maximum tissue reaction in associated with which suture material?,Polypropylene,Polyglyconate,Polydioxanone,Plain catgut,"Ans. D. Plain catgut. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 36. Table 18.1).While plain Catgut or Chromic catgut often causes bacterial infection due to inflammatory tissue reaction. Reaction to catgut depends on the stage of absorption and is mainly histocytic in type. Nonabsorbable sutures are encapsulated by a rim of connective tissue, while near the suture histocytes, giant cells and lymphocytes are found. This is most marked with silk and cotton, less so with Dacron, and least with nylon and wire.# All the natural sutures, silk, cotton, linen and catgut, are being replaced by polymeric synthetic materials that cause minimal inflammatory reactions, are of predictable strength and absorb at an appropriate rate. They can be manufactured as monofilaments or braids, and can be coated with wax, silicone or polybutyrate to allow them to run smoothly through tissues and to knot securely. The absorbables cause a minimal tissue reaction as they are resorbed. To aid in the prevention of postoperative infection, particularly after prosthetic surgery, absorbable synthetic sutures may be impregnated with an antiseptic (Vicryl Plus, a polyglactin, is impregnated with triclosan).# The integrity of some synthetic non-absorbables in holding healing tissues together can last indefinitely, such as the use of polypropylene in arterial anastomosis. Polyamide (nylon) is slowly biodegradable and therefore not suitable for this purpose. Many nonabsorbables are presented as monofilaments, which eliminates interstices in the thread and makes knots less likely to be a nidus for infection by reducing the risk of bacterial biofilms and adherence, but requires more skill in tying secure knots# Polyglyconate is newest synthetic monofilament absorbable suture. It is sterile, noncollagenous, nonantigenic, nonpyrogenic. It elicits only slight tissue reaction during absorption, absorption is by nonenzymatic hydrolytic process.Absorbable suturesSutureTissue reactionHow suppliedCommon indicationsContraindicationsCatgut plainHigh6/0-1 with needles; 4/0-3 without needlesLigate superficial vessels, suture subcutaneous tissuesStomas and other tissues that heal rapidlyNot for use in tissues which heal slowly and require prolonged supportCatgut chromicModerate6/0-3 with needles;5/0-3 without needlesAs for plain catgut PolyglactinMild8/D--2 with needles;5/0-2 without needlesGeneral surgical use where absorbable sutures required, e.g. gut anastomoses, vascular ligatures.

"The absorption of glucose from the gut into intestinal mucosal cells is coupled to Na+,K+ ATPase. In contrast, the movement of glucose from the intestinal epithelial cells into the submucosal bloodstream occurs through passive transpo. Given these facts, which of the following statements can be true at one time or another?",Levels of plasma glucose are approximately equal to levels in the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells,Free glucose levels in the lumen of the intestine can never be higher than levels in intestinal cells,Plasma glucose levels are much higher than intestinal cell cytosolic levels of glucose,Levels of glucose in the intestinal lumen are always higher than those in the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells,"The plasma membranes of intestinal epithelial cells contain a sodium gradient that drives the active transpo of glucose. The rate and amount of glucose transpoed depend upon the sodium gradient maintained across the plasma membrane. Sodium ions entering the cell in the company of glucose are pumped out again by Na+,K+-ATPase. Once in the cytosol of the intestinal cell, the glucose moves across the cell and diffuses out of the cell into the interstitial fluid of the submucosa and then into the plasma of the capillaries underlying the intestinal epithelium. This occurs for the following reason: while glucose is maintained in blood plasma at an approximately constant level, it is always slowly moving out of the plasma into the cells of tissue that use it. Given that the diffusion from the intestinal cells into the plasma is passive, the intestinal cells and the plasma try to maintain an equilibrium. Thus, plasma glucose levels are always approximately equal to or slightly less than levels in the intestinal cells. Due to the passive maintenance of this equilibrium, it is highly unlikely that the concentration of glucose in the plasma can get much higher than that in the intestinal cell cytosol. It is also unlikely that the levels of glucose in other tissues of the body (for example, muscle) will have any bearing on those found in the intestinal cells",B

A distal groove usually extends from the meatus through the splayed glans. - The penopubic type has the urethral opening at the penopubic junction, and the entire penis has a distal dorsal groove extending through the glans. All types of epispadias are associated with varying degrees of dorsal chordee. Females with epispadias have a bifid clitoris and separation of the labia. Male to female ratio of epispadias is 3: 1. Incontinence due to maldevelopment of urinary sphincters is commonly associated with most epispadias except for the glandular type. Other associated anomaly is pubic diastasis as in exstrophy. Surgery is required to correct the incontinence, remove the chordee to straighten the penis, and extend the urethra out onto the glans penis. Note that pubic diastasis (i.e. separation of pubic bones) is not synonymous with bifid pubic symphysis.",B

"A 7 yr old girl with non productive cough, mild stridor for 3 months duration. Patient is improving but suddenly developed wheeze productive cough mild fever and hyperlucency on CXR and PFT shows obstructive curve. Diagnosis is ?",Bronchiolitis obliterans,Hemosiderosis,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,Follicular bronchitis,"Bronchiolitis obliterans Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways. Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i.e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, and peussis). Other causes include connective tissue disease (i.e. juvenile rheumatoid ahritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, and scleroderma) Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups. Pathogenesis After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen. Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Complete or paial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis. Clinical manifestations Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans. Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing. Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a sayer James syndrome, i.e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed). Pulmonary function tests demonstrate variable findings but typically show signs of airway obstruction. Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion. CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency. Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment No definite therapy exists for bronchiolitis obliterans. Administration of coicosteroids may be beneficial About other options Follicular bronchitis It is a lymphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles) It is rare in children. Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed. Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months. Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings. Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common. Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern. Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis This is a rare disorder. Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or ""microlith"". within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph. Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with afine sandlike micronodular appearance. Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood. When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exeion and non productive cough. Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign. Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation. Diagnosis Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or ""Sandstorm"" appearance. CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities. Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",A

The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin A is best described by:,Postsynaptic receptor blockade,Acetylcholinesterase inhibition,Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release,Slowing of myelinated nerve fiber transmission,"Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release Botulinum toxin is an effective inhibitor of presynaptic acetylcholine exocytosis. Acting at the neuromuscular junction, cellular uptake is believed to occur through an active cell surface receptor-mediated process. This three-step chemical denervation is initiated by the toxin selectively binding to sites on the surface membrane of cholinergic nerve endings. An energy-dependent endocytotic process ensues internalizing the cell membrane with bound protein. The final step is presumed to act on calcium-mediated exocytosis, preventing the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. It is also believed that Botulinum toxin acts as a zinc-dependent metalloendo protease to inhibit exocytosis.",C

All are true about acute appendicitis except:,Clinically indifferent from Meckel diverticulum in children,Lymphoid hyperplasia may causes acute appendicitis,Pain shift to right iliac fossa,Ultrasound is more diagnostic than CT scan,"Ans: D (Ultrasound is...] Investigation L & B 26th/1206# The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is essentially clinicalThe premise that it is better to remove a normal appendix than to delay diagnosis does not stand up to close scrutiny, particularly in the elderly. A number of clinical and laboratory-based scoring systems have been devised to assist diagnosis. The most \videly used is the Alvarado score. A score of 7 or more is strongly predictive of acute appendicitis.In patients with an equivocal score (5-6), abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CTexamination further reduces the rate of negative appendicectomy. Abdominal ultrasound examination is more useful in children and thin adults, particularly if gynaecological pathology is suspected, with a diagnostic accuracy in excess of 90 per centContrast-enhanced CT scan is most use fid in patients in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty, particularly older patients, in whom acute diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction and neoplasm are likely differential diagnoses. Selective use of CT scanning may be cost-effective by reducing both the negative appendicectomy rate and the length of hospital stayImaging Harrison 19th/1987-88The effectiveness of ultrasonography as a tool to diagnosis appendicitis is highly operator dependent. Even in very skilled hands, the appendix may not be visualized. Its overall sensitivity is 0.86, with a specificity of 0.81.Ultrasonography, especially intravaginal techniques, appears to be most useful for identifying pelvic pathology in wo men. Ultrasonographic findings suggesting the presence of appendicitis include wall thickening, an increased appendiceal diameter, and the presence of free fluid.The sensitivity and specificity' of computed tomography (CT) are 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. Thus, CT imaging, given its high negative predictive value, may be helpful if the diagnosis is in doubt, although studies performed early in the course of disease may not have any typical radiographic findings.""Pain is initially felt in umbilical region.

"A male executive, 50 year of age is seen in casualty with hypotension and hematemesis. There is previous history suggestive of alcohol intake of 100 ml. daily. The blood loss is around 2 litres. Most probable diagnosis is ?",Gastritis,Duodenal ulcer,Mallory-Weiss tear,Esophageal varices,"Ans. is 'b' ie. Duodenal Ulcer Hematemesis is suggestive of massive upper GI bleed, the impoant causes of which in descending order are Peptic ulcer Duodenal ulcer (MC cause) Gastric ulcer Esophageal varices Gastritis Mallory weiss tear Neoplams of esophagus, stomach and duodenum Duodenal ulcer : Peptic ulcer is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding, present in one-half to two-third of pts. with upper GI bleed. Bleeding may be the initial presenting symptoms in up to 10 percent of pts with peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer bleeding is four times more common than gastric ulcer bleeding. Esophageal varices : Bleeding esophageal varices or gastric varices in the presence of liver disease account for about 10-20% of massive upper GI bleeding. In this pt. esophageal varices appears to be the cause as the pt. is a chronic alcoholic But here the amount he drinks daily should be taken into consideration. In men 40 - 80 g/day of ethanol --> produces fatty liver 80 - 160 g/day of ethanol for 10 - 20 yrs --> causes hepatitis or cirrhosis (Women exhibit increased susceptibility* to alcoholic liver disease at quantities > 20 g/day) He drinks 100 ml daily. Different types of drinks contain varied amounts of alcohol. What this pt. drinks is not known but even strong drinks such as 86-proof beverage contains 80 gm of ethanol in 250 ml of drinks (Wine contain 80 gm of ethanol in 1000 ml of drinks) Thus this patient is unlikely to have an alcoholic liver disease and so esophageal varices can be ruled out. Moreever even in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, varices are cause of massive GI bleed in only 1/2 the cases. Peptic ulcer or gastritis form rest of the half. Mallory-Weiss tear It accounts for a small percentage (5 to 10%) It presents in a classic pattern - initially vomitting is without blood, but after retching and vomitting with epigastric pain, bleeding and haematemesis begin. Gastritis Acute gastritis can presents as massive bleeding (though rarely) It is most commonly associated with intake of NSAIDS, alcohol, coicosteroids and oral potassium supplements.

True about intra abdominal compament syndrome -,Intra abdominal pressure > 15 cm H2O,Pneumoperitoneum can produce it.,| Renal blood flow,All,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Intraabdominal pressure > 15 cm H2O Abdominal Compament syndrome Is caused by acute increase in the intraabdominal pressure, caused by accumulation of large amounts of fluid i.e. blood or edema It is seen in patients -who have sustained massive abdominal trauma had an operation for massive intraabdominal infection or undergone a complicated prolonged abdominal operation The Normal intraabdominal pressure (IAP) is nearly 0 cm of H20 and large amounts of fluid accumulation is needed before it begin to rise. When the IAP exceeds 15 cm F120, serious physiological changes begin to occur. The lungs are compressed by the upward displacement of the diaphragm. This causes a decrease in functional residual capacity, increased airway pressure, and ultimately hypoxia. a) - Cardiac output decreases due to diminished venous return to the hea and increased afterload. - Both venous return and aerial perfusion of every intraabdominal organ especially kidneys are severely compromised. This leads to oliguria which may progress to anuria. As IAP exceeds 25 to 30 cm of H2O life threatening hypoxia and anuric renal failure occurs. Physiological Consequences of Increased Infra-abdominal Pressure Decreased Increased Cardiac Output Cardiac rate Central Venous Return Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure Visceral blood flow Peak inspiratory pressure Renal blood flow Central venous pressure Glomerular filteration Intrapleural pressure Systemic vascular resistance Management The diagnosis is made by measuring bladder pressure (through Foley catheter). It represents the intraabdoinal pressure. Abdominal compament syndrome is a surgical emergency and treatment includes rapid decompression of the elevated intraabdominal pressure by opening the abdominal wound and performing a temporary closure of the abdominal wall with mesh or a plastic bag. Permanent closure is done 5 to 7 days later when the condition resolves. IAP pressures less than 15 mm of 1120 do not require decompression.",A

A person is not able to extend his metacarpophalangeal joint. This is due to injury to which nerve?,Ulnar nerve,Radial nerve injury,Median nerve injury,Post. Introsseus nerve injury,"Ans. is 'd > b' i.e., Post. Introsseus nerve injury > Radial nerve injury Extension of MP joint is caused by muscles supplied by posterior interosseus nerve. Posterior interosseus nerve is a branch of radial nerve, so radial nerve palsy also results in loss of ability to extend MP joint. However, for single answer, the best option is posterior interosseus nerve because the only finding in PIN palsy is inability to extend MP joint of thumb & fingers, and inability to do radial abduction of thumb. In radial nerve palsy other findings will also be there. Clinical features of radial nerve palsy Clinical features depend upon the site of lesion. 1. If lesion is high Wrist drop, thumb drop and finger drop. Inability to extend elbow, wrist, thumb & fingers (MP joint) Patient can extend interphalangeal joints due to action of lumbricals and interossei.

Which of the following statement about the primary lymphedema is NOT TRUE?,Onset between 2-35 years indicate lymphedema praecox,Onset after 35 years indicate lymphedema tarda,Lymphangiosarcoma never occurs,A/W Milroy's disease,"Primary Lymphedema: It has been generally been classified on the basis of the age of onset and presence of familial clustering. Primary lymphedema with onset before the age first year (with in two year according to L & B) of life is called is called congenital. The familial version of congenital lymphedema is known as Milroy's disease and is inherited as a dominant trait. Primary lymphedema with onset between the age of 1 and 35 years (b/w 2-35 according to L& B) is called lymphedema praecox. The familial version of familial praecox is known as Meige's disease. Primary lymphedema with onset after the age of 35 years is called lymphedema tarda. The primary lymphedema are relatively uncommon, occurring in 1 of every 10,000 individuals. The most common form of primary of lymphedema is praecox, which accounts for about 80% of the patients. Congetital and tarda lymphedemas each account for the remaining 10%.

"In appendicitis, the initial periumbilical pain is eventually localized to right iliac fossa because of",Peritoneum,Iliopsoas,Colon,Caecum,"Ans. a (Peritoneum) (Ref. Bailey and Love Surgery 25th//pg. 1207).With progressive inflammation of the appendix, the parietal peritoneum in the right iliac fossa becomes irritated, producing more intense, constant and localised somatic pain that begins to predominate. Patients often report this as an abdominal pain that has shifted and changed in character. Typically, coughing or sudden movement exacerbates the right iliac fossa pain. The classic visceral-somatic sequence of pain is present in only about half of those patients subsequently proven to have acute appendicitis.APPENDICITISClinical Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis -- Symptoms# Peri-umbilical colic, n Pain shifts to the right iliac fossa n Anorexia n Nausea.Clinical Diagnosis of Acute Appendicitis -- Signs# The patient is then asked to point to where the pain began and to where it moved (Pointing sign).# Rebound tenderness.# Deep palpation of the left iliac fossa may cause pain in the right iliac fossa (Rovsing's sign).# Occasionally an inflamed appendix lies on the psoas muscle and the patient, often a young adult, will lie with the right hip flexed for pain relief (Psoas sign).# Spasm of the obturator intemus is sometimes demonstrable when the hip is flexed and internally rotated. If an inflamed appendix is in contact with the obturator intemus, this manoeuvre will cause pain in the hypogastrium (Obturator sign) (Zachary Cope).# Cutaneous hyperaesthesia may be demonstrable in the right iliac fossa, but is rarely of diagnostic value.Special Features, According to Position of the Appendix# Retrocaecal- HYPEREXTENSION OF THE HIP JOINT may induce abdominal pain when the degree of psoas spasm is insufficient to cause flexion of the hip.0# Pelvic- Rectal examination reveals tenderness in the rectovesical pouch or the pouch of Douglas, especially on the right side. Spasm of the psoas and obturator internus muscles may be present with appendix in this position. An inflamed appendix in contact with the bladder may cause frequency of micturition.# Post ileal- Although this is rare, it accounts for some of the cases of missed appendix'.- Tenderness, if any, is ill-defined, although it may be present immediately to the right of the umbilicus.Special Features, According to Age# Infants- Appendicitis is relatively rare in infants under 36 months of age and for obvious reasons the patient is unable to give a history. Because of this, diagnosis is often delayed and thus the incidence of perforation and postoperative morbidity is considerably higher than in older children. Diffuse peritonitis can develop rapidly due to the underdeveloped greater omentum, which is unable to give much assistance in localising the infection.# The elderly- Gangrene and perforation occur much more frequently in elderly patients. Elderly patients with lax abdominal walls or obesity may harbour a gangrenous appendix with little evidence of it, and the clinical picture may simulate subacute intestinal obstruction. These features coupled with coincident medical conditions produce a much higher mortality for acute appendicitis in the elderly.# PregnancyAlder's test is useful for diagnosis.",A

Hadfields operation is performed for which of the following pathology?,Duct ectasia,Fibroadenoma,Mondors disease,Inflammatory breast carcinoma,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Duct ectasia Duct ectasia/periductal mastitis* This is a dilatation of the breast ducts, which is often associated with periductal inflammation.* The classical description of the pathogenesis of duct ectasia asserts that the first stage in the disorder is a dilatation in one or more of the larger lactiferous ducts, which fill with a stagnant brown or green secretion. This may discharge.* These fluids then set up an irritant reaction in surrounding tissue leading to periductal mastitis or even abscess and fistula formation.* In some cases, a chronic indurated mass forms beneath the areola, which mimics a carcinoma. Fibrosis eventually develops, which may cause slit-like nipple retraction.* A marked association between recurrent periductal inflammation and smoking has been demonstrated. It is certainly clear that cessation of smoking increases the chance of a long-term cure.Clinical features* Nipple discharge (of any colour), a subareolar mass, abscess, mammary duct fistula and/or nipple retraction are the most common symptom/s.Treatment* In the case of a mass or nipple retraction, a carcinoma must be excluded by obtaining a mammogram and negative cytology or histology. If any suspicion remains the mass should be excised.* Antibiotic therapy may be tried, the most appropriate agents being co-amoxiclav or flucloxacillin and metronidazole.* However, surgery is often the only option likely to bring about cure of this notoriously difficult condition; this consists of excision of all of the major ducts (Hadfield's operation). It is particularly important to shave the back of the nipple to ensure that all terminal ducts are removed. Failure to do so will lead to recurrence.",A

Regarding sudeck's osteodystrophy all are true except,Burning pain,Stiffness & swelling,Erythematous & cyanotic discolouration,Self limiting & good prognosis,"D i.e. Self limiting & good prognosis - International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) has advocated the term complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1) for reflex sympathetic dystrophy and term complex regional pain syndrome type 2 (CRPS-2) to describe causalgia or similar signs and symptoms associated with a known peripheral nerve injury. - So the main difference between CRPS-1 (RSD, Sudceck's osteodystrophy) and CRPS-2 (Causalgia) is etiology. CRPS type 1 being associated with a soft tissue injury or immobilization while CRPS type II follows a peripheral nerve injury. - Presence of delayed onset, out of propoion, severe persistent, burning pain, decreased range of motion (stiffness), and shiny skin (trophic changes), erythematous & cyanotic discoloration 4 weeks to 2 months after sustaining soft tissue injury (ankle sprain) or bony injury (Colle's fracture) suggest a diagnosis of CRPS type 1 (i.e. reflex sympathetic dystrophy). Prolonged disuse results in muscle atrophy, joint stiffness or contracture, and osteopenia and leads to prolonged recovery (poor prognosis). Sympathetectomy (eg stellate ganglion block) may be used for treatment. It is a group of vague painful conditions observed as a sequelae of trauma. The trauma is some times relatively minor and signs and symptoms are out of propoion of the trauma. It is characterized by pain, hyperaesthesia, swelling, stiffness, discolouration, and trophic changes wihich are out of propoion to the inciting eventQ The most characteristic symptom is pain out of propoion to the inciting event in both severity and duration. It is often burning in characterQ. Hence the term 'Causalgia' which means burning pain. - Due to hypeaesthsia to light touch, patients often withdraw when one attempts to examine the affected extremity - Swelling is the most consistent physical findingQ. It often begins in area of injury and is soft initially, as the process continues, oedema gradually becomes firm and involve much broader area. - Stiffness and discolouration of skin (red, blue & /or pallor)Q are other classic signs. - Trophic skin changes i.e. skin is shiny, thin with loss of normal wrinkles and creasesQ are characteristically seen late. - The most common radiographic finding is localized osteopeniaQ d/t increased blood flow to the bone - Prognosis is directly related to the time to diagnosis and initiation of therapy. The goal is to break abnormal sympathetic reflex and to restore motion. - The abnormal sympathetic response is interrupted by the use of sympatholytic drugs eg. a - adrenergic blockers, local somatic nerve blocks, (Bier's block, axillary block), stellate ganglion blocks, or surgical sympathetectomyQ - Physical therapy is of crucial impoance.

Class ID wounds are similar except that a prosthetic device 9e.g. , mesh or valve) is inseed. Clean/ contaminated wounds (class II) includes those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary, or genitourinary tract with indigenous bacterial flora is opened under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. Contaminated wounds (class III) include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with the extensive introduction of the bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major break in the sterile techniques (e.g. Open cardiac massage), gross spillage of the viscus contents such as from the intestine, or incisio through inflamed, albeit nonpurulent, tissue. Diy wounds (Class IV) include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occured and in which the necrotic tissue is present, those created in the presence of ove infection as evidenced by the presence of purulent material, and those created to access a perforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. The microbiology of SSIs (surgical site infections) is reflective of the initial host microflora such that SSIs following creation of class I wound are invariable, due solely to skin microbes found on that poion of te body, while SSIs subsequent to a class II wound created for the purpose of elective colon resection may be caused by either skin microbes or colonic microflora, or both.

The role of intravenous urography, which is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of ureteric colic, is being challenged by CT, which has become the first-line investigation in a number of centres.CT has the following advantages over IVU: it has higher sensitivity and specificity for calculus detection, it does not use intravenous contrast medium, it permits alternative diagnoses, and requires a shoer examination time.CT can visualise all radiopaque stones, as well as radiolucent stones such as uric acid and cystine calculi. An impoant limitation of CT is the fact that it does not permit functional evaluation of the kidneys and it is unable to assess the degree of obstruction.

The following are impoant in maintenance of normal fecal continence except -,Anorectal angulation,Rectal innervation,Internal sphincter,Haustral valve,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Haustral valve Normal fecal continence requires - adequate rectal wall compliance to accommodate the fecal bolus. appropriate neurogenic control of the pelvic floor and sphincter mechanism, and - functional internal and external sphincter muscles At rest the puborectalis muscle creates a 'sling' around the distal rectum, forming a relatively acute angle (Anorectal angle). Anorectal angle distributes intraabdominal forces onto the pelvic floor and play an impoant role in the continence mechanism. At the time of defecation, this angle straightens, allowing the downward force to be applied along the axis of the rectum and anal canal. The internal & external sphincters are tonically active at rest. - the internal sphincter is responsible for most of the resting, involuntary sphincter force - the external sphincter is responsible for voluntary sphincter force. Both the internal and external sphincters are innervated by pudendal nerve. Finally, the hemorrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically blocking the anal canal. Thus impaired continence may result from : - poor rectal compliance - injury to internal and/or external sphincter or puborectalis, or - nerve damage or neuropathy",D

A 40 year old female presenting with a slow growing painless mass is recently diagnosed to have thyroid cancer. Which is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer?,Medullary carcinoma,Papillary carcinoma,Follicular carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,"Papillary carcinoma accounts for 80% of all thyroid malignancies in iodine sufficient areas and is the predominant thyroid cancer in children and individuals exposed to external radiation. It is more common in women with a 2:1 female to male ratio. Mean age of presentation is 30 to 40 years. Most patients presents with a slow growing painless mass in the neck. In locally advanced invasive disease patients presents with dysphagia, dyspnea and dysphonia. It is usually diagnosed by FNAB of the thyroid mass or lymph node. Pathologic diagnosis is made by the characteristic nuclear features such as presence of cuboidal cells with pale, abundant cytoplasm, crowded nuclei that may demonstrate grooving and presence of intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions (Orphan Annie nuclei). Psammoma bodies may also be present. Ref: Schwaz's Principles of Surgery, 9e, chapter 38",B

It is the most common tumor of the parotid, submandibular & sublingual glands (Most common tumor of minor salivary glands are Adenoid cystic Ca & mucoepidermoid ca.) Wahin's tumor arises only from the parotid gland. Acinic cell ca is a low grade malignant tumor. Most arise in the parotids; the small remainder arise in the submandibular glands. They rarely involve the minor glands. Frey syndrome (also k/a gustatory sweating) Is a complication of parotidectomy surgery. It results from damage of the auriculotemporal nerve during dissection, followed by inappropriate regeneration of parasympathetic autonomic nerve fibres which thus stimulate the sweat glands of the overlying skin (hence also k/a auriculotemporal syndrome). The clinical features of Frey syndrome include sweating and erythema over the region of the parotid glands surgical bed as a consequence of autonomic stimulation of salivation by smell or taste of food.",C
A nodule of 2 cm in left thyroid diagnosed as papillary Ca. Treatment of choice is:,Hemithyroidectomy,Total thyroidectomy,Thyroidectomy with radical dissection,Radiotherapy,"Papillary adenocarcinoma accounts for 85% of cancers of the thyroid gland. The tumor usually appears in early adult life and presents as a solitary nodule. For papillary carcinoma over 1 cm, acceptable operations are near-total or total thyroidectomy. For solitary papillary carcinomas less than 1 cm, thyroid lobectomy is adequate treatment. Subtotal or paial lobectomy is contraindicated because the incidence of tumor recurrence is greater and survival is shoer. Ref: Clark O.H. (2010). Chapter 16. Thyroid & Parathyroid. In G.M.

"All of the following are ominous signs in a case of severe head injury, EXCEPT:",Anisocoria,Decoicate posturing,Decerebrate posturing,Development of diabetes insipidus,"Anisocoria, decoicate posturing, and decerebrate posturing, all are mentioned as the ominous signs of severe head injury so development of diabetes insipidus is the answer of choice by exclusion here. Normally are equal in size, round and briskly reactive to light. Brain injury and pressure on the nerves leading to pupils can produce change in pupil size, shape and reacting to light and movement. These changes can be correlated with the severity and type of brain injury. A sudden enlargement (Dilation) of one pupil (anisocoria) is an ominous sighn that require immediate intervention. This typically signals increased pressure on one side of the brain, causing the brain to shift downwards in the skull cavity (uncal or tonsillar herniation). ""While decoicate posturing is still an ominous sign of severe brain damage, decerebrate posturing is usually indicative of more severe damage as the rubrospinal tract and hence, the red nucleus, is also involved indicating lesion lower in the brainstem"". Signs of brain injury: Loss of the normal autoregulation of blood pressure and pulse, called the cushing's reflex is a hallmark of severe brain injury or imminent crisis. This generally results in a sudden rise in blood pressure and a slowing of the pulse. A person with a moderate or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions, an inability to awaken, dilation of one or more pupils, slurred speech, aphasia (word- finding difficulties), dysahria (muscle weakness that causes disordered speech), weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, confusion,restlessness, or agitation. When the pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreted ICP) rises too high, it can be deadly. Sign of Increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, and a blown pupil, one that fail to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow hea rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous.

True about flail chest are all except: March 2007,Ultimately leads to respiratory failure,Paradoxical respiration,Fracture of 3-4 ribs,Mediastinal shift,"Ans. D: Mediastinal shift A flail chest occurs when multiple adjacent ribs are broken in multiple places,i.e. three or more ribs fractured in two or more places, separating a segment, so a pa of the chest wall moves independently. Flail chest is invariably accompanied by pulmonary contusion, that can interfere with blood oxygenation. Often, it is the contusion, not the flail segment, that is the main cause of respiratory failure. The characteristic paradoxical motion of the flail segment occurs due to pressure changes associated with respiration that the rib cage normally resists: During normal inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and intercostal muscles push the rib cage out. Pressure in the thorax decreases below atmospheric pressure, and air rushes in through the trachea. However, a flail segment will not resist the decreased pressure and will appear to push in while the rest of the rib cage expands. During normal expiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, allowing the abdominal organs to push air upwards and out of the thorax. However, a flail segment will also be pushed out while the rest of the rib cage contracts. The constant motion of the ribs in the flail segment at the site of the fracture is incredibly painful, and, untreated, the sharp broken edges of the ribs are likely to eventually puncture the pleural sac and lung, possibly causing a pneumothorax.",D

Regarding liver enzymes true is?,ALT is less specific than AST,Absolute levels of enzyme markers correlate with outcome,Glutathione-s-transferase used as hepatic prognostic marker following surgery,None,"Glutathione-s-transferase used as hepatic prognostic marker following surgery REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition chapter 298 The aminotransferases (transaminases) are sensitive indicators of liver cell injury and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular diseases such as hepatitis. They include the aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) There is a poor correlation between the degree of liver cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. Thus, the absolute elevation of the aminotransferases is of no prognostic significance in acute hepatocellular disorders. Alanine aminotransferase: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was formerly known as SGPT. This enzyme enters the blood when liver cells are damaged or destroyed and circulates for a few days. ALT is found primarily in the liver. (More specific for liver pathology) This enzyme is a sensitive indicator of active liver damage but does not indicate the cause or reversibility of the damage. An increase of at least three times normal indicates significant liver damage within the previous 2 to 5 days. Aspaate aminotransferase: Aspaate transaminase (AST), also called as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). AST is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration. Alpha Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Increased GST indicates early hepatocyte injury. Alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a superior marker of hepatocyte injury from toxicity; ischemia, and other liver injury. It is unique to hepatocytes, found in high concentrations, and is readily released in response to injury. Its rapid release into and removal from the circulation provides immediate information regarding liver status.",C

The following statements about management of this paicular patient are true, EXCEPT:",USG can be an useful investigation,Radical duct excision is the operation of choice,"Galactogram, though useful, is not essential",Majority of blood stained nipple discharge are due to papillomas or other benign conditions,"Unilateral, spontaneous, serous or serosanguinous discharge from the single duct is usually caused by an intraductal papilloma or rarely, by an intraductal cancer. Mostly the underlying cause is a ductal papilloma or ductal ectasia, but since the chances of malignancies are high, it must be investigated fuher. The risk of malignancy is increased if an underlying mass is present. Also know: Investigation used are: 1. Mammography: can show any underlying suspicious lesion 2. Cytological examination: this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer. 3. Galactography/ductography: The primary indication of the ductography is nipple discharge, paicularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential, since excision of the bloody ductal system is needed regardless of the diagnosis. In ductography, a contrast medium is injected into the duct and a mammogram taken. This may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Ductal ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures. USG may show underlying mass or ductal ectasia. The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (microdochectomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them to a histopathological diagnosis. Radical duct excision (meaning removal of all lactiferous duct) is not done. Ref: CSDT 12/e, page 299.",B

All of the following are seen in chronic pyloric obstruction except: March 2010,Alkaline urine,Acidic urine,Hypochloremia,Hypokalemia,"Ans. A: Alkaline urine Paradoxical aciduria occurs when a metabolic alkalosis caused by severe vomiting as seen in pyloric obstruction. Blood tests initially will reveal hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of hydrochloric acid vomiting, but sodium and potassium levels are normal. However as dehydration progresses, more profound metabolic abnormalities arise, paly due to renal dysfunction. Initially the urine has low chloride and high bicarbonate content, reflecting primary metabolic abnormality. This bicarbonate is excreted along with sodium and so, with time patient becomes progressively hyponatremic and more profoundly dehydrated. Because of dehydration, a phase of sodium retention follows and potassium and hydrogen are excreted in preference. This results in urine becoming paradoxically acidic and hypokalemia ensues.",A

Rx of choice in postoperative lung collapse is ?,Needle drainage,Coicosteroids,Pulmonary resection,Endoscopic suction,"Ans is 'd' ie Endoscopic suction The text given on post-op lung collapse in sabiston as well as schwaz mention no where that `endoscopic suction' is a treatment modality But still reading the text it appears that Endoscopic suction is the best answer among the given options. Below, I have quoted the text. Read it to make your own inference. ""The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be paicularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions. Pneumonia may develop early (i.e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i.e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care-related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care-related pneumonia. Presentation and Management The most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients has a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfoable from the fever but has no other ove pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation. Prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, paicularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds. Encouraging the patient to cough while applying counterpressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. Patients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated.""",D

A 58 year old male alcoholic with chronic pancreatitis develops a palpable abdominal mass. Ultrasound reveals a 9 cm cystic lesion adjacent to the pancreas. An impoant complication that might occur if this cyst ruptured would be?,Anaphylactic shock,Carcinomatosis,Disseminated infection,Intestinal hemorrhage,"The patient most likely has a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a complication of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not a true cyst; it is lined by granulation tissue and collagen. It contains pancreatic juices and lysed blood, so rupture would spill the active digestive enzymes onto the adjacent viscera, paicularly the stomach, small intestine, and transverse colon. Digestive action produces potentially severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Anaphylactic shock results from massive activation of the IgE-mediated branch of the immune system. Pancreatic secretions do not elicit an IgE response. The classic abdominal cyst that ruptures, producing anaphylactic shock, is a hydatid cyst. Carcinomatosis is widespread serosal spread of a carcinoma, typically due to tumor spillage into a body cavity. Although this may occur with pancreatic mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, this disease is far less likely to occur than is pancreatic pseudocyst in a patient with chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic pseudocyst is not an infective disease. Although septic abscesses do occur in the abdomen, and may even complicate a pancreatic pseudocyst, the danger of rupture is more associated with tissue destruction by pancreatic enzymes than with infection.

"Which of the following refinements of serum PSA is used to determine the need for TRUS guided biopsy of prostate, even though the level of serum PSA is still in normal range?",PSAD (prostate-specific antigen density),PSA velocity,Free/Total PSA,Complexed/Total PSA,"PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower ""upper"" limit of normal for younger males and higher ""upper"" limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0.15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0.75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the ""normal"" range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O .15, for complexed total PSA of <0.70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0.25 improved specificity in one study by 20%. These modifications are designed to reduce the frequency of biopsies in men without cancer.",B
What is probable diagnosis of a pt. with spinal POP cast presenting with bilious vomitting ?,Acute dilation of stomach,Duodenal obstruction,Peritonitis,Acute pancreatitis,"Ans is (b) Duodenal obstruction This is a patient with superior mesenteric syndrome or 'Wilkie's Syndrome' the superior mesenteric aery compresses the 3rd poion of the duodenum as it passes over it. Superior mesenteric Aery arises from the Ant. aspect of Aoa, passes behind the neck of pancreas but in front of the uncinate process and crosses in front of the 3rd poion of the duodenum to enter the root of mesentery. The acute angle at which the superior mesenteric aery arises from the Aoa may compress the transverse poion of the duodenum between it and Aoa causing paial intestinal Strutil Out obstruction, a condition referred to as superior mesenteric aery compression syndrome.

A well differentiated follicular carcinoma of thyroid can be best differentiated from a follicular adenoma by:,Hurthle cell change,Lining of tall columnar and cuboidal cells,Vascular invasion,Nuclear features,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Vascular Invasion Repeat All India 09Differentiation between follicular carcinoma and follicular adenoma is dependent on histological criteria of capsular and vascular invasion.This invasion cannot be determined with the preoperative use of FNA cytology. It requires histological analysis. Robbins writes- ""While nuclear features are helpful in distinguishing papillary from follicular neoplasms, they are of little value in distinguishing follicular adenomas from minimally invasive follicular carcinomas. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. The criterion for vascular invasion is applicable only to capsular vessels and vascular spaces beyond the capsule; the presence of tumor plugs within intra-tumoral blood vessels has little prognostic significance.

Multiple cutaneous sebaceous adenomas are seen in:,Cowden syndrome,Gardner syndrome,Turcot syndrome,Muir Torre syndrome,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Muir Torre syndrome Multiple sebaceous Neoplasms (adenomas) are characterstics of Muir Torre syndrome. Muir-Torre syndrome Muir-Tone syndrome is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome. The hallmark of Muir-Tone syndrome is presence of numerous sebaceous gland neoplasms, including carcinomas that may precede, follow, or coexist with visceral cancers. Visceral cancers associated with MTS are - GI tract adenocarcinoma of the colon or genitourinary tract, or lymphoma. The defining feature of this syndrome is the combination of sebaceous gland tumours and at least one visceral cancer. Typical skin tumours associated with this syndrome include sebaceous adenomas, epitheliomas and carcinomas. Keratoacanthomas and basal cell carcinomas with sebaceous differentiation also occur. All these sebaceous gland tumours are rare in the general population; the finding of such a tumour is a marker for MTS. Early recognition of the syndrome in patients with sebaceous gland tumours should facilitate early detection of subsequent malignancies if the patient is entered into appropriate screening programmes. Colorectal cancer is the commonest visceral neoplasm to occur in MTS. Cutaneous neoplasms Visceral malignancies * Sebaceous adenomas * GIT malignancies most Muir Torre * sebaceous epitheliomas commonly colorectal ca syndrome * sebaceous carcinomas * Genitourinary ca * Keratocanthoma * Basal cell carcinoma Other options: Cowden's disease or multiple hamaoma syndrome is an autosomal-dominant syndrome with numerous tumors of the hair follicles called tricholemmomas located on the face. These patients have very high risk of breast and thyroid carcinomas. Bilateral mastectomies may be recommended. Mammography and other exposure of the breast tissue to 0 radiation is contraindicated. Multiple Hamaomatous polyps occur anywhere in the GI tract. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP; familial adenomatous polyposis, a colorectal cancer syndrome characterized by hundreds of adenomatous colorectal polyps, with an inevitable progression to colorectal cancer by age 40. Cutaneous manifestations may be the presenting sign and include numerous epidermal cysts and soft tissue tumors. Osteomas of mandible and skull are the most common facial lesions in Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Epidermoid cysts - Desmoid tumors - Osteomas - Thyroid neoplasms, and - Congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium Turcot's syndrome is also a variant of FAP characterized by: - Colorectal polyposis - Brain tumors (Medulloblastoma, Glioblastoma multiforme) Also Know: Gorlin-Goltz syndrome or Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas, numerous bony abnormalities, and a strong predisposition for malignancy.

"A 18 yrs old boy was playing football, when he suddenly twisted his knee on the ankle and he fell down. He got up after 10 minutes and again staed playing, but next day his knee was swollen and he could not move it. The most probable cause is:",Medial meniscus tear,Anterior cruciate ligament tear,Medial collateral ligament injury,Posterior cruciate ligament injury,"Injury to the medial meniscus is the most frequent internal derangement of the knee joint. Clinical findings include swelling, pain, and varying degrees of restriction of flexion or extension. True locking (inability to fully extend the knee) is highly suggestive of meniscal tear. A marginal tear permits displacement of the medial fragment into the intercondylar region (bucket-handle tear) and prevents either complete extension or complete flexion.

Which of the following should contraindicate performance of the Fontan procedure?,Patient age of 25 years.,Severe mitral insufficiency.,Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18 mm. Hg.,Right pulmonary aery stenosis,"Good ventricular function and low pulmonary vascular resistance are essential requirements for a successful Fontan procedure. The Fontan operation should not be performed when ventricular ejection fraction is less than 30% or ventricular end-diastolic pressure is greater than 15 mm. Hg. Pulmonary vascular resistance in excess of 4 Woods units should also be considered an absolute contraindication for Fontan correction. Age at the time of Fontan procedure does not appear to be a major risk factor, except before age 2 years. Although patients who have survived into the third or fouh decade are likely to have ventricular dysfunction, a Fontan procedure can be performed successfully in these older patients if ventricular function and pulmonary vascular resistance meet the above criteria. In patients with tricuspid atresia a competent mitral valve is impoant for satisfactory cardiac output after the Fontan procedure. The presence of severe mitral insufficiency, however, should not necessarily contraindicate the procedure. In these cases it is recommended that the mitral valve be repaired or replaced in combination with the creation of a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. A completion Fontan operation is performed later. Distoed or stenosed pulmonary aeries are common sequelae of systemic-to-pulmonary aery shunts and may result in unsatisfactorily high pulmonary vascular resistance. In most cases, these stenoses can be repaired at the time of Fontan correction or with a bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis.",C
Insulinoma is most commonly located in which pa of the pancreas -,Head,Body,Tail,Equally distributed,"Ans is 'd' i.e. is equally distributed Insulinomas invariably occur only in the pancreas, distributed equally in the pancreatic head, body and tail"". -- Harrison 17/e * Insulinomas are a cell endocrinal tumur of the pancreas. * Insulinomas are the most common pancreatic endocrine neoplasms. The symptoms are produced due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia Most of the insulinomas are solitary and benign, Only about 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. (keep in mind that all other endocrine tumours of pancreas are usually malignant). Symptoms of insulinoma ? - The most common symptom is due to the effect of hypoglycemia on the central nervous system. - These symptoms are - confusion, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, coma Other symptoms are due to increased secretion of catecholamines which includes sweating, tremor and palpitations. Classic diagnostic criteria is - Whipple's triad - Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting. - Blood glucose below 2.8 mmol/L (50mg/d1) during symptomatic episodes. - Relief of symptoms by intravenous administration of Glucose. The most useful diagnostic test and the only one indicated in almost all patients is demonstration of fasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately high level of insulin. - The patient is fasted for 72 hrs or till the symptoms of hypoglycemia develop. - When hypoglycemia develops, serum level of insulin is measured. A ratio of plasma insulin to glucose > 0.3 is diagnostic. Localization of the tumour Once the diagnosis has been made, localization of the tumour is must for surgery. The most impoant examination for localization of tumour is intraoperative ultrasound, which can indentify pancreatic tumour in all cases. It is more sensitive than any other method Other impoant methods of localization ? High resolution CT and MRI. Endoscopic ultrasound examination of pancreas. - Selective aeriography T/T - Surgical excision is the t/t of choice ? - Since most insulinomas are benign simple enucleation is done.",D

One of the following is characterised by RIM sign:,Hydronephrosis (Gross),Hypernephroma,Chronic pyelonephritis,Polycystic kidney,"Ans is 'a' ie Hydronephrosis (Gross) We will write down, what we have got so far about the 'rim sign'.The rim sign is seen in cases of ureteral calculi.[The""rim sign,"" originally reported by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Ref: http://radioloev.rsna.ors/content/202/3/709.abstract: httv://emedicine.medscave.com/article/456872-overview) 1 Rim sign has also been mentioned in cases of renal infarction, but here its k/a cortical rim sign.[Cortical rim sign: Entire kidney is nonenhancing except for the outer 2 to 4 mm of cortex, which are perfused by capsular branches (Ref: http://www. learningradiologv.com/notes/gunotes/renalinfarctpage.htm) 7Spider leg appearance - Polycystic kidney*Cobra head appearance - Ureterocele*Flower vase appearance of ureters - Horse shoe kidney*Sandy patches - Schistosomiasis of bladder*Soap bubble appearance - Hydronephrosis*Apple core lesion on barium enema - Ca colon*Claw appearance on barium enema - Intussusception*Saw tooth appearance - Diverticula of colon*Birds beak appearance of esophagus on barium meal - Achalasia*Cork screw appearance of esophagus on barium meal - Diffuse esophageal spasm*String sign of Kantor - Crohn's ds*Thumb printing sign - Ischemic colitis* Now as far as the answer is concerned, among the given options ""hydronephrosis"" appears to be the best choice, as ureteric calculi would lead to hydronephrosis.",A

DNA fingerprinting is used for paternity testing and forensic identification of suspects. Which of the following is the most accurate description of DNA fingerprinting?,"DNA can be isolated from blood, skin, or sperm and analyzed for variable patterns of restriction fragments arising from tandemly repeated sequences (microsatellites)","DNA is copied from blood, skin, or sperm RNA using reverse transcriptase and analyzed for the pattern of complementary DNAs","DNA is isolated from blood, skin, or sperm and its fragment size distribution is analyzed by gel electrophoresis","DNA is isolated from blood, skin, or sperm and hybridized with probes from the HLA locus to visualize HLA gene patterns","Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) arising from variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) are the basis of the DNA fingerprinting technique. The process is: (1) isolation of DNA from parent/child or forensicspecimens using blood, skin, or semen; (2) PCR amplification and radioactive labeling of DNA from variable regions in each sample; (3) separation of the variable DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis; and (4) comparison of the DNA fragment patterns among samples. Since numbers of arrays of repeats of two, three, or four base pairs (microsatellites) may vary from 5 to 100 at a paicular chromosome locus, paicular alleles may occur in less than 1% of the population. As a result, analysis of three loci, each with two alleles, can produce odds as high as (100)6 that the pattern matches a putative father or suspect as compared to a random person from the general population. Reverse transcription based upon RNA-directed DNA synthesis is not utilized in DNA fingerprinting, and the size distribution of undigested DNA reflects its integrity during isolation rather than individual identify. HLA typing uses antibodies to define the constellation of alleles from various loci in the HLA region on chromosome 6. The tendency for ceain HLA alleles to occur together (associate) on the same chromosome as haplotypes greatly reduces their odds of identity when compared to DNA fingerprinting.",A

Ch 69/1171* Angiodysplasia is a degenerative lesion of previously healthy blood vessels found most commonly in the cecum and proximal ascending colon.* 77% of angiodysplasias are located in the cecum and ascending colon, 15% are located in the jejunum and ileum, and the remainder are distributed throughout the alimentary tract. These lesions typically are non- palpable and small (< 5 mm).* Angiodysplasia is the most common vascular abnormality of the GI tract.

Investigation of choice for hydatid disease is: September 2009,CT scan,Elisa,Biopsy,USG,"Ans. D: USG Laboratory Studies The results of routine laboratory blood work are nonspecific. Liver involvement may be reflected in an elevated bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase level. Leukocytosis may suggest infection of the cyst. Eosinophilia is present in 25% of all persons who are infected, while hypogammaglobinemia is present in 30%. Almost every serodiagnostic technique has been evaluated for echinococcosis, with variable results. - The indirect hemagglutination test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have a sensitivity of 80% overall (90% in hepatic echinococcosis, 40% in pulmonary echinococcosis) and are the initial screening tests of choice. - Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrate antibodies to antigen 5 and provide specific confirmation of reactivity. - The ELISA test is useful in follow-up to detect recurrence. Imaging Studies - Plain films Findings from plain films of the chest, abdomen, or any other involved site are, at best, nonspecific and mostly nonrevealing. A thin rim of calcification delineating a cyst is suggestive of an echinococcal cyst. - Ultrasound Ultrasonography helps in the diagnosis of hydatid cysts when the daughter cysts and hydatid sand are demonstrated. The accuracy of ultrasound evaluations remains operator-dependent. CT scan CT scan has an accuracy of 98% and the sensitivity to demonstrate the daughter cysts. It is the best test for the differentiation of hydatid from amebic and pyogenic cysts in the liver. - MRI: Images show the cysts adequately, but MRI offers no real advantage over CT scan. Other Tests - Casoni test Historically, an intradermal skin test (Casoni test) was used and had a sensitivity of 70%. It is now largely abandoned because of its low sensitivity, low accuracy, and potential for severe local allergic reaction.",D

All are true regarding myositis ossificans progressive except,Usually involve childs,Progressive form of normal myositis,Respiratory problems,Ankylosis,"B i.e. Progressive form of normal myosites Fibrodysplasia (Myositis) Ossificans Progressiva Patho Histology - It is a rare autosomal dominant (AD) disorder of connective tissue differentiation. - Main pathogenic mechanism is defective regulation of the induction of endochondral ossification - Intense perivascular lymphocytic infiltration into normal skeletal muscles is the earliest featureQ - The proliferating loose myxoid fibrous tissue infiltrates and replaces normally formed fibrous connective tissue and striated muscle - Numerous small blood vessels, cells immunoreactive for S -100 protein and cailagenous foci are scattered among proliferating lesion. - Endochondral ossification is a feature of maturing lesion. Only the absence of normal anatomical orientation differentiates this hetrotropic bone from normal. Otherwise it demonstrates all features of normal bone modeling (i.e., coical & trabecular organization, medullary canal, metaphyseal funneling) and remodeling (i.e., respond to weight bearing stress, resistance to fatigue fracture) - Bone morphogenetic protein - 4 (BMP - 4) is over expressed and Basic fibroblast growth factor which is an extremely potent stimulator of angiogenesis (in vivo) is elevated in urine during acute flare up stage. Clinical features - In myositis ossificans progressiva, the life expectancy is decreased and the commonest causes of death is lung diseaseQ. This autosomal dominant disease is characterized by hetrotropic ossification most commonly involving spine and congenital defomities of hand &feetQ. The disease usually stas before 6 year of ageQ - Moality in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive (myositis ossificans progressiva) is usually related to restrictive lung disease caused by an inability of chest to expandQ. - Begins in childhood usually before age of 6 yearsQ and becomes evident with in first 10 years of life. - Primary congenital skeletal abnormality is deformity of great toeQ. The toes may be sho, in valgus, monophalangic or have abnormal shaped proximal phalanx. - Begins as painful erythematous subfascial nodule mostly located on posterior aspect of neck & back which gradually calcify & eventually ossify (hetrotropic ossification) - The hetrotropic ossification progress in a axial to appendcular, cranial to caudal and proximal to distal direction.

A: Seen predominantly in women Pilonidal disease is described back as far as 1833, when Mayo described a hair-containing cyst located just below the coccyx. Hodge coined the term ""pilonidal"" from its Latin origins in 1880. Pilonidal disease describes a spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic hair-containing cysts and sinuses to large symptomatic abscesses of the sacrococcygeal region that have some tendency to recur Pilonidal disease involves loose hair and skin and perineal flora. Risk factors for pilonidal disease include male gender, hirsute individuals, Caucasians, sitting occupations, existence of a deep natal cleft, and presence of hair within the natal cleft. A common affliction amongst the military, it has been referred to as 'jeep disease'. Family history is seen in 38% of patients with pilonidal disease.

In this case, the patient has a poorly healing ulcer in his right toe, which likely has spread to the metatarsal bone. Osteomyelitis can be caused by any microorganism, but is most often due to pyogenic bacteria or mycobacteria. Osteitis deformans is also known as Paget disease of the bone. It is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, characterized by abnormal and chaotic bone resorption and formation. It most commonly occurs in the spine, pelvis, skull, and long bones of the lower extremities. Osteoahritis is the most common form of ahritis. It is a chronic noninflammatory disease characterized by degeneration of aicular cailage. It is accompanied by new bone formation rather than bone destruction. Osteomalacia is due to vitamin D deficiency in adults. It is associated with defective calcification of the bone matrix. Patients can experience bone pain, which often occurs in the ribs and thighs.

The chemotherapy drug fluorouracil undergoes a series of chemical changes in vivo that result in a covalent complex such that it is bound to both thymidylate synthase and methylene-tetrahydrofolate. The inhibition of deoxythymidilate formation and subsequent blockage of cell division is due to,Allosteric inhibition,Competitive inhibition,Irreversible inhibition,Noncovalent inhibition,"Since rapidly multiplying cancer cells are dependent upon the synthesis of deoxythymidilate (dTMP) from deoxyuridylate (dUMP), a prime target in cancer therapy has been inhibition of dTMP synthesis. The anticancer drug fluorouracil is conveed in vivo to fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), which is an analogue of dUMP. FdUMP irreversibly forms a covalent complex with the enzyme thymidylate synthase and its substrate N5,N10-methylene- tetrahydrofolate. This is a case of suicide inhibition, where an enzyme actually paicipates in the change of a substrate into a covalently linked inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits its catalytic activity.",C

True about gastrinoma are all except,Located mostly in Pancreas,Unusal located ulcer,90% beningn,Hypersecretion of gastric acid,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome This syndrome is mentioned here because the gastrin producing endocrine tumour is often found in the duodenal loop, although it also occurs in the pancreas, especially the head. It is a cause of persistent peptic ulceration. Before the development of potent gastric antisecretory agents, the condition was recognised by the sometimes fulminant peptic ulceration which did not respond to gastric surgery sho of total gastrectomy. It was also recognisable from gastric secretory studies in which the patient had a very high basal acid output but no marked response to pentagastrin, as the parietal cell mass was already nearly maximally stimulated by pathological levels of gastrin. The advent of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole has rendered this extreme endocrine condition fully controllable, but also less easily recognised. Gastrinomas may be either sporadic or associated with the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I (in which a parathyroid adenoma is almost invariable). The tumours are most commonly found in the 'gastrinoma triangle' (Passaro) defined by the junction of the cystic duct and common bile duct superiorly, the junction of the second and third pas of the duodenum inferiorly, and the junction of the neck and body of the pancreas medially (essentially the superior mesenteric aery). Many are found in the duodenal loop, presumably arising in the G cells found in Brunner's glands. It is extremely impoant that the duodenal wall is very carefully inspected endoscopically and also at operation. Very often all that can be detected is a small nodule that projects into the medial wall of the duodenum. Even malignant sporadic gastrinomas may have a very indolent course. The palliative resection of liver metastases may be beneficial and liver transplantation is practised in some centres, as for other gut endocrine tumours, with reasonable long-term results. However, the minority of tumours found to the left of the superior mesenteric aery (outside the 'triangle') seem to have a worse prognosis, more having liver metastases at presentation. In MEN type I, the tumours may be multiple and the condition is incurable. Even in this situation,as with sporadic gastrinoma, surgical treatment should be employed to remove any obvious tumours and associated lymphatic metastases, as the palliation achieved may be good.

"In Emergency department, 70 years old male presents with acute obstruction. He has Ca. descending colon, M/n of choice :",Defunctioning colostomy,Total Colectomy,Hartmann's procedure,Abdominoperineal resection,"Ans is 'c' ie Hartman's procedure As explained below, a variety of operations can be done in the obstructing lesion of left colon depending on a variety of factors, but Hartman's procedure is the most commonly preferred operation.Management of malignant large bowel obstructionMalignant obstruction is the most common cause of large bowel obstructionThe primary goal of treatment is decompression of the obstructed segment to prevent perforation. Removal of the malignant lesion is the secondary goal but a single operation to accomplish both objectives is preferred whenever possible.There are a variety of operation available and the operative strategy depends on many factors - the patients physical condition & age, location and extent of tumor and the experience of the surgical team.Obstructing lesion of the right colonIf the patient's condition is stable and the remaining bowel appears healthy - resection and ileocolic anastomosis in a single stage is the preferred op.If the patient's condition is unstable or bowel perforation has occurred - lesion is resected but no anastomosis done, an ileostomy is done and anastomosis is performed at a second operation.Nonresectable lesions- are bypassed by diversion procedures (colostomy or cecosigmoidostomy)Obstructing lesion of left colonTraditionally and most commonly performed procedure is - resection of lesion and proximal diversion done with proximal end colostomy or ileostomy (also known as Hartman's procedure)However, there is an increasing trend towards doing & primary anastomosis in a single stage operation. Primary anastomosis done in emergency setting in an unprepared bowel is associated with increased infection and anastomotic failure; but recent techniques of on-table lavage and more liberal application of extended resection coupled with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive perioperative care has improved the outcome for primary anastomosis.So in a stable patient with no diffuse peritonitis, no severe bowel injury and a resectable tumor- a resection and primary anastomosis should be preferred.If the patient is unstable, or the bowel is compromised - resection and proximal diversion is done.Another option available for left sided obstructing lesion is- subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis in one stage. It can be done if the proximal colon looks unhealthy (vascular compromise, serosal tears, perforation).Another option available is a colonic stent placement. This allows for decompression of the obstruction and converts the emergency situation into an elective setting.

This syndrome is called overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is among the more devastating sequelae of asplenia and is the most common fatal late complication of splenectomy. The loss of the spleen's ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells predisposes the patient to infection by encapsulated bacteria or parasites. Splenectomy also results in the loss of a significant source of antibody production. Infection may occur at any time after splenectomy; in one recent series, most infections occurred more than 2 years after splenectomy, and 42% occurred more than 5 years after splenectomy.""- Sabiston I8/e The risk for OPSI is greater after splenectomy for malignancy or hematologic disease than for trauma. The risk also appears to be greater in young children (<4 years of age). OPSI may begin with a relatively mild-appearing prodrome, including fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms may then progress rapidly to fulminant bacteremic septic shock, with accompanying hypotension, anuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and death within hours of presentation. The moality rate is between 50% and 70% for fully developed OPSI despite antibiotics and intensive care. Survivors often have a long and complicated hospital course with severe sequelae, such as peripheral gangrene requiring amputation, deafness from meningitis, mastoid osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and cardiac valvular destruction. S. pneumoniae is the most frequently involved organism in OPSI and is estimated to be responsible for between 50% and 90% of cases. Other organisms involved in OPSI include Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus species and other pneumococcal species, Salmonella species, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (implicated in OPSI as a sequela of dog bites). Currently, the standard of care for postsplenectomy patients includes immunization within 2 weeks of splenectomy with: - polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23), - H. influenzae type b conjugate, and - meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Antibiotic prophylaxis--usually a single daily dose of penicillin or amoxicillin--is recommended for asplenic children. (Antibiotic prophylaxis is controversia. Schwaz 9/e and Sabiston 18/e advise chemoprophylaxis; but Harrison 17/e does not recommend it)",A

Weight allowed in skeletal traction upto?,5 kg,I 0 kg,20 kg,30 kg,"Ans. is `c' i.e., 20 kg Traction Traction is defined as a pulling force to treat muscle or skeletal disorders (fractures, dislocation). There are two major types of tractions : skin & skeletal traction: A. Skin traction Here the traction is applied to the skin (using adhesive or nonadhesive tape or straps) which is indirectly transmitted to the bone. Skin traction can sustain a pull of no more than 4 to 5 kgs. Skin traction is given by adhesive tape & bandage, Buck's appratus. Gallow's/Bryant's/Russel traction are examples of skin traction. B. Skeletal traction Skeletal traction is an invasive procedure in which pins, screws, wires or tongs (e.g., Seinmann pin, Denham's pin, Kirschner's wire, ice tong, Crutchfield's tong, Bohler stirrup, Ilizarov's wire) are placed into the bones so that the weight is directly applied to the bone. Skeletal traction is used. In cases when the pulling force needed is more than the skin traction can bear. When longer durations of traction is required. When the pa of the body needing traction is positioned so that the skin traction is impossible. Upto 20 kg weight is permitted.",C

All of the following can be used to predict severe acute pancreatitis except,Glasgow score >_ 3,APACHE II score >_ 9,CT severity score >_ 6,C - reactive protein < 100,"ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS It is impoant to define that group of patients who will develop severe pancreatitis, as they are the ones with poorer outcomes and therefore they require aggressive early management and possibly transfer to a specialist unit. A severe attack may be heralded by an initial clinical impression of a very ill patient and a worsening physiological state at 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems have been used, all aimed at predicting persistent organ failure, paicularly respiratory, cardiac and renal. Severity stratification assessments should be performed in patients at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after admission. The Ranson and Glasgow scoring systems are specific for acute pancreatitis, and a score of 3 or more at 48 hours indicates a severe attack. Several other systems that are used in intensive care units can also be applied. These include the APACHE, SAPS, SOFA, MODS and modified Marshall scoring systems (the latter has the advantage of simplicity). Regardless of the system used, persisting organ failure indicates a severe attack. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after the onset of symptoms is also an indicator of severity. Patients with a body mass index over 30 are at higher risk of developing complications. A revision in 2013 of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (1992) recommends that patients with acute pancreatitis be stratified into 3 groups: Mild acute pancreatitis: * no organ failure; * no local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: * organ failure that resolves within 48 hours (transient organ failure); and/or * local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure. Severe acute pancreatitis: * persistent organ failure (>48 hours); * single organ failure; * multiple organ failure. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1224",D

Which of the following is true regarding intravenous administration of chemotherapy?,Subcutaneous extravasation of carmustine (BCNU) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) usually causes ulceration,Extravasation of doxorubicin rarely causes serious ulceration because the agent binds quickly to tissue nucleic acid,Serious and progressive ulceration can be expected following extravasation of vincristine or vinblastine,Problems of wound healing should be anticipated if systemic 5-FU therapy is begun less than 2 week postoperatively,"Since chemotherapy is generally most effective in killing rapidly dividing cells, the rapidly dividing cells of a fresh surgical wound should be in jeopardy when chemotherapy is given in the early postoperative period. Each of the phases of normal wound healing is theoretically at risk from one or another class of chemotherapeutic agents. Immediately following wounding, inflammation and vascular permeability lead to fibrin deposition and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), monocyte, and platelet influx. Macrophages are attracted by the activated complement system. By the fourth day the proliferative phase begins, and for the next 20 days fibroblasts produce mucopolysaccharides and collagen. Cross-linking of the collagen fibers then continues for several months in the maturation phase. It seems logical to delay antineoplastic agents for 10-14 days unless there are compelling clinical indications (e.g., superior vena cava syndrome) for more urgent treatment. Administration of folinic acid simultaneously with methotrexate normalizes wound healing. Extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents during intravenous administration may result in severe ulceration and sloughing. The nature of the injury is largely related to the nucleic-acid binding characteristics of the agent. Those agents that do not bind to tissue nucleic acid (vincristine, vinblastine, nitrogen mustard, BCNU, 5-FU) generally cause only local damage from the immediate injury. These substances are quickly metabolized or inactivated, and usual patterns of wound healing can be expected. On the other hand, agents that bind the nucleic acid (doxorubicin, dactinomycin, mitomycin C, mithramycin, and daunorubicin) cause not only immediate toxic reaction in the tissues but, unless excised, continuing and progressive tissue damage. Though some authors have reported success with elevation and ice packs, most recommend surgical excision if there is severe pain, any sign of early necrosis, or significant blistering.",D

True statement about burn resuscitation -,Colloid preferred in initial 24 hrs,Colloid preferred if burnt area is > 15 % of total BSA,Half of the calculated fluid given in initial 8 brs.,Urine output should be maintained at 50-60 mL/hr.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e.. Half of the calculated fluid given in initial 8 hrs. o Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a bum patient.o The hypovolemic shock in bum patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial -fintacellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body).o This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.o Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution- Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the bum (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e., 4 mL/kg per % of TBS A bum. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas).Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.o Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capilaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning),o A number of parameters are widely used to assess bum resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patimt, the target MAP is 60 mitiHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.o There is no use of diuretics in bum resuscitation.o Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement as they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory' response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",C
Oliver's sign is seen in:,Ascending aortic aneurysm,Arch of aorta aneurysm,Descending aortic aneurysm,Aortic dissection,"B i.e. Arch of aorta aneurysmRef: Rutherford Vascular Surgery, 8th edition, page 2090Explanation:Oliver's Sign:It is an abnormal downward movement of the trachea during systole that can indicate a dilation or aneurysm of the aortic arch*.Elicited by gently grasping the cricoid cartilage and applying upward pressure while the patient stands with his or her chin extended upward.
