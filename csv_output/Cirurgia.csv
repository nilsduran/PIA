Rx of choice in postoperative lung collapse is ?,Needle drainage,Coicosteroids,Pulmonary resection,Endoscopic suction,"Ans is 'd' ie Endoscopic suction The text given on post-op lung collapse in sabiston as well as schwaz mention no where that `endoscopic suction' is a treatment modality But still reading the text it appears that Endoscopic suction is the best answer among the given options. Below, I have quoted the text. Read it to make your own inference. ""The most common postoperative respiratory complication is atelectasis. As a result of the anesthetic, abdominal incision, and postoperative narcotics, the alveoli in the periphery collapse and a pulmonary shunt may occur. If appropriate attention is not directed to aggressive pulmonary toilet with the initial symptoms, the alveoli remain collapsed and a buildup of secretions occurs and becomes secondarily infected with bacteria. The risk appears to be paicularly high in patients who are heavy smokers, are obese, and have copious pulmonary secretions. Pneumonia may develop early (i.e., 2-5 days after admission to the hospital) or late (i.e., >5 days) and is referred to as health care-related pneumonia. Aspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric contents is the leading cause of health care-related pneumonia. Presentation and Management The most common cause of a postoperative fever in the first 48 hours after the procedure is atelectasis. The patients has a low-grade fever, malaise, and diminished breath sounds in the lower lung fields. Very often the patient is uncomfoable from the fever but has no other ove pulmonary symptoms. Atelectasis is so common postoperatively that a formal workup is not usually required. However, if not aggressively managed, frank development of pneumonia is likely. A patient with pneumonia, on the other hand, will have a high fever, occasionally mental confusion, and the production of a thick secretion with coughing, leukocytosis, and a chest radiograph that reveals infiltrates. If the condition is not expeditiously diagnosed and treated, the patient may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and require intubation. Prevention of atelectasis and pneumonia is associated with pain control, which allows the patient to take deep breaths and cough. A patient-controlled analgesia device seems to be associated with better pulmonary toilet, as does the use of an epidural infusion catheter, paicularly in patients with epigastric incisions. Respiratory care, otherwise, begins preoperatively. The patient must be instructed in use of the incentive spirometer and be held accountable by nurses and physicians during rounds. Encouraging the patient to cough while applying counterpressure with a pillow on the abdominal incision site is most helpful. Rarely, other modalities such as intermittent positive pressure breathing and chest physiotherapy may be required. Encouraging the patient to breathe deeply and cough is the single most valuable management approach in preventing and resolving atelectasis and pneumonia. Patients in whom pneumonia develops in the postoperative period are managed with aggressive pulmonary toilet, induced sputum for culture and sensitivity testing, and empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy while awaiting culture results. Once the organisms are cultured from sputum, a specific antibiotic must be used as indicated.""",D

Milroys disease is,Edema due to filariasis,Post cellulitic lymphedema,Congenital lymphedema,Lymphedema following trauma,"PRIMARY LYMPHOEDEMA Aetiology It has been proposed that all cases of primary lymphoedema are due to an inherited abnormality of the lymphatic system, sometimes termed 'congenital lymphatic dysplasia'. Genetic susceptibility Primary lymphoedema can be familial or sporadic. In familial cases the genetic mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, recessive or x-linked pattern. In the last few years the application of Next Generation Sequencing, which allows identification of genetic mutations, even in sporadic cases and smaller families, has increased our understanding of the genetic basis of lymphoedema. So far, mutations in more than 20 genes have been linked to the development of primary lymphoedema. In individuals with familial mutations the penetrance of lymphoedema can often be incomplete leading to a large variability in clinical presentation. Involvement of other systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, digestive) is common and can indicate a specific mutation. Presence of isolated lower limb lymphedema at bih, classically described as Milroy's disease, suggests mutation in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4)/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) or VEGF-C. In these patients, reduced initial uptake and presence of touous lymphatic tracts with evidence of rerouting in lymphangiography suggests mutation in the VEGF-C gene. lymphoedema can also be present as a minor sign in some well-recognised syndromes. Primary lymphoedema is present in less than 10% of cases of tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 and 2 gene mutations). Lymphoedema has been repoed in patients with Noonan syndrome in the presence of PTPN11, SOS1 or KRAS mutations, and in patients with Turner syndrome (monosomy X) and capillary malformation-aeriovenous malformation syndrome (RAS p21 protein activator 1 (RASA1) mutation).

Most common cause of ptosis ?,Myasthenia gravis,Paralysis of 3rd nerve,Idiopathic,Congenital,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Congenital Ptosis Ptosis is drooping of upper eyelid. Ptosis occurs when the muscles that raise the eyelid (levator palpebrae superiors and muller's nuscles) are not strong enough to do so properly. Etiology of Ptosis may be :? A) Congenital myogenic ptosis :- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis :- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i.e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis :- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic :- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic :- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e.g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma. Aponeurotic ptosis :- It is due to defect of the levator aponeurosis in the presence of normal functioning muscle, e.g. involutional (senile) ptosis, post-operative ptosis.",D

All of the following statements are true about the repair of groin hernias except -,Lichtenstein tension free repair has a low recurrence rate,TEP repair is an extraperitoneal approach to laparoscopic repair of groin hernia,"In Shouldice repair, non-abosorbable mesh is used",The surgery can be done under local anaesthesia in selected cases.,"Shouldice repair is a method of hernia repair in which the inguinal floor is strengthened by just approximation of tissue using non-absorbable sutures. No mesh is used.


Management of Groin hernias (mainly inguinal hernia)  
There are 2 objectives of t/t :
Treatment of the hernial sac
In Indirect hernias, the sac is dissected free from the cord structures and cremastric fibres. The sac is opened and the herniated contents are reduced. Then the sac is ligated at the internal inguinal ring. Alternatively the hernial sac may be invaginated back into the abdomen without ligation.
Direct sacs are usually too broad based for ligation and should not be opened but instead are simply inverted into the peritoneal cavity.
Inguinal floor reconstruction

Management of the hernial sac is sufficient for children and young adults, but some method of reconstruction (repair or strengthening) of the inguinal floor is necessary for all adult hernias to prevent recurrence.
3 broad categories of repair are available


Primary tissue repair
Anterior tension-free mesh repairs
Preperitoneal repairs - open & the laparoscopic approach

a) Primary tissue repair

In this method, the post wall of inguinal canal is strengthened by just approximation of tissues with sutures. There is no use of any prosthetic material.
Primary repairs without mesh were the mainstay of hernia surgery for decades. The advantages are simplicity of the repair and absence of any foreign body in the groin. Disadvantages include higher recurrence rates due to tension on the repair and a slower return to unrestricted physical activity. Consequently, tension free mesh repairs have now become the dominant method of inguinal hernia repair.
Commonly performed primary tissue repairs are


Bassini repair
Halsted repair
McVay (Cooper ligament) repair
Shouldice repair
Darn repair


Darn repair gets its name from the way a long nylon suture repeatedly passed between the tissues to create a weave that one might consider similar to mesh.

Anterior tension-free mesh repair
Recognizing that tension in a repair is the principal cause of recurrence, current practices in hernia management employ a synthetic mesh prosthesis to bridge the defect

Recurrence rate is quite low with these techniques
Common employed techniques are

 Lichtenstein repair
In Lichtenstein repair a piece of polypropylene mesh is used to reconstruct the inguinal floor.

The mesh is sutured to the abdominal fascia.
Recurrence rate is quite low

Patch and plug technique
In this method, a plug of the mesh is inserted into the hernial defect (i.e. an internal ring in an Indirect hernia) and sutured in place. Then another piece of mesh is placed over the inguinal floor which may or may not be sutured to the fascia.
Laparoscopic and Preperitoneal repairs

The laparoscopic hernia repair is based on the technique of 'Stoppa', who used an open preperitoneal approach to reduce the hernia and placed a large piece of mesh to cover the entire inguinal floor and myopectineal orifice. Preperitoneal hernia repairs may also be performed without mesh, but its rarely used now.
In Laparoscopic hernia repair, the preperitoneal space is reached by either transabdominal laparoscopy (TAPP) or by a totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP)
Both techniques are similar in actual repair but differ in the manner by which the preperitoneal space is accessed.

TAPP (Trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal)

in the TAPP repair, the peritoneal space is entered by conventional laparoscopy and then the preperitoneum overlying the inguinal floor is dissected away as a flap.

TEP (totally extraperitoneal repair)

in TEP repair the preperitoneal space is accessed without entering the peritoneal cavity.

Choice of Anesthesia


Here there is a difference of opinion b/w Schwartz Surgery (8/e, p 1368) & Washington Manual of Surgery (4/e, p 511)

According to the Washington Manual of Surgery

local anaesthesia is the preferred anaesthetic for elective open repair.
Laparoscopic hernia repair has been carried out under local or regional anaesthesia, but is more commonly done under General anaesthesia.

According to Schwartz Surgery

General anaesthesia is the preferred choice for open as well as laparoscopic repair.",C

The latter tend to flatten and disappear at puberty. Larger ones may cause problems from bleeding and/or erosion. Cavernous haemangiomata are larger and compressible, containing large vascular spaces.Occasionally a port-wine stain of the trigeminal area is associated with a vascular malformation of the leptomeninges on the same side, which may cause epilepsy or hemiparesis (the Sturge- Weber syndrome), or with glaucoma.Excellent results have been obtained with careful and time-consuming treatment with a 585-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser.

Spigelian hernia is: March 2005,Hernia passing through the obturator canal,Hernia occurring through the linea alba,Hernia through the triangle of petit,Hernia occurring at the level of arcuate line,"Ans. D: Hernia occurring at the level of arcuate line Spigelian hernia is an acquired ventral hernia through the linea semilunaris, the line where the sheaths of the lateral abdominal muscles fuse to form the lateral rectus sheath, at the level of arcuate line. Spigelian hernias are nearly always found above the level of the inferior epigastric vessels. Commonly, the patient is over the age of 50 years. Men and women are equally affected. The patient presents with pain that is localised to the hernial site and is aggravated by any movement that raises intraabdominal pressure. Later, the pain becomes more dull, constant, and diffuse. A soft, reducible mass may be present in the lower abdominal area which disappears on pressure. When the mass is reduced, the hernial orifice can usually be palpated. Diagnosis is more difficult when the hernia dissects within the layers of the abdominal wall - internal and external obliques - or may be located at a distance from the linea semilunaris. Ultrasound and CT scan may help to confirm the diagnosis.",D

"A 25-year-old man is involved in an automobile accident with resultant injuries including bilateral closed femur fractures, left pulmonary contusion, and closed head injury. On post-injury day 4, significant upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage begins. Endoscopic examination reveals an area of confluent ulceration with bleeding in the gastric fundus. Endoscopic hemostasis fails. Appropriate immediate management includes:",Lavage of gastric contents with iced saline,Urgent total gastrectomy,Selective aerial infusion of vasopressin the left gastric aery,Inseion of Sangstaken-Blakemore balloon,"Initial effos to control gastric hemorrhage consist of gastric lavage using warmed saline. Lavage serves to fragment existing clots and to remove any pooled blood, reducing fibrinolysis at bleeding sites. Over 80% of patients who present with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage stop bleeding using this approach. Definitive treatment of ongoing acute active stress bleeding by antacids is largely unsuccessful. Administration of H2-receptor blocking agents once active gastrointestinal bleeding has commenced is also usually ineffective as a definitive form of therapy. The endoscope has become the preferred therapeutic as well as diagnostic instrument with electrocautery and laser photocoagulation capabilities. If endoscopic therapy fails, angiography offers an additional means for the control of bleeding by selective infusion of vasopressin into the splanchnic circulation the left gastric aery. Vasopressin is administered by continuous infusion through the catheter at a rate of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/min for a maximum of 48 to 72 hours. About 10% to 20% of patients with acute stress ulcers continue to bleed or have recurrent bleeding despite these measures. In these patients, total gastrectomy has a moality ranging from 17% to 100%.

Bone Metastasis is common in which thyroid tumor -,Follicular,Papillary,Huhle cell tumour,Anaplastic,"Ans is C ie. Huhle cell tumor A thyroid cancer (Papillary, Follicular, Anaplastic) spreads by all the three 3 routes Hematogenous - Lymphatic and - Direct * Papillary spreads mainly by --> lymphatic route* * Anaplastic mainly by --> direct* (anaplastic Ca is characterized by extensive local invasion) * Follicular spreads mainly by --> Hematogenous route* (to lung, bones and CNS) So Bone metastasis is common in Follicular Ca but Huhle cell is a subtype of follicular Ca which is more invasive and metastasizes more frequently to bones. ""One subtype of Follicular Ca, the Huhle cell turner, tends to be more invasive, to metastasize frequently to bone, and to have an unourable clinical course."" - Harrison, I4/e, p2031 Also remember More about Huhle cell Ca Histopathologically Huhle cell Ca are dominated by cells with abundant, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm (Huhle cells). Huhle cells have this eosinophilic appearance because of an abundance of mitochondria in the cytoplasm. They differ from follicular carcinomas in that they are more often multifocal and bilateral (-- 30%) usually do not take up RAL are more likely to metastasize to local nodes and distant sites. and are associated with a higher moality rate. Management is similar to that of follicular neoplasm (explained ahead) with lobectomy and isthmectomy being sufficient for unilateral Huhle cell adenomas. when Huhle cell neoplasms are found to be invsive on intraoperative, frozen section or definitive paraffin section histology, the total thyroidectomy is performed. These patients should also undergo routine central neck node removal and modified radical neck dissection when lateral neck nodes are palpable (similar to patients with medullary carcinoma). Although RAI scanning and ablation usually are ineffective, they probably should be considered for ablation of any residual normal thyroid tissue and, occasionally, for ablation of tumors, because there is no other good therapy.",C

Earliest reflex to reappear after spinal shock ?,Knee jerk,Ankle jerk,Bulbocavemous reflex,Abdominal reflex,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Bulbocavernous reflex Spinal shock Spinal shock refers to the period after spinal cord injury (usually 24-48 hours) when the reflex activity of the entire spinal cord becomes depressed. During this period the reflex arcs below the level of spinal cord injury are not functioning. Spinal shock is basically flaccid paralysis with loss of all spinal reflexes. There is loss of autonomic, reflex, motor and sensory activity below the level of the cord lesion. Signs of spinal shock include : 1. Flaccid paralysis 2. Loss of deep tendon and perianal reflexes The return of reflex activity below the level of a spinal cord injury signifies the end of spinal shock. o An accurate assessment of neurological status cannot be completed until spinal shock resolves. The earliest indicator of resolution is the return of bulbocavernous reflex. The significance of spinal shock lies in the determination of whether a patient has sustained a complete vs incomplete spinal cord injury. This cannot be determined until spinal shock has ended. If there is total absence of sensory or motor function below the level of in jury, after spinal shock has resolved, It indicates complete cord injury. If there is some residual function distal to the level of injury after resolution of spinal shock indicates incomplete cord injury. High thoracic cord has poor prognosis as this area has narrow spinal canal and precarious blood supply, watershade area of blood supply lies in upper thoracic region.",C

Which of the following can delivery 100% oxygen,Venturi mask,Anesthetic face mask,Hudson mask,Non - rebreather face mask,"Devices used foroxygen therapy Performance of these devices can be described according to 1. Themaximum oxygen concentrationachievable to be delivered to the patient, and the reliability/ variability with which the devices do that. Looking at the reliability and variability of oxygen delivery to the patient we can divide these pieces of equipment intofixed performance or variable performance devices. This means that the achieved inspired oxygen concentration is either more dependent on thepatient'speak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR)(variableperformance devices) or less so (fixedperformance devices). Fixed performance devices These devices deliver a fixed inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, independent of the PIFR. Even at the time of PIFR no random entrainment of room air will occur to unpredictably alter the FiO2 with this equipment. Devices in this group include: SS Venturi mask Thereisentrainment of room air with these devices, but it is fixed and not dependent on the patient's PIFR. Therefore the resulting delivered FiO2 is also constant. SS Non-rebreather facemask A reservoir bag supplies 100% oxygen and makes up for the deficit which occurs during times when the patient's PIFR is higher than the oxygen supply flow to the mask (usually around 20 L/min from an oxygen wall or tank source). Aflap valveon the mask prevent or at least reduce entrainment of room air. These masks do not achieve a perfect seal with the patient's face, sosomeroom air entrainment still occurs. FiO2 up to 70-80% can be achieved. SS Anesthetic facemask(with an anesthetic breathing circuit) These masks form a complete seal around the patient's airway so no entrainment of room air can occur. The delivered oxygen concentration is the same as in the gas mixture supplied to the mask (assuming no rebreathing occurs in the anesthetic breathing cicuit). We have also listed thePatil-Syracuseand theendoscopy maskunder this heading. Both of these devices allow instrumentation with a fiberoptic scope while maintaining a seal to the face with the mask. 2. Variable performance devices These devices deliver a variable inspired oxygen concentration to the patient, which depends on the PIFR.

Neuro surgical intervention may be necessitated in all of the following Except,SDH,EDH,Depressed fracture,Diffuse axonal injury,"Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a form of traumatic brain injury. It happens when the brain rapidly shifts inside the skull as an injury is occurring. The long connecting fibers in the brain called axons are sheared as the brain rapidly accelerates and decelerates inside the hard bone of the skull. DAI typically causes injury to many pa of the brain, and people who suffer a DAI are usually left in a coma. The changes in the brain are often very tiny and can be difficult to detect using CT or MRI scans. It is one of the most common types of traumatic brain injury and also one of the most devastating. The prevailing symptom of DAI is loss of consciousness. This typically lasts six or more hours. If the DAI is mild, then people might remain conscious but display other signs of brain damage. These symptoms can be extremely varied, as they depend upon which area of the brain has been damaged. They can include: disorientation or confusion headache nausea or vomiting drowsiness or fatigue trouble sleeping sleeping longer than normal loss of balance or dizziness Ref:",D

Good to know: Fibrous dysplasia: It is characterized by the replacement of normal lamellar cancellous bone by an abnormal fibrous tissue that contain small, abnormally arranged trabeculae of immature woven bone. It may affect one bone (monostotic form) or several bones (polyostotic form) The monostotic form is the most common and is usually diagnosed in patients between 20 and 30 years of age without associated skin lesions. The polyostotic form typically manifests in children Monostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the femur paicularly the femoral neck as well as the tibia and ribs. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects the maxilla and other craniofacial bones, ribs, and metaphyseal or diaphyseal poions of the femur or tibia. Radiological findings: In the long bones, the fibrous dysplasia lesions are typically well-defined, radiolucent areas with thin coices and a ground glass appearance. The aicular ends are usually spared. Involvement of the facial bones usually presents as radiodense lesions, which may create a leonine appearance ( leontiasis sea). Treatment: There is no established effective treatment. IV bisphosphonates therapy- improvement in bone pain and paial or complete resolution of radiographic lesions have been repoed after IV bisphosphonate therapy. Surgical stabilization is used to prevent pathologic fracture or destruction of a joint space to relieve nerve root or cranial nerve compression or sinus obstruction. Complication: Most common complication is pathological fracture Shepherd's crook deformity- if fracture occur at the femoral neck, it commonly lead to a deformity called ""shepherd crook"". Expanding bone lesions may cause pain, deformity and nerve entrapment. Sarcomatous transformation of either form of fibrous dysplasia is extremely rare, but it may occur spontaneously or, more commonly, after radiation therapy.

These Gram-negative, non-sporing organisms, although predominant in the lower intestine, often escape detection because they are strictly anaerobic and slow to grow on culture media unless there is an adequate carbon dioxide tension in the anaerobic apparatus (Gillespie). In many laboratories, the culture is discarded if there is no growth in 48 hours. These organisms are resistant to penicillin and streptomycin but sensitive to metronidazole, clindamycin, lincomycin and cephalosporin compounds.

The balance of water intake. Renal excretion of sodium and ADH mediated water conservation by distal renal tubule. These processes are mediated by ? Stimulation of thirst Secretion of ADM Feedback mechanisms of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and variation of renal handling of .filtered sodium. Disorders in any one of the these components of sodium balance can result in sodium imbalance. Action of ADH ADH is secreted by the posterior pituitary glandQ. Its effect in kidney is mediated by the vasopressin. (V2 receptors) on the basolateral surface of the principal cells of the collecting duct. The key action of ADH in the kidney is increasing the permeability of water. It allows water to be reabsorbed from the medullary interstitium thus enhancing water reabsorption. In SIADH the A.D.IL level is inappropriately elevated The inappropriately elevated level of vasopressin enhances the reabsomtion of water thereby leading to. - Production of concentrated urine. - Inability to excrete water and consequently - Hyponatrernia Clinical features of SIADH - HyponatrenziaQ (sodium < 135 mEq/L) - Inappropriately elevated urine osmolalityQ (> 150 mosm/kg) - Excessive urine sodium excretionQ (it Nu > 30 mEq/L) - Decreased serum osmolalityQ (< 280 mosm/kg) These findings occur in - Absence of diuretic therapy - In the presence of euvulemiaQ without edemaQ - In the setting of otherwise normal cardiac, renal, adrenal, hepatic and thyroid function.

Earliest phenotypic manifestation of Idiopathic hereditary hemochromatosis is :,Post prandial increase in serum iron concentration,Elevated serum ferritin level,Slate grey pigmentation of skin,Increased transferrin saturation,"Increased transferrin saturation Elevation in transferrin saturation is the earliest phenotypic manifestation of idiopathic hereditary hemochromatosisQ. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited single gene disorder. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, with deposition of iron in multiple organs. Persons with hereditary hemochromatosis absorb only a few milligrams of iron each day in excess of need. Therefore, clinical manifestations often occur only after 40 years of age, when body iron stores have reached 15-40g (normally, the body stores approximately 4g of iron). In the past hereditary hemochromatosis was usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. The classical description was : ? - Cutaneous hyperpigmentation. - Diabetes mellitus - Cirrhosis Currently, most patients with newly diagnosed hereditary hemochromatosis are asymptomatic i.e., diagnosed at an early state when the patient is still asymptomatic. The shift towards earlier diagnosis is probably the result of including serum iron indices in the diagnosis. Such as : Serum iron - Serum iron binding capacity - % transferrin saturation and serum ferritin These are elevated in hemochromatosis long before the symptoms of hemochromatosis have developed. Therefore serum iron indices are used as screening test for the diagnosis of Heruochromatosis. A.Percent transferrin saturation Percent transferrin saturation is the earliest phenotypic marker of hereditary hemoehromatosisQ. ""It is the best screening test used for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis."" Biron binding capacity Now days iron binding capacity is being increasingly used as the screening test for the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Many trials have proved that : Iron binding capacity is better than % transferrin saturation as a screening test, but its wide scale use has not been staed till now. C.Serum Ferritin Serum ferritin concentration is usually a good index of body iron stores. Serum ferritin is increased in most untreated patients with hemochromatosis. Asymptomatic or symptomatic family members with the disease have increased serum ferritin. But serum ferritin is not used as screening marker because its act as acute phase reactant and its level is increased in various inflammatory conditions. Besides that its level is also increased in alcoholic liver disease and other hepatocellular injury due to increased release from tissues. Confirmatory testing of hereditary hemochromatosis : Is done by genetic analysis, which is more reliable than determining iron content in liver biopsies. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE genee. Between 60-93 percent of patients with this disorder are homozygous for mutation designated C282Ye. Liver biopsy is also done to assess if liver fibrosis is present or not.",D

"In pelvis fracture, the amount of blood loss is around?",1-4 units,2-4 units,2-6 units,4-8 units,"In pelvic fracture intrapelvic haemorrhage is by far, the most serious complication. Haemorrhage frequently results from fracture surfaces and small vessels in the retroperitoneum. Amount of blood loss is around 4-8 units. It must be emphasised, however, that these cases may need transfusion of very large quantities of blood. It is not uncommon for the amount of blood transfused to be in excess of the patient's total blood volume.

What is the most common cause,Bilateral PUJ obstruction,Infant polycystic kidney disease,posterior urethral valve,Meatal stenosis,"Posterior urethral valves Posterior urethral valves occur in around 1 in 5000-8000 live male bihs. The valves are membranes that have a small posterior slit within them, which typically lie just distal to the verumontanum and cause obstruction to the urethra of boys. They function as flap valves and so although they are obstructive to antegrade urinary flow, a urethral catheter can be passed retrogradely without any difficulty. Clinical features Newborns may present with palpable abdominal masses (distended bladder, hydronephrotic kidney & Ascites) Infants with Urinary infection & sepsis. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms untill adolescence or adulthood Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients DIAGNOSIS Posterior urethral valves need to be detected and treated as early as possible to minimise the degree of renal failure. The presentation varies according to the severity of the obstruction. The more severe the obstruction, the earlier the presen tation. Diagnosis is most commonly made antenatally with ultrasound, which demonstrates bilateral hydronephrosis above a distended bladder. If the diagnosis is not made antenatally, then babies typically present with urinary infection in the neonatal period or with uraemia and renal failure. Rarely the valves are incomplete and the patient is symp tom free until adolescence or adulthood, when again urinary infection or renal impairment can supervene. Investigation will involve a voiding cystogram, with the dilatation of the urethra above the valves demonstrable on a voiding cystogram. The bladder is hypero phied and often shows diveicula. Typically, there is vesico- ureteric reflux into dilated upper tracts. The valves themselves can be difficult to see on urethroscopy because the flow ofirrigant sweeps them into the open position. Renal function is usually impaired, albeit to a varying degree, and the extent is fuher assessed by measurement of ultrasound scanning, which will assess the renal coical thickness, and renography to assess differential renal function. TREATMENT Initial treatment is by catheterisation to relieve the obstruction and to allow the effects of renal failure to improve. Definitive treatment is by endoscopic destruction of the valves with continuing lifelong suppoive treatment of the dilated urinary tract, the recurrent urinary infections and the uraemia.

"The carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by all, EXCEPT:",Hypothyroidism,Tuberculosis,Pregnancy,Acromegaly,"Many systemic conditions are strongly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). These conditions may directly or indirectly affect microcirculation, pressure thresholds for nerve conduction, nerve cell body synthesis, and axon transpo or interstitial fluid pressures.

"A 72-year-old man with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and coronary aery disease presents in septic shock from emphysematous cholecystitis. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 6-L nasal cannula and his hemoglobin is 7.2 mg/dL. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%. Which of the following treatment options will improve his oxygen delivery the most?",Increase his inspired oxygen concentration,Transfer him to a hyperbaric chamber,Administer an erythropoietic agent,Transfuse two units of packed red blood cells,"Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous. Correction of the patient's anemia by the most expeditious manner, that is, transfusion of blood, is the treatment of choice.",D

A middle-aged man presents with a markedly enlarged tonsil and recurrent infections with serum immunoglobulin deficiency. Chromosome analysis demonstrates a translocation between the immunuglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14 and an unidentified gene on chromosome 8. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his phenotype?,The translocation has deleted constant chain exons on chromosome 14 and prevented heavy chain class switching,The translocation has deleted the interval containing diversity d. and joining (J) regions,The translocation has activated a tumor-promoting gene on chromosome 8,The translocation has deleted the heavy chain constant chain Cu so that virgin B cells cannot produce IgM on their membranes,"This case is an example of Burkitt's lymphoma, which may affect the tonsils or other lymphoid tissues. The translocation places the myc oncogene on chromosome 8 downstream of the very active heavy chain locus on chromosome 14, activating myc gene expression in B cells and their derivatives. The translocation is likely an aberrant form of the normal DNA rearrangements that generate unique heavy chain genes in each B cell. The translocation joins one chromosome 8 to one chromosome 14, leaving their homologues unaffected. The cause for the phenotype must therefore be trans-acting, since cis-acting effects would peain only to the translocated loci and not affect the homologous untranslocated loci. Activation of a tumor-promoting gene (oncogene) on chromosome 8 could produce an enlarged tonsil, while underactivity of immunoglobulin production due to one-half expression could decrease immune function but would not completely ablate the processes in choices a, b, d, and e. At the genetic level, trans-acting events are autosomal dominant in that one of the two homologous loci is abnormal and produces a phenotype. Mutations of cis-acting events must disrupt both homologous loci to produce phenotypes, making them autosomal recessive at the genetic level.",C

Consists of pain in axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall and is often caused by nerve damage during axillary node dissectionNeuroma pain: can occur from scars from either mastectomy or lumpectomy but is more common if surgery is followed by radiotherapy.Other nerve injury pain: can occur even if intercostobrachial nerve is spared and is more common in breast reconstruction and implants.In Jung et als review, there were 21 studies with follow-up periods from 1-96 months (one studyof 210 months), which revealed the following widely varying ranges of prevalence estimates:Phantom breast pain 3-44 per centIntercostobrachial neuralgia (ICN) 16-39 per cent for all breast cancer surgery;ICN in breast conserving surgery 14-61 per centNeuroma pain 23-49 per cent.",B

Pain due to post-amputation neuroma is best treated by:,Infrared therapy,Interference therapy,Ultrasound therapy,Surgical Excision,"D i.e. Surgical Excision A painful neuroma can be prevented by gentle traction on the nerve followed by sharp proximal division, allowing the cut nerve end to retract deep into the soft tissue away from the end of amputated limb. A painful neuroma usually is palpable and often has a positive Tinel sign. Initial treatment consists of socket modification. If this fails to relieve symptoms, simple neuroma excision or a more proximal neurectomy may be required and the severed nerve is replaced into healthy tissue. Some authors recommended neuroma excision combined with centrocentral anastomosis of the proximal stump or a procedure to seal the epineural sleeve. Phantom limb pain, although rarely when is significant, can be extremely difficult to treat. More that 50 different methods of treatment are in use. Although no one specific method is universally beneficial, some patient may benefit from such diverse measures as massage, ice, heat, increased prosthetic use, relaxation training, biofeed back, sympathetic blockade, local nerve block, epidural block, ultrasound, trans cutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), placement of dorsal column stimulator, interferential therapy, and acupuncture etc.",D

Which of the following stapler is used for MIPH,Linear cutting stapler,Circular cutting stapler,Linear stapler,Circular stapler,"Stapled haemorrhoidopexy With the aim of symptom relief but preservation of the anal cushions, the technique of stapled haemorrhoidopexy (Longo), which utilises a purpose-designed stapling gun (PPH, Ethicon Inc.), has also been described and is widely used in Europe. This procedure excises a strip of mucosa and submucosa (together with the vessels travelling within them) circumferentially,well above the dentate line. Activation of the gun also simultaneously repairs the cut mucosa and submucosa by stapling the edges together. This procedure is quick to perform, and controlled trials suggest that it is less painful and less traumatic than conventional haemorrhoidectomy and, at least in the sho term, it seems to be equally efficacious. However, evidence is emerging that the technique is associated with higher recurrence rates than following conventional haemorrhoidectomy, and associated with more additional surgery.

These structures are all removed en blocand in continuity with the primary disease if possible. The main disability that follows the operation is weakness and drooping of the shoulder due to paralysis of the trapezius muscle as a consequence of excision of the accessory nerve.So electromyography will not be normal.

"Investigation of choice in Vesico-ureteric Reflux is: March 2005, September 2010, September 2012",CT scan,Voiding cystourethrography,Intravenous urography,X-ray KUB,"Ans. B: Voiding cystourethrography The recommended radiographic evaluation for VUR includes a VCUG, renal-bladder ultrasonography and nuclear renal scan (DMSA). Perform VCUG and renal-bladder ultrasonography in any child with documented UTI before age 5 years, any child with pyelonephritis, and any male child with a symptomatic UTI. A renal-bladder ultrasonography may be used to screen older children with UTI. If ultrasonographic findings are abnormal, conduct fuher workup studies with VCUG to rule out VUR. During the initial workup in a patient with suspected reflux, perform the standard VCUG, which provides clear anatomic detail and allows accurate grading of the reflux degree. By filling and emptying the bladder several times (cycling) with the catheter still in the bladder, as described by Lebowitz, the yield of identifying VUR is clearly enhanced. The conventional cystography provides more anatomical accuracy than nuclear cystography; however, nuclear cystography is advantageous (used widely to monitor VUR) because of lower radiation exposure and increased sensitivity.",B
Regarding cystic disease of breast which one is true:,Common in 25 years of age,Excision is the treatment,may turn into malignant,Aspiration is the treatment,"Ans. is 'd' ie Aspiration is the t/t Cysts are considered foremost among all of the benign histological changes in the breast. They occur most commonly in the last decade of reproductive life due to a nonintegrated involution of stroma and epithelium. Remember, cysts are one of the many features seen in ANDI (Aberration of normal development and involution).Cysts are often multiple, may be b/1 and can mimic malignancy. But no relationship b/w cysts and breast cancer has been found.They typically present suddenly and cause great alarm: prompt diagnosis & drainage provides immediate relief.Treatment:A solitary cyst or small collection of cysts can be aspirated If they resolve completely and if the fluid is not blood stained no further t/t is required.However some will recur and require respiration. If there is residual lump or if the fluid is bloodstained, a local excision for histological diagnosis is done.Excision is also done if the cyst recurs repeatedly.Thus both (B) & (D) option are true but since aspiration is the primary t/t and successful in most cases it is better answer.",D

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas-,Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Mucinous cystadenoma is macrocystic, not the microcystic adenoma.
MCN: MC cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.
Frequently seen in young women, mean age 5th decade.
More common in the body and tail of the pancreas.

Pathology

MCNs contain mucin-producing epithelium, macrocystic.
Histology: Presence of mucin-rich cells and ovarian-like stroma.
Estrogen and progesterone staining are positive in most cases.

Clinical Features

Incidental MCN is becoming increasingly common.
Up to 50% of patients present with vague abdominal pain.
A history of pancreatitis may be found in up to 20% of patients, which explains the common misdiagnosis of pseudocyst.

Diagnosis

CT scan: Presence of a solitary cyst with fine septations and rim of calcification.
Cross-sectional imaging may not be able to distinguish between benign and malignant MCNs.
Presence of eggshell calcification, larger tumor size, or a mural nodule on cross-sectional imaging is suggestive of malignancy.
Cyst fluid analyses: Mucin-rich aspirate, high CEA and low amylase levels.
These fluid analyses provide accurate diagnosis in up to 80% of cases.

Treatment

Exclusion of malignancy can’t be obtained by biopsy alone, so surgical excision is indicated for all mucinous cystic neoplams, because extensive histological sampling is required for confirmation.

"" 70% to 90% of children with splenic injury are successfully treated without operation, and 40% to 50% of adult patients with splenic injury nonoperatively in large volume trauma centres"". ""Splenectomy may be safer option, especially in the unstable patients with multiple potential sites of bleeding. In ceain situations, selective angio embolism of the spleen can play a role''. Splenic injuries are treated nonoperatively, by splenic repair (splenorrhaphy), paial splenectomy, or resection, depending on the extent of the injury and the condition of the patient. Enthusiasm for splenic salvage has been driven by the evolving trend toward nonoperative management of solid organ injury and the rare but often fatal complication of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI ). It is uncommon in otherwise healthy adults. For this reason attempts to salvage the spleen are more vigorous. Splenectomy is also indicated for lesser splenic injuries in patients who have developed a coagulopathy and have multiple abdominal injuries, and it is usually necessary in patients with failed splenic salvage attempts. Paial splenectomy can be used in patients in whom only a poion of the spleen has been destroyed, usually the superior or inferior half. Splenic trauma: The spleen is the most commonly injured organ in cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Nonoperative management is the treatment of choice Splenic injuries in children have been managed traditionally without surgery. Until recently, most splenic injuries in the adults were managed with splenorrhaphy or splenectomy. Currently., 50-80% of adults with blunt splenic injuries are managed non operatively. Stable patients who have high-grade splenic injuries on CT or have evidence of ongoing bleeding on CT may be candidate for angiographic embolisation. Unstable patients with splenic injuries should undergo splenectomy or attempts at splenic repair if appropriate.

Select the wrong statement with respect to cleft lip and palate,Have possible genetic and environmental predisposition,Frequency varies among population groups,Cleft lip with palate is the most common combination,Antenatal diagosis is not possible,"The incidence of cleft lip and palate is 1:600 live bihs and of isolated cleft palate is 1:1000 live bihs. The incidence increases in Oriental groups (1:500) and decreases in the black population (1:2000). The highest incidence repoed for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Indian tribes of Montana, USA (1:276). Although cleft lip and palate is an extremely diverse and variable congenital abnormality, several distinct sub-groups exist, namely cleft lip with/without cleft palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP) alone and submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The typical distribution of cleft types is: *cleft lip alone: 15%; *cleft lip and palate: 45%; *isolated cleft palate: 40%. Cleft lip/palate predominates in males whereas cleft palate alone appears to be more common in females. In unilateral cleft lip the deformity affects the left side in 60% of cases. AETIOLOGY Contemporary opinion on the aetiology of cleft lip and palate is that cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate have a genetic predisposition and a contributory environmental component. A family history of cleft lip and palate in which the first-degree *The key features of the perioperative care of the child with cleft lip and palate *The associated complications of cleft lip and palate and their management relative is affected increases the risk to 1:25 live bihs. Genetic influence is more significant in cleft lip/palate than cleft palate alone, in which environmental factors exe a greater influence. Environmental factors implicated in clefting include maternal epilepsy and drugs, e.g. steroids, diazepam and phenytoin. The role of antenatal folic acid supplements in preventing cleft lip and palate remains equivocal. Although most clefts of the lip and palate occur as an isolated deformity, Pierre Robin sequence remains the most common syndrome. This syndrome comprises isolated cleft palate, retrognathia and a posteriorly displaced tongue (glossoptosis), which is associated with early respiratory and feeding difficulties. Isolated cleft palate is more commonly associated with a syndrome than cleft lip/palate and cleft lip alone. Over 150 syndromes are associated with cleft lip and palate, although Stickler's (ophthalmic and musculoskeletal abnormalities), Shprintzen's (cardiac anomalies), Down's, Ape's and TreacherCollins' syndromes are most frequently encountered.

"In clinical anaesthesia, which nerve is the most popular site, and commonly used for monitoring neuromuscular response during anaesthesia & in intensive care units?",Ulnar nerve,Fascial nerve,Posterior tibial nerve,Median nerve,"(A) Ulnar nerve[Miller's Anaesthesia6-1557,1559,1559f)[?]Neuromuscular function is monitored by evaluating the muscular response to Supramaximal Stimulation of a Peripheral Motor Nerve.Two types of stimulation can be used: 1. Electrical & 2. Magnetic.Electrical nerve stimulation is by far the most commonly used method in clinical practice.[?]Patterns of Nerve Stimulation:For evaluation of neuromuscular function, the most commonly used patterns of electrical nerve stimulation are Single-Twitch, TOF, Tetanic, Post-Tetanic Count (PTC), & Double-Burst Stimulation (DBS).Advantages of Train-of-Four (TOF) stimulation are greatest during nondepolarizing blockade because the degree of block can be read directly from the TOF response even though a preoperative value is lacking.TOF stimulation has some advantages over tetanic stimulation: It is less painful &, unlike tetanic stimulation, doesnot generally affect the degree of neuromuscular blockade.Sites of Nerve Stimulation & Different Muscle Responses:Any superficially located peripheral motor nerve may be stimulated.In clinical anesthesia, the ulnar nerve is the most popular site.Median, posterior tibial, common peroneal, & facial nerves are also sometimes used.For stimulation of the ulnar nerve, the electrodes are best applied to the volar side of the wrist.Distal electrode should be placed about 1 cm proximal to the point at which the proximal flexion crease of the wrist crosses the radial side of the tendon to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Proximal electrode should preferably be placed so that the distance between the centers of the two electrodes is 3 to 6 cm.Electrical stimulation normally elicits only finger flexion & thumb adductionIf one electrode is placed over the ulnar groove at the elbow, thumb adduction is often pronounced because of stimulation of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.Ulnar groove placement of electrodes (sometimes preferred in small children) is used, the active negative electrode should be at the wrist to ensure maximal response.Polarity of the electrodes is less crucial, placement of the negative electrode distally normally elicits the greatest neuromuscular response.Because different muscle groups have different sensitivities to neuromuscular blocking agents, results obtained for one muscle cannot be automatically extrapolated to other muscles.Diaphragm is among the most resistant of all muscles to both depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.Clinical significance is that onset time is normally shorter for the diaphragm than for the adductor pollicis muscle and the diaphragm recovers from paralysis more quickly than the peripheral muscles do.Other respiratory muscles are less resistant than the diaphragm, as are the larynx & the corrugator supercilii muscles.Most sensitive are the abdominal muscles, the orbicularis oculi muscle, the peripheral muscles of the limbs, & the geniohyoid, masseter, & upper airway muscles.From a practical clinical point of view, it is worth noting that:Response of the corrugator supercilii to facial nerve stimulation reflects the extent of neuromuscular blockade of the laryngeal adductor muscles & abdominal muscles better than the response of the adductor pollicis to ulnar nerve stimulation does.Upper airway muscles seem to be more sensitive than the peripheral muscles.Although three investigations using acceleromyography have indicated small differences in the response to TOF nerve stimulation in the arm (adductor pollicis muscle) & the leg (flexor hallucis brevis muscle), these differences are probably of little clinical significance.Remember: In assessing neuromuscular function, use of a relatively sensitive muscle such as the adductor pollicis of the hand has both disadvantages & advantages.During surgery it is a disadvantage that even total elimination of the response to single-twitch & TOF stimulation does not exclude the possibility of movement of the diaphragm, such as hiccuping & coughing.",A

Local syncope → digits become cold and white*
Local asphyxia → digits turn blue with burning sensation*
Local recovery →digits regain normal colour*


Pulses remain unaffected* as this is the disease which affects arterioles
With the help of points (a) and (b) Raynauds ds can be ruled out.

Atherosclerosis (Senile gangrene)

Seen in elderly people over 50 years of age.
Thus because of age factor we can rule out atherosclerosis.

Myocardial infaction

Age factor again helps in ruling it out as MI is generally seen in elderly, though its incidence is increasing in young, but it cannot be a more common cause than Buerger's disease.

Buerger's (Thromboangitis obliterans)  Usual victims of this ds are young men below 40 yrs of age, who are smokers (ds is not seen in females and nonsmokers).

Buerger ds is the inflammatory reaction in the arterial wall with involvement of the neighbouring vein and nerve, terminating in thrombosis of the artery.
It characterstically involves small and medium sized arteries (plantars, tibial and radial artery)
Both upper and lower extremities are affected.
In lower extremity the ds. occurs beyond the popliteal artery. In upper extremity the ds occurs beyond the brachial art.
Early in the course of Buergers ds the superficial veins are involved producing the characterstic migratory, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis.
An imp difference with atheroselerosis is that, atherosclerosis is a disease of large sized arteries, buergers is a ds of small arteries.",D

Paget's disease commonly develops in which age group ?,1st decade,3rd decade,5th decade,7th decade,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 5th decade Paget's disease (Osteitis deformans) Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). The pelvis and tibia being the commonest sites, and femur, skull, spine (veebrae) and clavicle the next commonest. Paget's disease occurs after 40 years of age and is more common in males.",C

Which aery is not ligated during caecum surgery,Ileocolic,Right colic,Left colic,Right branch of middle colic,"Right hemicolectomy Carcinoma of the caecum or ascending colon is treated by right hemicolectomy. At open surgery the peritoneum lateral to the ascending colon is incised, and the incision is carried around the hepatic flexure. The right colon and mesentery are elevated, taking care not to injure the ureter, gonadal vessels or the duodenum. The ileocolic aery is ligated close to its origin from the superior mesenteric aery ('high-tie') and divided. Where the right colic aery has a separate origin from the superior mesenteric aery (around 10% of patients) this is separately ligated. The mesentery of the distal 20 cm of ileum and the mesocolon as far as the proximal third of the transverse colon is divided. The greater omentum is divided up to the point of intended division of the transverse colon. When it is clear that there is an adequate blood supply at the resection margins, the right colon is resected, and an anastomosis is fashioned between the ileum and the transverse colon. If the tumour is at the hepatic flexure the resection must be extended fuher along the transverse colon and will involve dividing the right branch of the middle colic aery. Extended right hemicolectomy Carcinomas of the transverse colon and splenic flexure are most commonly treated by an extended right hemicolectomy. The extent of the resection is from the right colon to the descending colon. The mobilisation is as for a right hemicolectomy but dissection continues to take down the splenic flexure and the whole transverse mesocolon is ligated. Some surgeons prefer to perform a left hemicolectomy for a splenic flexure cancer. Left hemicolectomy This is the operation of choice for descending colon and sigmoid cancers . The left half of the colon is mobilised completely along the 'white line' that marks the lateral attachment of the mesocolon. As the sigmoid mesentery is mobilised, the left ureter and gonadal vessels must be identified and protected. The splenic flexure may be mobilised by extending the lateral dissection from below and completed by entering the lesser sac. The inferior mesenteric aery below its left colic branch, together with the related paracolic lymph nodes, is included in the resection by ligating the inferior mesenteric aery close to its origin ('high-tie'). For full mobility the inferior mesenteric vein is also ligated and divided at the lower border of the pancreas. The bowel and mesentery can then be resected to allow a tension-free anastomosis. A temporary diveing stoma may be fashioned upstream, usually by formation of a loop ileostomy. This is usually undeaken if the anastomosis is below the peritoneal reflection of the rectum, because healing is more likely to be impaired distally. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1264",D

Cellulitis is both a cause and complication of lymphedema.

Cellulitis may occur concurrently in lymphedema because the pooling of protein-rich lymph fluid makes it easier for the patient to develop an infection.,B
Rodent ulcer is seen in:,Basal cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Verrucous carcinoma,Ameloblastic carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma most often affects white adults, especially those with fair complexions. Although most patients are older than 40 years at diagnosis, some lesions are detected as early as the second decade of life, particularly in patients with red or blonde hair and blue or green eyes. Males are affected about twice as often as females; however, among young patients, there is a female predilection (possibly due to tanning bed use). Approximately 80% of lesions occur on the head and neck, with the remainder involving the trunk and limbs.
The most common clinicopathologic variant, nodular (nodulo-ulcerative) basal cell carcinoma, begins as a firm, painless papule that slowly enlarges and develops a central depression or umbilication. Telangiectatic blood vessels usually are evident within the rolled border surrounding the central depression. When the lesion is pressed, a characteristic pearly opalescent quality is discerned. Expanding ulceration often develops in the central depression, and the patient may show intermittent bleeding followed by healing. Untreated lesions continue to enlarge slowly with ulceration and destruction of underlying structures—hence the term rodent ulcer. Destruction of underlying bone or cartilage may occur, but metastasis is extremely rare.

Simple Mastectomy includes removal of: September 2005 & 2006,Only breast,Breast and axillary nodes,Breast+axillaries nodes+pectoralis major muscle,Breast+axillaries nodes+pectoralis major muscle+ pectoralis minor muscle,"Ans. A: Only breast These common surgical procedures for carcinoma breast include: Radical (Halsted) mastectomy is rarely used, and then only in cases where cancer cells have invaded the chest wall and the tumor is very large. The breast, pectoralis major and pectoralis minor muscles under the breast, and all of the lymph nodes are removed. This produces a large scar and severe disability to the arm nearest the removed breast. Modified radical (Patey) mastectomy is the most common form of mastectomy. It leaves the pectoralis major muscle intact. The breast and associated structures are removed en bloc and the excised mass is composed of: - The whole breast - A large poion of skin, the centre of which overlies the tumour but which always include the nipple - All of the fat, fascia and lymph nodes of the axilla - The pectoralis minor muscle is either divided or retracted to gain access to the upper two-thirds of the axilla. The axillary vein and the nerves to serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi (the thoraco-dorsal trunk) should be preserved. Simple, sometimes called total, mastectomy has been the treatment of choice in the late 1980s and 1990s. Generally, only the breast is removed; though, sometimes, one or two lymph nodes may be removed as well. Two other surgical procedures are variations on the simple mastectomy. The skin-sparing mastectomy is a new surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an incision, sometimes called a keyhole incision, around the areola. The tumor and all breast tissue are removed, but the incision is smaller and scarring is minimal. - The subcutaneous mastectomy, or nipple-sparing mastectomy, preserves the skin and the nipple over the breast. Paial mastectomy is used to remove the tumor, the lining over the chest muscle underneath the tumor, and a good poion of breast tissue, but not the entire breast. This is a good treatment choice for early stage cancers. Lumpectomy just removes the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding it. Some lymph nodes may be removed as well. This procedure is gaining acceptance among surgeons and patients alike.",A

"During resuscitation, fractured ribs most commonly involve:",2nd -4th ribs,3rd -5th ribs,4th -6th ribs,5th -7th ribs,"Ans. c. 4th -- 6th ribs Reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the literature in relation to rib fractures in adults Rib fractures following CPR in adults are quite common - 30 to 60% of prospective post-moem studies. Post-CPR rib fractures are often bilateral. The site of rib fracture is dependent on: the position of the hands; force used; and method of chest compression (manual or device-assisted). The vast majority (90%+) offractures occur in ribs 2 to 7; fractures in the bony pas of rib numbers 1 and 8 to 10 are possible but probably very rare; it is difficult to see how fractures can occur in rib numbers 11 and 12 following standard manual CPR. The vast majority of fractures (90%+) occur in the anterior third of the bony pa of the rib, some occur in the middle third but - following standard manual CPR - none in the posterior third of the bony pa of the rib. Posterior rib fractures occur following automated band-type CPR. Lateral fractures i.e. those occurring between the anterior and posterior axillary lines, do occur after standard CPR. If a fracture is noted in rib numbers 10 to 12 or in the posterior third of the bony pa of a rib, then non-resuscitation trauma should be suspected. Chest x-ray is unreliable as a diagnostic tool for detecting rib fractures. CT is better than x-ray and may complement the post-moem detection of rib fractures. Fractures are more common On the left side of the chest With increasing age of the patient In females With increasing length of time of resuscitation attempts Following the involvement of untrained persons With the use of ACD-CPR",C

Not used for intravascular volume maintainence is -,Hydroxy ethyl starch,Dextran,Erythropoetin,Gelatin,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Erythropoetin o Colloids the term 'colloids' refers to aqueous solutions that contain both large organic macromolecules and electrolytes. Presumably, the large molecular size of the dissolved molecules limited their ability to cross the endothelial membrane. These molecules are retained within the intravascular space to a greater degree than pure crystalloids, owing to their higher oncotic pressure.o Crystalloids describe aqueous fluids that contain crystal-forming elements (electrolytes), which easily pass through vascular endothelial membrane barriers followed by water, leading to their equilibration between the intravascular and extracellular space.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for her deterioration?",Sepsis,Hypovolemia,Adrenal insufficiency,Acute tubular necrosis,"Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur in patients with severe stress, infection, or trauma or as a result of abrupt cessation or too rapid tapering of chronic glucocoicoid therapy, and is classically manifested as changing mental status, increased temperature, cardiovascular collapse, hypoglycemia, and hyperkalemia. The diagnosis can be difficult to make and requires a high index of suspicion. Its clinical presentation is similar to that of sepsis; however, sepsis is generally associated with hyperglycemia and no significant change in potassium. The treatment for adrenal crisis is intravenous steroids, volume resuscitation, and other suppoive measures to treat any new or ongoing stress. Dexamethasone should be used as steroid replacement when additional testing with an adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is planned, since hydrocoisone can interfere with measurement of coisol levels. Steroid treatment can be subsequently conveed to oral medication and tapered after treatment of the adrenal crisis",C

True regarding umbilical hernia is/are all except?,Mostly congenital,More common in males,Occurs due to increased intrabdominal pressure,Occurs via rectus abdominis diastesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., More common in malesoAn umbilical hernia mostly congetital, is a hernia present at the site of the umbilicus through a persistent umbilical ring.oBoys and girls are equally affected in congenital where as acquired is three times more common in women than in men. An acquired umbilical hernia directly results from increased intra-abdominal pressure.oIn congenital umbilical hernia, which is especially common in premature infants, the intestines return normally into the body cavity, but the musculature (rectus abdominis) of the ventral abdominal wall fails to close the umbilical ring (diastasis recti), thus allowing a varying amount of omentum or bowel to protrude through.oIf these hernias are asymptomatic, reducible, and don't enlarge, no surgery is needed (and in other cases it must be considered).Umbilical herniaoAn umbilical hernia, mostly congetital, is a hernia present at the site of the umbilicus through a persistent umbilical ring. The hernia sac is peritoneum, which is frequently adherent to the dermis of the umbilical skin. It can be congenital or acquired.oIn congenital umbilical hernia, which is especially common in premature infants, the intestines return normally into the body cavity, but the musculature (rectus abdominis) of the ventral abdominal wall fails to close the umbilical ring (diastasis recti), thus allowing a varying amount of omentum or bowel to protrude through.A) Congenital#More common type. Congenital umbilical hernia is a congenital malformation of umbilicus.; Common in infants. Low birth weight and premature infants are also more likely to have an umbilical hernia. Boys and girls are equally affected. It is also found to be more common in children of African descent.#Virtually all pediatric umbilical hernias are congenital.B) Acquired#Occur among adults. It is three times more common in women than in men.#An acquired umbilical hernia directly results from increased intra-abdominal pressure caused by obesity, heavy lifting, a long history of coughing, or multiple pregnancies. Another type of acquired umbilical hernias are incisional hernias, which are hernia developing in a scar following abdominal surgery, e.g. after insertion of laparoscopy trocars through the umbilicus.#Strangulation is uncommon.PresentationoHernias may be asymptomatic and present only as a bulge of the umbilicus. Symptoms may develop when the contracting abdominal wall causes pressure on the hernia contents. This results in abdominal pain or discomfort. These symptoms may be worsened by the patient lifting or straining.oIf a physician gently pushes on the bulge when a child is lying down and calm, it will usually get smaller or go back into the abdomen.oIncarceration refers to the inability to reduce the hernia back into the abdominal cavity because intestines get trapped within the umbilical hernia. Prolonged incarceration can lead to tissue ischemia (strangulation) and shock when untreated Sometimes the. When this occurs, the child usually has severe pain and the bulge may be firm and red.oThe size of the base of the herniated tissue is inversely correlated with risk of strangulation (i.e., a narrow base is more likely to strangulate).TreatmentoAlthough sometimes quite large, these hernias tend to resolve without any treatment by around the age of 2-3 years. Surgery is needed if they do not close by themselves by the age of 5 years.oIf these hernias are asymptomatic, reducible, and don't enlarge, no surgery is needed (and in other cases it must be considered).",B

Which is the best fluid for resuscitation during shock state?,Crystalloids,Colloids,Plasma substitutes,5% dextrose,"ANSWER: (A) CrystalloidsREF: Schwartz's Principles of Surgery 9th ed chapter 5""Fluid resuscitation is a major adjunct to physically controlling hemorrhage in patients with shock. The ideal type of fluid to be used continues to be debated; however, crystalloids continue to be the mainstay of fluid choice""Several studies have demonstrated increased risk of death in bleeding trauma patients treated with colloid compared to patients treated with crystalloid. In patients with severe hemorrhage, restoration of intravascular volume should be achieved ivith blood products.Ongoing studies continue to evaluate the use of hypertonic saline as a resuscitative adjunct in bleeding patients. The benefit of hypertonic saline solutions may be immunomodulatory. Specifically, these effects have been attributed to pharmacologic effects resulting in decreased reperfusion-mediated injury with decreased O2 radical formation, less impairment of immune function compared to standard crystalloid solution, and less brain swelling in the multi- injured patient. The reduction of total volume used for resuscitation makes this approach appealing as a resuscitation agent for combat injuries and may contribute to a decrease in the incidence of ARDS and multiple organ failure.",A

A child is spinned around by holding his hand by his father. While doing this the child staed crying and does not allow his father to touch his elbow. The diagnosis is:,Pulled elbow,Radial head dislocation,Annular ligament tear,Fracture olecranon process,"Pulled elbow or Nursemaid's elbow occurs in children under 4 years old. It is caused by a sudden pull on the extended pronated arm, usually by an adult tugging on a reluctant toddler. The pronated radial head slips paially under the annular ligament and displaces into the radiocapitellar joint. The child suddenly stops using the arm, holding it in a flexed and pronated position. Radiographs show no abnormalities, since positioning for elbow films will often reduce the subluxation. Reduction is achieved by firmly supinating the forearm and flexing the elbow while pressing down on the radial head. Often, a ""click"" is felt when reduction is achieved. Soon after reduction the child becomes less apprehensive and gradually resumes use of the arm. Ref: Srinivasan R.C., Tolhurst S., Vanderhave K.L. (2010). Chapter 40. Ohopedic Surgery. In G.M.

Warfarin to be stopped____________ days before surgery?,2 to 3 days,4 to 5 days,6 to 7 days,8 to 9 days,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 4 to 5 days Warfarin may increase peri- operative bleeding, except for minor procedures such as cataract surgery without bulbar blocks. No consensus exists on the optimal perioperative management of patients receiving warfarin. The usual recommendation is to withhold warfarin staing 4 to 5 days preoperatively (if the INR is between 2.0 and 3.0) to allow the INR to decrease to less than 1.5, which is a level considered safe for surgical procedures and neuraxial blockade. If the INR is greater than 3.0, it is usually necessary to withhold warfarin longer than 4 to 5 days. If the INR is measured the day before the surgical procedure and remains higher than 1.8, a small dose of vitamin K (1 to 5 mg administrated orally or subcutaneously) can reverse anticoagulation. Vitamin K has an effect within 6 to 10 hours after oral or subcutaneous administration (more predictable with oral administration), and it peaks within 24 hours to 48 hours. Administration of higher doses may lead to warfarin resistance when therapy is initiated again.",B

In tetany the increased membrane excitability is caused by:,Decreased release of inhibitory neurotransmitter from nerve terminals,Depolarization of the nerve and muscle membranes,Spontaneous release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum,Activation of sodium channels at more negative membrane potentials,"Membrane excitability is related to the ease with which depolarization opens Na+ channels. The opening of the Na+ channel in response to depolarization is, in pa, related to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration; the lower the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, the easier it is for Na + channels to open when the membrane depolarizes. Hyperventilation (lowering aerial CO2 tension) decreases extracellular Ca+ concentration by increasing aerial pH. When pH rises, H+ is released from plasma proteins in exchange for Ca and ionized Ca+ concentration decreases.",B

Features of hypehyroidism are all except: March 2007,Voracious appetite,Cold intolerance,Emotional disturbance,Sleeplessness,"Ans. B: Cold intolerance Causes Functional thyroid tissue producing an excess of thyroid hormone occurs in a number of clinical conditions. The major causes are: - Graves' disease (the most common etiology with 70-80%) - Toxic thyroid adenoma - Toxic multinodular goitre High blood levels of thyroid hormones/hypehyroxinemia can occur for a number of other reasons: - Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. There are a number of different kind of thyroiditis including Hashimoto's (immune mediated), subacute (inflammatory), and DeQuervain's (granulomatous). These may be initially associated with secretion of excess thyroid hormone, but usually progress to gland dysfunction and thus, to hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism. - Struma ovarii (a teratoma of the ovary) can produce excess thyroid hormone. - Amiodarone, a hea medication, can sometimes cause hypehyroidism. - Postpaum thyroiditis (PPT) occurs in about 7% of women. Major clinical signs include weight loss (often accompanied by a increased appetite), anxiety, intolerance to heat, fatigue, hair loss, weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, polydipsia, and sweating. Additionally, patients may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation), shoness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long term untreated hypehyroidism can lead to osteoporosis Neurological manifestations can include tremor, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (paicularly of asian descent) periodic paralysis. Minor ocular (eye) signs, which may be present in any type of hypehyroidism, are eyelid retraction (""stare"") and lid-lag. In hypehyroid stare (Dalrymple sign) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal (the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus, where the ""white"" of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris). In lid-lag (von Graefe's sign), when the patient tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hypehyroidism. Neither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball) which occurs specifically and uniquely in Graves' disease. This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the retroorbital (eye socket) fat. Measuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood is usually all that is required. A low TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited by increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood, and is therefore a reliable marker of hypehyroidism. Measuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, may also contribute to the diagnosis. Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test to distinguish between causes of hypehyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis.",B

It has become a highly accurate test, often obviating the need for carotid arteriography prior to carotid endarterectomy. Carotid arteriography remains the ""gold standard"" when quantifying the degree of carotid stenosis, but it is usually performed after noninvasive testing suggests significant stenosis. Spiral CT angiography is a new noninvasive modality that has been used to evaluate many segments of the vascular tree, but as yet its accuracy does not approach that of standard arteriography and it would certainly not be used in the initial evaluation of a patient with an asymptomatic bruit. Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) is also a relatively new modality that has enjoyed moderate success in the investigation of carotid disease. Although not quite as accurate as standard arteriography, it has been used in conjunction with the duplex as a complementary study. Once again, because of its cost, MRA would not be used as the primary screening modality. Transcranial Doppler studies are used to assess the intracranial vasculature.",B

Escharotomies is required in which type of burns:,1st degree,2nd degree deep ( subcutaneous ),2nd degree superficial,Electrical,"When deep second- and third-degree burn wounds encompass the circumference of an extremity, peripheral circulation to the limb can be compromised. Development of generalized edema beneath a nonyielding eschar impedes venous outflow and eventually affects aerial inflow to the distal beds. This can be recognized by numbness and tingling in the limb and increased pain in the digits. Aerial flow can be assessed by determination of Doppler signals in the digital aeries and the palmar and plantar arches in affected extremities. Capillary refill can also be assessed. Extremities at risk are identified either on clinical examination or on measurement of tissue pressures greater than 40 mm Hg. These extremities require escharotomies, which are releases of the burn eschar performed at the bedside by incising the lateral and medial aspects of the extremity with a scalpel or electrocautery unit. The entire constricting eschar must be incised longitudinally to completely relieve the impediment to blood flow. The incisions are carried down onto the thenar and hypothenar eminences and along the dorsolateral sides of the digits to completely open the hand, if it is involved. If it is clear that the wound will require excision and grafting because of its depth, escharotomies are safest to restore perfusion to the underlying non burned tissues until formal excision.

All of the following are features of Grave's disease except: September 2005,More common in males,Tremor,Pretibial myxedema,Intolerance to heat,"Ans. A: More common in males Graves disease, a syndrome of primary thyrotoxicosis, is caused by circulating thyroid receptor autoantibodies (TRab/ TSH-RAbs). The antibodies not only displace thyrotropin from the thyroid receptors but also mimic thyrotropin by activating the receptor to stimulate the synthesis and release T3 and T4. Because autoantibody production is not linked to the normal pituitary negative feedback loop, thyroid gland function becomes autonomous, and serum T4 and T3 levels become abnormally high and lead to clinical thyrotoxicosis. Because hormone synthesis is accelerated and thyroid gland radioiodine uptake is elevated, radionuclide scans demonstrate a diffuse increase in iodine uptake by the gland. Graves disease is closely associated with Hashimoto's disease (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) in which thyrotoxic/ cytotoxic antithyroid antibodies attack the gland. Thyrotoxicosis is eight times more common in females. Major clinical signs include weight loss (often accompanied by a increased appetite), anxiety, intolerance to heat, fatigue, hair loss, weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, polydipsia, and sweating. Additionally, patients may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation), shoness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long term untreated hypehyroidism can lead to osteoporosis Neurological manifestations can include tremor, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (paicularly of asian descent) periodic paralysis. The goiter in primary thyrotoxicosis is diffuse and vascular; it may be large or small, firm or soft, and a thrill and a bruit may be present. The onset is abrupt but remissions and exacerbations are not infrequent. Hypehyroidism is usually more severe than in secondary thyrotoxicosis but cardiac failure is rare. Manifestations of thyrotoxicosis not due to hypehyroidism per se, for example orbital proptosis, ophthalmoplegia and pretibial myxoedema, may occur in primary thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid dermopathy/ pretibial myxoedema is characterized by thickening of the skin, usually in areas of trauma, by deposition of hyaluronic acid in the dermis and subcutis.",A

Caudal anesthesia requires identification of the sacral hiatus. The sacrococcygeal ligament (i.e., extension of ligamentum flavum) overlies the sacral hiatus between the two sacral cornua. To facilitate locating the cornua, the posterior superior iliac spines should be located and, by using the line between them as one side of an equilateral triangle, the location of the sacral hiatus should be approximated. After the sacral hiatus is identified, the index and mid-dle fingers of the palpating hand are placed on the sacral cornua, and after local infiltration, the caudal needle (or Tuohy needle if a catheter is to be placed) is inseed at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the sacrum.

"TRUE about infant airway compared to adult airway are all, EXCEPT:",The relatively large size of the tongue,Epiglottis is omega shaped,Larynx is funnel shaped,None of the above,"Differences in airway anatomy make the potential for technical airway difficulties greater in infants than in teenagers or adults. The airway of infants differs in five ways: (1) the relatively large size of the infant's tongue in relation to the oropharynx increases the likelihood of airway obstruction and technical difficulties during laryngoscopy; (2) the larynx is located higher (more cephalic) in the neck, thus making straight blades more useful than curved blades; (3) the epiglottis is shaped differently, being sho, stubby, omega shaped, and angled over the laryngeal inlet; control with the laryngoscope blade is therefore more difficult; (4) the vocal cords are angled, so a ""blindly"" passed endotracheal tube may easily lodge in the anterior commissure rather than slide into the trachea; and (5) the infant larynx is funnel shaped.

Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder in which a thyroid-stimulating IgG immunoglobulin (TSI) binds to the TSH receptors causing increased release of thyroid hormone. The exophthalmos is caused by lymphocytic infiltration of the extraocular muscles. Hashimoto's thyroiditis results in hypothyroidism and is associated with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland and antimicrosomal antibodies against the thyroid parenchyma. Multinodular toxic goiter causes hypehyroidism, but does not result in exophthalmos. Papillary carcinoma will only very rarely present as a hypersecreting nodule. Most cases will be nonsecreting, cold nodules. There is no exophthalmos. This is the most common thyroid cancer and has the best prognosis of all thyroid cancers. Ref: Cooper D.S., Ladenson P.W.

Effect of inhalational agent on neuromuscular system which is true -,They relax skeletal muscle and decreases the effect of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD),They contract skeletal muscle and potentiate the effect of NMBD,They directly relax skeletal muscle and they potentiate the action of NMBD,No effect on neuromuscular system,"Halogenated volatile anesthetics have a potentiating effect on nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The mechanism appears to be incompletely understood, but is likely a combination of: effect on central motor neurons augmentation of the NMB's affinity for the receptor site inhibition of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Clinically, the presence of inhaled anesthetics will decrease the ED50, as well as both prolong the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The degree of potentiation depends on the specific agent and concentration used. For example, desflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane. With deeper planes of anesthesia, the degree of potentiation is enhanced due to a dose-dependent inhibition of current through the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Studies attempting to quantify the magnitude of these effects have led to conflicting results due to the time factor, or duration of anesthesia. The older halogenated agents (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) may take up to 2 hours to equilibrate with muscle, so in practice the potentiating effects of these vapors might not be immediately apparent. In contrast, newer agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane equilibrate more rapidly with muscle, and the effects may be seen after as little as 30 minutes. Nitrous oxide has largely been considered as having no effect on neuromuscular blockade.",C

A 45 year old male with h/o smoking is scheduled for elective surgery. All are true except,Effect of nicotine on aoic and carotid bodies can increase sympathetic tone,Carbon monoxide shift 02-lib dissociation curve to right,Muscle relaxant dose requirements are increased,Smoking dereases surfactant levels,"B i.e. Carbon monoxide shift 02-Hb dissociation curve to right Smoking increases airway irritability & secretions, decreases surfactant mucopulmonary transpo and increases the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. - Cessation of smoking for 12 to 24 hrs before operation decreases the level of carbon monoxide and carboxyhemoglobin, which shift oxy-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the rightQ and increases the 02 available to tissue. (CO shift oxyHb dissociation curve to left). - Improvement in mucociliary transpo and small airway function and decrease in sputum production require prolonged abstinence (8-12 weeks) from smoking. So the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications decrease with abstinence from cigarette smoking for > 8 weeks in patients undergoing cardiac (coronary aery bypass) surgery and > 4 weeks in patients underging pulmonary surgery. - Smoking sholy before surgery may be a/w an increased incidence ST segment depression on ECG. Major action of nicotine consists initially of transient stimulation (at small doses) and subsequently of a more persistent depression of all autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) ganglia (at larger doses). Nicotine also possess a biphasic action on adrenal medulla i.e. small doses evoke whereas larger doses prevent the discharge of catecholamines in response to splanchnic nerve stimulation. The effect of nicotine on neuromuscular junction are similar to those on ganglia i.e. initial stimulant phase (contractions) f/b blockade by receptor desensitization (IA rapidly developing paralysis). Nicotine, like Ach, stimulates number of sensory receptors such as mechanoreceptors (to stretch or pressure) of skin, mesentry, tongue, lung and stomach; chemoreceptors of carotid and aoic body, thermal receptors of skin and tongue; pain receptors; and emetic chemorecepto trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema of medulle oblongata (causing vomiting). Nicotine markedly stimulates CNS i.e. weak analgesia at low doses; tremors and convulsion at higher doses followed by CNS depression and death from respiratory failure. So it can be assumed for the above description that smoking (low nicotine) can stimulate aoic and carotid body, increase sympathetic tone and stimulate NMJ thereby increasing the muscle relaxant dose requirements.",B

After pancreatic transplantation bladder drainage is preferred over enteric drainage for the better monitoring of which levels?,HBA1C levels,Amylase levels,Glucose levels,Electrolyte levels,"Major advantage of bladder drainage after pancreatic transplant is the ability to monitor the patient for graft rejection. Decrease of more than 50% in urine amylase activity after pancreas transplantation signals possible acute rejection. The decrease in urinary amylase may be the only clinical indication of a problem, with no change in the serum concentration of creatinine or glucose or activity of serum amylase or lipase. Biopsy of pancreas is done to confirm diagnosis of rejection. Ref: Stem Cell Therapy for Diabetes By Shimon Efrat, Page 71",B

In contrast to phase II depolarization block & Non depolarizing block, phase I depolarization block does not exhibit fade during tetanus or train-of-four, neither does it demonstrate post tetanic potentiation. Phase I block is potentiated by isoflurane, Mg, Li & Anticholine-esterase while phase II block is potentiated by enflurane. - The onset of paralysis by succinylcholine is signaled by visible motor unit contractions called fasciculation.Q Patients who have received suxamethonium have an increased incidence of postoperative myalgiaQ. This is more common in healthy female outpatients. Pregnancy & extremes of age seem to be protective.

All are true regarding kaposi sarcoma except one :,Predominent in male,Multicentric origin,Chemotherapy is treatment of choice,Occurs in AIDS pt only,"Ans. is 'd' ie Occurs in AIDS pt. only There are at least 4 distinct epidemiological forms of Kaposi's sarcoma, only one form is associated with AIDS.The 4 distinct forms are -The classic form - that occurs in older men of predominantly Mediterranean or Eastern European, Jewish backgrounds.Equatorial African form - that occurs in all ages.The form associated with organ transplantationThe form associated with HIV-I infection.Kaposi 's sarcoma (K.S.)Kaposi's sarcoma is a multicentric neoplasm consisting of multiple vascular nodules appearing in the skin, mucous memb and lymph nodes, lung, GIT etc.Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon)Course ranges from indolent with only minor skin or lymph node involvement to fulminant with extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement.AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma occurs predominantly in homosexual men (96%)K.S. does not result from a neoplastic transformation of cells in the classic sense and so is not truly a sarcoma. It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin, it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K.S. is believed to be d/t occurrence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis.Though K.S. is an opportunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike opportunistic infection, its occurrence is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIV inf. even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count.Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all forms of KS (in all the 4 types)In contrast to most malignancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in K.S. and is of no clinical significance.Management of KS associated with HIVIn the majority of cases, effective ARV therapy is quite helpful in achieving control. Spontaneous regressions have been reported in the setting of HAART.For patients in whom tumor persists or in whom control of HIV replication is not possible options exist.Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances.For a single lesion or a limited number of lesions causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problemslocalized radiation,intralesional vinblastine, orcryotherapyFor large number of lesions or visceral involvementSystemic therapies, either IFN- or chemotherapy is consideredInterferon- IFN provides an added advantage of having ARV activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease.Chemotherapy- Three of the chemotherapeutic agent that have been approved by the FDA for KS are:liposomal daunorubicin,liposomal doxorubicin, andpaclitaxelLiposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS.The single most important determinant of response appears to be the CD4+ T cell count.Management of AIDS Associated Kaposi's SarcomaAntiretroviral therapySingle or limited number of lesionsLocalized radiationIntralesional vinblastineCryotherapyExtensive diseaseInitial therapyInterferon- (if CD4+ T cells >150/L)Liposomal daunorubicinSubsequent therapyLiposomal doxorubicinPaclitaxelCombination chemotherapy with low-dose doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (ABV)Radiation treatment So the option (C) is not totally correct but option (D) is absolutely wrong.",D

Acalculous cholecystitis is caused by -,Diabetes mellitus,Total parenteral nutrition,Tuberculosis,All,"Ans. (a) Diabetes mellitus (b) Total parenteral nutrition (c) Tuberculosis * In acalculous cholecystitis, there is acute inflammation of gallbladder without gallstones.* In over 50% of cases of acalculous cholecystitis an underlying explanation is not found.* Acalculous cholecystitis typically develop in critically ill patients in the ICU. Patients on parenteral hyperalimentation with extensive burns, sepsis, major operations, multiple trauma or prolonged illness with multiple organ system failure are at risk for developing acalculous cholecystitis.* Harrison writes* ""An increased risk for the development of acalculous cholecystitis is especially associated with serious trauma or burns, with the postpaum period following prolonged labor, and with ohopedic and other nonbiliary major surgical operations in the post operative period. It may possibly complicate periods of prolonged parenteral hyperalimentation. For some of these cases, biliary sludge in the cystic duct may be responsible. Other precipitating factors include- vasculitis- obstructing adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder- diabetes mellitus- torsion of the gall bladder- unusual bacterial infections of the gall bladder (eg. Leptospira, Streptococcus, Salmonella, or Vibrio cholera), andparasitic infestation of gallbladder.* Acalculous cholecystitis may also be seen with a variety of other systemic disease processes- sarcoidosis - syphilis- cardiovascular disease - actinomycosis- tuberculosis* Clinical manifestation- is indistinguishable from those of calculuos cholecystitis, however, the setting of cholecystitis in severe underlying illness is characteristic of acalculous cholecystitis.* U/S & CT examinations show a large, tense, static gallbladder without stones and with evidence of poor emptying over a prolonged period. Ultrasonography is usually the diagnostic test of choice, as it can be done bedside in the intensive care unit.* ManagementThe complication rate of acalculous cholecystitis is more than calculous cholecystitis.- Acalculous cholecystitis requires urgent intervention.- Percutaneous ultrasound or CT guided cholecystostomy is the treatment of choice for these patients, as they are unfit for surgery.- If the diagnosis is unceain, percutaneous cholecystostomy is both diagnostic and therapeutic. About 90% of patients will improve with the percutaneous cholecystostomy. However, if they do not improve, other steps, such as open cholecystostomy or cholecystectomy, may be required.If needed cholecystectomy can be done after the patient has recovered from the underlying disease.",D

On activation, the vein is sucked into the resector under direct vision, morcellated and removed by suction . TRIVEX system uses two components. First instrument illuminates the varicose veins through the skin using advanced fibre optic technology and the vein resector is then guided next to the vein underneath the skin. Suction draws the vein into tip of the vein resector while a rotating blade effectively removes the leg vein. With this new varicose vein treatment, large clusters of varicose veins can be accurately removed through a minimal number of small incision and is far more effective than other forms of varicose vein surgery.

Modified radical neck dissection is modification of RND that preserves nonlymphatic structures i.e. CN XI, SCM and IJV. MRND has been found to be equally effective in controlling neck disease as RND with superior functional outcome. Selective neck dissection Preservation of any of the levels I through V during neck dissection is known as Selective neck dissection. The principle behind preservation of ceain nodal groups is that specific primary sites preferentially drain their lymphatics in a predictable pattern.

Which of the following agent causes muscle rigidity,Fentanyl,Halothane,Ketamine,Droperidol,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

Corkscrew esophagus is seen in which of the following conditions ?,Carcinoma esophagus,Scleroderma,Achalasia cardia,Diffuse esophagus spasm,"• Esophageal contractions are repetitive, simultaneous, and of high amplitude.
• Basic pathology is related to a motor abnormality of the esophageal body that is most notable in the lower two thirds of the esophagus.
• More common in women and is often found in patients with multiple complaints. Clinical Features]
• Clinical presentation: Chest pain and dysphagia (may be related to eating or exertion and may mimic angina)
• Complain of a squeezing pressure in the chest that may radiate to the jaw, arms, and upper back.
• The symptoms are often pronounced during times of heightened emotional stress.
Diagnosis
• Barium swallow:
−− Corkscrew or rosary-bead esophagus, segmental spasm or pseudodiverticulosis appearance
−− Due to presence of tertiary contractions
−− Indicative of advanced disease
• Hypermotility disorder also known as supersqueeze esophagus.
• Esophagus with hypertensive peristalsis or high-amplitude peristaltic contractions.
• Most common and most painful esophageal hypermotility disorder.
• Associated with hypertrophic musculature resulting in high-amplitude contractions of the esophagus
Clinical Features
• Chest pain and dysphagia are typical symptoms.
Diagnosis
• The gold standard of diagnosis is the subjective complaint of chest pain with simultaneous objective evidence of peristaltic esophageal contractions 2 standard deviations above the normalQ values on manometric tracings.
• On manometry, amplitude >180 mmHg and duration of contraction >6 seconds
Treatment
• The treatment of nutcracker esophagus is medical (Calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and antispasmodics) 
• The LES pressure is above normal, motility of esophageal body may be hyperperistaltic or normal.
Clinical Features
• Patients with hypertensive LES present with chest pain or dysphagiaQ.
Diagnosis
• Diagnosis is made by manometry.
−− Elevated LES pressure (>26 mm Hg) and normal relaxation of the LES.
−− Esophageal body may be hyperperistaltic or normal.
Treatment
• Botox injections alleviate symptoms temporarily, and hydrostatic balloon dilation may provide long-term symptomatic relief.
• Surgery in patients who fail interventional treatments and those with significant symptoms.
• A laparoscopic modified Heller esophagomyotomy is the operation of choice.",D

The differential diagnosis should include other causes of abdominal pain, such as acute appendicitis. The most common stone consists of calcium oxalate and up to 80 per cent of renal stones are visible on ultrasound. The KUB US scan is poor at differentiating different stones and can often miss smaller stones. Intravenous urography (IVU) (C) is more useful for detecting obstructions in the renal tract and US scans should always be done before IVU as smaller stones often become nonvisible. IVU scans as it is able to differentialte upto 99 percent of renal stones and it is also useful for exploring other causes of an acute abdomen. However, the radiation risk to the patient makes this investigation much more invasive and is not as readily available as an US scan. An MRI scan (B) has only a few advantages over a CT scan, these include the ability to assess renal aeries and there is no risk form radiation. However, MRI has poor differentiation ability and stones can often appear similar to tumours of blood clots. Where it is paicularly impoant to avoid radiation x-ray (A) is reasonable in detecting renal stones (up to 80 per cent) since the majority consist of calcium which shows up well on radiograph films, however, there is again a radiation risk to the patient which is avoidable in USG scans.",D

Summary This year's Nobel Laureates have made a series of ground breaking discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and DNA recombination in mammals. Their discoveries led to the creation of an immensely powerful technology referred to as gene targeting in mice. It is now being applied to viually all areas of biomedicine - from basic research to the development of new therapies. Gene targeting is often used to inactivate single genes. Such gene ""knockout"" experiments have elucidated the roles of numerous genes in embryonic development, adult physiology, aging and disease. To date, more than ten thousand mouse genes (approximately half of the gene in the mammalian genome) have been knocked out. Ongoing international effos will make ""knockout mice"" for all genes available within the near future. With gene targeting it is now possible to produce almost any type of DNA modification in the mouse genome, allowing scientists to establish the roles of individual genes in health and disease. Gene targeting has already produced more than five hundred different mouse models of human disorders, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer.",B

However, abnormalities that inhibit sperm transpo (e.g., complete caput separation, atresia, agenesis) have been repoed in only 8% of patients with cryptorchidism.In addition, when the processus vaginalis is patent, the epididymis is more likely to be abnormal.Hazards of incomplete descent are:Sterility in bilateral cases (especially intra-abdominal testes)Pain as a result of traumaAn associated indirect inguinal hernia is often presentTorsionEpididymo-orchitis in an incompletely descended right testis can mimic appendicitis.Orchidopexy is usually performed after the age of 1 year.Early repositioning of an incompletely descended testis can preserve function.",C
Local anaesthetics act by-,Na channel inhibition inside gate,Na channel inhibition outside gate,K channel inhibition inside gate,K channel inhibition outside gate,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na channel inhibition inside gate o Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na+ channels from inside.Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted,o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad > Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

Post-transplant cytomegalovirus infection may cause,Pyelonephritis,GI ulceration and hemorrhage,Cholecystitis,Intraabdominal abscess,"Overall, 30% of all infections contracted in the posttransplant period are viral. The most common viral infections are DNA viruses of the herpesvirus family and include cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and varicella zoster virus. CMV infections may occur as either primary or reactive infections and have a peak incidence at about 6-week post-transplant. The classic signs include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukopenia. CMV infection can affect several organ systems and result in pneumonitis; ulceration and hemorrhage in the stomach, duodenum, or colon; hepatitis; esophagitis; retinitis; encephalitis; or pancreatitis. The risk of developing posttransplant CMV depends on donor-recipient serology, with the greatest risk in seronegative patients who receive organs from seropositive donors.

Which type of breast cancer is most likely to be bilateral,Infiltrating duct carcinoma,Paget's disease of breast,Lobular carcinoma of breast,Medullary carcinoma of braest,"Current nomenclature of Carcinoma Breast Ductal carcinoma is the most common variant with lobular carcinoma occurring in up to 15% of cases. There are subtypes of lobular cancer, including the classical type, that carry a better prognosis than the pleomorphic type. Occasionally, the picture may be mixed with both ductal and lobular features. There are different patterns of spread depending on histological type. If there is doubt whether a tumour is predominantly lobular in type, immunohistochemical analysis using the e-cadherin antibody, which reacts positively in lobular cancer, will help in diagnosis. Rarer histological variants, usually carrying a better prognosis, include colloid or mucinous carcinoma, whose cells produce abundant mucin, medullary carcinoma, with solid sheets of large cells often associated with a marked lymphocytic reaction and tubular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is commonly multifocal and/or bilateral, hence the increasing use of MRI for assessment. Cases detected the screening programme are often smaller and better differentiated than those presenting to the symptomatic service and are of a special type.

Metabolic alkalosis with paradoxical aciduria o Repetitive vomiting leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. The urine is alkaline initially but eventually it becomes acidic (paradoxical aciduria)o Cause of paradoxical aciduriaInitially the kidney compensate for metabolic alkalosis by reabsorbing hydrogen and chloride ions in exchange for sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. But gradually as the body stores of sodium and especially potassium become depleted, kidney starts retaining these ions in exchange of hydrogen ions. Thus the urine becomes acidic and metabolic alkaline state is further aggravated.",C
Which of the following is most common complication of celiac plexus block aEUR',Hypotension,Retroperiton&al hemorrhage,Pneumothorax,Intravascular injection,"Hypotension The most common complication of celiac plexus is postural hypotension which is largely due to blockade of the lumbar sympathetic chain. Celiac plexus The celiac plexus is situated retroperitoneally in the upper abdomen. It is at the level of T12 and L1 veebrae, anterior to the crura of the diaphragm. It is the main junction for autonomic nerves supplying the upper abdominal organs (Liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, pancreas, kidneys, small bowel and 2/3 of the large bowel). The ganglia lie on each side of LI (aoa lying posteriorly, pancreas anteriorly and inferior venacava laterally). The plexus is composed of network of neve fibres from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic supply :? It contains two large ganglia that receive sympathetic fibres from three splanchnic nerves - Greater splanchnic nerves (TIT, to TIT() - Lesser splanchnic nerves (Tio/T,,) - Least splanchnic nerves (Tii/T,2) Parasympathetic supply - From the left and right vagal trunks which pass through the celiax plexus but do not connect there. Technique The block is performed using X-ray screening, intravenous sedation, local anaesthetic infiltration of the superficial layers with the patient in the prone position. Indications of celiac plexus block For releief of pain from nonpelvic intraabdominal organs. Acute pain - may be performed during surgery for postoperative pain relief. Chronic pain - useful for any condition that causes chronic severe upper abdominal visceral pain e.g. chronic pancreatitis (local anaesthetic blocks only).

"A 24 year old female is with suspected appendicitis is taken up for surgery. However during surgery the appendix appears to be normal. Instead the Ileum is inflamed, enlarged with multiple adhesion. Surrouding fat is also involved. Possible diagnosis is -",Ileocaecal tuberculosis,Diverticulosis,Intussusception,Carcinoid,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ileocaecal tuberculosis o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms :# Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis# Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis.A) Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate.o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumeno It usually occurs in the ileocecal region.Clinical features# Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea.# Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mass in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.# Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction.Barium meal radiography will reveal# Persistent narrowing of the affected segment i.e. the terminal ileum and the caecum.# The caecum is pulled up * and may become subhepatic.# As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caecal angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecal angle is 900. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 1500.*Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.# ATT is given in both cases.# If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)B) Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis)o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved.o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt losso Barium meal shows absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment.Treatment# A course of A TT is adequate# Operation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",A
What is TRUE regarding Barrett's esophagus -,Seen in females,Premalignant condition,Responds to conservative management,Squamous metaplasia is seen,"About option (a)


Barrett's esophagus is more common in men than in women (3 : 1 ratio)


About option (c)

Schwartz surgery and CSDT writes that Barrett's esophagus can be reversed but only with antireflux surgery (response to medications is not good). Read below lines from CSDT (13/e p438) Schwartz (9/e p841): CSDT writes-""A fundoplication may promote regression of the columnar epithelium. Many studies have shown that regression occurs in 15-50% of patients when the length of the Barrett segment is less than 3 cm.""
Schwartz writes- ""The common belief that Barrett's epithelium cannot be reversed is likely false. DeMeester and associates reported that, after antireflux surgery, loss of IM (intestinal metaplasia) in patients with visible BE was rare, but occurred in73% of patients with inapparent IM of the cardia. This suggests that the metaplastic process may indeed be reversible if reflux is eliminated early in its process, that cardiac mucosa is dynamic, and that, as opposed to IM extending several centimeters into the esophagus, IM of the cardia is more likely to regress following antireflux surgery.
Gurski and colleagues reviewed pre- and posttreatment endoscopic biopsies from 77 Barrett's patients treated surgically and 14 treated with PPIs. Histopathologic regression occurred in 28 of 77 patients (36.4%) following antireflux surgery, and in one of 14 (7.1%) patients treated with PPlsalone (P <.03). After surgery, regression from low-grade dysplastic to nondysplastic BE occurred in 17 of 25 (68%) patients and from IM to no IM in 11 of 52 (21.2%) patients. Both types of regression were significantly more common in short- (<3 cm) compared to long-segment (>3 cm) BE.
Although these studies do not conclusively prove the ability of antireflux surgery to reverse the changes of early BE, they do provide encouragement that, given early changes, the process may indeed be reversible.""
More about the tit of Barret's oesophagus

First, the natural course of Barrett's oesophagus.

-  Barrett's esophagus develops during healing of erosive esophagitis with continued acid reflux and the Barrett's esophagus progresses through a dysplastic stage before developing into adenocarcinoma. The stages are
-   Erosive esophagitis → Metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus) → Low grade dysplasia → high grade dysplaisa → Adenocarcinoma

Treatment of Barrett's esophagus is same as for reflux esophagitis → Conservative (antacids, H2 blocking agents, elevation of the head of bed, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol etc.) and Anti-reflux surgery (Nissen's fundoplication is anti-reflux procedure of choice)
As there is substantial increased risk of cancer with Barrett's esophagus, a regular follow-up with endoscopy and biopsy is done. This allows detection of cancer at an early stage with improved long-term survival after resection
In the absence of dysplasia → Surveillance endoscopy every 12-24 months.
In the presence of low-grade dysplasia →

Patients with low grade dysplasia should be treated for 12 weeks with high-dose acid suppression therapy and then biopsy repeated. (the rationale for this approach is to decrease the mucosal inflammation by blocking acid secretion, allowing the pathologist a more accurate reading),If the repeated biopsy show metaplasia or high-grade dysplasia, the patient should be managed accordingly. If repeated low-grade dysplasia is seen- surveillance endoscopy is done every 6-12 months.

If high grade dysplasia is detected (the diagnosis must be confirmed by two experienced pathologist) → esophagectomy with removal of all columnar lined epithelium

or
if resection is not done, then the patient should be strictly followed at 3 monthly interval. If cancer is detected resection is done.
Rationale for esophagectomy in high grade dysplasia is based on the following considerations-
(a) cancer is already present in about 30 to 50% of patients operated for high grade dysplasia.
(b) cancer develops in about 50% fo patients during follow up.)",B

Drugs for paralytic ileus for bowel resection surgery are all except ?,Alvinopam,Dihydroergotamine,Naloxone,Methylnaltrexone,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Naloxone Pharmacologic Management of Post op paralytic ileus (P01): Minimizing the sympathetic inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, decreasing inflammation and stimulation of gastrointestinal 11-opioid receptors are the ultimate goals of pharmacologic management. A) Minimizing sympathetic inhibition Both propranolol, a nonspecific 13-receptor antagonist, and dihydroergotamine, an a-receptor antagonist, have been investigated for treatment of POI. Neostigmine is an acetylcholinsterase inhibitor that causes an increase in cholinergic (parasympathetic) activity in the gut wall, which is believed to thereby stimulate colonic motility. Use of edrophonium chloride and bethanechol chloride, which competitively inhibit acetylcholine on the binding site of acetylcholinesterase, has been repoed to show improvement of POI. Cisapride is a serotonin (5-HT)4 receptor antagonist that promotes acetylcholine release from postganglionic nerve endings in the myenteric plexus and is thought to indirectly improve gastrointestinal motility. Metocloprimide is suspected to enhance gastrointestinal motility without stimulating gastric secretion, but its use has not been substantiated for POI. B) Decreasing inflammation Decreasing inflammation may be indicated in patients who are about to undergo major intestinal surgery, as this is thought to be an impoant contributing factor to POI. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) agents can be used in conjunction with opioid analgesics for their dual effects on pain control and inflammatory inhibition. C) Stimulation of gastrointestinal iii-opioid receptors Stimulation of gastrointestinal .1-opioid receptors can theoretically influence gastrointestinal motility directly; therefore, blocking the peripheral gastrointestinal effects of centrally acting opioids used for analgesia may help prevent POI. Two novel drugs are being investigated for this reason: alvimopan and methylnaltrexone. Both drugs are If-opioid receptor antagonists, and both appear to offer promising results for preventing prolonged POI. Opioid therapy for postoperative or chronic pain is frequently associated with adverse effects, the most common being dose-limiting and debilitating bowel dysfunction, so alvimopan and methylnaltrexone may also be useful in the treatment of chronic opioid bowel dysfunction. The currently available opioid antagonists such as naloxone are of limited use because they also act at central opioid receptors to reverse analgesia and elicit opioid withdrawal. Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone are peripherally acting if-opioid receptor antagonists that have been studied in patients undergoing abdominal and pelvic surgery and have been shown in several studies to significantly accelerate gastrointestinal recovery. Alvimopan received FDA approval for the treatment of POI on May 20, 2008. D) Alternative medications Bisacodyl administration versus placebo twice daily staing on postoperative day 1, patients who received bisacodyl had significantly earlier bowel movements than those who received placebo (25 h v. 56 h), but fuher studies are needed to assess the effect of laxatives on POI.",C

"In order to expose the coeliac axis, left renal aery, superior mesenteric aery and abdominal aoa in a case of trauma, which of the following is performed :",Left medial visceral rotation,Right medial visceral rotation,Cranial visceral rotation,Caudal visceral rotation,"Left medial visceral rotation Repeat from Nov 06 The major abdominal vessels are retroperitoneal structures that lie posterior to the contents of peritoneal sac & close to the midline. The vessels which are notoriously difficult to expose are: retrohepatic vena cava, suprarenal aoa; the coeliac axis; the proximal superior mesentric aery; the junction of the superior mesentric, splenic and poal veins and the bifurcation of the vena cava. Rapid exposure of these vessels can be accomplished during abdominal trauma by following maneuvers: - The principle behind visceral rotation is to rotate the viscera of one side towards the midline after freeing their lateral peritoneal attachments so as to expose the vessels of that side A left medial visceral rotation (Mattox maneuver) provides excellent exposure of the aoa, coeliac axis, superior mesentric aery, left renal aery and iliac aeries. A right medial visceral rotation (Catell maneuver) readily exposes the vena cava (with a combined Kocher maneuver), right renal vessels and iliac veins. The infrarenal aoa may be approached a transperitoneal incision at the base of the mesocolon. The junction of the superior mesentric, splenic and poal veins can be readily exposed in trauma surgery by dividing the neck of the pancreas. The bifurcation of the vena cava is obscured by the right common iliac aery. This vessel is to be divided to expose extensive vena caval injuries of this area.",A

All are true regarding kaposi sarcoma except one ?,Predominent in male,Multicentric origin,Chemotherapy is treatment of choice,Occurs in AIDS pt only,"Ans is 'd' ie Occurs in AIDS pt. only There are at least 4 distinct epidemiological forms of Kaposi's sarcoma, only one form is associated with AIDS. * The 4 distinct forms are ? 1) The classic form - that occurs in older men of predominantly Mediterranian or Eastern European, Jewish backgrounds. 2) Equatorial African form - that occurs in all ages. 3) The form associated with organ transplantation 4) The form associated with HIV-I infection. Kaposi's Sarcoma (K.S.) Kaposi's Sarcoma is a multicentric neoplasm consisting of multiple vascular nodules appearing in the skin, mucous memb and lymph nodes, lung, GIT etc. Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, paicularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon) Course ranges from indolent with only minor skin or lymph node involvement to fulminant with extensive cutaneous and visceral involvement. AIDS related kaposi's sarcoma occurs predominantly in homosexual men (96%) K.S. does not result from a neoplastic transformation of cells in the classic sense and so is not truly a sarcoma. It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin. it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K.S. is believed to be d/t occurence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis. Though K.S. is an oppuunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike oppounistic infection, its occurance is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIV inf even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count. Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all forms of KS (in all the 4 types) In constrast to most maligancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in KS. and is of no clinical significance. Management of KS associated with HIV In the majority of cases, effective ARV therapy is quite helpful in achieving control. Spontaneous regressions have been repoed in the setting of HAA. For patients in whom tumor persists or in whom control of HIV replication is not possible options exist. Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances. 1) For a single lesion or a limited number of lesions causing significant discomfo or cosmetic problems localized radiation, intralesional vinblastine, or cryotherapy 2) For large number of lesions or visceral invlovement Systemic therapies, either IFN- or chemotherapy is considered Interferon- IFN provides an added advantage of having ARV activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease. Chemotherapy- Three of the chemotherapeutic agent that have been approved by the FDA for KS are: - liposomal daunorubicin, - liposomal doxorubicin, and - paclitaxel Liposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS. The single most impoant determinant of response appears to be the CD4+ T cell count.",D

Which of the following should be administered preoperatively?,High-purity factor VIII: C concentrates,Low-molecular-weight dextran,Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP),Cryoprecipitate,"Von Willebrand disease is similar to true hemophilia in frequency of occurrence. It is being diagnosed more commonly today because of more reliable assays for factor VIII. This autosomal dominant disorder (recessive transmission can occur) is characterized by a diminution in factor VIII: C (procoagulant) activity. The reduction in activity is not as great as in classic hemophilia, and the clinical manifestations are more subtle. These manifestations are often overlooked until an episode of trauma or surgery makes them apparent. Treatment requires correcting the bleeding time and providing factor VIII R: WF (the von Willebrand factor). Only cryoprecipitate is reliably effective. High-purity factor VIII: C concentrates, effective in hemophilia, lack the von Willebrand factor and are consequently undependable",D

All the following are true about Meckel's diverticulum except-,Bleeding,Intussusception,Arises at the mesentric border,Located 60 cm from the cecal valve,"Meckel's diverticulum is situated at the anti-mesenteric border of the small intestine.

Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all the 3 layers of the intestine.
It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract.
Male to female ratio is 3 : 2.
Approximately 60% of Meckel's diverticula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are ­colonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue.
A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diverticula is

Rule of two: i.e. 

2% prevalence
2 inch in length
2 feet proximal to the ilcocecal valve.
half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age
Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs.

Complications
Most common complication

in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) → bleeding
in adults → intestinal obstruction
overall → bleeding
Following complications are noted in Meckel's diverticulum.

Bleeding

bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum.

Intestinal obstruction
Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms.

Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus
Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point.
Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (the Mesodiverticular band is a remnant of the left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentery.)
Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis.

Diverticulitis

clinical picture is similar to appendicitis.
diverticulitis may lead to perforation.
Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in an inguinal or a femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia.


Diagnostic studies

Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention.
Barium meal follows through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during the acute presentation of complication.
If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium99 pertechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diverticulum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to Meckel's diverticula.",C

The clinical presentation of a mucocele is nonspecific, and often it is an incidental finding at operation for acute appendicitis. An intact mucocele presents no future risk for the patient; however, rupture may lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei or mucinous carcinomatosis of appendiceal origin Every effo is made to keep the mucocele intact during extraction, including placing the specimen in a bag and conveing a laparoscopic procedure to open. Management of Mucocele: Includes resection of the appendix, plus wide resection of the mesoappendix to include all the appendiceal lymph nodes, collection and cytologic examination of all intraperitoneal mucus, and careful inspection of the base of the appendix.

Therefore, hypotension may not be observed, and neither are the other signs of circulatory inadequacy that are typical of isotonic or hypotonic dehydration. Signs suggesting involvement of the central nervous system (such as irritability or lethargy) are characteristic of hypeonic dehydration. Slow correction of this hypernatremia (over 24 to 48 h) prevents significant fluid shifts and increased intercranial pressure. Initial bolus therapy should be with isotonic fluid such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. Blood products such as fresh-frozen plasma are not indicated, and hypotonic solutions such as D10W and 1/4 NS could cause rapid fluid shifts, resulting in cerebral edema and death.

"Vimal, a 70 years old male presents with a h/o lower GI bleed for last 6 months. Sigmoidoscopic examination shows a mass, of 4 cms about 3.5 cms above the anal verge. The treatment of choice is ?",Colostomy,Anterior resection,Abdominoperineal resection,Defunctioning anastomosis,"Ans. is 'c' ie. Abdominoperineal resection Treatment of rectal cancer Surgical and oncologic management varies greatly depending on the stage and location of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as Low anterior resection (LAR) or APR. a) Low anterior resection: This is sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper 2/3'd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower 1/3 rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesion but above the dentate line. (some books write that even 1cm margin can be adequate, but provided the carcinoma is well differentiated) Devito Oncology writes- ""Tumors within 1 to 2 cm of the dentate line, that is those that can be removed with at least a 1-cm distal margin, can be resected and intestinal continuity restored with a coloanal azzastomosis."" b) Abdominoperineal resection (also k/a Miles procedure) : There is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of a permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for low anterior resection cannot be obtained i.e. for carcinomas in lower rectum. c) Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transanal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Transanal excision can spare the patient the morbidity of a more extensive rectal resection. However, it does not stage the nodal drainage areas and therefore cannot provide as complete staging and management of the tumor as a definitive resection. Tumors considered for local excision must meet a number of criteria to minimize the risk of local regional recurrence. Devita's Oncology writes- ""Generally, local excision is limited to tumors within 8 to 10 cm of the anal verge, encompass less than 40% of circumference of the bowel wall, are of well or moderately well differentiated histology, and have no pathological evidence of venous or lymphatic vessel invasion on biopsy."" Various technical approaches have been described to achieve transanal local excision, including use of a special proctoscope equipped with a magnifying camera (transanal endoscopic microsurgery). Transanal endoscopic microsurgery makes use of a specially designed proctoscope, magnifying system, and instruments similar to those used in laparoscopy to allow local excision of lesions higher in the proximal rectum. d) Palliative procedures: Unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulgration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. e) Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Also know: Haman's procedure This is a compromise type of resection in which the rectum and/or sigmoid colon are resected and an end colostomy done. Anastomosis and perineal dissection of the distal rectum and perineum are not done. This procedure is used - if there is too much obstruction or sepsis to allow a safe anastomosis. - for elderly or severly unstable pts. who would not stand a lengthy ant resesction or an APR procedure. In this pt. the tumor lies 3.5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is 2 cm from the anal verge (Ref: Devito Oncology 8/e), so this lesion is just about 1.5 cm above the dentate line. A minimum margin of 2 cm is required below the tumor for sphincter saving LAR, so this patient will have to go an APR procedure to remove the tumor.",C

They should be warned that normal contraceptive precautions should continue until the success of the operation is confirmed by semen analysis performed 12-16 weeks after surgery. They should also be warned of the possibility of spontaneous recanalisation, which may restore feility unexpectedly and of the possibility of chronic testicular pain that may occur in up to 5% of men. Vasectomy is easily and painlessly performed under local anaesthetic. The vasa are delivered through tiny bilateral scrotal incisions or through a single midline scrotal incision. For medico-legal reasons it is wise to remove a segment of each vas to prove that it has been successfully divided. Burying the cut ends, fascial interposition or turning them back on themselves helps to prevent them rejoining. Reversal of vasectomy may not restore feility even if the surgery is technically successful because of damage to the testis secondary to the vasectomy. Although patency rates of 80% or more are commonly repoed, successful feility rates are much lower, and diminish with increasing delay from the time of vasectomy.

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas?,Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Microcystic adenoma Mucinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (approx 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mutinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA ( Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference from IPMN where tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",A

Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax or pancreatitis. An elevated serum amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.

In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in ""emergency airways management"". - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative.

What is ideal time for Preoxygenation?,3-5 min,1- 3min,5-8 min,2-3 min,"Preoxygenation entails replacement of the nitrogen volume of the lung (as much as 95% of FRC) with oxygen in order to provide a reservoir for diffusion into the alveolar capillary blood after the onset of apnea. To provide effective preoxygenation, a methodical approach is necessary. The impoance of preoxygenation with a tight-fitting mask should be explained to the patient beforehand. Once preoxygenation is initiated, EtO2 and FIO2 values should be monitored closely. If the EtO2 value does not increase as expected, the anesthesia provider may have to hold the mask with both hands and/or replace the mask with a better-fitting one. Whenever possible, the induction should not sta until the EtO2 value approximates or exceeds 90%.. the ideal time period is 3 minutes.",A

Index of potency of general anaesthesia -,Minimum alveolar concentration,Diffusion coefficient,Dead space concentration,Alveolar blood concentration,"Minimum alveolar concentration is defined as the alveolar concentration of an inhaled anesthetic agent that prevents movement in 50% of patients in response to a standardized surgical stimulus. The MAC of a volatile substance is inversely propoional to its lipid solubility (oil: gas coefficient), in most cases. This is the Meyer-Oveon hypothesis put forward in 1899-1901 by Hans Horst Meyer and Charles Ernest Oveon. MAC is inversely related to potency, i.e. high MAC equals low potency. MAC values of adult Halothane: 0.75 Sevoflurane: 2.0 Isoflurane: 1.2 Desflurane: 6.0 Enflurane: 1.7 Xenon: 70 N2O: 104 Factors affecting: MAC increases with hypehermia, hypernatremia, and redheads. MAC decreases with anemia, hypercarbia, hypoxia, hypothermia, hypotension (MAP < 40 mmHg), and pregnancy. Medications, illicit drugs, and prior substance use history have also been found to affect MAC. For example, acute use of amphetamines, cocaine, ephedrine, and chronic use of alcohol increase MAC. Whereas, administration of propofol, etomidate, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ketamine, opiates, local anesthetics, lithium, verapamil, and alpha 2-agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine) decrease MAC. Acute alcohol intoxication and chronic amphetamine use have also been found to decrease MAC. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Haemodynamicaly unstable patient with blunt trauma to abdomen and suspected liver injury; which of the following is the first investigation performed in the emergency room?,FAST,CT Scan,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage,Standing X ray Abdomen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., FAST * The patient has gunshot injury to the right upper quadrant of abdomen, mostly damaging the liver.General: Liver trauma* The liver is the second most common organ injured in abdominal trauma.* Liver trauma can be divided into blunt and penetrating injuries.* Blunt injury produces contusion, laceration and avulsion injuries to the liver, often in association with splenic, mesenteric or renal injury.* Penetrating injuries, such as stab and gunshot wounds, are often associated with chest or pericardial involvement.* Blunt injuries are more common and have a higher mortality than penetrating injuries.Diagnosis of liver injury:* The liver is an extremely well-vascularised organ, and blood loss is therefore the major early complication of liver injuries.* Clinical suspicion of a possible liver injury is essential, as a laparotomy by an inexperienced surgeon with inadequate preparation preoperatively is doomed to failure.* All lower chest and upper abdominal stab wounds should be suspect, especially if considerable blood volume replacement has been required.* Similarly, severe crushing injuries to the lower chest or upper abdomen often combine rib fractures, haemothorax and damage to the spleen and/or liver.* Focused assessment sonography in trauma (FAST) performed in the emergency room by an experienced operator can reliably diagnose free intraperitoneal fluid.* Patients with free intraperitoneal fluid on FAST and haemodynamic instability, and patients with a penetrating wound will require a laparotomy and/or thoracotomy once active resuscitation is under way.* Owing to the opportunity for massive ongoing blood loss and the rapid development of a coagulopathy, the patient should be directly transferred to the operating theatre while blood products are obtained and volume replacement is taking place.* Patients who are haemodynamically stable should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest and abdomen as the next step.* Additional investigations that may be of value include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, which can confirm the presence of haemoperitoneum, but this is rarely performed nowadays due to inceased use of FAST and CT.Initial management:* The initial management is maintenance of airway patency, breathing and circulation (ABC) following the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS).* Peripheral venous access is gained with two large-bore cannulae and blood sent for crossmatch of ten units of blood, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, clotting screen, glucose and amylase.* Initial volume replacement should be with colloid or O-negative blood if necessary. Arterial blood gases should be obtained and the patient intubated and ventilated if the gas exchange is inadequate.* Intercostal chest drains should be inserted if associated pneumothorax or haemothorax is suspected. Once initial resuscitation has commenced, the patient should be transferred to the operating theatre, with further resuscitation performed on the operating table.* The necessity for fresh-frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate should be discussed with the blood transfusion service immediately the patient arrives, as these patients rapidly develop irreversible coagulopathies due to a lack of fibrinogen and clotting factors.* Standard coagulation profiles are inadequate to evaluate this acute loss of clotting factors, and factors should be given empirically, aided by the results of thromboelastography (TEG), if available.* A contrast CT prior to laparotomy should be considered if the patient is haemodynamically stable.",A

"A 24 year old patient suffered from 3rd degree burn of right upper limb, 2nd degree burns of right lower limb and 1st degree burn of whole of the back. Total percentage of burn will be?",27%,36%,45%,54%,"ANSWER: (A)27% REF: Sabiston 18th e chapter 22 Burn size is generally assessed by the so-called rule of nines. In adults, each upper extremity and the head and neck are 9% of TBSA (total body surface area), the lower extremities and the anterior and posterior aspects of the trunk are 18% each, and the perineum and genitalia are assumed to be 1% of TBSA. Degree of burn has nothing to do with calculation of percentage of burns. However different degrees of burns can be allotted their respective shares; for example a total of 27% burns as in this case can be said as 9% of 3rd degree + 18% of 2nd degree Note that- 1st degree burns are not considered in calculating the total area of burns in adults. However in children and infants, 1st degree burns are taken into consideration.",A

When history of allergy is unceain, an antihistamine such as diphenhydrarnine injected directly into the wound can be used as an alternative and achieves anesthesia in approximately 30 mm. * True allergic reactions to local anesthetics are rare, especially to aminoamide compounds such as lidocaine and bupivicaine. The ester derivatives of paraaminobenzoic acid, such as procaine, are responsible for most local anesthetic allergic reactions. * Toxicity should be suspected in patients who complain of dizziness, tinnitus, and periorbital tingling. Rarely, systemic convulsions follow. * These are usually self-limited because of rapid redistribution of the drug, with resultant lower serum levels.",C

Local anesthesia acts by blockage of -,Na+ channel,Ca++ channel],K+ channel,Mg++ channel,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na+ channel Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contactr without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted.o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :RecoveryResting (close)-Active (open)-Inactive (open) LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na"" channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only wrhen the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad> Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

Which of the following is the main mechanism by which the mechlorethamine exes its cell killing?,"Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands",Blocking microtubular assembly and mitosis during M-phase,"Inhibiting topoisomerase, preventing repair of DNA strand breaks","Intercalating in DNA strands, there by preventing DNA replication by Mrna","Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands Vincristine and the other vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin and impair microtubular assembly, preventing mitosis (M-phase-specific). Mechlorethamine, like cyclophosphamide (and carmustine and several others), is an alkylating agent. They are called bifunctional alkylating agents because they can covalently bind to DNA in two places (""nucleophilic attack""), thereby forming cross-links between two adjacent strands or between two bases in one strand. This ultimately disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis or may cause strand breakage. Cyclophosphamide (which can be considered the prototype of the alkylating agents) is actually a pro- drug--it requires metabolic activation in order for its effects to occur. Cyclophosphamide (and other alkylating agents) are cell cycle-nonspecific, although their efficacy is greater when cells are not in G0.Bleomycin, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are good examples of drugs that intercalate in DNA strands. Thus, the altered DNA no longer serves as an adequately precise template for eventual synthesis of more functional DNA and RNA. They are classified as antitumor antibiotics. Etoposide and topotecan are examples of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase 11. The consequence is inhibited ability of affected cells to repair DNA strand breaks. This stops the cell cycle in G2 - The taxoid (e.g., paclitaxel) impairs mitosis, but by stabilizing assembled microtubules rather than by exeing a vinca alkaloid-like inhibition of microtubular assembly.",A

Almost all cases present in infancy and childhood. Approximately half are diagnosed in the neonatal period and most of the remainder are diagnosed in early childhood. Schwartz and (9/e p1056) Bailey (24/e, p 1154) write that Hirschprung's ds. can present in adults too.
Schwartz writes- ""Although Hirschsprung's disease is primarily a disease of infants and children, it occasionally presents later in adulthood, especially if an extremely short segment of the bowel is affected (ultrashort-segment Hirschsprung's disease).""
In the newborn period, most common symptoms are abdominal distention and failure to pass meconium.
Older patients may experience chronic or intermittent constipation.
Occasionally, infants may present with a dramatic complication of Hirschprung's disease called enterocolitis.
Surgery is always required. The basic principle is removal of most or all of the aganglionic segment and anastomosing the ganglionic bowel to the rectum

Amnio- centesis involves obtaining a sample of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal fibroblasts. Chorionic villus sampling involves taking a biopsy of the placenta. In the case of PUBS, the umbilical vein is punctured under direct ultrasound guidance near the placental origin and blood is obtained for genetic analysis. Doppler velocimetry is an ultrasound technique used to examine blood flow through the umbilical aery. IUGR has been associated with abnormal umbilical aery Doppler velocimetry. Therefore, this technique is used with other modalities such as BPP and NSTS to monitor fetal wellbeing.",D

Commonest treatment of Branchial cyst,Cystectomy,Aspiration,Excision,Nothing done,"A branchial cyst probably develops from the vestigial remnants of the second branchial cleft, is usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. The cyst usually presents in the upper neck in early or middle adulthood and is found at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages so that it may be difficult to palpate. If the cyst becomes infected it becomes erythematous and tender and, on occasions, it may be difficult to differentiate from a tuberculous abscess. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration both aid diagnosis and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undeaken when the lesion is quiescent. Although the anterior aspect of the cyst is easy to dissect, it may pass backwards and upwards through the bifurcation of the common carotid. Bailey & Love,5th,727",C

Which of the following are the most likely sites for the primary tumor?,Colon or spleen,Liver or pancreas,Lung or bladder,Ovary or appendix,"This rare, but dramatic, condition is called pseudomyxoma peritonei, and is produced when a malignant or benign (spread by rupture into the peritoneal cavity rather than true metastasis) mucus producing tumor (mucinous cystadenoma or mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) produces gel-like mucus that fills the peritoneal cavity. The usual sites of origin of these tumors are ovary and appendix. The condition, even when benign, is difficult to treat because the mucus producing cells are spread all over the peritoneal lining, and cannot be effectively removed.

"A 45-year-old male presents with 4x4 cm, mobile right solitary thyroid nodule of 5 months duration. The patient is euthyroid. The following statements about his management are true except -",Cold nodule on thyroid scan is diagnostic of malignancy,FNAC is the investigation of choice,The patient should undergo hemithyroidectomy if FNAC report is inconclusive,Indirect laryngoscopy should be done in the preoperative period to assess mobility of vocal cords.,"On isotope scanning, a thyroid nodule can be 'hot' 'warm' or 'cold'.
Hot - a hot nodule is one that takes up isotope, while the surrounding thyroid tissue is inactive because the hot nodule is producing such high levels of thyroid hormones that TSH secretion is suppressed.
Warm nodule - a warm nodule takes up isotope and so does normal thyroid tissue around it.
Cold nodule - it takes up no isotope.

The cold nodules carry a higher risk for malignancy. But a 'cold' nodule does not necessarily mean malignant. Only 20% of cold nodules turn out to be malignant, and about 5% of hot nodules can be malignant. Thus routine isotope scanning is no longer used to distinguish benign from malignant.
FNAC is the investigation of choice for a solitary thyroid nodule.
The finding of a malignant diagnosis on FNAC is associated with a high accuracy rate (-100%), but the false negative rate of FNAC is high (1-6%). Thus benign nodules should be kept under observation. An inconclusive FNA needs aggressive management. A repeat FNA is done. If still inconclusive, the pt. can be kept under observation if risk factors are low. Alternatively, if risk factors are high as in the present case, the pt. can undergo hemithyroidectomy to remove the nodule and sent for histopathology. Age and underlying medical condition are also taken into consideration while deciding the course of management.

Important points about Congenital PELT obstruction 

Cong. PUJ obstruction is the most common cause of significant dilatation of the collecting system in the fetal kidney.
Incidence is more in boys (2:1)
Usually unilateral but bilateral in 10-40% of cases (I could not find 10-15% of cases, but option 'C' can be taken as correct, weighing it against option D)
More common in left side
Associated anomalies -



Renal dysplasia
Multicystic dysplastic kidney
Renal agenesis

(Cambell urology writes - ""Unilateral renal agenesis has been noted in almost 5% of children"")

Vescico - ureteric reflux
PUJ obstruction was noted in 21% of children with the VATER group of anomalies


(VATER stands for vertebral defects, imperforate anus, tracheoesophageal fistula, radial and renal dysplasia)
Most common presentation of cong. PUJ obstruction is asymptomatic. Cambell writes - "" Now the almost
universal use of prenatal sonography has made discovery of PUJ obstruction a common occurance""

Diagnostic tools -

Majority of cases are diagnosed prenatally with the help of ultrasound.
Whitaker test (pressure - flow studies) can be used to find out obstruction to flow of urine,
In whitaker test catheters are placed in renal pelvis and bladder. Fluid is infused into the kidney and the pressures are measured. A differential pressure between kidney and bladder could then be indicative of obstruction to the flow.
Retrograde pyelography can be useful to locate the site of obstruction.

Surgical repair

Congenital PUJ obstruction are corrected by either-open surgical techniques or -endoscopic and laparascopic approaches
Out of the 'open' techniques the Anderson- Hynes Dismembered Pyeloplasty is the most commonly employed technique.
Endoscopic approaches include,
endoscopic pyelotomy
ballon dilatation

Which of the following anesthetic agent causes dissociative anesthesia:-,Thiopentone,Propofol,Ketamine,Etomidate,"Ketamine produces dose-dependent CNS depression leading to a so-called dissociative anesthetic state characterized by profound analgesia and amnesia, even though patient is conscious and maintains protective reflexes. Ketamine produces dissociative anesthesia through antagonistic actions at thephencyclidinesite of theNMDARmediated glutamatergic input to the GABA-ergic system. Dissociative anesthesia is a state where the patient appears conscious (eg, eye opening, swallowing, muscle contracture) but unable to process or respond to sensory input.

"An in-hospital workup of a 78-year-old hypeensive, mildly asthmatic man who is receiving chemotherapy for colon cancer reveals symptomatic gallstones. Preoperative laboratory results are notable for a hematocrit of 24% and urinalysis with 18 to 25 WBCs and gram-negative bacteria. On call to the operating room, the patient receives intravenous penicillin. His abdomen is shaved in the operating room. An open cholecystectomy is performed and, despite a lack of indications, the common bile duct is explored. The wound is closed primarily with a Penrose drain exiting a separate stab wound. On postoperative day 3, the patient develops a wound infection. Which of the following changes in the care of this patient could have decreased the chance of a postoperative wound infection?",Increasing the length of the preoperative hospital stay to prophylactically treat the asthma with steroids,Treating the urinary infection prior to surgery,Shaving the abdomen the night prior to surgery,Continuing the prophylactic antibiotics for 3 postoperative days,"The determinants of a postoperative wound infection include factors predetermined by the status of the patient (eg, age, obesity, steroid dependence, multiple diagnoses , immunosuppression) and by the type of procedure (eg, contaminated versus clean, emergent versus elective). However, there are several factors that can be optimized by the surgeon. Decreasing the bacterial inoculum and virulence by limiting the patient's prehospital stay, clipping the operative site in the operating room, administering perioperative antibiotics (within a 24-hour period surrounding operation) with an appropriate antimicrobial spectrum, treating remote infections, avoiding breaks in technique, using closed drainage systems (if needed at all) that exit the skin away from the surgical incision, and minimizing the duration of the operation have all been shown to decrease postoperative infection. Making a wound less orable to infection requires attention to basic Halstedian principles of hemostasis, anatomic dissection, and gentle handling of tissues as well as limiting the amount of foreign body and necrotic tissue in the wound. Although they are the most difficult factors to influence, host defense mechanisms can be improved by optimizing nutritional status, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery.",B

Commonest complication of parenteral nutrition includes all except: March 2007,Hyperglycemia,Hyperkalemia,Hyperosmolar dehydration,Azotemia,"Ans. B: Hyperkalemia Parenteral nutrition is indicated to prevent the adverse effects of malnutrition in patients who are unable to obtain adequate nutrients by oral or enteral routes. Other indications are sho gut syndrome, high-output fistula, prolonged ileus, or bowel obstruction. Sho-term TPN may be used if a person's digestive system has shut down (for instance by Peritonitis. Chronic TPN is performed through a central intravenous catheter, usually in the subclan or jugular vein. In infants, sometimes the umbilical vein is used. Complications: Catheter complications include pneumothorax, accidental aerial puncture, and catheter-related sepsis. The most common complication of TPN use is bacterial infection, usually due to the increased infection risk from having an indwelling central venous catheter. Liver failure / reversible cholestatic jaundice, often related to Fatty liver, may occur. Two related complications of TPN are venous thrombosis and rarely priapism. Fat infusion during TPN is assumed to contribute to both. Total parenteral nutrition increases the risk of acute cholecystitis due to complete unusage of gastrointestinal tract, which may result in bile stasis in the gallbladder. Metabolic complications include the Refeeding Syndrome characterised by hypophosphataemia and other electrolyte abnormalities. Nutrients deficiency: hypoglycemia/ hypocalcemia/ hypomagnesemia are also seen. Hyperglycemia is common at the sta of therapy, and hypoglycaemia is likely to occur with abrupt cessation of TPN. Hyperosmolar dehydration is also associated with excesss of glucose. Excess fat leads to hyperchlosterolemia and formation of lipoprotein X and hyperiglyceridemia.

D: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis resolves after total colectomy Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a form of cholangitis due to an autoimmune reaction. Primary sclerosing cholangitis leads to cholestasis. Blockage of the bile duct leads to accumulation of bile, which damages the liver, leading to jaundice and eventually causes liver failure. Signs and symptoms Tiredness (a non-specific symptom often present in liver disease) Severe jaundice with intense itching. Malabsorption (especially of fat) and steatorrhea, leading to decreased levels of the fat-soluble vitamins, A, D, E and K. Signs of cirrhosis Ascending cholangitis? The diagnosis is by imaging of the bile duct, usually in the setting of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which shows characteristic changes (""beading"") of the bile ducts. Another option is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The differential diagnosis can include primary biliary cirrhosis, drug induced cholestasis, cholangiocarcinoma, and HIV-associated cholangiopathy. PSC is often listed as a manifestation of ulcerative colitis outside the colon. PSC differs from these manifestations in that, unlike most other manifestations, PSC continues in spite of surgical removal of the colon. Standard treatment includes ursodiol. Treatment also includes medication to relieve itching (antipruritics) and bile acid sequesterants (cholestyramine) etc.",D

"Increased lipolysis of fat stores, which can result from starvation, diabetesmellitus, or coicosteroid use, is most likely to cause steatosis (fattyliver) through which one of the listed mechanisms?",Decreased free fatty acid excretion from the liver leads to free fatty acid accumulation in hepatocytes,"Excess NADH (high NADH/NAD ratio) causes excess production of lactate from pyruvate, which accumulates in hepatocytes",Increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver leads to triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes,Inhibition of apoprotein synthesis by the liver leads to phospholipid accumulation in hepatocytes,"Free fatty acids are normally taken up by the liver and esterified to triglyceride, conveed to cholesterol, oxidized into ketone bodies, or incorporated into phospholipids that can be excreted from the liver as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Abnormalities involving any of these normal metabolic pathways may lead to the accumulation of triglycerides within the hepatocytes. This accumulation of triglycerides is called fatty change or steatosis. Examples of abnormalities that produce hepatic steatosis include diseases that cause excess delivery of free fatty acids to the liver or diseases that cause impaired lipoprotein synthesis. Excess delivery of free fatty acids occurs in conditions that increase lipolysis of adipose tissue, such as starvation, diabetes mellitus, and coicosteroid use. Increased formation of triglycerides can result from alcohol use, as alcohol causes excess NADH formation (high NADH/NAD ratio), increases fatty acid synthesis, and decreases fatty acid oxidation. Impaired apoprotein synthesis occurs with carbon tetrachloride poisoning, phosphorous poisoning, and protein malnutrition. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity is the mechanism of lovastatin, which indirectly increases liver LDL receptors and increases LDL clearance from the blood.",C

Diagnosis of traumatic rupture of diaphragma) Laparoscopyb) Chest X rayc) Diagnostic peritoneal lavaged) IPPV,ab,a,ad,bc,"• Diaphragmatic injuries are often caused by penetrating injuries.
• Patients sustaining penetrating injuries below the nipples and above the costal margins should be investigated to rule out diaphragmatic injury.
Etiology
• Penetrating trauma (knife, bullet, repair of hiatus hernia)
• Blunt trauma (motor vehicle accident, fall from height, bout of hyperemesis):
−− Caused by compressive force applied to the pelvis and abdomen.
−− Rupture is usually large, with herniation of abdominal content into chest
Clinical Features
• Most diaphragmatic injuries are silent and the presenting features are those of injury to the surrounding organs.
• Late complication: Herniation of abdominal contents in to the chest.
• Herniation of organ: Stomach >Colon >Small intestine >Omentum >Spleen >Kidney and pancreas.
Diagnosis
• There is no single standard investigation to diagnose diaphragmatic injuries.
• Chest X-ray after placement of a nasogastric tube may be helpful (as this may show the stomach herniated into the chest)
• Contrast study of upper or lower GIT, CT scan and diagnostic peritoneal lavage all lack positive or negative predictive value.
• Most accurate evaluation is by video assisted thracoscopy (VATS) or laparoscopy, offering the advantage of allowing the surgeon to proceed to repair and additional evaluation of the abdominal organs.
Treatment
• Operative repair is recommended in all cases.
• All penetrating diaphragmatic injury must be repaired via the abdomen and not the chest, to rule out penetrating hollow viscus injury.

Use of this balanced salt solution helps correct the fluid deficit (in the extracellular, extravascular compartment) resulting from hypovolemic shock. This procedure may decrease requirements for whole blood in patients with hemorrhagic shock. If blood loss has been minimal and is controlled, whole blood transfusion may be avoided entirely. The theoretical objection to infusion of lactated Ringer's solution is that it will increase lactate levels and compound the problem of lactic acidosis. This has not been borne out in animal or clinical studies. Along with the hemodynamic improvement that follows volume restitution, liver function improves, lactate metabolism is improved, excess lactate levels drop, and metabolic acidosis improves.",C

NaHCO3 NaHCO3 has been routinely used in the treatment of hyperkalemia. It was believed that NaHCO3 caused movement of potassium inside the cells by causing alkalosis. But studies do not suppo this - They claim that NaHCO3 do not cause movement of potassium inside the cells in acute cases of hyperkalemia. - It only decreases potassium when there is coexisting acidosis. - NaHCO3 can decrease potassium level in chronic hyperkalemia. It increases potassium delivery to the kidney. But the use of NaHCO3 still continues in most hospitals and institutes across the world. - It is now hypothesized that NaHCO3 does not cause r entry inside the cell by mechanism earlier believed to he, but by another mechanism. The question does not say anything about acidosis. Don't think that acidosis occurs only in severe hyperkalemia. Most patients with C.R.F. present with acidosis and mild moderate hyperkalemia.

Venous Air Embolism is common in which position,Sitting,Supine,Prone,Left lateral,"(A) Sitting # Venous air embolism (VAE), the entry of gas into the peripheral or central vasculature, can occur secondary to iatrogenic complications, trauma, and even certain recreational activities.> VAE results when a large bolus of air entering the venous system can cause an air lock in the right atrium and ventricle, leading to outflow obstruction, decreased pulmonary venous return, and subsequent decreased left ventricular preload and cardiac output.> Pathogenesis of pulmonary endothelial injury may have components of platelet-fibrin thrombi from the right ventricle, cytokine release, neutrophil, platelet, and complement activation at the microvascular air-blood interface, and injury mediated by lipid peroxidation and oxygen radicals.> Physical examination may reveal the following signs: Tachycardia Tachypnea Cyanosis Altered level of consciousness Hypotension Cardiac ""mill wheel"" murmur-A loud, churning, machinery like murmur heard over the precordium (a late sign) Sudden loss of consciousness followed by convulsion in an intubated patient on positive-pressure ventilation Circulatory shock or sudden death (patients with severe VAE)> CAUSES:1. Primary cause of VAE is surgical procedures, especially neurosurgical procedures performed in the upright, sitting position. Anytime the operative site is more than 5 cm above the right atrium, VAE is a risk. Other surgical procedures that can lead to the infusion of air include obstetric/gynecologic procedures (cesarean section), craniofacial surgery, dental implant surgery, vascular procedures, liver transplantation, and orthopedic procedures (e.g., hip replacement, arthroscopy). The frequency of reported VAE in surgical procedures ranges from 10% in cervical laminectomy up to 80% in posterior fossa surgery.2. Second cause of VAE is iatrogenic creation of a pressure gradient for air entry. Examples include spinal needles in lumbar punctures (case report), peripheral intravenous lines, central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, hemodialysis catheters, and long-term (Hickman) catheters. Most cases occur during catheter manipulation, disconnection, or removal. A pressure difference of 5 cm of H2O across a 14-gauge needle allows 100 ml of air per second to enter the venous system. The frequency of reported VAE with central catheter use ranges from 1 in 47 to 1 in 3000.3. A third cause of VAE is mechanical insufflation or infusion. Insufflation has been documented to occur during arthroscopic procedures, CO2 hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, urethral insufflation, and orogenital sexual activity during pregnancy. Infusion air entry can occur during the injection of contrast agents for CT scans, angiography, and cardiac catheterization, and during cardiac ablation procedures.4.

Which of the following statement is false: March 2007,Granulomatous inflammation is found in Crohn's disease.,Perianal lesions are common in Crohn's disease,Stricture involving the colon is found in ulcerative colitis,Fistula formation is common in Crohn's disease.,"Ans. C: Stricture involving the colon is found in ulcerative colitisCrohn's disease/regional enteritis) is an autoimmune disease, which can affect any pa of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus (terminal ileum is the area most commonly affected).Anal lesions are also commonThe disease is characterized by areas of inflammation with areas of normal lining between in a symptom known as skip lesions.Microscopy of Crohn's disease show focal areas of chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal walls.There are non-caseating granulomas, but these are found in only 60% of patients.The main gastrointestinal symptoms are:Abdominal pain may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. It is often accompanied by diarrhea, especially in those who have had surgery. The diarrhea may or may not be bloody.The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the pa of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency.Visible bleeding in the feces is less common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, but may be seen in the setting of Crohn's colitis.Although the association is greater in the context of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease may also be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitisPerianal discomfo may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the anus may be suggestive of inflammation, fistulization or abscess around the anal area or anal fissure.Crohn's disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloahropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (ahritis) or muscle inseions (enthesitis). Common complications of inflammation include scarring that can produce intestinal blockage (obstruction) and deep ulcers penetrating through the bowel wall that can create pus-filled pockets of infection (abscesses) or abnormal connecting channels between the intestine and other organs (fistulas).When the large intestine is affected extensively by Crohn's disease, rectal bleeding commonly occurs.After many years, the risk of colon cancer (cancer of the large intestine) is greatly increased.About one third of people who develop Crohn's disease have problems around the anus, especially fistulas and cracks (fissures) in the lining of the mucus membrane of the anus.Crohn's disease may lead to complications in other pas of the body. These complications include gallstones, inadequate absorption of nutrients, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and deposits of the protein amyloid in several organs (amyloidosis).A colonoscopy is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the terminal ileum, identifying the pattern of disease involvement. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata. The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms.It is impoant to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different.",C

Which would lead to an increase in hepatocyte synthesis of primary bile acids?,An injection of cholecystokinin,An ileal resection,Stimulation of the vagus nerve,Lovastatin,"The rate of synthesis of primary bile acids from cholesterol is inversely related to the rate at which bile acids are extracted from the hepatic poal blood and resecreted into the bile canaliculi. Therefore, an increase in the rate of synthesis occurs following ileal resection. Ileal resection decreases the ability to absorb bile acids from the small intestine and causes a decrease in enterohepatic recirculation of the bile acids. Therefore, secretion of new bile acids is increased.Injection of cholecystokinin or stimulation of the vagus nerve contract the gallbladder and relax the sphincter of Oddi, causing increased delivery of bile acids to the duodenum. These bile acids are absorbed in the ileum and returned to the liver in the hepatic poal blood. Therefore, synthesis of new bile acids is decreased. Lovastatin, which decreases the activity of 3 hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, decreases synthesis of cholesterol and, therefore, decreases the synthesis of bile acids. A decrease in dietary cholesterol would decrease the synthesis of primary bile acids.",B
"A 73-year-old woman with a long history of heavy smoking undergoes femoral aery-popliteal aery bypass for rest pain in her left leg.

An upper abdominal ultrasonogram reveals a dilated gallbladder, but no stones are seen. A presumptive diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis is made. Which of the following is the next best step in her treatment?",Nasogastric suction and broad-spectrum antibiotics,Immediate cholecystectomy with operative cholangiogram,Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to visualize and drain the common bile duct,"The development of acute postoperative cholecystitis is an increasingly recognized complication of the severe illnesses that precipitate admissions to the ICU. The causes are obscure but probably lead to a common final pathway of gallbladder ischemia. The diagnosis is often extremely difficult because the signs and symptoms may be those of occult sepsis. Moreover, the patients are often intubated, sedated, or confused as a consequence of the other therapeutic or medical factors. Biochemical tests, though frequently revealing abnormal liver function, are nonspecific and nondiagnostic. Bedside ultrasonography is usually strongly suggestive of the diagnosis when a thickened gallbladder wall or pericholecystic fluid is present; nonvisualization of the gallbladder on a nuclear medicine (HIDA) scan can also be diagnostic. If diagnosis is delayed, moality and morbidity are very high. Percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder is usually curative of acalculous cholecystitis and affords stabilizing palliation if calculous cholecystitis is present. Antibiotics without drainage are too cautious a choice for a patient with a potentially fatal complication. Operative intervention is indicated only if less invasive methods of treatment (percutaneous cholecystostomy tube) have failed, and ERCP is not indicated in the absence of ductal obstruction.",C

Symptoms or signs of atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta (Leriche syndrome) include,Claudication of the buttock and thigh,Causalgia of the lower leg,Retrograde ejaculation,Gangrene of the feet,"The slow progression of aortoiliac atherosclerotic occlusive disease is usually associated with the development of collateral flow through the lumbar branches of the aorta, anastomosing via retroperitoneal branches of the gluteal arteries with the profunda femoris arteries in the legs. This network of collateral vessels provides sufficient blood flow to nourish the extremities at rest but cannot prevent claudication of the upper and lower muscle groups of the leg during exercise. Sexual impotence, also part of the Leriche syndrome, is believed to be a result of bilateral stenosis or occlusion of the hypogastric (internal iliac) arteries. Retrograde ejaculation can occur after disruption of the sympathetic chain overlying the distal aorta and left iliac and can occur after dissection around these vessels during vascular reconstructions. Gangrene of the feet or toes is rarely seen unless distal embolization of atherosclerotic material from the aorta occludes the pedal or digital arteries. Dependent rubor is usually a sign of significant ischemia resulting from lower extremity occlusive and not aortoiliac disease.

Otolith organs are responsible for?,Producing the vestibular-ocular reflex,Detecting the position of the head in space,Producing rotary nystagmus,Detecting angular acceleration,"The otolith organs provide information about the position of the head with respect to gravity. When the head is bent away from its normal upright position, otoliths (small calcium carbonate crystals within the utricle and saccule are pulled downward by gravity. The crystals bend the stereocilia on the hair cells, causing the hair cells to depolarize. Depolarization of the hair cells stimulates the vestibular iterse fibers. Bending the head in different directions causes different otoliths to move. Therefore, the paicular group of vestibular nerve fibers that is stimulated signals the direction in which the head bends.",B
Investigation of choice in an unstable patient with suspected intraabdominal injury' is -,DPL,USG',CT scan,X-ray abdomen,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., USG o The prime aim of investigations in a pt. of blunt trauma abdomen is to determine whether the patient needs an exploratory laparotomy or not.o Previously DPL was the inv. of choice to determine the presence of intra-abdominal hemorrhage, but currently Ultrasound has replaced DPL,o U/S is the investigation of choice in both stable as well as unstable patients.Schwartz writes- ""Blunt abdominal trauma initially is evaluated by FAST examination in most major trauma centers, and this has largely supplanted DPL. FAST is not 100% sensitive, however, so diagnostic peritoneal aspiration is still advocated in hemodynamic ally unstable patients without a defined source of blood loss to rule out abdominal hemorrhage. Patients with fluid on FAST examination, considered a 'positive FAST\ who do not have immediate indications for laparotomy and are hemodynamically stable undergo CT scanning to quantify their injuries. ""Sabiston writes - Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in ike operating room to nde out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate surgical exploration.Also knowo Use of U/S in trauma pts. is now k/a FAST examination (i.e. Focussed Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)In this examination the goal is not to evaluate the whole abdomen but io look for free intraperitoneal fluid at specific siteso The diagnostic approach in penetrating abdominal injuries (i.e. stab wounds & Gunshot wounds) differs from that in blunt injuries,o In Gun shot wounds (GSW)Exploratory laprotomy is mandatory, as chances of interna! injury are high (-90%) in GSWs to abdomen,o In stab wounds (SW)In contrast to GSW, SWs that penetrate the peritoneal cavity are less likely to injure intra-abdominal oigans.SWs should be explored under local anesthesia in the emergency department whether the peritoneum has been violated.Injuries that do not penetrate the peritoneal cavity do not require further evaluation.DPL can also be done to detect intraperitoneal injuries.",B

Brilliantly transilluminant swellings are all except?,Hydrocele,Meningeocele,Lipoma,Cystic hygroma,"Ans is 'c' i.e. lipoma All the other options except lipoma are cystic lesions containing clear fluid and thus will show brilliant transillumination.Lipoma are not cystic structures but large lipomas are able to show transillumination upto varying extent (though not brilliantly)TransilluminationTransillumination involves shining a light through a swelling to detect whether it transmits light brilliantly or not.It is a function of the optical density of the component elements of the swelling. Light passes easily through clear fluid but not through solid tissues. If a lump trans illuminates then it must contain water, serum, lymph or plasma, or highly refractile fat. Blood and other semi-opaque fluids do not transmit light.Thus a cyst containing clear fluid (e.g. hydrocele, cystic hygroma, meningocele) trans illuminates brilliantly, one containing opalescent fluid (spermatocele) less so. Fat (lipoma) and subcutaneous tissues also transilluminate to a varying extent.",C

The neuroendocrine carcinoma arising from parafollicular 'C' cells of thyroid is:,Papillary carcinoma,Follicular carcinoma,Medullary carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,"MEDULLARY CARCINOMA OF THE THYROID (MCT)
These tumours arise from parafollicular ‘C’ cells which are derived from ultimobranchial bodies and not from thyroid foillicle.

These tumours present in two different ways.


Sporadic is common, seen in about 80-90% of cases.
Familial variety present as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).

MEN Type I

Pituitary adenoma
Parathyroid adenoma
Pancreatic adenoma

MEN Type IIa

Parathyroid adenoma
Phaeochromocytoma
Medullary carcinoma of thyroid


When it is associated with mucocutaneous neuromas involving lips, tongue, eyelids, it is called Sipple syndrome, with an occasional marfanoid habitus (MEN type IIb)
It has got a characteristic amyloid stroma 
These tumours are not TSH-dependent and do not take up radioactive iodine 

Hormones produced by MCT

Calcitonin 
Prostaglandins
Serotonin (5-HT), ACTH

Spread

Both by lymphatics and blood, thus, worsening the prognosis.

Key Concept:
Medullary Carcinoma arises from parafollicular C cells which are derived from ultimobranchial bodies and not from thyroid follicle. The medullary carcinoma produces hormones such as Calcitonin, Prostaglandins and serotonin.

A pt presents with acute rheumatic carditis with fever. True statements is,Increase troponin T,Reduced myocardial contractility,Signs of inflammation and necrosis,Valve replacement will ameliorate C.C.F.,"Valve replacement will ameliorate CCF The question is about carditis in Rheumatic .fever. carditis is one of the major criterias for the diagnosis of Rheumatic fever. Carditis Carditis occur in 50-60% patients with acute Rheumatic fever carditis and resultant chronic rheumatic hea disease are the most serious manifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis is characterized by pancarditis with active inflammation of all the three layers of the hea : Myocardium - Pericardium - Endocardium Endocarditis Endocarditis (Valvulitis) which is manifested by one or more cardiac murmurs is universal findinv in rheumatic carditis whereas the presence of pericariditis or myocarditis is variable. Endocarditis or valvular damage is the hallmark of Rheumatic fever, the mitral valve is almost always affected sometimes together with Aoic valve. Serious and long tenn illness is entirely related to valvular hea disease. Pericarditis Pericarditis most commonly causes pericardial effusion which results in pleural friction rub on echocardiography and may occasionally cause pleuritic chest pain. Myocarditis Myocardial involvement is almost never responsible in itself for cardiac failure. Myocarditis perse plays little or any role in the morbidity of rheumatic fever. Evidence for absence of myocarditis playing any role in the morbidity and moality of rheumatic fever is based on the following. - Troponin 7(2-a marker of myocardial damage has been found not to increase during acute rheumatic .fever with carditis indicating absence of significant myocardial damage. - Radionuclide evaluations using antimyosin antibody indicates insignificant myocardial uptake (hence absence of significant damage) in the absence of pericarditis and C.C.F. - Myocardial biopsies during acute rheumatic fever with carditis have .failed to provide information regarding presence of myocarditis because of paucity of myocardial damage. - Echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricular function indicates that the myocardial contractility (the capacity of myocardium to contract) remains normalQ even in the presence of C.C.F. - Pathological evaluation (biopsy) of the myocardium indicates that the amount of myocardial damage is insufficient to explain the moality. - Surgical replacement of mitral and/or aoic valve during acute rheumatic fever results in rapid control of CCF and decrease in hea size, despite investigational evidence for ongoing active rheumatic .fever. The surgical findings thus indicate that it is the acute hemodynamic overload secondary to valvular regurgitation which is responsible .for CCF.",D

Because the arm is rapidly flexed, the Ta afferent neurons innervating the muscle spindles in the biceps, which detect muscle length, will reduce their firing rate. The lb afferents, innervating the Golgi tendon organs (GTO) from the biceps, will detect the contractile activity of the biceps and increase their firing rate. The triceps are stretched during the arm flexion and so their la afferents will increase their firing rate. lb afferents do not respond when muscles are passively stretched, so their firing rate will not change.",C

Optimal management of bilateral undescended testicles in an infant is,Immediate surgical placement into the scrotum,Chorionic gonadotropin therapy for 1 month; operative placement into the scrotum before age 1 if descent has not occurred,Observation until the child is 2 years old because delayed descent is common,"Observation until age 5; if no descent by then, plastic surgical scrotal prostheses before the child enters school","By the second year, a testicle not in the cooler environment of the scrotal sac will begin to undergo histologic changes characterized by reduced spermatogonia. Testicles left longer in the undescended state not only have a higher incidence of malignant degeneration but are inaccessible for examination. If a malignancy should occur, diagnosis will be delayed. There is also a substantial psychological burden when children reach school age or are otherwise subjected to exposure of their deformed genitalia. Gel-filled prostheses are generally inserted when a testicle cannot be placed in the scrotum. Close follow-up by a physician until the late teens is indicated in all patients who have had an undescended testicle. Since these patients may be at increased risk for malignancy throughout life, careful training should be given in self-examination.",B

Most Imp. technical consideration at the time of doing below knee amputation is -,Post. flap should be longer than the anterior flap,Stump should be long,Stump should be sho,Ant flap should be longer than post flap,"Ans. is 'a' ie. Post flap should be longer than the anterior flop Posterior flap should be longer than the anterior flap as the posterior skin has a good blood supply (and anterior skin has poor due to lack of muscle on anterior aspect). A good blood supply helps in easy healing of stump. - Equally sho anterior and posterior flaps are used only when the long post flap technique is not feasible because of previous wounds or extensive tissue ischemia. 'The longer (the stump) the better', is the general rule for amputation at all sites, but below knee amputation is an exception. The amputation level is kept proximal to the lower third of tibia, since the preponderance of tendinous structures in the lower third predispose to poor circulation and an unstable painful lump. The best level below the knee as, for, as prosthetic fitting is concerned is at the distal musculotendinous junction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Some other imp. points about BK amputation The fibula is transected slightly above the tibial level. No essential differences in healing rate is noted in pts. with or without popliteal pulses, but the absence of a femoral pulse is associated with a high failure rate for BK amputation. The nerves are pulled gently down, transected and then allowed to retract, and the vessels are ligated above the level of the end of tibia.",A

Severity of acute pancreatitis correlate with levels of all of the following except,Glucose,Amylase,Transaminase,Calcium,"ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF ACUTE PANCREATITIS It is impoant to define that group of patients who will develop severe pancreatitis, as they are the ones with poorer outcomes and therefore they require aggressive early management and possibly transfer to a specialist unit. A severe attack may be heralded by an initial clinical impression of a very ill patient and a worsening physiological state at 24-48 hours. Various prognostic scoring systems have been used, all aimed at predicting persistent organ failure, paicularly respiratory, cardiac and renal. Severity stratification assessments should be performed in patients at 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days after admission. The Ranson and Glasgow scoring systems are specific for acute pancreatitis, and a score of 3 or more at 48 hours indicates a severe attack. Several other systems that are used in intensive care units can also be applied. These include the APACHE, SAPS, SOFA, MODS and modified Marshall scoring systems (the latter has the advantage of simplicity). Regardless of the system used, persisting organ failure indicates a severe attack. A serum C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L at 48 hours after the onset of symptoms is also an indicator of severity. Patients with a body mass index over 30 are at higher risk of developing complications. A revision in 2013 of the Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis (1992) recommends that patients with acute pancreatitis be stratified into 3 groups: Mild acute pancreatitis: * no organ failure; * no local or systemic complications. Moderately severe acute pancreatitis: * organ failure that resolves within 48 hours (transient organ failure); and/or * local or systemic complications without persistent organ failure. Severe acute pancreatitis: * persistent organ failure (>48 hours); * single organ failure; * multiple organ failure. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1224",B

Triangle of doom :

Triangle of doom is formed by the gonadal vessels laterally and the vas deferens medially. Both these entities meet at the deep inguinal ring and the base of triangle is formed by the peritoneal reflection. This triangle contains external iliac artery and vessels. So no dissection or other activity whatsoever should be performed
in this area, as an injury to either of these vessels could be fatal. Moreover the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve lies in this area and is equally in danger in case of careless dissection

Triangle of pain :

Triangle of pain lies lateral to the triangle of doom and is defined as gonadal vessel medially, the iliopubic tract laterally and inferiorly the inferior edge of skin incision. This triangle contains femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve of thigh. Stapling in this area during laparoscopic hernia repair may cause nerve entrapment and result in painful neuralgias.

Circle of death :

This is also called as corona mortis and refers to vascular ring formed by an arterial network, the common iliac artery, internal and external iliac arteries, Obturator artery, abberant Obturator artery, and inferior epigastric artery. The venous counterparts are similar in name, course, and position.",A

Treatment of choice for 3rd degree hemorrhoids is: September 2007,Sclerotherapy,Band ligation,Hemorrhoidectomy,All of the above,"Ans. C: Hemorrhoidectomy External hemorrhoids develop around the rim of the anus. External hemorrhoids cause most of the symptoms associated with hemorrhoids (pain, burning, and itching) because the skin around them is very sensitive. If an external hemorrhoid becomes strangulated, a clot can form in it and become an excruciatingly painful thrombosed hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids develop inside the passageway of the anus. Internal hemorrhoids are often present without causing any discomfo or even awareness of their presence. Internal hemorrhoids are usually painless, although they sometimes cause discomfo and bleeding if a hard stool rubs against them during a bowel movement. Internal hemorrhoids also may prolapse outside the anus, where they appear as small, grape-like masses. These can be painful. Internal hemorrhoids are classified by the degree of tissue prolapse into the anal canal: First-degree - hemorrhoids that bleed but do not prolapse Second-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse with straining or defecating and retract on their own Third-degree - hemorrhoids that prolapse and require manual reduction Fouh-degree - hemorrhoids that chronically prolapse and, if reducible, fall out again Management: Rubber band ligation - A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days. Sclerotherapy is one of the oldest forms of treatment. A chemical solution is injected directly into the hemorrhoid or the area around it. This solution causes a local reaction that interferes with blood flow inside the hemorrhoid, making the hemorrhoid shrink. Laser or electro-coagulation techniques - Both techniques use special devices to burn hemorrhoidal tissue. - Cryotherapy uses cold temperatures to obliterate the veins and cause inflammation and scarring. It is more time consuming, associated with more posttreatment pain, and is less effective than other treatments. Therefore, this procedure is not commonly used. - Hemorrhoidectomy - Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoid may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. This is the best method for permanent removal of hemorrhoid Hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment for: Severe third-degree and fouh-degree hemorrhoids. Second degree hemorrhoids that have not been cured with conservative measures. Fibrosed hemorrhoids Interno-externo hemorrhoids when the external hemorrhoid is well defined.",C

It is also the most common type of cancer that occurs outside the eyeball.# BCC of the eyelid usually affects adults, but may also occur in younger people.# These tumours are related to sun exposure and are similar to basal cell carcinoma of the skin.# BCC most often occurs in the lower eyelidb. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)# SCC of the eyelid is uncommon, accounting for about 5% of all eyelid tumours.# It can occur from a precancerous condition, such as actinic keratosis or Bowen's disease.# These tumours are also related to sun exposure and are similar to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.# SCC tends to behave more aggressively and is more likely to spread than BCC.c. Sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC)# SGC is cancer of the glands in the eyelid.# It is a rare tumour that may account for up to 5% of all eyelid cancers.# It occurs more often in women than men and occurs most often in the elderly.# These tumours develop most often on the upper eyelid, followed by the lower eyelid and the caruncleo SGC can start in the Meibomian glands, glands of Zeis or the sebaceous glands of the caruncle.# SGC is often diagnosed at a later stage because it can mimic benign conditions. It can also grow aggressively.# SGC may be multifocal (occurring in more than one place), so they have a tendency to recur after treatmentd Malignant melanoma# Melanoma of the eyelid is very uncommon and accounts for less than 1% of all eyelid cancers.# Melanoma of the eyelid is similar to melanoma of the skin of the skin.

Predisposing factors for development of cholangiocarcinoma are primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver fluke in Asians, especially Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis. Patients typically presents as painless jaundice, with pruritus or weight loss. Diagnosis is made by biopsy, percutaneously for peripheral liver lesions, or more commonly endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under direct vision for central lesions.

"5 minutes before recovery from anesthesia, nitrous oxide is removed and 100% oxygen is administered to the patient to prevent -",Diffusion Hypoxia,Second gas effect,Hyperoxia,Bronchospasm,"Ans. is' a' i.e., Diffusion hypoxia Diffusion hypoxiao In initial part of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N2O), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intra-alveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli - Concentration effect.o During recovery reverse occurs - N2O having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air - partial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced.o The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia (Fink effect).o Diffusion hypoxia occurs in first 5-10 minutes of recovery.o Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% O2 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N2O, instead of straight away switching over to air. Besides N2O, Xenon also causes diffusion hypoxia.",A

"In Duchennes muscular dystrophy, calf muscle is: September 2009",Hyperophied,Atrophied,Pseudoatrophied,Pseudohyperophied,"Ans. D: Pseudohyperophied Duchenne muscular dystrophy is by far the most common childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, afflicting 1 in 3300 boys with an overall prevalence of 63 cases per million. One third of these cases are due to spontaneous mutations, while the rest are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Duchenne muscular dystrophy clinically manifests in patients aged 3-7 years, with development of lordosis, a waddling gait, and the Cowers sign. Calf pseudohyperophy follows 1-2 years later. Most patients are wheelchair bound by age 12 years. Diagnostic criteria include: Weakness with onset in the legs; Hyperlordosis with wide-based gait; Hyperophy of weak muscles; Progressive course over time; Reduced muscle contractility on electrical stimulation in advanced stages of the disease; and (6) absence of bladder or bowel dysfunction, sensory disturbance, or febrile illness. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is much more than a disease of skeletal muscles. Dystrophin is also found in the hea, brain, and smooth muscle. Late-stage cardiac fibrosis can lead to output failure and pulmonary congestion, a common cause of death. Additionally, cardiac fibrosis can include cardiomyopathy and conduction abnormalities, which can induce fatal arrhythmias.",D
Persistent vomiting in G.O.O. causes -a) Hyponatremic hyperchloremia occurb) Hypernatremia without ↓ed Cl- alkalosisc) Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosisd) Paradoxical aciduria,cd,bc,bd,ac,"Repetitive vomiting leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. The urine is alkaline initially but eventually it becomes acidic (paradoxical aciduria)



Cause of paradoxical aciduria 

Initially the kidney compensate for metabolic alkalosis by reabsorbing hydrogen and chloride ions in exchange for sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. But gradually as the body stores of sodium and especially potassium become depleted, kidney starts retaining these ions in exchange of hydrogen ions, thus the urine becomes acidic and metabolic alkaline state is further aggravated.",A
Peritonitis in acute appendicitis is caused by -,Fecolith,Early rupture,Appendicular abscess,T.B.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e.. Early rupture of appendixo Perforation of appendix in acute appendicitis commonly leads to an abscess cavity' walled off by the small bowel loops and the omentum, forming a phlegmon. Rarely the appendix may perforate freely into the peritoneal cavity and cause generalized peritonitis. This usually occurs in cases of early rupture of the appendix as inflammatory process did not get time to be localized by the omentum and bowel loops.o Usually the rupture of appendix is a late sequelae of appendicitis, usually occurring 48 to 72 hours from the onset of symptoms.Also know:o The site of rupture is commonly just beyond the point of obstruction, along the antimesenteric border of appendix,o Fecaliths are the most common cause of appendiceal obstruction.Lets also see the management of appendicitis:Management of appendicitis: o The treatment of appendicitis is appendectomy. (It can be done open or laparoscopically)o Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated preoperatively. Postoperative antibiotic coverage is of no use in simple (uncomplicated) acute appendicitis. If perforated or gangrenous appendicitis is found, antibiotics are continued until the patient is afebrile and has a normal white blood cell count.Perforated Appendicitis (Maingot's 11/e p603)o Rupture is suspected in the presence of fever with a temperature of >39degC (102degF) and a white blood cell count of >18,000 cells/mm3.o The management of perforation depends on the nature of the perforation.o If the perforation is free causing intraperitoneal dissemination of pus and fecal material, urgent laparotomy is done for appendectomy and irrigation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity'.o If the perforation is contained it would result in an appediceal mass or abscess. This is managed as described under.Appendiceal Abscess/ Masso Patients who present late in the course of appendicitis with a palpable or radiographically documented mass (abscess or phlegmon) are treated with-# Conservative therapy and interval appendectomy 6 to 10 weeks later.(conservative management includes intravenous antibiotics and fluids as well as bowel rest.)# Patients with large abscesses, greater than 4 to 6 cm in size, and especially those patients with abscess and high fever, benefit from abscess drainage.",B

A 20-year-old male finds a mass in his scrotum. The first step in evaluating this mass is,Palpation and transillumination,HCG and a-fetoprotein,Scrotal ultrasonography,Evaluation for inguinal adenopathy,"The first step in evaluating a scrotal mass is to determine whether the mass is in the testis or outside it. Most solid masses arising from within the testis are malignant. Palpation of the scrotal mass and transillumination (holding a flashlight directly against the posterior wall of the scrotum) will distinguish testicular lesions from other masses within the scrotum, such as hydrocele. Ultrasonography will confirm a solid testicular mass. The tumor markers b-HCG and a-fetoprotein are not used in the initial evaluation of a scrotal mass, but may be impoant when a solid mass suggestive of testicular carcinoma is found. b-HCG or AFP will be elevated in about 70% of patients with disseminated nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Seminomas are usually associated with normal tumor cell markers. Choriocarcinomas produce b-HCG. Endodermal sinus tumors or embryonal cell carcinomas are often associated with elevated AFP levels. The lymphatic drainage of the testis is into the periaoic nodes, not to the inguinal nodes. The periaoic nodes must be assessed radiographically, usually by CT scanning, if a testicular neoplasm is strongly suspected.",A
Manoeuvre for diagnosing rupture of medial collateral ligament is: March 2010,Posterior drawer test,Anterior drawer test,Lachmann's test,Valgus stress test,"Ans. D: Valgus Stress Test Tests to Detect Ligament Injury Lachman Test - The Lachman test is the best test to diagnose an ACL tear. - With the patient lying flat and relaxed, the examiner bend the knee slightly, about 20 degrees. The examiner then stabilizes the thigh while pulling the shin forward. - Both the amount of translation (shifting) as well as the feel of the endpoint offer information about the ACL. Anterior Drawer Test - The anterior drawer test is also performed with the patient lying flat. The knee is bent 90 degrees and the shin is pulled forward to check the stability of the ACL. - An intact ACL will only allow the shin to come forward slightly. - A torn ACL will allow the shin to move fuher forward. Pivot Shift Test - The pivot shift test is a difficult maneuver to perform on a patient who is not under anesthesia. This test places a stress on the knee joint that forces a subluxation (paial dislocation) in patients who do not have an ACL. - This test recreates the type of instability that caused the ACL injury. Posterior Drawer Test - The posterior drawer is performed similarly to the anterior drawer test. - This test detects injury to the PCL. - By pushing the shin backward, the integrity of the PCL is tested. - Excessive movement of the shin backwards is a sign of PCL injury. Varus and Valgus Instability - Varus and valgus instability tests check the LCL (lateral collateral ligament) and MCL (medial collateral ligament), respectively. - With the patient lying flat, and the knee held at about 30 degrees of flexion, gentle adduction and abduction force is applied. - Insufficiency of the LCL or MCL will allow the knee to ""open up"" excessively. - The test is repeated with the leg straight. If the knee still opens up excessively, then more than just the LCL or MCL was torn.",D

"A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with a stab wound to the right side of the back just medial to the posterior axillary line. His blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, pulse rate is 98 bpm, and respiration rate is 22 breaths per minute. Physical examination reveals no abdominal tenderness, guarding, or neurologic changes. Local exploration of the stab wound is performed using local anesthesia. The track to the wound ends in the paraspinal muscles. What would be the next step in management?",Admit the patient for 24 hours of observation.,Perform peritoneal lavage.,Perform CT scan with rectal and intravenous contrast.,Discharge to outpatient clinic for follow-up monitoring.,"A patient with definitive negative findings on wound exploration can be discharged from the hospital for outpatient follow-up care. It is sometimes difficult to determine the depth of a stab wound to the back because of the thickness of the paraspinal muscles. Some authors have found that nearly 20% of patients with such injuries have negative findings on exploration. Such patients can be discharged. Deeper stab wounds to the back may injure peritoneal structures without penetration of the peritoneal cavity. Thus, peritoneal lavage is less useful than a CT scan with intravenous, oral, and (particularly) rectal contrast to rule out retroperitoneal colon injuries.",D
Paralytic ileus is seen in ?,Spinal cord injury,Hypocal cemia,Hypermagnesemia,All,"Answer is 'a' i.e. Spinal cord injury Causes of Paralytic ileus Postoperative - a degree of ileus usually occurs after any abdominal procedure and is self-limiting, with a variable duration of 24-72 hrs. Post op ileus may be prolonged in the presence of hypoproteinemia or metabolic abnromality. Paralytic ileus is a state in which there is failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure. The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel with associated distention, vomiting, absent or diminished bowel sounds and absolute constipation. Radiological picture shows dilated gas filled bowel loops with multiple air-fluid level. The picture is similar to mechanical small bowel obstruction; the only differentiating point is presence of gas in colon and rectum in paralytic ileus. Other clinical differentiating features of paralytic ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction are. 1) Pain - Pain is colicky in mechanical obstruction. Pain is not a feature of paralytic ileus and if present is a steady, diffuse pain. 2) Bowel sounds - Bowel sounds are hypoactive or absent in paralytic ileus in contrast to hyperactive bowel sounds in mechanical obstruction.",A

"In intestinal obstruction, investigations needed are ?",Barium swallow,Intestinal barium meal,Stomach barium meal,All,"Answer is 'b' i.e. Intestinal barium meal The diagnosis of intestinal obstruction is suspected in any patient presenting with abdominal pain, vomiting, distension and obstipation. Plain radiographs usually confirm the clinical suspicion and can also define the site of obstruction. Maingot's 10/e, p 1163 writes that 4 x-ray views of the abdomen are essential in all pts. suspected of intestinal obstruction. i) upright chest, ii) upright abdomen, iii) supine abdomen & iv) left lateral decubitus view. whereas Sabiston, Harrison & CSDT write for only 2 views - the erect abdomen & the supine abdomen. Also know that Bailey 24/e, p 1189 writes that ""Erect abdominal films are no longer routinely obtained and the radiological diagnosis is based on a supine abdominal film. An erect film may subsequently be requested when fuher doubt exists"" Other investigations which may be done are: CT scan - CT is useful in cases in which diagnosis is not readily apparent by plain abdominal film, or if an abdominal tumor or abscess is suspected to be the cause of obstruction. - CT is helpful in identifying the location and cause of obstruction. Barium studies A barium enema is done if a large bowel obstruction is suspected. Barium studies for small bowel obstructions are - Barium meal follow through (BMFT) - Enteroclysis (small bowel enema) - these studies are done in patients in whom a recurring or low-grade mechanical obstruction is suspected. - these studies are contraindicated in acute obstructions - Bailey 24/e, p 1190 - BMFT & enteroclysis are also contraindicated in large bowel obstruction as barium may get insipissated in the colon.",B

Which of the following has the highest potential of progression into cancer,Adenomatous polyp,Hyperplastic polyp,Juvenile polyp,Hamaomatous polyp,"Familial adenomatous polyposis Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is defined clinically by the presence of more than 100 colorectal adenomas, but is also characterised by duodenal adenomas and multiple extraintestinal manifestations. Over 80% of cases come from patients with a positive family history. The remainder arise as a result of new mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on the sho arm of chromosome 5. FAP is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and is consequently equally likely in men and women. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 100% in patients with FAP. FAP can also be associated with benign mesodermal tumours such as desmoid tumours and osteomas. Epidermoid cysts can also occur (Gardner's syndrome); desmoid tumours in the abdomen spread locally to involve the intestinal mesentery and, although non-metastasising, they may become unresectable. Up to 50% of patients with FAP have congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), which can be used to screen affected families if genetic testing is unavailable. CLINICAL FEATURES Polyps are usually visible on sigmoidoscopy by the age of 15 years and will almost always be visible by the age of 30 years. Carcinoma of the large bowel develops 10-20 years after the onset of the polyposis. If there are no adenomas by the age of 30 years, FAP is unlikely. If the diagnosis is made duringadolescence, surgery is usually deferred to the age of 17 or 18 years unless symptoms develop. Malignant change is rare before the age of 20 years. Examination of blood relatives, including cousins, nephews and nieces, is essential; a family tree should be constructed and a register of affected families maintained. Referral to a medical geneticist is essential. If over 100 adenomas are present at colonoscopy, the diagnosis can be made confidently Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1259",A

The condition occurs during or immediately after anaesthesia and may be precipitated by potent inhalational agents.o The mechanism involves a sudden rise in intracellular calcium due to release of stored calcium in sarcoplasmic reticulum stimulating contraction, rhabdomyolysis and a hypermetabolic state.Drugs causing malignant hyperthermia# Succinylcholine# Desflurane# Tricyclic antidepressants# Halothane# Cyclopropane# Phenothiazines# Isoflurane# Ether# Lignocaine# Enflurane# Methoxyflurane # Sevoflurane# MAO inhibitors o Succinylcholine is the most common cause of MHo Amongst inhalational agents halothane is the most common cause.o Combination of Sch and Halothane has a much higher incidence.Clinical featureso Masseter spasm - if a patient develops severe masseter spasm after suxamethonium, there is a significant possibility of malignant hyperthermia.o Tachycardia, arrhythmias and hypertension.o Hyperthermiao Rise in end-tidal CO2 - May rise to more than 100 mm Hg (normal is 32-42 mm Hg). It is the earliest and most sensitive indicator.o Hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, elevated creatininephosphokinase, muscle rigidity.o Increased myoglobin, renal failure.o Muscle biopsy contracture test (definitive diagnostic procedure) The muscle biopsy contracture test is the most sensitive and specific test. The Caffeine Halothane Contracture test (CHCT), a test performed on freshly biopsied muscle; is the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia. However, the test is available only at few centers in the world (only about 30 centers world wide) and it is very costly. The CHCT test should be considered for all those judged to be at significant risk for malignant hyperthermia, either through family history, or by elicitation of signs of an episode of malignant hyperthermia, or if there had been any previous uncharacterized adverse reaction to a general anesthetic.Managemento Stop all anaesthetics immediately.o Hyperventilation with 100% oxygeno Cooling of body by ice coolingo Correct acidosis and hyperkalemia.o Maintain urine output.o IV dantrolene is the drug of choiceo Procaine is the local anaesthetic of choice for malignant hyperthermia patients.o Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for malignant hyperthermia patient.",A
A patient on antibiotics for treatment for peritonitis presents with mucus diarrhoea. Most probable cause could be: September 2009,Ulcerative colitis,Activation of latent tuberculosis,Antibiotic associated diarrhoea,Gastritis,"Ans. C: Antibiotic associated diarrhoea Nearly 25% of antibiotic associated diarrhoeas (AAD) is caused by Clostridium difficile, making it the commonest pathogen. Other pathogens implicated infrequently include Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Candida spp. and Salmonella spp. Most mild cases of AAD are due to non-infectious causes which include reduced break down of primary bile acids and decrease metabolism of carbohydrates, allergic or toxic effects of antibiotic on intestinal mucosa and pharmacological effect on gut motility. The antibiotics most frequently associated with C. difficile associated diarrhoea are clindamycin, cephalosporin, ampicillin and amoxicillin. Clinical presentation may vary from mild diarrhoea to severe colitis and pseudomembranous colitis associated with high morbidity and moality. The most sensitive and specific diagnostic test for C. difficile infection is tissue culture assay for cytotoxicity of toxin B. Commercial ELISA kits are available. Though less sensitive, they are easy to perform and are rapid. Withdrawal of precipitating antibiotic is all that is needed for control of mild to moderate cases. For severe cases of AAD, oral metronidazole is the first line of treatment, and oral vancomycin is the second choice.",C
"A 68-year-old man is admitted to the coronary care unit with an acute myocardial infarction. His postinfarction course is marked by congestive hea failure and intermittent hypotension. On the fouh day in hospital, he develops severe midabdominal pain. On physical examination, blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110 beats per minute and regular; the abdomen is soft with mild generalized tenderness and distention. Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?",Barium enema,Upper gastrointestinal series,Angiography,Ultrasonography,"In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop",C
The primitive uteroplacental circulation is functionally established during which period of embryonic/fetal development?,First week,Second week,Third week,End of first month,"End of first month. During the second week of fetal development, lacunar spaces develop between cells of the syncytiotrophoblast, paicularly in the region of the embryonic pole as the conceptus invades the endometrium. Endometrial capillaries in this region become dilated and engorged with blood to form sinusoids. The syncytial cells direct erosion of the endothelium of the maternal capillaries, allowing maternal blood to enter the lacunae and bathe the syncytial cells. During the second week, core will then differentiate to form capillaries and blood cells by the end of the third week (teiary villus). primary villi consist of projections of syncytial cells surrounding a core of cytotrophoblast cells (answer b).

All of the following drugs are commercially marketed as racemic mixture except-,Bupivacaine,Thiopentone,Ropivacaine,Thiamylal,"Ropivacaine is pure s-isomer of bupivacaine. Enantiomers exist in two different spatial configurations, like right- and left-handed gloves, and are present in equal amounts in a racemic solution. They are optically active and can be differentiated by their effects on the rotation of the plane of a polarised light into dextrorotatory or levorotatory stereoisomers. The physicochemical propeies of the two enantiomeric molecules are identical, but the two enantiomers can have substantially different behaviours in their affinity for either the site of action or the sites involved in the generation of side effects. R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of local anaesthetics have been demonstrated to have different affinity for different ion channels of sodium, potassium, and calcium; this results in a significant reduction in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity (cardiotoxicity) of the S(-)enantiomer as compared with the R(+)enantiomer. The technological advancements have made it possible to develop Ropivacaine as an optically pure S(-) enantiomeric from the parent chiral molecule propivacaine. It belongs to the group of local anaesthetics, the pipecoloxylidides and has a propyl group on the piperidine nitrogen atom compared to bupivacaine, which has a butyl group.",C

Ankylosing spondylitis (marie-strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4th/e 593) and ankle (Apley's 9th/e 67) are also involved.

"All are TRUE about hypospadias, EXCEPT ?",Circumcision in infancy is contraindicated,Avoid surgery till pubey,No treatment required in glandular variety,All,"Ans. is 'b i.e. Avoid surgery till pubey Different books mention different age criteria for correcting hypospadias. Campbell's urology states ""Best time for surgery for hypospadias is between 6-12 months of age."" Hypospadias: This is a condition in which the external meatus of the urethra is situated at some point on the undersurface of the penis or perineum. Besides the abnormal position of external urethral meatus the other associated abnormalities are a) In the penile variety the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening are absent, Instead a fibrous cord is present. Due to contracture of this fibrous cord, the penis is curved ventrally (in a downward direction) this is known as chordee. So the more proximal the ectopic opening is placed the greater is the chance of chordee. This curved penis causes problem in intercourse as well as micturition. b) In all cases, inferior aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed. While the superior aspect is normally developed. This causes prepuce to take the form of hood and is called hooded prepuce. Complications of hypospadias ? a) Difficulty in directing the urinary stream. b) Due to presence of chordee, erection is difficult and painful and the intercourse may be difficult or impossible. c) Infeility can occur (usually associated with posterior type), T/T of Hypospadias: T/T of hypospadias is very complex. Here are some impoant points. Treatment is not required in anterior variety. In this variety the patient is usually functional both for micturition and procreation and repair is done primarily for cosmetic reasons. In case of other varieties, a plastic operation is performed to bring the external urethral meatus to its normal position, and remove the chordee to straighten the curvature. Operation can be done in one stage or two stage surgeries. Now days one stage surgeries are more popular. - Indication for 2 stage operation - Scrotal or perineal variety - Even sever proximal types have been treated in single stage repair with success. - Circumcision is not done in patients with hypospadias as the prepuce can later be used in surgical repair.",B
Which one of the following cofactors must be utilized during the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyel-CoA?,Thiamine pyrophosphate,Acyl carrier protein (ACP),Biotin,FAD,"FAD The key enzymatic step of fatty acid syn thesis is the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. The carboxyl of biotin is covalently attached to an E-amino acid group of a lysine residue of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The reaction occurs in two stages. In the first step, a carboxybiotin is formed: HCO3- + biotin-enzyme + ATP CO2 - biotin-enzyme+ ADP + Pi In the second step, the CO2 is transferred to acetyl CoA to produce malonyl CoA: CO2-biotin-enzyme + acetyl CoA malonyl CoA+ biotin-enzyme None of the other cofactors listed are involved in this reaction.",D

More common in Western countriesBrown stonesAre composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin with varylng amounts of cholesterol and protein (eg. Calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium sterate).Are typically found in Asia.Brown stones are rare in gallbladder. They form in bile duct and are related to bile stasis and infected bile.Gram-negative bacteria (paicularly E. coli) secretes p -glucoronidase which deconjugates the soluble conjugated bilirubin. The free unconjugated bilirubin precipitates and combines wtih calcium and bile to form brown pigment stones. They form whenever static foreign bodies are present in the bile duct, for example 'stents' or parasites such as Clonorchis sinensis and Ascaris lumbricoides.",B

Post spinal headache lasts for ?,10 min,I hrs,10 days,1 week,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 10 days Post dural puncture headache is due to CSF leak. Typical location is bifrontal or occipital. Headache gets worsen on sitting or upright posture and is relieved by lying down position and abdominal pressure --> The hallmark of postdural puncture headache i.e., association with body position. The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days. PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure suppoing the brain, paicularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (paicularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia. Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH . Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v., fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position.

First Local anesthetic to be used for spinal block:,Cocaine,Procaine,Prilocaine,Lignocaine,"Cocaine was the first local anesthetic to be used for regional anaesthesia. In 1884, Austrian ophthalmologist Karl Koller (1857-1944) instilled a 2% solution of cocaine into his own eye and tested its effectiveness as a local anesthetic by pricking the eye with needles. His findings were presented a few weeks later at annual conference of the Heidelberg Ophthalmological Society. The following year, William Halsted (1852-1922) performed the first brachial plexus block. Also in 1885, James Leonard Corning (1855-1923) injected cocaine between the spinous processes of the lower lumbar veebrae, first in a dog and then in a healthy man. His experiments are the first published descriptions of the principle of neuraxial blockade. On August 16, 1898, German surgeon August Bier (1861-1949) performed surgery under spinal anesthesia in Kiel.

About hemothorax -a) Seen in choriocarcinomab) Supine posture is better than erect posturec) Needle aspiration may be needed for diagnosisd) Thoracotomy is always done,ab,bc,acd,abc,"Hemothorax: Causes

trauma (most common)
tumor
tuberculosis
Diagnosis is made by needle aspiration of pleural fluid.
Harrison writes that for making a diagnosis of hemothorax, the pleural fluid hematocrit should be > 50% of the peripheral blood.
Chest X rays are taken to assess the presence and extent of pleural cavity collection (blood or simple plural fluid)
a supine position with horizontal x-ray beam (k/a decubitus position) is better than an erect film, as about 400-500 ml of blood may be hidden by diaphragm on upright chest x-ray.

Management of hemothorax

Most of the hemothorax can be t/t effectively with a large bore chest tube drainage and in most of the cases the bleeding stops as the lungs re-expands.
A small number of cases will require thoracotomy
continued bleeding
a significant blood clot has formed.
Currently, most hemothoraces requiring more than simple tube drainage can be managed with Videothoracoscopy. Thoracotomy may be needed only if more extensive exposure is needed to manage an active source of bleeding or if extensive decortication of the lung is necessary.",D

Microscopic examination of a series of peripheral blood smears taken during the course of a staphylococcal infection indicates that the bactericidal capacity of the boy's neutrophils is impaired or absent. What is the most likely cause of this child's illness?",Defect in the enzyme NADPH oxidase,Defect in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA),Defect in the IL-2 receptor,Developmental defect at the pre-B stage,"Patients with chronic granulomatous disease have defective functioning of phagocytic neutrophils and monocytes due to an inability to produce hydrogen peroxide. That is, their phagocytic cells have a decreased oxidative or respiratory burst. The most common cause of chronic granulomatous disease is defective NADPH oxidase, which is an enzyme on the membrane of lysosomes that conves O2 to superoxide and stimulates oxygen burst. This deficiency results in recurrent infections with catalasepositive organisms, such as S. aureus. The classic form of chronic granulomatous disease usually affects boys and causes death before the age of 10. Key findings in chronic granulomatous disease include lymphadenitis, hepatosplenomegaly, eczematoid dermatitis, pulmonary infiltrates that are associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, and defective ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria. A defect in the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA) is seen in the autosomal recessive (Swiss) form of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), while a defect in the IL-2 receptor is seen in the X-linked recessive form of SCID.

Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007,Ankylosing spondylitis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Reiter's syndrome,Osteoahritis,"Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools. The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.",A

"A 4-week-old boy is brought to your OPD by his mother because he has had increasing amounts of vomiting over the past week. Initially it staed as ""spitting up"" after a few meals a day, but now the baby is having projectile vomiting after every meal. She says the vomitus is non-bloody and non- bilious and the baby appears hungry after he vomits. This is her first child and she is not sure if this is normal. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show: Sodium: 140 mEq/L Potassium: 3.0 mEq/L Chloride: 87 mEq/L Bicarbonate: 30 mEq/L At this time the most appropriate next step is to",do nothing,obtain an abdominal radiograph,obtain an abdominal ultrasound,order a barium enema,"This baby has presented with the typical picture of pyloric stenosis. Projectile nonbilious vomiting is seen in viually all patients. Patients also often develop a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from the persistent vomiting. On exam, the upper abdomen may be distended after feeding and prominent peristaltic waves from left to right may be seen. The classic physical exam finding of an ""olive-shaped"" mass in the epigastric area is not always felt. An ultrasound is the least invasive, safest diagnostic test. The typical appearance on ultrasound is a hypoechoic ring with a hyperdense center. The pyloric muscle thickness measures greater than 4mm. Since this patient has the symptoms of pyloric stenosis, it is inappropriate to do nothing (choice A). A plain film of the abdomen (choice B) will most likely appear normal unless there is a complete obstruction of the pyloric outlet. Again, this study would expose the baby to unnecessary radiation. And, in this case, it would not help you to establish the diagnosis. A barium enema (choice D) will not help to make the diagnosis in this patient. The fact that the vomitus is nonbilious puts the point of obstruction prior to the entrance of the sphincter of Oddi. A study performed from below will not help to see what is happening so high in the intestinal tract. If you suspected intussusception (paroxysmal abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, heme-positive stool, and sausage-shaped mass in upper mid abdomen on palpation), then a barium enema (or air enema) would be both diagnostic and therapeutic.",C

True about solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is alUexcept,Increased muscle layer proliferation,Crypt distoion,Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte,Subepithelial fibrosis,"Lamina propria infiltration with lymphocyte Histopathology of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome shows hypocellular lamina propria. There is relative absence of inflammatory cells Surgical Pathology & Cytopathology writes - ""There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), but without the dense lamina propria inflammation."" Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome The pathogenesis of mucosa/ prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS. SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age. Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction. Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa. Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration. The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, paicularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial poion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosa' hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distoion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium. In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudomembrane. The cells show enlarged, hyperchronzatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells",C

"In the study of enzymes, a sigmoidal plot of substrate concentration () versus reaction velocity (V) may indicate which of the following?",Michaelis-Menten kinetics,Competitive inhibition,Noncompetitive inhibition,Cooperative bindings,"Cooperative bindings Allosteric enzymes, unlike simpler enzymes, do not obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Often, one active site of an allosteric enzyme molecule can positively affect another active site in the same molecule. This leads to cooperativity and sigmoidal enzyme kinetics in a plot of versus . The terms competitive inhibition and noncompetitive inhibition apply to Michaelis-Menten kinetics and not to allosteric enzymes. Allosteric Regulation i. Allosteric enzyme has one catalytic site where the substrate binds and another separate allosteric site where the modifier binds (allo= other) ii. Allosteric and substrate binding sites may or may not be physically adjacent. iii. The binding of the regulatory molecule can either enhance the activity of the enzyme (allosteric activation), or inhibit the activity of the enzyme (allosteric inhibition). iv. In the former case, the regulatory molecule is known as the positive modifier and in the latter case as the negative modifier. v. The binding of substrate to one of the subunits of the enzyme may enhance substrate binding by other subunits. This effect is said to be positive co-operativity. If the binding of substrate to one of the subunits decreases the avidity of substrate binding by other sites, the effect is called negative co-operativity. vi. In most cases, a combination is observed, resulting in a sigmoid shaped curve. vii.Km is usually increased. viii. Vmax is reduced. ix. The effect of allosteric modifier is maximum at or near substrate concentration equivalent to Km . xi.When an inhibitor binds to the allosteric site, the configuration of catalytic site is modified such that substrate cannot bind properly. xii. Most allosteric enzymes possess quaternary structure. They are made up of subunits, e.g. Aspaate transcarbamoylase has 6 subunits and pyruvate kinase has 4 subunits.",D
A 45 year old woman presents with a hard and mobile lump in the breast. Next investigation is -,FNAC,USG,Mammography,Excision biopsy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., FNAC In any patient with a breast lump or other symptoms suggestive of carcinoma, diagnosis should be made by a combination of : 'Triple Assessment' : a. Clinical assessment b. Radiological imaging c. Tissue sampling for either cytological or histological examination. FNAC is more than often the first investigation for a tissue assessment. Bailey writes ? ""FNAC is the least invasive technique for obtaining a cell diagnosis and is very accurate if both operator and cytologists are experienced. However false negatives do occur, mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from 'in situ' disease. A histological specimen taken by core biopsy allows a definitive preoperative diagnosis, differentiates between duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive disease and also allows the tumor to be stained for receptor status. This is impoant before commencing neoadjuvant therapy.""",A

Nirous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following except: September 2006,Volvulus surgeries,Pneumothorax,Patient in shock,Tympanoplasties,"Ans. C: Patient in shock Overall, nitrous oxide is a very safe drug with few absolute contraindications. Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock.",C

Most likely etiology is:",Renovascular disease,Thrombotic renal disease,. Multiple myeloma,SLE,"Multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma is the most likely etiology. The combination of hypercalcemia and acute renal failure raises the possibility of multiple myeloma as the bone breakdown secondary to tumor involvement releases large amounts of calcium to the extracellular fluid and hypercalcemia ensues. The renal failure in myeloma is primarily related to hypercalcemia combined with proteinaceous cast formation within the renal tubules, producing a form of intratubu- lar obstruction as well as a tubular inflammatory lesion. The major diagnostic clue is the finding of dipstick mildly positive urine with a sulfosalicylic acid strongly positive urine. Dipstick testing does not detect the negatively charged light-chain proteins, only the alburnin. Renovascular lesions and thrombotic renal disease could present with this picture, although they should not be asso- ciated with hypercalcemia and severe back pain, and findings upon examination of the urine would not include proteins.

"About inguinal hernia surgery all of the following are true, except:",Hernia in children is treated with herniotomy,Absorbable mesh should not be used for surgery,Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic,Surgery can be done using laparoscopy,"Surgery can be done even if the patient is asymptomatic.
Non-absorbable mesh is used for hernia surgery.
Hernia in children can be treated with herniotomy only. Inguinal floor reconstruction can be needed in children with large hernias.
Coming to option 'c' i.e. ""Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic""
Surgery can be done even in asymptomatic patients. Let's see this in a little detail as future questions can be asked with little twists in the statement.
The decision to repair an asymptomatic hernia or go for 'watchful waiting' has been a matter of many research studies.
Surgery Vs Watchful waiting:

It's agreed that the definitive treatment of all hernias, regardless of their origin or type, is surgical repair. Outcomes are generally excellent with minimal short-term morbidity and rapid return to presurgical health. This is true even in elderly individuals, especially with the use of local anesthesia.
These surgical outcomes combined with limited outcome data in patients who do not undergo surgery have led to recommendations to offer surgery to most patients with a groin hernia, regardless of symptoms. The risks of delayed surgery are primarily related to the risk of incarceration and strangulation, which are the only true medical indications for repair of hernias. However, it is not possible to identify with any degree of reliability which hernias are likely to incarcerate or strangulate versus those that will remain uncomplicated.
The other school of thought favoring Watchful waiting say that: While surgery is clearly indicated for most patients with significant symptoms related to a hernia, it may be reasonable to delay surgery in patients with inguinal hernia who have minimal or no symptoms.
Various studies comparing ""watchful waiting"" vs ""immediate surgery in asymptomatic patients"" have found no difference in the rate of hernia accidents and pain scores between the surgery and watchful waiting groups, although patients who had immediate surgery responded that their general health had improved at one year, compared to a perception of health decline in the 'watchful waiting' group.
These findings suggest that a strategy of watchful waiting rather than referral for surgery can be considered in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia, as long as they are aware of the risk, albeit small, of hernia complications and understand the need for prompt medical attention should symptoms of these complications occur.
Although most authors agree that watchful waiting is a safe therapeutic option, some authors suggest elective surgery, rather than watchful waiting, for patients who are elderly, who have limited access to emergency care, or significant illness that would put them at greater risk for poor outcome after bowel strangulation.",C

The two conditions vary in their symptom pattern and onset, but both involve the internal organ systems, including the renal tract and lungs (causing failure and pulmonary fibrosis). Skin involvement in DCSS is severe and widespread, but organ involvement is maximal at around 3 years and then typically improves. In CREST skin involvement is confined to the face and extremities; however, organ involvement tends to be progressive and more severe. CREST syndrome is typified by the following features: Calcinosis, Raynaud's, esophageal disorders, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia. Diagnosis is clinical and backed by identification of ceain auto-antibodies. Anti-nuclear antibodies are usually present, anti-Scl-70 is positive in 40% of scleroderma, the presence of anti-centromere antibody occurs in 80%-90% of CREST and is suggestive of the diagnosis.

Axillary lymph node status is the most powerful predictor of recurrence and survival in breast cancer patients. In sentinel node biopsy, blue dye and or radioactive colloid is injected into the breast parenchyma around the tumor, and these are picked up by the lymphatic channels and concentrated in the lymph node draining the cancer. It is then removed by excision. If sentinel node is negative for cancer, chance of metastasis being found in the axillary node is less than 5%. If sentinel lymph node biopsy is positive, axillary node resection is required. Ref: Breast Cancer Research Protocols By Susan A.

A 4 year boy is complaining of pain around elbow with the hand held in pronation with extension. X ray of the elbow joint is normal. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Pulled elbow,Montegia fracture,Cellulitis,None of the above,"Pulled elbow or Nursemaid elbow or Babysitter's elbow or radial head subluxation is most commonly occurs in children aged 1-4 years. The etiology is slippage of the head of the radius under the annular ligament. The distal attachment of the annular ligament covering the radial head is weaker in children than in adults, allowing it to be more easily torn. As children age, the annular ligament strengthens, making the condition less common. The oval shape of the proximal radius in cross-section contributes to this condition by offering a more acute angle posteriorly and laterally, with less resistance to slippage of the ligament when axial traction is applied to the extended and pronated forearm. The patient resists supination/pronation as well as flexion/extension of the forearm. Axial traction is the most common cause of nursemaid elbow. A fall is the second most common mechanism of injury. Infants have been repoed with nursemaid elbow after rolling over or being assisted to roll over. The Monteggia fracture is a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with dislocation of the head of the radius.",A

GRAWITZ'S TUMOR)# This is an adenocarcinoma.# It is the most common neoplasm (75 per cent) of the kidney.# It arises from renal tubular cells.# most commonly the upper pole.# Spread : The tumor is prone to grow into the renal vein.# Highly vascular metastases may pulsate.# If the tumour extends beyond the renal capsule it is liable to metastasise via the lymph nodes in the hilum of the kidney to the para-aortic nodes and beyond.# CF: M:F = 2:1.# Hematuria is the most common symptom.# In men, a rapidly developing varicocele is a rare but impressive sign, occurring most often on the left side because the left gonadal vein is obstructed where it joins the left renal vein.# Atypical C/f: Hyperpyrexia, Extreme anemia, or Polycythemia (occurs in 4%of cases), Hypercalcemia, Nephrotic synd.# Investigation: US is generally initial or screening too of choice, while CECT demonstrate the extent of the lesion more clearly and will show whether there is hilar lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. MRV remains the best choice for detecting renal vein invasion.# Treatment- If the tumor is confined to the kidney, treatment is nephrectomy with removal of the perinephric fat.- Nephrectomy can be performed through a loin or a transverse or oblique upper abdominal incision. The transab- dominal approach has the advantage that the renal pedicle and the IVC can be widely exposed.- The vascular pedicle should be ligated before the kidney is mobilised because handling the tumor may cause malignant cells to be released into the circulation.- Adenocarcinoma of the kidney does not respond well to radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapy. There have been early promising results from clinical trials of the cytokine interleukin-2 in this condition.- Conventional surgical treatment is by nephroureterectomy.- Percutaneous resection of these cancers is controversial.Also know:WILMS' TUMOR (Syn.

Liver and bone metastases are rare; and brain metastases even more so.# Lymphatic spread is uncommon.# The presence of bone secondaries favours a diagnosis of nephroblastoma, another renal tumor of childhood.# Rx: Nephrectomy should be performed as soon as possible and followed by radiotherapy with or without chemo- therapy.- Partial nephrectomy may be possible in patients with bilateral disease.# Prognosis- Under 1 year of age 80 per cent survive for 5 years, but the prognosis is less good in older children.- Recurrences usually occur within a year, so a child surviving for 18 months or more is probably cured.- NATIONAL WILMS' TUMOR STUDY GROUP (NWTS) STAGING SYSTEM (post-chemotheraphy based staging system in Wilms tumor).

Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent.She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Persistent foramen ovale,Patent ductus aeriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Pulmonary stenosis,"Patent ductus aeriosus.The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-likemurmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",B
All of the following are features of musculocutaneous nerve injury at axilla except,Loss of flexion of shoulder,Weak elbow flexion,Weak forearm supination,Loss of sensation on radial side of forearm,"Loss of flexion of shoulder* Flexion at shoulder is done by major muscles like pectoralis major, anterior fibres of deltoid, which are intact here. Musculocutaneous nerve (MCN)originates from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus of nerves. It pierces the coracobrachialis muscle and gives off branches to the muscle, as well as to brachialis and biceps brachii, the chief flexors at elbow joint. Coraco-brachialis is a flexor at shoulder joint Biceps brachii is a powerful supinator, hence supination is weakened. MCN terminates as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.",A

Five-year survival rates in excess of 20% may be expected following resection of pulmonary metastases if,Other organ metastases are present,Lung lesions are solitary,Local tumor recurrence is found,The tumor doubling time is less than 20 days,"Resection of metastases of lung, liver, and brain can result in occasional 5-year cures. In general, surgery should be undertaken only when the primary tumor is controlled, diffuse metastatic disease has been ruled out, and the affected patient's condition and the location of the metastasis permit safe resection. Five-year survival rates as high as 18% have been reported for selected patients with liver metastases from colorectal primary tumors. However, the best results have come from resection of pulmonary metastases, in which 5-year survival rates exceed those of resection for primary bronchogenic carcinoma. Autopsy reviews have demonstrated that many patients with pulmonary metastases have no other evidence of tumor, which suggests that resectional treatment may be justified even when the lung foci are not solitary. Selection of patients for pulmonary resections may be aided by measurement of tumor doubling times; patients with doubling times greater than 40 days appear to benefit most, while those with doubling times less than 20 days are not significantly helped.",B

Fastest way of shifting potassium intracellularly is aEUR',Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E.C.G. appearance. But an impoant point to note - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - ""Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels"". The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium. for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower p1{. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells :? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ IC ATPase. I.V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelr2. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. * The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. 5' adrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 18 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking ft blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism .for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary IC' elimination in patients with some kidney. function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium polysterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -""Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body"". - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",C

"Desmoid tumor, treatment is:",Local excision,Wide excision,Wide excision with radiotherapy,Radiotherapy,"Desmoid tumors, also known as ""aggressive fibromatosis,"" are soft tissue lesions that behave similarly to other truncal soft tissue sarcomas but have unique characteristics. These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize.
Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection..
Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (-5%) occurs in association with FAP syndrome.
Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or infra-abdominal tumors . The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures.Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patients
Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease.
Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor development.
The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign-appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management.
Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structures.
MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structures.
Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis.


Management: 

Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the t/t of choice for recurrences.
For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested.


Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens(such as tamoxifen).
Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high.
Radiotherapy-""The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined."" — Sabiston


""In summary, for easily resectable disease, surgery alone appears to be the optimal approach, especially in patients with negative microscopic margins. In advanced cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapy can be considered in most patients. A period of close observation is also reasonable because some patients demonstrate regression without any therapy. However, if a patient is symptomatic and not a candidate for surgery, consideration should be given to radiation or chemotherapy to increase the chance of a response.""-Devita Oncology",B

"Semen analysis of a young man who presented with primary infertility revealed low volume, fructose negative ejaculate with azoospermia. Which of the following is the most useful imaging modality to evaluate the cause of his infertility?",Colour duplex ultrasonography of the scrotum,Transrectal ultrasonography,Retrograde urethrography,Spermatic venography,"First lets briefly review the anatomy of male internal genitalia
Sperms are produced in testes and then stored and mature within the epididymis. Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct.
The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large part of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase.

Now coming to the question.

Semen analysis forms an important part of infertility assessment.
Low ejaculatory volume is caused by
retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or
obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct
Azoospermia may be seen in
testicular failure or
obstruction of vas deferens
Absence of fructose suggests
seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction.
A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests → either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles.
The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice.

A 50 yr. old male presents with obstructive symptoms. Biopsy of stomach reveals Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Most appropriate marker for GIST is:,CD 34,CD 117,CD 30,CD 10T2 No Mo Anal Cancer,"Ans is 'b' i.e. CD 117 Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the GI tract and are most frequently located in the stomach (60%-70%). In 1983, Mazur and Clark coined the term GIST to indicate a distinctive subgroup of GI mesenchymal tumor, which could be classified neither as neurogenic nor as smooth muscle derived tumor. Historically, they were presumed to have smooth muscle origin and classified as leiomyomas, leiomyoblastomas, and leiomyosarcoma. They are considered to originated from the interstitial cell of Cajal, an intestinal pacemaker cells. Almost all GISTs (and almost no smooth muscle tumors) express c-KIT (CD117) or the related PDGFRA, as well as CD34. Kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, the ligand for which is stem cell factor. The Kit protein is detected by immunohistochemistry and can reliably distinguish GISTs from true smooth muscle neoplasms. (Note that almost all smooth muscle tumors (and almost no GISTs) express actin and desmin. KIT is used not only for diagnosis but also for targeted therapy of GISTs. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is widely used in the treatment of advanced and metastatic GISTs and has been recently employed in the neo adjuvant and adjuvant set-up with encouraging results. Surgical resection of the localized GIST is the mainstay therapy, as a resection of tumor renders only a chance of cure. The primary goal of surgery is complete resection of the disease with negative margins. GISTs are resistant to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore until the advent of Imatinib, there was no effective treatment available for the unresectable or metastatic GISTs. The development of Imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the management of this disease. Imatinib mesylate (formerly referred to as STI 571, GleevecTM) is a 2-phenylpyrimidine derivative that blocks binding of ATP to ABL tyrosine kinases including c-Kit, c-ABL, bcr-ABL, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRA). Imatinib was developed as a PDGFR inhibitor. The efficacy of Imatinib mesylate as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor was first assessed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is associated with mutation in bcrABL tyrosine kinase similar to the role of KIT in GIST. Prognosis in patients with GIST tumors depends mostly on tumor size and mitotic count, and metastasis. GISTs metastasize through hematogenous route. Usual sites are infra-abdominal, either to the liver, omentum, or peritoneal cavity. (Ref: Devita's Oncology 8/e).",B

What is the most characteristic of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis -,Affects the first born female child,The pyloric tumour is best felt during feeding,The patient is commonly marasmic,Loss of appetite occurs early,"Option (a)

HPS classically presents in a firstborn male child between 3 and 6 weeks of age. However, children outside this age range also are commonly seen, and the disease is not restricted to either male or first borne children.

Option (d)

After vomiting the child has a voracious appetite, that leads to a cycle of feeding and vomiting.

Option (c)

""Greater awareness of pyloric stenosis has led to earlier identification of patients with fewer instances of chronic malnutrition and severe dehydration"" -Nelson 17/e


Option (b)

The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is usually made by palpation - of the typical olive shaped hard pyloric mass located in the right upper quadrant. In healthy infants when palpation is difficult, feeding can help in the diagnosis. After feeding, gastric peristalsis waves may be visible.
After the infant vomits, the abdominal musculature is more relaxed and the mass is easier to palpate. Sedation can also be used to facilitate examination but is usually unnecessary. In cases of doubt, ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis.",B
"A 28-year-old male was injured in a motorcycle accident in which he was not wearing a helmet. On admission to the emergency room he was in severe respiratory distress and hypotensive (blood pressure 80/40 mm. Hg), and appeared cyanotic. He was bleeding profusely from the nose and had an obviously open femur fracture with exposed bone. Breath sounds were decreased on the right side of the chest. The initial management priority should be:",Control of hemorrhage with anterior and posterior nasal packing.,Tube thoracostomy in the right hemithorax.,Endotracheal intubation with inline cervical traction.,Obtain intravenous access and begin emergency type O blood transfusions.,"Airway remains the first priority in the management of any patient with multiple injuries. Control of the airway in a patient with head, face, and neck injury can be extremely challenging. In the patient presented, the best option given for control of the airway is endotracheal intubation with in-line cervical traction. This requires at least two persons, one to maintain the head in the neutral position and one to inse the endotracheal tube under direct vision. An alternative in this case would be emergency cricothyroidotomy, tracheostomy, or needle-jet insufflation. Nasotracheal intubation is not an option in the presence of a mid-face fracture and a nasal hemorrhage. Clearly, attention must also be directed at assuring adequacy of ventilation (potential right pneumothorax), assessing and treating obvious hemorrhage, determining if there is occult intra-abdominal or thoracic hemorrhage, and determining the patient's neurologic status. While management of these other issues can occur simultaneously, they do not take priority over securing an adequate airway. In this patient the airway is so tenuous that time should not be spent obtaining a cross-table cervical spine film and chest film prior to definitive control of the airway.",C

Which of the following would cause an immediate reduction in the amount of potassium leaking out of a cell?,Increasing the permeability of the membrane to potassium,Increasing (hyperpolarizing) the membrane otential,Decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration,Reducing the activity of the sodium-potassium pump,"The amount of potassium leaking out of the cell depends on its driving forces and its membrane conductance. The driving forces are the membrane potential and the concentration gradient. Hyperpolarizing the membrane makes the inside of the cell more negative and therefore, makes it more difficult for potassium to flow out of the cell. Increasing the permeability of the membrane to potassium or decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration increases the flow of potassium out of the cell. Altering the activity of the sodium-potassium pump or the extracellular sodium concentration has no immediate effect on the flow of potassium across the membrane. However, decreasing the activity of the sodium-potassium pump will ultimately depolarize the membrane, increasing the flow of potassium out of the cell.",B

To differentiate between stress incontinence and detrusor instability investigation done is,Cystosurethroscopy,Urodynamic study,MCU,Retograde urethroscopy,Ans is 'b' ie Urodynamic study Genuine stress incontinence is defined as urinary leakage occuring during increased bladder pressure when this is solely due to increased abdominal pressure and not due to increased true detrusor pressure. - It is caused by sphincter weakness. Detrusor instability - this is phasic increase in detrusor pressure (due to phasic contraction of detrusor muscle) giving rise to sensation of urgency of micturition and urge incontinence. It is found in pts with several types of neurogenic bladder dysfunction such as multiple sclerosis (MS) Parkinson disease or following a stroke or ceain types of spinal injury when it is known as detrusor hyperreflexia. Usefulness of Urodynamic testing: 1) Distinguishing genuine stress incontinence from detrusor instability in women. 2) Classification of neurogenic bladder dysfunction 3) Distinguishing bladder outflow obstruction from idiopathic detrusor instability in men. 4) Investigation of incontinence.,B

What gas is used to create pneumoperitoneum -,O2,Nitrogen,CO2,Nitrous dioxide,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., CO2 & ''d' i.e., Nitrous dioxide Choice of Gas for pneumoperitoneum* First Pneumoperitoneum was created by filtered room air. Carbon dioxide 8c N2O are now preferred gas because of increased risk of air embolism with room air.* CO2 is used for insufflation as it is 200 times more diffusible than O2, is rapidly cleared from the body by the lungs and will not support combustion.* N2O is only 68% as rapidly absorbed in blood as CO2. N2O has one advantage over CO2 that it has mild analgesic effect, and so causing no pain if diagnostic laparoscopy is performed under local anaesthesia. For short operative procedures like sterilization or drilling, under local anaesthetic N2O may also be used. During prolonged laparoscopic procedure N2O should not be a preferred gas for pneumoperitoneum because it supports combustion better than air.* CO2 when come in contact with peritoneal fluid converts into carbonic acid. Carbonic acid irritates diaphragm causing shoulder tip pain & discomfort in abdomen. Carbonic acid has one advantage also that it alters pH of peritoneal fluid (acidotic changes) and it is mild antiseptic so the chances of infection may be slightly less compared to any other gas.* Helium gas being inert in nature is also tried in many centers but it does not have any added benefit over CO2.",C

"In case of choledochal cyst, bile diversion into the small intestine is not done because of the risk of -",Malignancy,Pancreatitis,Recurrent Cholangitis,All,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Recurrent Cholangitis Schwaz writes ? ""The cyst wall is composed of fibrous tissue and is devoid of mucosal lining. As a result, the treatment of choledochal cyst is surgical excision followed by biliary enteric reconstruction. There is no role for internal drainage by cystenterostomy, which leaves the cyst wall intact and leads to the inevitable development of cholangitis. Rarely, choledachal cyst can lead to the development of biliary tract malignancy. This provides a fuher rationale for complete cyst excision."" Thus we infer that a bypass procedure will inevitably lead to strictures and recurrent cholangitis. This can be prevented by complete excision of cyst and reconstruction procedure. Though by complete excision we also prevent malignancy (which may occur in future), but this is an added advantage",C

Which is not true regarding varicocele -,Testicular veins involved,More common on the right side,May be the first feature of a renal tumour,Feels like a bag of worms,"Ans:B.)More common on Right Side.VaricoceleA varicocele is an abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains blood from the testicles.The varicoceles might be noticed as soft lumps, usually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum. Some people who have them feel pain or heaviness in their scrotum. An obvious varicocele is often described as feeling like a bag of worms.Varicoceles are much more common (approximately 80-90%) in the left testicle than in the right because of several anatomic factors, including the following:The angle at which the left testicular vein enters the left renal veinThe lack of effective antireflux valves at the juncture of the testicular vein and renal veinThe increased renal vein pressure due to its compression between the superior mesenteric aery and the aoa (ie, nutcracker effect).Varicocele may be seen in Renal Tumor due to obstruction of the testicular vein",B

Treatment of Papillary Ca of Thyroid with bony metastasis,Radiotherapy,Radioiodine,Near total thyroidectomy with radiotherapy,Near total thyroidectomy with radioiodine & radiotherapy,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Near total thyroidectomy with radioiodine & radiotherapy As already mentioned in previous question, Total or Near total thyroidectomy is t/t of choice in PTC and also FTC (except minimally invasive cancer). Radioactive iodine '3'1is used post-operatively to detect and destroy any metastatic disease. It is also advised by some expes to do a routine 1311scan and therapy for all patients of differentiated thyroid cancer, postoperatively (except those with occult or minimally invasive disease). Screening with RAI is more sensitive than chest x-ray or CT scanning for detecting metastases; however, it is less sensitive than Tg measurements for detecting metastatic disease in most differentiated thyroid cancers except Huhle cell tumors. External beam radiotherapy is used to treat bone metastasis (to prevent fracture or to control pain). It is also occasionally used to control unresectable, locally invasive or recurrent thyroid carcinoma. There is no role for routine chemotherapy in differentiated thyroid cancers. Other Postop management in differentiated thyroid cancers Thyroid Hormone T4 is given as replacement therapy in patients after total or near-total thyroidectomy, and has the additional effect of suppressing TSH and reducing the growth stimulus for any possible residual thyroid cancer cells. TSH suppression reduces tumor recurrence rates. Thyroglobulin measurement Thyroglobulin (Tg) is produced only by thyroid follicular cells. Following total thyroidectomy, it should be undetectable in serum and any detectable level then indicates the persistence or recurrence of neoplastic disease. This is the basis for the use of Tg as a post-operative tumor marker in the follow-up of thyroid cancer patients Tg levels in patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy should be <2 ng/mL when the patient is taking T4 , and <5 ng/mL when the patient is hypothyroid.",D

D: Recurrent dislocation of shoulder A Hill-Sachs lesion usually results from recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation with resultant posterolateral humeral head compression fracture as the humeral head comes to rest against the anteroinferior pa of the glenoid. It is often associated with a Banka lesion of the glenoid (stripping of the glenoidal labrum along with the periosteum from the anterior surface of the glenoid and scapular neck). Plain film Best seen following re-location of the joint, and better appreciated on internal rotation views. It appears as a sclerotic veical line running from the top of the humeral head towards the shaft. If large then a wedge defect may be evident. CT and MRI Both MRI and CT are very sensitive to this lesion, which appears as a region of flattening or a wedge shaped defect (with bone marrow oedema on MRI acutely) seen involving the posterolateral humeral head above the level of the coracoid. This is usually seen in the most superior few slices, were the humeral head should be rounded. It is impoant to note that below the level of the coracoid the humeral head normally flattens out posterolaterally, and this should not be misinterpreted as a Hill-Sachs lesion",D

What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",Berger's disease,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Goodpasture's disease,Lipoid nephrosis,"Many diseases involve hematuria, and a few of these diseases occur in the setting of an upper respiratory infection or of upper respiratory signs and symptoms. When hematuria follows within 2 days of the onset of an upper respiratory infection without skin lesions in a young patient, IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) should be considered. This disease involves the deposition of IgA in the mesangium of the glomeruli. Light microscopic examination may suggest the disease, but renal biopsy immunofluorescence (IF) must be performed to confirm it. This disorder may be the most common cause of nephritic syndrome worldwide. The hematuria may become recurrent, with proteinuria that may approach nephrotic syndrome propoions. Serum levels of IgA may be elevated. A small percentage of patients may progress to renal failure over a period of years. In contrast to Berger's disease, a linear IF pattern suggests a type II hypersensitivity reaction, such as Goodpasture's disease, while a granular pattern is seen with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN), membranous GN, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranoproliferative GN. Most positive immunofluorescence patterns involve IgG and C3, except that a granular IgM pattern is present in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, while mesangial IgA is seen in IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease).

Which of the following is the most effective definitive therapy for both prevention of recurrent variceal hemorrhage and control of ascites?,Endoscopic sclerotherapy.,Distal splenorenal shunt.,Esophagogastric devascularization (Sugiura procedure),Side-to-side poacaval shunt,"Shunt operations are the most effective means of preventing recurrent variceal hemorrhage. Rebleeding rates after endoscopic sclerotherapy range from 40% to 60%. Although extensive esophagogastric devascularization has effectively prevented recurrent bleeding in Japanese series, these operations have been followed by rebleeding rates in excess of 25% in most Western series. Although one controlled trial has shown more frequent recurrent hemorrhage following the distal splenorenal shunt than after the poacaval shunt, most series have repoed rebleeding rates of less than 10% for both of these operations. Both the liver and the splanchnic viscera are impoant sites of ascites formation. Since the distal splenorenal shunt maintains sinusoidal and mesenteric venous hypeension and requires interruption of impoant retroperitoneal lymphatics, it tends to aggravate rather than relieve ascites. Hepatic sinusoidal pressure may be unchanged or even increased after an end- to-side poacaval shunt. Only side-to-side poal-systemic shunts, such as the side-to-side poacaval shunt, reliably decompress both the liver and splanchnic viscera, thus preventing ascites formation.",D
Trendelenberg test is positive in palsy of,Gluteus maximus,Gluteus medius,Rectus femoris,Vastus medialis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Gluteus medius Trendelenberg test : It tests the stability of the hip and paicularly of the abductor mechanism of the limb on which the patient is standing. Principle of the test : Normally when one leg is raised from the ground the pelvis tilts upwaras on that side, through the action of the hip abductors of the standing limb. If the abductors are inefficient they are unable to sustain the pelvis against the body weight and it tilts downwards instead of rising up on the side of the lifted leg. Note that the test is performed with the patients standing on the affected leg. Abductor mechanism : It can be compared with the lever, with the body weight being trying to tilt the pelvis down; the hip joint being the fulcrum and the abductor muscles being the power acting throught the lever arm (from the head of the femur to attachment of the abductor muscles on the greater trochanter - the neck of the femur). Causes of positive trendelenberg test : Any failure of abductor mechanism causes dipping of the pelvic (ASIS) on the normal side. There are three fundamental causes : 1) Paralysis of the abductor muscles (Supplies gluteus medius & minimus) eg. Polio. Paralysis of superior gluteral nerve 2) Marked approximation of the inseion of the abductor muscles to their origin by upward displacement of the greater trochanter ; so that the muscles are slack. eg. Severe coxa vara, dislocation of hip 3) Absence of stable fulcrum & lever arm about which the abductor muscles can act Neck femur fracture Dislocation of hip, Destructruction of head as in Pehe's diseases.",B
"A 26 year old man presents to his physician with a chronic cough. The man is a smoker, and states that he also gets frequent headaches and aches in his legs when he exercises. Chest x-ray demonstrates notching of his ribs. Which of the following undiagnosed congenital defects may be responsible for these findings?",Coarctation of the aoa,Eisenmenger's syndrome,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition of great vessels,"Coarctation of the aoa occurs in two patterns. In the infantile type, the stenosis is proximal to the inseion of the ductus aeriosus (preductal); this pattern is associated with Turner's syndrome. In the adult form, the stenosis is distal to the ductus aeriosus (postductal) and is associated with notching of the ribs (secondary to continued pressure from the aoa on them), hypeension in the upper extremities, and weak pulses in the lower extremities. Headache, cold extremities, and lower extremity claudication with exercise are typical if the patient is symptomatic (many adults with mild distal coarctation may remain asymptomatic for years). Upper extremity hypeension with weak pulses in the lower extremities, and a midsystolic (or continuous) murmur over the chest or back may be the only obvious signs in some. Note that the chronic cough is probably related to the man's smoking, and is not caused by the coarctation.

They always result in some degree of cailage damage. Ideally the joint surface should be restored to their original position and held there strongly enough that movement may be staed in the early postoperative period. some permanent loss of motion is to be expected and joint may develop degenerative ahritis as a result of the injury. Principles of intra aicular fracture Immobilization of intra aicular fracture results in joint stiffness Immobilization of aicular fracture, treated by open reduction and internal fixation, results in much greater stiffness. Depressed aicular fragments, which do not reduce as a result of closed manipulation and traction, are impacted and will not reduced by closed means. Major aicular depression do not fill with fibrocailage and the instability which results from their displacement, is permanent. Anatomical reduction and stable fixation of aicular fragment is necessary to restore joint congruity. Immediate motion is necessary to prevent joint stiffness and to ensure aicular healing and recovery. This require stable internal fixation. Radius fracture treatment ( of distal end i.e. intra aicular pa) K wire fixation may be helpful for smaller fragments. cast immobilization is indicated for nondisplaced fracture, displaced fractures with a stable fracture pattern. The cast should be worn approximately 6 weeks or until radiographic evidence of union has occured. Ahrodesis In this operation, fusion is achieved between the bones forming a joint so as to eliminate any motion at the joint. An ahrodesis is used most often for a painful, stiff joint. It is also performed for grossly unstable joints in polio etc. It is also used for grossly unstable joint due to trauma. Excision and aspiration of hematoma excision of damaged poion of bone and aspiration of intra aicular hematoma, are also included in management of intra aicular fracture.

Absolute contraindication of conservative breast cancer therapy is,Large pendulous breast,History of previous radiation,Axillary node involvement,Subareolar lump present,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. History of previous radiation Conservative breast cancer management: Absolute Contraindications Pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to the use of breast irradiation. However, in many cases, it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and treat the patient with irradiation after delivery. Women with two or more primary tumors in separate quadrants of the breast or with diffuse malignant-appearing microcalcifications are not considered candidate for breast conservation treatment. A history of prior therapeutic irradiation to the breast region that would require retreatment to an excessively high total-radiation dose to a significant volume is another absolute contraindication. Persistent positive margins after reasonable surgical attempts. Relative Contraindications A history of collagen vascular disease is a relative contraindication to breast conservation treatment because published repos indicate that such patients tolerate irradiation poorly. Most radiation oncologists will not treat patients with scleroderma or active lupus erythematosus, considering it an absolute contraindication. In contrast, rheumatoid ahritisis not a relative or an absolute contraindication. The presence of multiple gross tumors in the same quadrant and indeterminate calcifications must be carefully assessed for suitability because studies in this area are not definitive. Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication to breast conservation treatment, although there is little published experience in treating patients with tumor sizes greater than four to five cm. However, a relative contraindication is the presence of a large tumor in a small breast in which an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. In this circumstance, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered. Breast size can be a relative contraindication. Large pendulous breast is a relative contraindication, as it presents difficulty in delivering a uniform radiation dose. Centrally located tumor for which removal of the nipple areola complex is required to obtain a tumor free margin is a relative contraindication. It depends on patient acceptability. The nipple and areola can now be reconstructed.",B

CNS is paicularly vulnerable to toxicity & is the site of premonitory signs of overdose in awake patients. Coical inhibitory pathways are most susceptible resulting in excitatory motor phenomenon in initial stages of LA toxicity. Hypercapnia, respiratory & metabolic acidosis exacerbates CNS toxicityQ. Increased PaCO2 increases cerebral blood flow delivering greater dose of LA more rapidly to brain. And decreased intracellular pH ours formation of non diffusable cationic (protonated) form of LA, which is trapped within neuron. Finally plasma protein binding of LA is decreased in acidic environment resulting in increased availability of free drug for diffusion into brain.

'Hippocrates facies' are seen in,Peritonitis,Pancreatitis,Facial nerve injury,Marginal mandibular nerve injury,"Ans. A. Peritonitis. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 973; Fig. 61.6)Diffuse (generalised) peritonitis# Diffuse (generalised) peritonitis may present in differing ways dependent on the duration of infection.# Early- Abdominal pain is severe and made worse by moving or breathing.- It is first experienced at the site of the original lesion and spreads outwards from this point. Vomiting may occur. The patient usually lies still. Tenderness and rigidity on palpation are found typically when the peritonitis affects the anterior abdominal wall. Abdominal tenderness and rigidity are diminished or absent if the anterior wall is unaffected, as in pelvic peritonitis or, rarely, peritonitis in the lesser sac. Patients with pelvic peritonitis may complain of urinary symptoms; they are tender on rectal or vaginal examination. Infrequent bowel sounds may still be heard for a few hours but they cease with the onset of paralytic ileus.- The pulse rises progressively but, if the peritoneum is deluged with irritant fluid, there is a sudden rise. The temperature changes are variable and can be subnormal.# Late- If resolution or localisation of generalised peritonitis does not occur, the abdomen remains silent and increasingly distends.- Circulatory failure ensues, with cold, clammy extremities, sunken eyes, dry tongue, thready (irregular) pulse and drawn and anxious face (Hippocratic facies). The patient finally lapses into unconsciousness. With early diagnosis and adequate treatment, this condition is rarely seen in modem surgical practice.Additional Educational points:Clinical features of an abdominal/pelvic abscess# Malaise, Sweats with or without rigors, Abdominal/pelvic (with or without shoulder tip) pain, Anorexia and weight loss, Symptoms from local irritation, e.g. hiccoughs (subphrenic), diarrhoea and mucus (pelvic), Swinging pyrexia, and Localised abdominal tenderness/mass.",A

Double Bubble sign is seen with:,Pyloric stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Ileal atresia,Esophageal atresia,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Duodenal atresia ""The ultrasound hallmark of duodenal atresia is the 'double bubble sign'. This consists of two adjacent, fluid-filled cavities in the upper abdomen: a lateral and usually somewhat larger cavity representing the dilated stomach, and a medial cavity representing the distended proximal duodenum between the pylorus and the stenosis.""- Ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology By Eberhard Merz, F. Bahlmann 2/e p298Double bubble sign:The double bubble sign is a finding observed on radiographs of newborns and infants. It is reproducible with a variety of other imaging modalities, including upper gastrointestinal studies and prenatal sonography. The finding depicts two air-filled structures in the upper abdomen, with little or no air distally. Horizontal-beam radiographs will demonstrate air and fluid levels in both bubbles.The first bubble (proximal and left sided) is - stomachThe second bubble (to the right of the midline) is - duodenumThe detection of the double bubble sign leads to suspicion of a number of structural anomalies, all of which cause duodenal obstruction.Causes:Intrinsic causes areExtrinsic causes are- duodenal atresia,- annular pancreas,- duodenal stenosis,- malrotation of the gut with obstruction produced byandmidgut volvulus or by Ladd bands, and- duodenal webs;- preduodenal position of the portal vein.The specific duodenal structural anomaly causing the obstruction determines the appearance, prominence, and presence of air distal to the obstruction. Duodenal atresia produces complete obstruction, partially obstructing anomalies, such as duodenal web or duodenal stenosis, allow passage of some air distal to the obstruction and a less dramatic double bubble.",B

Thickened peripheral nerves are seen in all the following conditions except,Hansen's neuropathy,Amyloid polyneuropathy,Diabetic neuropathy,Refsum's disease,"Diabetic neuropathy is due to conversion of sugar to sorbitol which causes nerve demyelination; neuropathy is distal, diffuse with a stocking distribution; it takes around 10 years to develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose forms sorbitol by aldose reductase enzyme and galactose forms galactitol. If sorbitol level raises it gets trapped in peripheral nerves, retina and lens causing neuropathy, cataract and retinopathy. There may be formation of abnormal aeriovenous communications under the skin leads into nerve ischaemia and neuropathy. Sensory neuropathy causes loss of vibration sense, sense of position, touch, pain and temperature. Sensation may be absent in the entire sole due to medial and plantar nerve involvement. Foot feels like dead with like walking in the sand and prone for minor repeated traumas which are not noticed by the patient. Motor neuropathy causes paralysis of intrinsic muscles of foot leading into claw toes and hammer toe. Longitudinal arch of the foot becomes flat causing loss of foot curvature; loss of joint position and Loss of foot muscle strength leads into altered gait and positions of foot leading into the deep seated trophic ulcers over the heads of the metatarsals. Autonomic neuropathy causes absence of sweating and loss of skin elasticity making more prone for breakdown and infection. Autosympathectomy is common in diabetics involving foot area.

In which the, first is stage of hematoma formationQ and the last is stage of remodelingQ Fracture Healing Bone is a unique tissue because it heals by the formation of normal bone, as opposed to scar tissue. Infact it is considered a nonunion when a bone heals by fibroblastic response. The majority of fractures heal by secondary (callus) healing through a combination of intramembranous - ossification (hard callus formation) & endochondral ossificaion (soft callus formation). Bone healing can be divided into following phases depending on the biological events. * There are two sources of repair tissues (callus), medullary & periosteal. The former is most marked in cancellous hone, while the later predominates in diaphyseal fracture. Periosteal callus may be of two types - primary callus (from DOPC) & external bridging callus (from IOPC), its appearance is inhibited by rigid fixation as plate and is predominant form of healing in cast immobilization &intramedullary nailing. (i.e. micromovements present) * Late medullary callus is more dependent on intramedullary vascularity (not on external soft trissue) and is impoant in fractures immobilized by rigid plating (i.e. no micrmovements)* Phenomenon of Creeping Substitution occurs in cancellous bone (i.e. blood vessels invading the trabeculae of bone directly causing bone apposition)* The modification of previously undifferentiated soft tissue cells in to osteogenic cells (IOPC) is termed bone induction.",A

All are false except one in case of hyperophic pyloric stenosis -,Symptomatic within one week,Lump is always clinically palpable,T/t of choice is Finney's pyloroplasty,Ultrasonography is diagnostic test,"Ans is 'd' ie USG is diagnostic test Hyperophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS) The musculature of the pylorus and adjacent antrum is grossly hyperophied, the hyperophy being maximum in the pylorus itself. It occurs in approximately 3 in 1000 live bih and is the most common surgical cause of vomitting in infancy. M > F (4 : 1)* Characterstically the first born male child is affected. The conditon is most commonly seen at 4 wks after bih ranging from the 3rd wk to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from bih, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after bih. Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fouh week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t. These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions. "" The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on physical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the right upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen. When the olive cannot be palpated, ultrasound in experienced hands will diagnose the condition accurately in 95 percent of pts."" - Schwaz. Treatment - Pyloric stenosis is never a surgical emergency although dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities may present a medical emergency Fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte abnormalities and metabolic alkalosis is essential before surgery. - Surgery : Fredet-Ramstedt pyloromyotomy.

Two weeks following the initial management of this patient's chylothorax there is persistent accumulation of chyle in the pleural space. Appropriate management at this time includes which of the following procedures?,Neck exploration and ligation of the thoracic duct,Subdiaphragmatic ligation of the thoracic duct,Thoracotomy and repair of the thoracic duct,Thoracotomy and ligation of the thoracic duct,"Chylothorax May occur after intrathoracic surgery, or it may follow malignant invasion or compression of the thoracic duct. Intraoperative recognition of a thoracic duct injury is managed by double ligation of the duct. Injuries not recognized until several days after intrathoracic surgery frequently heal following the institution of a low-fat diet and either repeated thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy drainage. A low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet often reduces the flow of chyle. Failure of this treatment modality requires direct surgical ligation of the thoracic duct. This is best approached from below the diaphragm(Sub Diaphragmatic)",B
True about stomach carcinoma -,Weightloss is commonest feature,Secondaries are most commonly seen in peritoneum & omentum,Lymphatic & hematogenous spread are rare,Barium meal is diagnostic,"Answer 'a' i.e. Weightloss is commonest feature Symptoms of gastric cancer Earliest symptom is usually vague postprandial abdominal heaviness Most common symptom is weight loss Other symptoms are: - anorexia - abdominal pain (usually not severe) vomiting may be present and becomes a major feature if pyloric obstruction occurs. It may have coffee-ground colour due to bleeding by the tumor. - dysphagia may be the presenting symptom if the lesion is at the cardia. Paraneoplastic symptoms such as - Trousseau's syndrome (thrombophlebitis) - Acanthosis nigricans (hyperpigmentation of the axilla and groin) - Peripheral neuropathy Option b & c Spread of gastric carcinoma - intramural spread within the submucosa - direct spread through the gastric walls - lymphatic spread hematogenous - transperitoneal through peritoneal seedlings about option 'b' - I am not very sure, but it appears to be uncorrect. Most common secondaries are noted in intrabdominal and supraclavicular lymphnodes. Liver is the most common site for hematogenous spread of tumor (Harrison 16/e, p 525) Option 'd' - Barium meal is -75% sensitive for gastric cancer and is the simplest study to perform but it is not confirmatory. Endoscopy with biopsy is always needed if gastric Ca is suspected, to confirm the diagnosis. Harrison 16/e, p 526 writes - ""Gastric adenocarcinoma is a relatively radioresistant tumor and adequate control of the primary tumor requires doses of external beam irradiation that exceeds the tolerance of surrounding structures, such as the bowel mucosa and the spinal cord.

During the interdigestive period, the GI tract undergoes regular increases in peristaltic contractile activity at about every 90 mm that are termed migrating motor complexes. Originally recorded from the small intestine, they begin in the smooth muscle of the esophagus or the stomach. They are commonly associated with periodic increases in the hormone motilin. Although it is still unclear, they appear to serve a ""house keeping function"" by clearing the GI tract of luminal contents. They are immediately interrupted when a meal is ingested.",B

Which of the following is NOT TRUE about intermittent claudication?,Most common in calf muscle,Pain is positional,Atherosclerosis is impoant predisposing factor,Relieved by rest,"Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. Intermittent claudication: It refers to the pain or fatigue in muscles of the lower limb caused by walking and relieved by rest. Claudication is derived from the latin word for ""liping, lame"", strictly speaking, the term should be used only for symptoms in the lower extremities. The pain is a deep seated ache usually in the calf muscle, which gradually progressive until the patient is compelled to stop walking. Patient occasionally describe ""cramping""or ""tiredness""in the muscle. Typically, symptoms are completely relieved after 2-5 min of inactivity. Claudication is distinguished from other types of pain in lower extremity in that some exeion is always required before it appears; it is reproducible; it does not occur at rest; and it is relieved by cessation of walking. Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. The distance a patient can walk varies with the rate of walking, the level of incline, and the degree of aerial obstruction. The average patient with involvement of a single aerial segment can walk 90-180 meters on a level terrain at a moderate pace before pain appears. Regardless of which aerial segment is involved, claudication most commonly involves the calf muscles due to their high workload with normal walking. The correct diagnosis should be easily established by determining the location of pain (calf), the quality of the pain, the length of the time required for relief of symptoms, the reproducibility of symptoms, the distance walked before symptoms begin (initial claudication distance), and the type of rest or position required for relief of symptoms. Although most patients with the disorder do not develop gangrene or require amputations, adverse outcomes of systemic atherosclerosis, including death are common. There is increasing interests in the use of the ankle- brachial index ( ABI ). Normal is >1. Claudication are in the 0.6- 0.9 range. with the rest pain and gangrene occurring at rest <0.3. Indications for surgery include disabling claudication (severely limiting work or lifestyle), rest pain, limb threatening ischemia, and microembolization of the toes in which no other source is identified. Claudication distance will vary from day to day and will altered by walking up hill, and speed of walking of against the wind. Characteristically this pain is worse at night and is worsened by elevation of the extremity, whereas it is somewhat relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed or by sleeping in a chair. Tis rest pain is mainly due to ischemic changes in the somatic nerves, so it is the cry of the dying nerves. Ref: L & B 25/e, page 899 ; Textbook of Surgery By S. Das 5/e, page 151",B

Protein metabolism after trauma is characterized by the following except:-,A.Increased liver gluconeogenesis,B.Inhibition of skeletal muscle breakdown by interleukin 1 and tumour necrosis factor,C.Increased urinary nitrogen loss,D.Hepatic synthesis of acute phase reactants,"The average protein intake in healthy young adults range from 80- 120g/dl and every 6g of protein yields about 1g of nitrogen. After injury the initial systemic proteolysis mediated primarily by glucocoicoids , increases urinary nitrogen excretion to excess of 30g/dl, roughly corresponds to a loss in lean body mass of 1.5% per day.An injured individual who does not receive nutrition for 10 days can theoritically loose 15% of lean body mass. Protein catabolism after injury provides substrates for gluconeogenesis and for the synthesis of acute phase proteins. Skeletal muscle proteins are the first to deplete acutely after an injury whereas visceral proteins remain relatively preserved. Severe trauma , burns , and sepsis are associated with increased protein catabolism. The rise in urinary nitrogen and negative nitrogen balance can be detected early after injury and peak by 7 days. Protein catabolism may persist upto 3-7 weeks.",B
"While doing spinal anesthesia, the drug get deposited between:",Pia and arachnoid,Dura and arachnoid,Dura and veebrae,Into the spinal cord,"In spinal anaesthesia, local anaesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space, between pia and arachnoid, blocks conduction of impulses along all nerves with which it comes in contact.

Which of the following is the most likely reason for this?",Propofol,Succinylcholine,Due to surgery,Early mobilization,"Ans. b. Succinylcholine (Ref: Miller's Anesthesia 8/e p866; Morgan 4/e p210-215; Lee 13/e p181-191)Succinylcholine is a short acting depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes initial fasciculations during induction. It can cause muscle soreness and post-op muscle pain.Succinylcholine (Scoline, Suxamethonium or Diacetylcholine)Suxamethonium chloride, a dicholine ester of acetyl cholineA clear, colorless aqueous solution of pH 3.0-5.0 with a shelf life of 2 yearsQStored at 4degCQSpontaneous hydrolysis occurs in alkaline or warm conditionsQ.Metabolism:Sch is the only depolarizing (non-competitive) muscle relaxantQ in clinical use.It is the only neuromuscular blocker with a rapid onset of action (30-60 seconds) and ultra short (shortest) duration of actionQ (3-5 min; typically < 10 min).Its rapid onset effect is mainly due to its low lipid solubilityQ and relatively overdose that is administered.The short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase or pseudocholinesteraseQ).Dibucaine number indicates the percentage of inhibition of pseudocholinesteraseQ (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme activity by local anesthetic dibucaine and it is a measure of qualitative activity of pseudocholinesterase.The dibucaine number indicates the genetic make up of an individual with respect to butyrylcholinesterase. it does not measure the concentration of enzyme in plasma, nor does it indicate the efficiency of enzyme in hydrolysing substrate succinylcholine or mivacuriumQ.Dibucaine number is proportional to enzyme function (quality) and independent of amount of enzyme (i.e. quantity)Q.Prolonged paralysis from succinylcholine caused by atypical (abnormal) pseudochoiinesterase should be treated with continued mechanical ventilation until muscle fasciculation returns to normalQ. Anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine are avoidedQ, as these may prolong the effect of Sch.Side Effects:Sch is a relatively safe drug but because of risk of hyperkalemia, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrest (profound bradycardia) in children with undiagnosed myopathies, Sch is considered contraindicated in routine management of children and adolescent.Side effects of Succinylcholine include an increase in* Muscle tone (masseter spasm)Q* Muscle fasciculations (signal onset of paralysis)Q* Muscle pains or myalgia (MC complication)Q* Hyperkalemia leading to diastolic cardiac arrest refractory to CPRQ* Introcutar, intracranial, intra abdominal, intragastric pressure and opening pressure of lower esophageal sphincter (all increased)* Malignant hyperthermiaQManagement of Side-effects:Sinus bradycardias, nodal (junctional rhythms and ventricular dysrhythmiasQ occur. Children are particularly susceptible to profound bradycardia. Intravenous atropine is prophylactically, given to children prior to first dose and always before a 2nd dose.Side effects especially myalgia and fasciculation can be prevented by precurarization, self-taming with IV scoline, IV lignocaine and faster infusion. But pretreatment with small doses of nondeplarizing relaxant (e.g. rocuronium) remain the most commonly used methodQMalignant Hyperpyrexia:Autosomal dominantPredisposing conditions: Duchene muscular dystrophyQ, HalothaneQ and Succinyl cholineQTreatment: DantroleneQ, bromocriptine and external cooling",B

The resulting inflammation may be confined to the peri colonic tissue (uncomplicated diverticulitis) or result in abscess, free perforation, fistulization, or obstruction (complicated diverticulitis). The clinical spectrum is correspondingly broad ranging from mild symptoms to peritonitis and sepsis. Patients with signs and symptoms of sepsis should be hospitalized and undergo diagnostic study. A CT scan is the best study to evaluate the extent of the inflammatory process as well as to exclude other pathology. Plain x-ray would not reveal specific pathology. Both barium enema and colonoscopy in the acute setting are risky and may cause free perforation and contamination of the peritoneal cavity there by converting a localized process to generalized peritonitis. Barium has the additional risk of a chemical peritonitis caused by the barium itself. Diagnostic laparoscopy is invasive and may risk spreading a localized process.",D

Orchidopexy for cryptorchidism is done at the age of:,1 to 2 years,5 to 6 years,Pubey,Neonatal period,"FAST Schwaz writes- ""Blunt abdominal trauma initially is evaluated by FAST examination in most major trauma centers, and this has largely supplanted DPL, FAST is not 100% sensitive, however, so diagnostic peritoneal aspiration is still advocated in hemodynamically unstable patients without a defined source of blood loss to rule out abdominal hemorrhage. Patients with fluid on FAST examination, considered a positive FAST', who do not have immediate indications. for laparotomy and are hemodynamically stable undergo CT scanning to quantify their injuries."" Sabiston v,rites - Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT. unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or. focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate surgical exploration. The main decision in an abdominal injury is to decide whether an exploratory laparotomy is necessary or not. Physical examination though may help sometimes, has significant limitations and may be unreliable. The diagnostic approach to penetrating (Gunshot and Stab wounds) and blunt abdominal trauma differs substantially. Gunshot abdominal wounds: Chances of internal injury is very high in gunshot wounds thus little preoperative evaluation is required and laparotomy is mandatory. Stab wounds to abdomen: In contrast to GSWs, SWs are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs. Patients with isolated penetrating abdominal wound if hypotensive, or in shock or showing peritoneal signs go for exploratory laparotomy. Management of stable patients is debatable and controversial. Various methods are used to determine whether laparotomy is necessary or not. Anterior stab wound- In ant. stab wounds local wound exploration can be performed to determine if there is any penetration of the peritoneal cavity. If the tract terminates without entering the peritoneum, the injury can be managed as a deep laceration and laparotomy is not needed. Otherwise, penetration of the peritoneum is assumed, and significant injury must be excluded by fuher diagnostic evaluations. Options include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, CT, FAST, and admission with observation. Flank and back wounds- There is more debate over the management of stab wounds to the flank and back. These injuries are special because of the risks associated with retroperitoneal organ injury-colon, kidneys and ureter. Triple contrast CT (i.e. oral, IV, and rectal contrast) is advised to detect colon and retroperitoneal injuries and the need for laparotomy. Other methods like DPL, laparoscopy arc also advised. Blunt abdominal injury: Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT (CT in selected cases to refine the diagnosis) unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focussed abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out infra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate exploratory laparotomy. US has largely replaced DPL. Management of hemodynamically unstable pt: a hemodynamically unstable pt is evaluated by FAST and if infra-abdominal fluid detected, undergoes laparotomy.",C

Barium swallow shows irregular filling defect in lower esophagus,"1,2,3 true & 4,5 false","1,2,4 true & 3,5 false","1,2,3,4 true & 5 false","1,2,4,5 true & 3 false","Achalasia cardia is motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, and esophageal body undergoes nonspecific contractions. (peristalsis is absent or reduced). The pathogenesis of achalasia is poorly understood. It involves: Neurologic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of auerbach's myenteric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve) Pharmacological studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus. The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advance disease. As a result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and touous. Clinical Presentation: Both sexes are equally affected. It may develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60 years of age. Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating. Diagnosis: Chest X-ray shows absence of gastric air bubbles, an air fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in the esophagus. Barium swallow shows a dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus, described as 'BIRD BEAK' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower third of the esophagus. Treatment includes heller's cardiomyotomy, forceful dilation by pneumatic balloon, repeated injection botulinum toxins and drugs improving motility of esophagus. Esophagectomy is not a treatment modality for achalasia cardia. Irregular filling defect is a feature of carcinoma esophagus not of achalasia cardia.

Most common subtype of Basal cell carcinoma is: March 2005,Superficial basal cell carcinoma,Nodular basal cell carcinom,Sclerosing basal cell carcinoma,Pigmented basal cell carcinoma,"Ans. B: Nodular basal cell carcinoma Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma: Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of basal cell carcinoma and usually presents as a round, pearly, flesh-colored papule with telangiectases. As it enlarges, it frequently ulcerates centrally, leaving a raised, pearly border with telangiectases, which aids in making the diagnosis. Most tumors are observed on the face, although the trunk and extremities also are affected Cystic basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma, cystic basal cell carcinoma is often indistinguishable from nodular basal cell carcinoma clinically, although it might have a polypoid appearance Pigmented basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma that has brown-black macules in some or all areas, often making it difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Morpheaform (sclerosing) basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant in which tumor cells induce a proliferation of fibroblasts within the dermis and an increased collagen deposition (sclerosis) that clinically resembles a scar.

Sister Joseph Nodules are present at: March 2005,Umbilicus,Diaphragm,Lung,Liver,"Ans. A: Umbilicus Sister Mary Joseph nodule/node/ Sister Mary Joseph sign, refers to a palpable nodule bulging into the umbilicus as a result of metastasis of a malignant cancer in the pelvis or abdomen. Gastrointestinal malignancies account for about half of underlying sources (most commonly gastric cancer, colonic cancer or pancreatic cancer, mostly of the tail and body of the pancreas), and men are even more likely to have an underlying cancer of the gastrointestinal tract. Gynecological cancers account for about 1 in 4 cases (primarily ovarian cancer and also uterine cancer). Unknown primary tumors and rarely, urinary or respiratory tract malignancies cause umbilical metastases. Proposed mechanisms for the spread of cancer cells to the umbilicus include direct transperitoneal spread, the lymphatics which run alongside the obliterated umbilical vein, hematogenous spread, or remnant structures such as the falciform ligament, median umbilical ligament, or a remnant of the vitelline duct.

A 63-year-old man undergoes a screening colonoscopy and is found to have a polyp in his sigmoid colon. Which type of polyp is most associated with malignancy?,Tubular adenoma,Villous adenoma,Tubulovillous adenoma,1 cm polyp,"Adenomatous polyps are common, occurring in up to 25% of the population older than 50 years of age in the United States. By definition, these lesions are dysplastic. The risk of malignant degeneration is related to both the size and type of polyp. Tubular adenomas are associated with malignancy in only 5% of cases, whereas villous adenomas may harbor cancer in up to 40%. Tubulovillous adenomas are at intermediate risk (22%). Invasive carcinomas are rare in polyps smaller than 1 cm; the incidence increases with size. The risk of carcinoma in a polyp larger than 2 cm is 35 to 50%. Although most neoplastic polyps do not evolve to cancer, most colorectal cancers originate as a polyp.",B

Which of the following is the mechanism of action of local anaesthetic?,Block Na+ channel,Block K+ channel,Open Na+ channel,Block Ca++ channel,"preventing channel activation and inhibiting the Na influx associated with membrane depolarization. Local anesthetic binding to Na channels does not alter the resting membrane potential. With increasing local anesthetic concentrations, an increasing fraction of the Na channels in the membrane bind a local anesthetic molecule and cannot conduct Na ions. As a consequence, impulse conduction slows, the rate of rise and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation and impulse conduction increases progressively. At high enough local anesthetic concentrations and with a sufficient fraction of local anesthetic-bound Na channels, an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished.

VDRL test performed on the patient having painless penile ulcer for 2 week is reactive at a dilution of 1:4 (4dilutions). The patient also repos to you that he has recently been diagnosed with hepatitis A which one of the following actions would be most appropriate?,Order a confirmatory test such as FTA test,Order a rapid plasma region (RPR) test,Perform a spinal tap to rule out CNS syphilis,Repeat the VDRL test,"This patient appears to have primary syphilis, as evidenced by a penile chancre that was not tender. One ofthe differences between syphilis and herpes simplex virus (HSV) is that an HSV lesion is excruciatingly painful. Treponemal organisms may be seen microscopically in the lesion if the lesion is scraped. If not treated, the chancre will disappear and the patient will be asymptomatic until he/she exhibits the signs/symptoms of secondary syphilis, which include a disseminated rash and systemic involvement such as meningitis, hepatitis, or nephritis. There are two kinds of tests for the detection of syphilis antibodies: non- specific tests such as the RPR and VORL, and specific tests such as the FT A, TPHA (T pallidum hemagglutination test), and the MHTP (microhemagglutination-T pallidum). The difference is that the nonspecific tests use a cross- reactive antigen known as cardiolipin, while the specific tests use a T pallidum antigen. Although the nonspecific tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and often cross- react in patients who have diabetes, hepatitis, or infectious mononucleosis, or who are pregnant. Some patients, especially those with autoimmune diseases, will have both nonspecific (RPR) and specific tests (FTA) positive even if they do not have syphilis. Resolution of such a situation can be done by molecular methods for T pallidum, such as PCR, or by the immobilization test using live spirochetes and the patient's serum. In the TPI test, the spirochetes will die in the presence of specific antibody.",A

Hydroceles also may arise in the spermatic cord or the canal of Nuck.> Structurally, hydroceles are classified into 3 principal types.> In a communicating (congenital) hydrocele, a patent processus vaginalis permits flow of peritoneal fluid into the scrotum. Indirect inguinal hernias are associated with this type of hydrocele.> In a noncommunicating hydrocele, a patent processus vaginalis is present, but no communication with the peritoneal cavity occurs.> In a hydrocele of the cord, the closure of the tunica vaginalis is defective. The distal end of the processus vaginalis closes correctly, but the mid portion of the processus remains patent. The proximal end may be open or closed in this type of hydrocele.> Hydroceles are located superior and anterior to the testis, in contrast to spermatoceles, which lie superior and posterior to the testis.> Hydrocele is bilateral in 7-10% of cases.> Hydrocele often is associated with hernia, especially on the right side of the body.> The size and the palpable consistency of hydroceles can vary with position. Hydrocele usually becomes smaller and softer after lying down it usually becomes larger and tenser after prolonged standing.> Systemic signs of toxicity are absent. The patient is usually afebrile with normal vital signs.> Abdominal or testicular tenderness are absent; no abdominal distension is present.> Bowel sounds cannot be auscultated in the scrotum unless an associated hernia is present.> Unless an infection causes an acute hydrocele, no erythema or scrotal discoloration is observed.> Transillumination A light source shines brightly through a hydrocele. Transillumination is common, but it is not diagnostic for hydrocele.

Nasogastric tube: whenever a perforated ulcer is suspected, the first step is to pass a nasogastric tube and empty the stomach to reduce further contamination of the peritoneal cavity.
Intravenous crystalloid: The patient is resuscitated aggressively by administration of intravenous crystalloid. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics

Surgery:
Surgery is mostly indicated, although occasionally nonsurgical treatment can be used in stable patients without peritonitis, and in whom radiologic studies document a sealed perforation.
Surgery whether laparoscopy or laparotomy involves two components:
i) Thorough peritoneal toilet

to remove all the fluid and food debris
 drain is not indicated

ii) Management of perforation
For duodenal ulcer perforation

The most frequently performed operation for a perforated duodenal ulcer is simple closure with an omental onlay reinforcement or patch.
This is combined with postoperative H. pylori eradication (antibiotics + antisecretory agents)
Insertion of a nasoenteric or jejunal feeding tube should be considered


For gastric ulcer perforation

All perforated gastric ulcers are best treated by distal gastric resection with or without a truncal vagotomy (Truncal vagotomy can be added for type II & III gastric ulcers. Type I and IV gastric ulcers do not need acid reducing procedures as they are associated with hyposecretion). Ulcer is removed along with gastric resection as it carries a risk of malignancy (cf: duodenal ulcer has no risk of cancer). If ulcer is left behind, biopsy is always done.

- Other procedures used for gastric ulcers are
-     patch closure with biopsy - wedge excision and closure
Conservative Management:
Conservative management may be tried in stable patients without peritonitis, and in whom radiologic studies document a sealed perforation.
In conservative management, the patient is observed closely and treated with

nasogastric suction,
IV fluids
intravenous acid secretion suppression, and
intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.",C

The largest and most consistent repoed relative risk has been with HLA-Cw6. Psoriatic ahritis involves DIP joints and the DOC for psoriatic ahritis is methotrexate. Psoriatic ahritis Psoriatic ahritis refers to an inflammatory ahritis that characteristically occurs in individuals with psoriasis. Only 5% of patients with psoriasis develop ahritis. In 60-70% of cases, psoriasis precedes joint disease. In 15-20%, the two manifestations appear within 1 year of each other. In about 15-20% of cases, the ahritis precedes the onset of psoriasis and can present a diagnostic challange. Clinical features The usual age at onset is 30-50 years. The patient may present with one of several patterns of joint involvement. These include : Ahritis of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints Assymetrical oligoahritis : Most common pattern Symmetrical polyahritis similar to RA Axial involvement (sacroiliac and spine) similar to ankylosing spondylitis Ahritis multilans So, Psoriatic ahritis can present with symptoms similar to any other inflammatory ahritis (RA, AS) or with any other different pattern. Shoening of digitis, called telescoping, because of underlying osteolysis is paicularly characteristic of Psoriatic ahritis and there is much greater tendency than in RA for both fibrous and bony ankylosis. Other findings are enthesitis, nail changes, and tenosynovitis. Treatment of Psoriatic ahritis Anti TNF - a agents eg etanercept and infliximab are newer drugs and are effective even in longstanding restistent PsA cases to previous therapy and extensive skin lesion.

Merkel cell carcinoma is due to,Cytokeratin: 7,Cytokeratin: 19,Cytokeratin: 20,Cytokeratin: 18,"Cytokeratin 20: *Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive, primary skin cancer exhibiting neuroendocrine differentiation. oThe histogenesis of MCC is controversial. Possible cells of origin include the epidermal MC, a dermal MC equivalent, a neural-crest- derived cell of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, and a residual epidermal stem cell. oCytogenetic abnormalities are present in 30-47% of MCCs. The most frequent change is loss of heterozygosity due to translocations or deletions of chromosome 1; specifically, 2 distinct regions in the most distal band 1 p36 on the sho arm of chromosome 1are implicated in MCC. Similar abnormalities near this site occur in several neuro cystic tumors, including melanoma, neuroblastoma, and pheochromocytoma. Other abnormalities described in MCC include losses at chromosomes 3, 13, and 22 and paial trisomy 01 chromosomes 1, 11, 18, and X. Unlike neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung, gene amplifications are rare in cutaneous MCC. oCytokeratin 20 is expressed in a dot like paranuclear or crescentic pattern; other low molecular weight (MW) cytokeratin antibodies (E.g., CAM5.2, MNF116), white less specific, react in a similar localization pattern. oElectron microscopic findings are char9- cteristic, revealing a lobulated nucleus that may contain rodlets. The cytoplasm is electron- lucent and contains a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous ribosomes. Intermediate filaments are numerous and often assume a parallel or whorled arrangement near the nucleus, accounting for the dot like pattern of cytokeratin distribution visualized by immunohistochemistry. Desmosomes may be present. Most diagnostic is the dense core granule (80-120 mn in diameter), the source and the locus of the neuroendocrine peptides.",C

Complications of aerial catheterization for a 96-h period of monitoring include all the following EXCEPT,Aerial thrombosis,Infection at the catheter site,Hemorrhage,Septicemia,"Aerial catheterization in the critically ill patient is an impoant method of monitoring changes in blood pressure and permitting frequent sampling of aerial blood. Aerial thrombosis is especially common with smaller aeries such as the radial or dorsalis pedis. This problem can be reduced by the use of continuous heparin flow rather than intermittent flushing. Infection at the catheter site can be minimized by careful management of the wound and by percutaneous placement of the catheter without aerial cutdown. Hemorrhage can occur if the system becomes disconnected. Septicemia is extremely unusual if the catheter is not left in situ for more than 4 days, but it becomes an increasing problem with longer use. Wound hematoma can occur especially if there is difficulty with (he aerial puncture. This complication may be dangerous when catheterization of the femoral aery is used because the blood loss in pelvis or thigh may not be appreciated.

A patient with autoimmune thyroiditis presents with hypothyroidism. Which of the following is true?,Thyroid peroxidase antibodies,Painful enlargement of thyroid,More common in men,"No risk, of malignancy","Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th: editionExplanation:HASHIMOTO THYROIDITISMost common cause of hypothyroidism in areas of the world where iodine levels are sufficient. Gradual thyroid failure due to autoimmune destruction of the thyroid gland.Common age group (45 - 65)Female predominance (10: 1 to 20: 1)Can occur in children and is a major cause of nonendemic goiter.It is associated with polymorphisms in multiple immune regulation-associated genes, the most significant of which is the linkage to cytotoxic T lymphocyte--associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) polymorphisms & Also functional polymorphism in protein tyrosine phosphatase-22 fPTPN22J gene that encodes a lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase, which is also thought to inhibit T- cell function.Susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes has been associated w ith polymorphisms in both Cl'LA 4 and PTPN22.PathogenesisHashimoto thyroiditis is caused by a breakdown in self-tolerance to thyroid auto-antigens.presence of circulating autoantibodies against thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidaseInduction of thyroid autoimmunity is accompanied by a progressive depletion of thyrocytes by apoptosis and replacement of the thyroid parenchyma by mononuclear cell infiltration and fibrosis.MorphologyDiffusely enlargedThe capsule is intact, and the gland is well demarcated from adjacent structures. .Microscopic examination reveals extensive infiltration of the parenchyma by a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate containing small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and w ell-developed germinal centersThe thyroid follicles are atrophic and are lined in many areas by epithelial cells distinguished by the presence of abundant eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm, termed Hurthle cells. This is a metaplastic response of the normally low cuboidal follicular epithelium to ongoing injury.In fine-needle aspiration biopsy samples, the presence of Hurthle cells in conjunction with a heterogeneous population of lymphocytes is characteristic of Hashimoto thyroiditis.In ""classic'"" Hashimoto thyroiditis, interstitial connective tissue is increased and may be abundant.A fibrous variant is characterized by severe thyroid follicular atrophy and dense ""keloid - like*' fibrosis, broad bands of acellular collagen encompassing residual thyroid tissue.Unlike Reidel thyroiditis, the fibrosis does not extend beyond the capsule of the gland. The remnant thyroid parenchyma demonstrates features of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.Clinical CoursePainless enlargement of the thyroid associated with some degree of hypothyroidismThe enlargement of the gland is usually symmetric and diffuseIn some cases, however, it may be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis caused by disruption of thyroid follicles, with secondary release of thyroid hormones (""hashi toxicosis""). During this phase, free T4 and T3 levels are elevated, TSH is diminished, and radioactive iodine uptake is decreased.As hypothyroidism supervenes.

Radiological features of aneurysmal bone cyst Eccentric, expansile osteolytic lesion The characteristic feature is 'blown-out' distension of one surface of the bone. Overlying coex may be intact or disrupted. Extensive sclerosis at the interface between normal and expanded coex (buttersing) may be present. Delicate thin trabeculae is characteristic and an expansile ballooning lesion may produce a 'soap-bubble appearance'. Lesion occurs at metaphysis of long bones.

It becomes elevated when breaks in the mucosal basement membrane occur due to tumor growth. Some other conditions can also cause elevations of CEA (e.g., cirrhosis, pancreatitis). The patient described above has colonic carcinoma, and the ""apple core"" lesion is the classic radiographic finding of this tumor. Although CEA is not used for screening because of the large number of false positives, it can be used to guide treatment in known cases. It returns to normal levels 30-45 days after tumor resection. If it begins to rise again, tumor recurrence is likely. AFP, or alpha-fetoprotein, is an alpha globulin (70,000 daltons) made by the liver and yolk sac of the human fetus. It is elevated with hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell neoplasms. It is not paicularly specific. hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, is a glycoprotein secreted by trophoblastic epithelium of the placenta.

Total Nissen's fundoplication is used for the surgical management of -,Achlasia cardia,Gastroesophageal reflux,Gastric ulcer,Esophageal diverticula,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Gastroesophageal reflux Surgical management of Gastroesophageal reflux disease:* There are many operations for GORD, but they are virtually all based on the creation of an intra-abdominal segment of oesophagus, crural repair and some form of wrap of the upper stomach (fundoplication) around the intraabdominal oesophagus. The contribution of each component to operative success is widely debated, but it is clear that operations that fail to address all three components have inferior success rates.* Total Nissen's fundoplication used for the surgical management of GERD, tends to be associated with slightly more short-term dysphagia but is the most durable repair in terms of long-term reflux control.* Partial fundoplication, whether performed posteriorly (Toupet) or anteriorly (Dor, Watson), has fewer short- term side-effects at the expense of a slightly higher long-term failure rate.* One disadvantage of total fundoplication is the creation of an overcompetent cardia, resulting in the 'gas bloat' syndrome in which belching is impossible.",B

What is the most common complication following TIPSS?,Encephalopathy,Hepatic ischemia,Infection,Life-threatening hemorrhage,"TIPSS is a percutaneous procedure used for treatment of patients who have gastroesophageal varices in the setting of poal hypeension. It has largely replaced surgical poosystemic shunts due to the fact that it is both safe and effective while also providing a minimally invasive alternative to major abdominal surgery. TIPSS functions by creating an intrahepatic shunt between the poal and systemic circulation which causes a reduction in the poal pressure and ultimately in the blood flow through varices. It is accomplished by endovascular access through the jugular vein to a hepatic vein radical and subsequent creation of a needle tract that connects it to a branch of the poal vein. After dilation of the tract, a metallic stent is deployed to hold the new poosystemic connection open. Because this shunt reduces first pass metabolism of the liver, the most common complication of TIPS is encephalopathy which occurs in 25 to 30% of patients. Other complications such as hepatic ischemia, infection, renal failure, and hemorrhage may occur, but are rare",A

Most commonly used approach of brachial plexus block-,Interscalene,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Supraclavicular Brachial plexus blocko This is the second most commonly practised block after central neuraxial block (spinal & epidural anaesthesia).Brachial plexus block is used for upper limb surgeries.o Brachial plexus can be blocked by 4 approaches : -Interscalene approachBrachial plexus is blocked between anterior and middle scalene. This approach is not used routinely due to close proximity of vital structures. Ulnar nerve is usually spared by this approach because injection is given in close proximity of upper nerve roots and inferior nerve roots (C8-T1) may be spared.This technique provides excellent anaesthesia and analgesia for shoulder and upper arm procedures, (in contrast to other three approaches which do not provide adequate shoulder anaesthesia).Complications include Homer syndrome (due to stellate ganglion block), phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection into carotids and epidural or intrathecal injections.Supraclavicular approachThis is the most commonly used approach. It involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity to the trunks of the brachial plexus by inserting the needle lateral to subclavian vessels. The supraclavicular block is performed where the brachial plexus is most compact, consequently, it produces reliable and rapid onset anaesthesia and is particularly useful in a fast paced ambulatory surgery centre.Pneumothorax is the most common complication. Other complications include phrenic nerve block, intravascular injection in subclavian artery or vein, Homer syndrome, hematoma formation.Infra-clavicular approachInfraclavicular block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary nerve may be spared as this nerve exits the brachial plexus sheath proximal to the level of infraclavicular block.Axillary approachAxillary block involves the injection of local anaesthetic in close proximity of terminal branches of the brachial plexus. The major disadvantage of this approach is that mucocutaneous and intercostobrachial nerves are spared. So arm surgery cannot be performed. In contrast to interscalene approach, most intense block occur in (C7-T1) ulnar dermatomes and least in C5-C6 dermatomes.",B
A three years old boy presents with the poor urinary stream. Most likely cause is -,Stricture urethra,Neurogenic bladder,Urethral calculus.,Posterior urethral valve.,"Poor urinary stream in 3 years old boy suggests urinary tract obstruction (usually intravesical) and the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in a male child is posterior urethral valve.
Posterior urethral valve

These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter.
It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum*
It occurs only in males.
It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty.
Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood.
Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease
Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients.

Diagnosis is made by

voiding cystourethrogram* &
endoscopy


Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction.
The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.*

Management

First, a small polyethene feeding tube is inserted in the bladder and left for several days. Then further management is done according to serum creatinine level.


with normal serum creatinine → transurethral ablation of the valve leaflets. *
With increased serum creatinine and the worsening of condition → vesicostomy to bypass the obstruction and when normal creatinine levels are achieved, transurethral ablation is done.",D
False about hypospadies,Defect seen in dorsal penis,A\/w chordee,A\/w hooded prepuce,Circumcision should be avoided,"Hypospadias occurs in one in 200-300 boys and is the most common congenital malformation of the urethra. The external meatus opens on the underside(ventral) of the penis or the perineum, and the ventral aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed ('hooded prepuce'). The more severe varieties of hypospadias represent an absence of the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening. The absent structures are represented by a fibrous cord, which deforms the penis in a downward direction (chordee). Avoid circumcision as prepuce may be used in procedures to correct the abnormality(urethroplasty). Reference : page 1362-63 Bailey and Love's sho practice of surgery 25th edition",A

The bleeding diathesis is mainly localized in the large hemangiomas (""sequestered""or localized intravascular coagulation but laboratory evidence of DIC in the general circulation is also definitely present). The severity and the incidence of DIC tends to parallel the size of vascular tumours but remember that thrombocytopenia and consumptive coagulopathy are not seen in all hemangiomas and size alone does not determine which hemangiomas are associated with thrombocytopenia and coagulopathies. Recurrent bleeding from the surface of the tumour is the major hemorrhagic manifestation. Periodic swelling of the lesion is often observed. This phenomenon may be a consequence of intermittent obstruction of blood outflow from the hemangioma. Treatment Surgical removal is the best treatment Interferon",A
"During anaesthesia, which is least affected?",Visual evoked response,Brainstem evoked response,Somatosensory evoked response from median nerve,Somatosensory evoked response from posterior tibial nerve,"An evoked potential or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from the nervous system following stimulus. electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiological recording methods. This is done under general anaesthesia so evoked potential least affected by anaesthetic agents are paicularly monitored. Auditory evoked potential is least affected by general anaesthesia. Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) can be used to trace the signal generated by a sound through the ascending auditory pathway. The evoked potential is generated in the cochlea, goes through the cochlear nerve, through the cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex, lateral lemniscus, to the inferior colliculus in the midbrain, on to the medial geniculate body, and finally to the coex. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are small AEPs that are recorded in response to an auditory stimulus from electrodes placed on the scalp. AEPs serve for assessment of the functioning of the auditory system and neuroplasticity. They can be used to diagnose learning disabilities in children, aiding in the development of tailored educational programs for those with hearing and or cognition problems.",B

Which of the following statements concerning carcinoma of the esophagus is true?,Alcohol has been implicated as a precipitating factor,Squamous carcinoma is the most common type at the cardio esophageal junction,It has a higher incidence in males,It occurs more commonly in patients with corrosive esophagitis,"Carcinoma of the esophagus occurs primarily in the sixth and seventh decades of life in a male:female ratio of 3:1. Although the cause is unknown, alcohol, tobacco, and dietary factors have been implicated as causative agents. A high incidence is reported in patients with corrosive esophagitis. The malignant tumors arising in the esophagus are usually squamous cell carcinomas except those involving the esophagogastric junction, which are usually adenocarcinomas. Even though squamous cell carcinomas are weakly radiosensitive, surgical extirpation affords reasonable, if short-term, palliation. Some authorities recommend radiotherapy for palliation alone or in combination with surgery to treat this lesion. Adenocarcinomas are not particularly radiosensitive and surgical treatment is generally employed. Following resection for esophageal carcinoma among the highly select group of patients whose tumors are still resectable when the diagnosis is made, survival is only about 14% at 5 years. The overall 5-year survival is under 5%.",D

CPAP may be especially useful in patients with congestive heart failure or obstructive sleep apnea.Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is probably the most common mode of support and requires provision of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). The difference between IPAP and EPAP is a reflection of the amount of pressure support ventilation provided to the patient, and EPAP is synonymous with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).Some noninvasive ventilation is provided using proportional-assist ventilation (PAV), which provides flow and volume assistance with each breath.",A

"All of the following statements about primary Gouty Ahritis are true, Except:",90% of cases are caused by over production of uric acid,Uric acid levels may be normal at the time of an acute attack,Men are more commonly affected than women (Male > Females),Definitive diagnosis requires aspiration of synol fluid,"Answer is A (90% of cases are caused by over production of uric acid): Diagnosis & Treatment in Rheumatology `Fewer than 5% of cases are caused by over production of uric acid'- Current Rheumatology Most 90%) cases of gout result from hyperuricemia secondary to decreased uric acid excretion by the kidneys and not from over production of uric acid. Most patients with Gout have hyperuricemia due to decreased uric acid excretion by the kidney The underlying basis of gout is an increased total body urate pool. This is generally manifested as hypercuricemia and persistant hyperuricemia is the most impoant risk factor for gouty ahritis (Although hyperuricemia alone is not synonymous with gout) This hyperuricemia can result from increased urate production or decreased uric acid excretion by the kidneys or a combination of both mechanisms The most common mechanism of hyperuricemia in gout is a defect in the renal handing of uric acid (and not uric acid over production). `Over 90% of individuals with sustained hyper uricemia have a defect in the renal handling of uric acid' `Fewer than 5% of patients with gout are hyper uricemic because of urate overproduction' -- Current Rheumatology Uric Acid levels may be normal at the time of an acute attack - Although most patients with acute gouty ahritis have associated hyperuricemia, elevated uric acid levels are not essential for the diagnosis of gout. This limits the value of serum uric acid determinations for the diagnosis of gout. Gout is caused whenever,synol fluid is supersaturated with uric acid, irrespective of serum concentration of uric acid. The serum levels of uric acid can be normal or even low at the time of an attack and hence its determination is not diagnostic for gout. Gout is more common in Men than Women (Male > Female) Gout presents predominantly in men Women represent only 5-20% of all patients with gout Definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration of synol fluid Definitive diagnosis of gout requires aspiration of the involved joint and demonstration of intracellular monosodium urate crystals in synol fluid.

Almost immediately, degeneration of the axon distal to the injury begins. Degeneration also occurs in the proximal fragment back to Surgery the fist node of Ranvier. Phagocytosis of the degenerated axonal fragments leaves a neurilemmal sheath with empty cylindrical spaces where the axons were. Several days following the injury, axons from the proximal fragment begin to regrow. If they make contact with the distal neurilemmal sheath, regrowth occurs at about the rate of 1 mm per day. However, if associated trauma, fracture, infection, or separation of neurilemmal sheath ends precludes contact between axons, growth is haphazard and a traumatic neuroma is formed.

The degective migration of neural crest cells results in,Congenital megacolon,Albinism,Adrenogenital hypoplasia,Dentinogenesis imperfecta,"Hirschsprung's disease (congenital mega colon) Hirschsprung's disease is characterised by the congenital absence of intramural ganglion cells (aganglionosis) and the presence of hyperophic nerves in the distal large bowel. The absence of ganglion cells is due to a failure of migration of vagal neural crest cells into the developing gut. The affected gut is in spasm, causing a functional bowel obstruction. The aganglionosis is restricted to the rectum and sigmoid colon in 75% of patients (sho segment), involves the proximal colon in 15% (long segment) and affects the entire colon and a poion of terminal ileum in 10% (total colonic aganglionosis) . A transition zone exists between the dilated, proximal, normally innervated bowel and the narrow, distal aganglionic segment.Hirschsprung's disease may be familial or associated with Down syndrome or other genetic disorders. Gene mutations have been identified on chromosome 10 (involving the RET proto-oncogene) and on chromosome 13 in some patients. Hirschsprung's disease typically presents in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension and bilious vomiting but it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or even adult life, when it manifests as severe chronic constipation. Enterocolitis is a potentially fatal complication. The diagnosis requires an adequate rectal biopsy and an experienced pathologist. A contrast enema may show the narrow aganglionic segment, a cone and the dilated proximal bowel. Surgery aims to remove the aganglionic segment and 'pull-through' ganglionic bowel to the anus (e.g. Swenson, Duhamel, Soave and transanal procedures), and can be done in a single stage or in stages after first establishing a proximal stoma in normally innervated bowel. Most patients achieve good bowel control but a significant minority experience residual constipation and/or faecal incontinence or fuher enterocolitis. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 136",A
A 40 year old patient has undergone an open chlecystectomy. The procedure was reported as uneventful by the operating surgeon. She has 100 ml of bile output from the drain kept in the gallbladder bed on the first post operative day. On examination she is afebrile and anicteric. The abdomen is soft and bowel sounds are normally heard. As an attending physician. What should be your best possible advice?,Order an urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and biliary stenting,Urgent laparotomy,Order an urgent hepatic iminodiacetic acid scintigraphy (HIDA),Clinical observation,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Clinical observation 100 ml. of Bile output from the patient on the 1st postop. day without any other abnormality is of no clinical significance, so does not warrant any action from the surgeon. But remember if passing of 100 ml of bile continues for 5-6 days then it is considered abnormal. It denotes bile duct injury.Oxford textbook of Surgery writes - ""Even after a straightforward cholecystectomy there may be a little bile in the drain the following day.""Textbook of Liver and Biliary Surgery writes - ""A small amount of biliary> drainage following cholecystectomy should cause no alarm because it usually disappears within 1 or 2 days. However, excessive biliary drainage through the wound or drain site, jaundice, sepsis, or a combination of these events early in the post op. period should suggest a bile duct injury, as should copious biliary drainage for more than a few post-op days"".",D
Complete transaction of the spinal cord at the C7 level produces all of the following effects except:,Hypotension,Limited respiratory effo,Anaesthesia below the level of the lesion,Areflexia below the level of the lesion,"D i.e. Areflexia below level of lesion The diaphragm is innervated by two phrenic nerves that originate as branches of the cervical plexus in neck. This motor nerve to diaphragm arise from the anterior rami of cervical nerves C3, C4, C5Q, with major contribution coming from C4. So transection of spinal cord at C7 level is not going to stop respiration but due to involvement of thoracic intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles, there will be some weakness of respiratory effoQ. (i.e. limited respiratory effo) Complete Spinal Cord Injury Complete spinal cord transection (injury) is characterized by total absence of sensation and voluantry motor function caudal to the level of spinal cord injury in the absence of spinal shockQ Complete areflexia is found in spinal shockQ. Spinal shock occurs when the spinal cord fails temporarily following injury. Even pas of spinal cord with out structural damage do not function. It rarely lasts for more than 48 hours & during this period it is difficult to tell that lesion is complete or incomplete. Return of bulbocavernous reflex and anal wink (i.e. primitive reflexes) indicate, spinal shock has endedQ In the absence of sacral sparing (i.e. there is no sacral sensations) and with return of bulbocavernosus reflex (i.e. spinal shock is over which typically occurs with in 24 - 48 hours) the spinal cord injury is termed complete and there is viually no likelihood of functional spinal cord recovery.

Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for breast cancer in this patient?",Bih control pills,Caffeine consumption,Cigarette smoking,Family history,"Positive family history is definitively the most significant risk factor of developing breast cancer among the ones mentioned in the list. About 5% to 10% of cases are attributable to inheritance of autosomal dominant genes. Most hereditary cases of breast cancer are due to two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are tumor suppressor genes probably involved in DNA repair. There are additional rare ""susceptibility"" genes, namely those causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (mutations of p53), Cowden syndrome (mutations of a gene on chromosome 10), and ataxia-telangiectasia (mutations of ATM gene). Note, however, that 80% to 90% of women with breast cancer do not have a positive family history. The role of exogenous estrogens, including those administered with bih control pills or postmenopausal replacement therapy, is still debated. If there is any associated risk for breast cancer, this is minimal. There is no convincing evidence linking caffeine consumption or cigarette smoking to breast cancer.

Best LA agent for intranasal instillation:,Articaine,Tetracaine,Lignocaine,Bupivacaine,"It is formulated in a pre-filled, single-use nasal sprayer: 6 mg tetracaine HCl and 0.1 mg oxymetazoline HCl (equivalent to 5.27 mg tetracaine and 0.088 mg oxymetazoline) in each 0.2 mL spray. It is intended for intranasal use only, and administration should be on the same side as the maxillary tooth being treated. It is recommended to wait 10 minutes after administration and then determine anesthesia effectiveness.
Topical tetracaine has been safely and effectively used intranasally by the ear-nose-throat (ENT) medical community for ENT procedures. Patients noticed that their upper teeth felt numb, which led to interest in the application of this type of anesthesia for dentistry. The oxymetazoline (the active ingredient in Afrin and other nasal decongestant sprays) was added to Kovanaze to slow systemic absorption of the tetracaine and improve the duration of action.

A congenital diaphragmatic hernia results when the pleuroperitoneal membrane fails to form.* Most Bochdaleks hernias occur on the left side, allowing protrusion of the abdominal viscera into the chest. The herniated bowel passes through the defect, filling the chest cavity and causing hypoplasia of the left lung and a shift of mediastinal structures to the right side. It is not uncommon for other abnormalities to be associated with Bochdaleks hernia; these may include neural tube defects and cardiovascular abnormalities* The left-sided Bochdalek hernia occurs in approximately 85% of cases. Left-sided hernias allow herniation of both the small and large bowel and intraabdominal solid organs into the thoracic cavity.* In right-sided hernias (13% of cases), only the liver and a portion of the large bowel tend to herniate. Bilateral hernias are uncommon and are usually fatalRemember* The 3 basic types of congenital diaphragmatic hernia include the posterolateral Bochdalek hernia (occurring at approximately 6 weeks' gestation), the Anterior Morgagni hernia, and the hiatus hernia.",A

A two month old infant has undergone a major surgical procedure. Regarding postoperative pain relief which one of the following is recommended:,No mediaction is needed as infant does not feel pain after surgery due to immaturity of nervous system,Only paracetamol suppository is adequate,Spinal narcotics intrathecal route,Intravenous narcotic infusion in lower dosage,"D. i.e. Intravenous narcotic infusion in lower dosage Though neonates have immature brain, they neveheless feel painQ and analgesia is needed. During circumcision of babies, standard techniques of G.A. are suitable. They are given a normal intravenous or inhalational induction and spontaneous respiration is maintained using 02 N20 & volatile agent. Morphine is the drug of choice for children who are inpatients. The preferred route of injection is intravenousQ but other routes can be used. Intrathecal route is not the first choice. Following minor surgical procedures, oral acetaminophen (paracetamol), codeine phosphate and ibuprofen may be givn either alone or in combination. After more major surgery continuous infusion of a potent opioid analgesic such as morphine may be requiredQ. Regional nerve blocks & direct local infiltration of surgical wounds with long acting local anesthetics are simple yet very effective methods of providing pain relief for all children.

Carcinoid tumor is diagnosed by -,Urinary 5 HIAA,Serum Chromogranin A,Plasma neuro-specific enolase,Urinary 5-HTP,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Urinary 5 HIAA Diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome:* The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of urinary or plasma serotonin or its metabolites in the urine. The measurement of 5-HIAA is used most frequently.* False-positive elevations may occur if the patient is eating serotonin-rich foods such as bananas, pineapples, walnuts, pecans, avocados, or hickory nuts or is taking certain medications (cough syrup containing guaifenesin, acetaminophen, salicylates, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or 1-dopa).* The normal range in daily urinary 5-HIAA excretion is 2-8 mg/d.* Most physicians use only the urinary 5-HIAA excretion rate; however, plasma and platelet serotonin levels, if available, may provide additional information.* Platelet serotonin levels are more sensitive than urinary 5-HIAA but are not generally available.* Because patients with foregut carcinoids may produce an atypical carcinoid syndrome, if this syndrome is suspected and the urinary 5-HIAA is minimally elevated or normal, other urinary metabolites of tryptophan, such as 5-HTP and 5-HT, should be measured.* Serum chromogranin A levels are elevated in 56-100% of patients with carcinoid tumors, and the level correlates with tumor bulk. Serum chromogranin A levels are not specific for carcinoid tumors.* Plasma neuron-specific enolase levels are also used as a marker of carcinoid tumors but are less sensitive than chromogranin A, being increased in only 17-47% of patients.",A

Universal precautions to be observed by surgeons for the prevention of hospital acquired HIV infection include the following except,Wearing gloves and other barrier precaution,Washing hands on contamination,Handling sharp instruments with care,Preoperative screening of all patients for HIV,"Universal  precautions have been drawn up by the CDC in the United States and largely adopted by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (in summary):

Use of a full face mask ideally, or protective spectacles;
Use of fully waterproof, disposable gowns and drapes, particularly during seroconversion;
Boots to be worn, not clogs, to avoid injury from dropped sharps;
Double gloving needed (a larger size on the inside is more comfortable);
Allow only essential personnel in theatre;
Avoid unnecessary movement in theatre;
Respect is required for sharps, with passage in a kidney dish;
A slow  meticulous  operative  technique  is  needed  with minimised bleeding.

Key Concept:
Universal precautions do not include the preoperative screening of patients for HIV.

T/t of choice for grade IV vesicoureteric reflux with recurrent UTI,Cotrimox azole,Bilateral reimplantation of ureter,Injection of Collegen in the ureter,Endoscopic resection of ureter,"Ans. is 'a' ie. Cotrimoxazole (Ref. Nelson, 18/e p2233 (16/e, p 1628))Don't get misled by this statement given in O.P. Ghai - ""Operative correction of VUR is indicated inpts. with - persistent severe (grade IV or V) refluxThis statement does not mean that any pt. with grade IV & V reflux will be given surgical management and rest medical management. Treatment is not so clear-cut.The choice b/w medical or surgical modality is based on certain principles (go through the following text to understand it).The below given explanation is a bit lengthy. Bear with me for giving such a long text, as it is one of the most important but less read topic (UG books do not give sufficient information on its treatment).This explanation will help you to tackle any future question on t/t of VUR with different patient profile (as t/t changes with grades as well as age of the patient)Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the ureter and the renal pelvisGrading of VUR : is based on the appearance of the urinary tract on Micturating Cystourethrogram (MCU).Grade 1reflux into a non-dilated ureterGrade IIreflux into the upper collecting system without dilatation.Grade IIIreflux into dilated ureter and /or blunting of calyceal fornicesGrade IVreflux into a grossly dilated ureterGrade VGross dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis & calyces : calyces show loss of papillary impression. Complications of VURReflux predisposes to renal infection (pyelonephritis) by facilitating the transport of bacteria from the bladder to the upper urinary tract.The inflammatory reaction caused by a pyelonephritic infection may result in renal injury or scarring.Extensive renal scarring impair renal function and may result in renin mediated hypertension, reflux nephropathy, renal insufficiency, end stage renal disease, reduced somatic growth and morbidity during pregnancy.* TreatmentThe goals of t/t are to prevent pyelonephritis, renal injury, and other complication of reflux.Treatment modality is either medical or surgical.Medical therapyis based on the principle that reflux often resolves over time and the antibiotics maintain urine sterility and prevent infection and complication while awaiting spontaneous resolution.Surgical therapy :the basis for surgical therapy is that in selected children, ongoing reflux has caused or has significant potential for causing renal injury.The decision to do medical or surgical t/t is based on certain principles and parental, patient preferences.Below is given a chart listing the treatment recommendation for VUR.Before going through the chart lets see the basic principles on which this chart is based -With bladder growth and maturation, there is tendency for reflux to resolve or improve over time.Lower grades of reflux are much more likely to resolve than are higher grades.For grades I & II reflux, the likelihood of resolution is similar irrespective of age at diagnosis and whether if it unilateral or bilateral.For grade III & IV a younger age at diagnosis and unilateral reflux generally are associated with a higher rate of spontaneous resolution.Grade V reflux rarely resolves.The mean age for reflux resolution is 6 - 7 yrs.Reflux is unlikely to cause any renal injury in the absence of infection.Treatment Recommendation for VUR diagnosed following a UTI.GradeAge (yrs)ScarringInitial t/tFollow-upI-iiAny-Antibiotic prophylaxis-III - IV0-5-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6- 10-U/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryIII - IV6 - 10-B/L: Surgery V<1-Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoU/L: Antibiotic prophylaxisSurgeryV1 - 5NoB/L: Surgery V1 - 5YesSurgery V6- 10-Surgery * ThusMedical Management is the initial t/t in almost all children except for -Grade III & IV (Bilateral)Grade V (Mostly)Medical management (antibiotic prophylaxis) is continued till the reflux resolves.Pt. is shifted from medical to surgical management, in children withbreakthrough UTI (Recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis)Development of new renal scarsFailure of reflux to resolve.Thus in this question we will begin with medical management ie cotrimoxazole. This pt is having recurrent UTI. This will not alter our t/t. If the pt. had recurrent UTI despite prophylaxis, we would have done a surgical management.If you have a close look at the statement of O.P. Ghai, you will note that he is not stating that grades IV & V will be t/t surgically. It is persistent grades IV & V that are t/t surgically (persistent means VUR that are not resolving over time).",A

Commonest fracture in elderly with fall on outstretched hand is ?,Colle's fracture,Bennets fracture,Galazzie fracture,Monteggia fracture,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Colle's fracture Colle's fracture is the most common fracture in person over 40 years. Colle's fracture Colle's fracture is an extra-aicular fracture at the distal end of radius, at its coico-cancellous junction. It is the most common fracture in person over 40 years of age and especially in women after menopause (Postmenopausal females). The association of the fracture with osteoporosis is now well established and it is one of the fragility fracture, seen in osteoporosis. The fracture nearly always caused by fall on outstretched hand. Displacement in colle's fracture The fracture line runs transversely at the coico-cancellous junction. In the majority of the cases, one or more displacements of the distal fragment occur :- Dorsal displacement (Dorsal shift) i Dorsal tilt (Dorsal angulation) Lateral displacement (lateral shift) Clinical features of colles fracture Lateral tilt (lateral angulation) Supination (external rotation) Impaction (proximal migration) Pain and swelling at the wrist. Typical deformity : There is a dorsal hollow or depression just proximal to the fracture and immediately distal to this there is a marked prominence caused by lower fragment being displaced backwards, carrying with it the whole of the carpus and hand. This gives appearance of a fork, So named dinner fork/ silver fork /spoon shaped deformity. There is local tenderness. Treatment of colle's fracture Treatment of colle's fracture is essentially conservative. For undisplaced fracture below-elbow cast is given in-situ. For displaced fractures, the standard method of treatment is to undeake manipulative reduction under local or general anaesthesia. Technique of closed manipulation involves reversing the typical deformities of colle's fracture (in following sequence) :- Disimpaction (by traction) :- to correct impaction.

Secondary brain injury seen in:,Concussion,Diffuse axonal surgery,Seizures,Intracrebral hematoma,"Ans: C (Seizures) Ref: .J. Claude Hemphill. Multimodal Monitoring and Neurocritical Care Bioinformatics: Secondary Brain Injury. Med scape education.Explanation:When patients have an acute neurological catastrophe such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke, damage to the brain can occur at the time of the initial event.This damage is termed primary brain injury, and the underlying mechanisms include:Intraparenchymal or extra-axial traumatic or spontaneous hemorrhageDiffuse axonal injury (in TBI)Focal or global ischemia from acute ischemic stroke or global cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest.Although interventions (eg: surgical hematoma evacuation ) can be undertaken to limit or reverse primary brain injury, much of the primary damage may be irreversible.This primary brain injury initiates a cascade of biochemical events that are rexersible. This process is termed secondary brain injurySecondary brain injury can generally be considered as two related concepts:Cellular injury cascadesSecondary brain insults (SBIs).An example of the cellular injury cascade is the ischemic cascade in which events such as excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium influx, and free radical membrane damage are ongoing.Hence, ultra-early ischemic stroke treatment via revascularization of an occluded intracranial artery with thrombolytic agents is intended to restore perfusion before permanent cell death, thereby reversing this secondary brain injury.In addition to initiating ischemic and apoptotic cell injury cascades, primary brain injuries make injured, but salvageable, brain tissue vulnerable to SB Is.Hypotension, hypoxia and hypoglycemia are all examples of SBIs in which decreased substrate delivery to an injured brain further worsens injury.On the other hand, fever, seizures and hyperglycemia are examples of SBIs in which increased metabolic demand may outstrip compensator) mechanisms and result in further injury.Examples of primary and secondary brain injury in TBIPrimarySecondary* Intracerebral fiemorrnage* Subdural hemorrhage* Subarachnoid hemorrhage* Epidural hemorrhage* Cerebral contusion* Cerebral laceration* Axonal stretch injury* Edema* Impaired metabolism* Altered cerebral blood flow* Free radical formation* Excitotoxicity* Increased inlracracial tension* Seizures",C

Which of the following is not true about resuscitation in burns patient?,Ringers lactate is the preferred crystalloid solution,Fluid shift from intravascular to extravascular compartment in the burns patient is maximum in the first 24 hrs,Quantity of crystalloid needed is calculated using the parkland formula - 6m/Kg body weight per % of the total body surface area burnt,Target mean arterial pressure in resuscitation is 60 mmHg,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Quantity of crystalloid needed is calculated using the parkland formula-6m/Kg body weight per % of the total body surface area burnt * Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",C
In a 60Kg man with 40% burns what is the amount of ringer lactate given in first 8 hours,9600 ml,6400 ml,4800 ml,3200 ml,Parkland formula calculates the fluid to be replaced in the first 24 hours by the following formulatotal percentage body surface area x weight (kg) x 4 = volume (mL). Half this volume is given in the first 8 hours and the second half is given in the subsequent 16 hours.So 40*60*4 = 9600 half of that in first 8 hrs ie; 4800 ml.Fluid in parkland formula is Ringer lactateBailey and Love 26th edition pg: 392,C

Pilonidal disease describes a spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic hair-containing cysts and sinuses to large symptomatic abscesses of the sacrococcygeal region that have some tendency to recur Pilonidal disease involves loose hair and skin and perineal flora. Risk factors for pilonidal disease include male gender, hirsute individuals, Caucasians, sitting occupations, existence of a deep natal cleft, and presence of hair within the natal cleft.

Most common cause of urethral stricture is,Trauma,Infection,Congenital,Post endoscopy,"Urethral stricture CAUSES The common causes of urethral stricture are: * Inflammatory * Secondary to urethritis * Secondary to balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) * Traumatic (MC) * Bulbar urethral injury * Pelvic fracture urethral disruption injury * Iatrogenic * Secondary to urethral instrumentation including cath- eterisation and transurethral prostatectomy * Secondary to radical prostatectomy * Secondary to radiotherapy for prostate cancer * Idiopathic CLINICAL FEATURES Symptoms are usually hesitancy of micturition, straining to void and a poor urinary stream. The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1482",A

"All of the following are seen in active chronic hepatitis B except,",IgM against core antigen,Total core antibody,HbeAg,HbsAg,"IgM against core antigen What is chronic active hepatitis ? . Chronic hepatitis B is usually classified by histological features such as grade and stage. The other way to classify chronic hepatitis is based on relative level of HBV replication :A) A Replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B is known as chronic active hepatitisQ. . Characterized by the presence of the markers of HBV replication such as HBeAg and HBVDNA. B) Non replicative phase of chronic hepatitis This is characterized by the absence of conventional markers of HBV replication i.e., (HBeAg and HBVDNA). Thus the serological markers of chronic active hepatitis B are :? HBsAg HBeAg HBVDNA IgGHBcAg ""IgM AntiHBcAg is nevere seen in chronic hepatits, its presence confirms that hepatitis is acute"". Antibodies to HBcAg Antibodies to HBcAg are not protective but we can use them to understand how long the infection has been going. IgM antiHBcAg Acute infection 1gM antiHBcAg = Chronic infection The role of IgM antillBc in the diagnosis The presence of HBsAg with or without 1gM anti HBc represents HBV infection.e If IgM anti HBc is present, the HBV infection is considered acute and if IgM antiHBc is absent the infection is considered chronic.e A diagnosis of acute hepatitis can be made even in the absence of HBsAg if IgM Anti HBc is detectable.",A

"Known complication of stoma (e.g., Colostomy stoma)",Prolapse,Stenosis,Retraction,All of the above,"Ans. d (All of the above) (Ref. Bailey and Love 24th ed., 57.10)Complications of colostomies: The following complications are more common after poor technique:# Prolapse;# Retraction;# Necrosis of the distal end;# Stenosis of the orifice;# Colostomy hernia;# Bleeding (from granulomas around margin of colostomy);# Colostomy 'diarrhoea': this is usually an infective enteritis and will respond to oral metronidazole 200 mg TID.STOMASColostomy# A colostomy is an artificial opening made in the large bowel to divert faeces and flatus to the exterior, where it can be collected in an external appliance. Depending on the purpose for which the diversion has been necessary a colostomy may be temporary or permanent.# Temporary colostomy- This is most commonly established to defunction an anastomosis after an anterior resection, to prevent faecal peritonitis developing following traumatic injury to the rectum or colon, and to facilitate the operative treatment of a high fistula in ano. It is now less commonly used for patients with distal obstruction of the sigmoid colon as a result of carcinoma or diverticular disease.# Double-barrelled colostomy- This colostomy was designed so that it could be closed by crushing the intervening 'spur' using an enterotome or a stapling device. It is rarely used now but occasionally the colon is divided so that both ends can be brought separately to the surface ensuring that the distal segment is completely defunctioned.# Permanent colostomy- This is usually formed after excision of the rectum for a carcinoma by the abdominoperineal technique (APR).- It is formed by bringing the distal end (end colostomy) of the divided colon to the surface in the left iliac fossa, where it is sutured in place joining the colonic margin to the surrounding skin.- The point at which the colon is brought to the surface must be carefully selected to allow a colostomy bag to be applied without impinging on the bony prominence of the anterosuperior iliac spine. The best site is usually through the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, 6 cm above and medial to the bony prominence.Loop ileostomy# An ileostomy is used by some surgeons as an alternative to colostomy, particularly for defunctioning a low rectal anastomosis. The creation of a loop ileostomy from a knuckle of terminal ileum has already been described. The advantages of a loop ileostomy over a loop colostomy are the ease with which the bowel can be brought to the surface and the absence of odour. Care is needed, when the ileostomy is closed, that suture line obstruction does not occur.Caecostomy# This is rarely used now. In desperately ill patients with advanced obstruction, a caecostomy may be useful. Caecostomy is only a short-term measure to allow a few days for the condition of the patient to improve. Reoperation should normally follow fairly soon thereafter and a proper surgical procedure carried out.",D

Local anaesthetic acts by inhibition of,Na channels,Mg channels,Ca channels,K channels,"The nerve resting membrane potential is little affected by local anesthetics. As the concentration of local anesthetic applied to the nerve is increased, a decrease in the rate of depolarization and in the peak amplitude of the action potential occurs until the impulse is abolished. It is not possible, however, to derive data on the binding of local anesthetics to Na+ channels from measurement of the changes in nerve impulses. By using a ""voltage-clamp"" procedure, Na+ currents and their inhibition by local anesthetics can be directly assayed. When the membrane of isolated neurons is rapidly depolarized to a constant value, the time course of ionic currents is observed. Sodium currents during one initial depolarization are reduced by subclinical doses of local anesthetic (e.g., 0.2mM lidocaine) and totally abolished by clinical doses (e.g., 1% lidocaine, [?]40mM). If the test depolarization is applied repeatedly, for example, at frequencies higher than 5Hz (five pulses per second), the paially depressed (tonically inhibited) Na+ current is fuher reduced incrementally for each pulse until a new steady-state level of inhibition is reached. This frequency-dependent inhibition, also called phasic inhibition. Local anesthetics bind in the inner vestibule of the closed Na+ channel. Amino acid mutations in the S6 segments of D-1, D-3, and D-4 all modify local anesthetic action, thus suggesting either that these regions form a pharmacophore small enough to simultaneously contact the drug at three surfaces or that the local anesthetic molecule moves rapidly among these three segments.

Which is the principle for management of diabetic foot?,Control of DM,Topical antibiotics is paramount,Protection of the other limb,Early amputation,"Ans: a. (Control of DM)Ref: Cuschieri, 4th ed. pg. 783The treatment of diabetic foot should be multi disciplinary involving vascular surgeon, diabetologist, and chiropodist. The main pathophysiology of diabetic foot involves a combination of neuropathy, infection and ischaemia. The goal of management should be control of blood glucose and health education directed at preventing foot trauma.Prolonged antibiotic therapy should be used in the event of osteomyelitis. Prompt surgical drainage of abscesses should be undertaken.In summary, the treatment of diabetic foot should involve:1. Adequate control of blood glucose2. Prompt control of sepsis3. Vascular assessment4. Debridement including minor amputations. Major amputations should be undertaken for severe spreading uncontrollable limb infection threatening life, or the limb is severely ischaemic. Once one limb has been amputated, there is increased risk of amputation of the other limb, and the patient's survival rate is only 30%. Topical antibiotics are not of much benefit in the management of diabetic foot.Though both options, a and c are correct, option a (control of diabetes) seems to be the better answer.",A
The initial fluid rate in burns patient for first 24 hours is -,TBSA x wt x 8,TBSA x wt x 4,TBSA x wt x 3,TBSA x wt x 2,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., TBS A x wt x 4 * Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",B

Which of the following type of receptor is involved in malignant hypehermia ?,Nicotinic receptor,Ryanodine receptor,Muscarinic receptor,None.,"Malignant hypehermia (MH) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. It is associated with mutations in 2 genes: RyR1 (ryanodine receptor type 1), which encodes the skeletal muscle isoform of the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and CACNA1S, which encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type calcium channel isoform of the sarcolemma (dihydropyridine receptor). The RyR1 gene is located on chromosome 19. Malignant hypehermia (MH) is a subclinical myopathy that allows large quantities of calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle and cause a hypermetabolic state after exposure to triggering agents. Altered calcium channel gating kinetics in the SR is the underlying cause. The sustained elevation of calcium allows excessive stimulation of aerobic and anaerobic glycolytic metabolism, which accounts for respiratory and metabolic acidosis, rigidity, altered cell permeability, and hyperkalemia.",B

This constraint applies with in the coex, where the physical lack of space for new bone necessitates preceding resorption, and it also seems to apply to periosteal and endosteal sutfaces(2 * There is, however, debate as to whether periosteal accretion can occur in adults without preceding bone resorption. There are two definte, pathological exceptions to this rule. One is- during the production of callus in a healing fractured where woven bone will form de novo.- after cancllous autograft, where new bone will form directly on to the cancellous graft.* However, the contribution of these circumstances to overall bone homeostasis is likely to be very small.* The total body rate of resorption (is the product of) = number of new cavities eroded in a defined time period Xaverage volume of each cavity. Since the amount of bone eroded in each resorption cavity is constant (roughly), the rate of activation (i.e. rate at which new osteoclastic erosion cavities are begun) determines the total body bone resorption, as well as the rate of total body bone resorption, as well as the rate of total body bone formation.",D

Extravasated urine following rupture of bulbar urethra collects in all the following regions except,Penis,Scrotum,Inguinal canal,Beneath the superficial facia in the abdominal wall,"Rupture of the bulbar urethra There is a history of a blow to the perineum, usually due to a fall astride injury. The bulbar urethra is crushed upwards onto the pubic bone, typically with significant bruising. He subsequently developed urinary retention and sepsis secondary to infection of the haematoma and he died some days after the accident. Extravasation of urine is common if the urine is not diveed and the extravasated urine is confined in front of the mid-perineal point by the attachment of Colles' fascia to the triangular ligament and by the attachment of Scarpa's fascia just below the inguinal ligament. The external spermatic fascia stops it getting into the inguinal canals. Extravasated urine collects in the scrotum and penis and beneath the deep layer of superficial fascia in the abdominal wall. CLINICAL FEATURES The signs of a ruptured bulbar urethra are perineal bruising and haematoma, typically with a butterfly distribution. There is usually bleeding from the urethral meatus and retention of urine is also typically present. MANAGEMENT If the diagnosis is suspected, the patient should be treated with appropriate analgesia and antibiotics should be administered. He should be discouraged from passing urine. A full bladder should be drained with a catheter placed by percu taneous suprapubic puncture using a Seldinger technique. This reduces urinary extravasation and allows investigations to establish the extent of the urethral injury. Diagnosis is made by urethrography using water-soluble contrast. If there is significant extravasation, then the perineal collection should be drained. The suprapubic catheter should remain in situ while the bruising and extravasation settle down and a stricture will typically develop at the site of the injury. The optimal treatment is delayed anastomotic urethroplasty after the swelling and bruising have settled down (typically 8-12 weeks later), with excision of the traumatised section and spatulated end-to-end reanastomosis of the urethra.

Raised Intra cranial Pressure will cause: March 2007,Tachycardia,Hypotension,Papilloedema,Normal looking anterior fontanelle in infants,"Ans. C: Papilloedema ICP at rest is normally 7-15 mmHg for a supine adult, and becomes negative (averaging ""10 mmHg) in the veical position. Increased ICP One of the most damaging aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. The body's response to a decrease in CPP is to raise blood pressure and dilate blood vessels in the brain. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP fuher and causing a vicious cycle. Neurologic changes seen in increased ICP are mostly due to hypoxia and hypercapnea and are as follows: decreased LOC, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, hyperventilation, sluggish dilated pupils and widened pulse pressure. Signs and symptoms of increased ICP In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP including headache, nausea, vomiting, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens (CrN VI) palsies, and the Cushing's triad. Cushing's triad involves an increased systolic blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a slow hea rate is especially suggestive of high ICP. Irregular respirations occur when injury to pas of the brain interfere with the respiratory drive. In infants and small children, the effects of ICP differ because their cranial sutures have not closed. In infants, the fontanelles, or soft spots on the head where the skull bones have not yet fused, bulge when ICP gets too high.",C

A classic example (""football knee"") involves a player who is hit while running. The knee, supporting all the player's weight, usually is slightly flexed, and the foot is anchored to the ground by cleats. Impact from an opposing player usually causes rotation almost entirely restricted to the knee. The injury involves rapid rotation of the flexed femoral condyles about the tibial plateau, which most frequently tears the medial meniscus. (Less frequently, the lateral meniscus is torn.) A tear in the inner free border of the cartilage is also common whenever excessive rotation without flexion or extension occurs.

Eccrine or Typical sweat glands

- Distributed all over the body ; most numerous in the palms and soles, the forehead and scalp and the axilla.
- Have a role in control of body temperature.
- Innervated by cholinergic nerves.
Apocrine or Atypical sweat glands

Apocrine glands are particularly large glands of the dermis or hypodermis, classed as a type of sweat gland. In the adult, they are present in the axillae, perianal region, areolae, periumbilical skin, prepuce, scrotum, mons pubis and labia minora.
The excretory ducts open into the hair follicle (instead of on the skin surface as in the eccrine sweat gland)
Apocrine sweat glands are functional after puberty and are supplied by adrenergic nerves.
The secretions of apocrine sweat glands are viscous and contain proteins. They are odourless but after bacteria decomposition they give off body odours that vary from person to person.

Cobra head appearance on excretory urography is suggestive of:,Horseshoe kidney,Duplication of renal pelvis,Simple cyst of kidney,Ureterocele,"The term ureterocele denotes a cystic ballooning of the distal end of the ureter. This type of ureterocele is also termed ohotopic, since it arises from a ureter with a normal inseion into the trigone. An intravesical ureterocele results from the prolapse of the mucosa of the terminal segment of the ureter through the ureterovesical orifice into the bladder. This prolapsed ureteral mucosa carries with it a poion of the continuous sheet of the bladder mucosa around the orifice. The prolapsed segment thus has a wall that consists of a thin layer of muscle and collagen interposed between the bladder uroepithelium and the ureter uroepithelium. Since the terminal ureteral orifice is usually narrowed and paially obstructed, and since there is no muscle suppo for the double mucosal walls of the prolapsed segment, it dilates. This dilated segment fills with urine and protrudes into the bladder. On excretory urography, cobra head sign is classically seen with an intravesical ureterocele.

Which anesthetic agent is associated with the highest level of carbon monoxide formation?,Halothane,Influrane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,"Desflurane undergoes degradation to carbon monoxide in the presence of strong bases in dry CO2 absorbents ( like desiccated soda lime). The propensity for CO production correlates with anesthetic concentration in the breathing circuit (Desflurane > Isoflurane > enflurane). Though Sevoflurane, methoxyflurane, and halothane also degrade in the presence of strong bases, they do not produce CO. CO production is predominantly seen with absorbents that contain barium hydroxide and when the water content of soda lime or Baralyme falls below 1.4% and 5%. Amsorb is a CO2 absorbent which is more ine than soda lime and baralyme and so associated with lesser degradation of anesthetics and so less carbon monoxide production.",C

This is a highly successful procedure in more than 95% of cases. Endoscopic incision (urethrotomy) through the scar tissue of an obliterated urethra is a hopeless procedure and uniformly fails. Partial urethral narrowing can initially be treated by endoscopic incision with higher success.

Sahiston Textbook of Surgery, 19th Edition, Pg: 1313.Explanation:""The most common presenting symptom of colovesical fistula is pneumaturia""About other optionsBarium enema is diagnostic - barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time.Common in females - more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder.May be a surgical complication - Colovesical fistulas can occur as a result of surgical complication, however it is rare. Iatrogenic Rectovesical fistula is more common.Hence, option A. commonly presents withpneumaturia appears more appropriate.Vesicoenteric fistulasIt commonly occurs in the setting of bowel disease, such as diverticulitis. colorectal carcinoma, and Crohn's disease.Less common causes include irradiation, infection, and trauma (external penetrating trauma as well as iatrogenic surgical trauma).Diverticulitis is the most common cause of colovesical fistula, accounting for approximately 70% of cases.Sigmoid-vesicular fistulas are more common in men than in women because the uterus prevents the sigmoid from adhering to the bladder.Women with sigmoid fistulas have usually had a prior hysterectomyClinical featuresAlthough enterovesical fistulae are almost always secondary to extravesical pathology, they present with urinary symptomsThe MC presenting symptom is pneumaturia, (seen in 50% to 85% cases)Irritative voiding symptoms (in 70% to 90% cases)Fecaluria (20% to 68%) of patients with enterovesical fistulae and tends to be more common with diverticular and malignant fistulae.The classic presentation of vesicoenteric fistula is described as Gouverneur's syndrome and consists of suprapubic pain, urinary frequency, dysuria, and tenesmus.Other symptoms include hematuria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urinary retention, perineal pain, hematochezia, and fever.Urine in the stool is rarely reported with enterovesical fistulae: these fistulae tend to be unidirectional with flow from the high-pressure intestinal tract to the low-pressure urinary tractInvestigationsThe most reliable test Computed Tomography (CT Scan), which may demonstrate air in the bladder ' .The triad of findings on CT that are suggestive of colovesical fistulaBladder wall thickening adjacent to a loop of thickened colonAir in the bladder (in the absence of previous lower urinary tract manipulation)Presence of colonic diverticula.A barium enema will fail to reveal a fistula 50% of the time, and an IV pyelogram is even less accurate.Cystoscopy usually reveals cystitis and bullous edema at the site of the fistula, but the test is helpful to exclude cancer (colon or bladder) as the cause of the fistula.ManagementNonoperative managementIn nontoxic, minimally symptomatic patients with nonmalignam causes of enterovesical fistulas, a trial of medical therapy including intravenous total parenteral nutrition bowel rest, and antibiotics may be warranted.This may be the preferred initial approach, especially in patients with Crohn's disease, in whom the notion of immediate exploratory laparotomy and bowel resection is discouraged because of the chronic relapsing nature of the disease.Operative ManagementThe goal of operative management is to separate and close the involved organs with minimal anatomic disruption and normal long-term function of both systems.Both one- and tw o-stage procedures have been advocated, depending on the clinical circumstances.A one-stage procedure involves removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and primary reanastomosis of the bowel after resection of the involved bowel segment.A two-stage approach advocates removal of the fistula, closure of the involved organs, and construction of a temporary proximal diverting colostomy, with a later return to the operating room for colostomy takedown once the fistula track is demonstrated to be closed.The choice of whether to proceed with a one- stage or two-stage repair is influenced by the location and cause of the fistula, the patient's general condition, the presence of a pelvic abscess, and the presence of colonic obstruction.Patients with an inflammatory cause of the fistula hut without gross contamination can be treated with a one-stage procedure, whereas those with unprepared bowel, gross contamination, or abscess may require a two-stage procedure.",A

Which of the following is the skeletal muscle relaxant of choice in liver and renal disease ?,Mivacurium,Atracurium,Gallium,Vecuronium,"Atracurium is degraded by both pH and temperature dependent Hofmann elimination (autolysis) and by ester hydrolysis; it therefore does not require a dosage adjustment in patients with renal or hepatic failure. However, acidosis and severe hypothermia decrease the rate of drug metabolism and should prompt dose reduction. Mivacurium is a sho-acting benzylisoquinoline with an onset of action comparable to atracurium but with one-third its duration of action, because of rapid hydrolysis by plasma pseudocholinesterase. However, patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency may have depressed pseudocholinesterase activity leading to delayed elimination.

Treatment of bupivacaine toxicity includes: (PGI May 2011),Isoprenaline,Calcium channel blockers,Bretylium,Metoprolol,"Ans: C (Bretylium) TREATMENT OF BUP1VACA1NE INDUCED CARDIOTOXIC1TY MILLER 6TH/933""Many resuscitation drugs, including atropine, epinephrine, bretylium, lidocaine, amrinone, and phenytoin, have been used in animal studies and occasionally in humans for the treatment of bupivacaine overdose and cardiovascular collapse. In our view, beyond the established uses of epinephrine, vasopressin, and atropine in their designated steps in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and beyond the use of Intralipid as detailed later, there is no established role for anti arrhythmic drugs or other traditional resuscitation drugs in the setting of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest It is not recommended that bupivacaine-induced ventricular arrhythmias be treated with iidocaine or amiodaroneThe clinical implications for cardiac resuscitation after intravascular injection or overdose of local anesthetic are the following: Miller 6th/933No medications are uniformly effective in facilitating resuscitation from bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest or severe ventricular tachycardia. Basic principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be emphasized first, including attention to securing the airway; providing oxygenation and ventilation, and performing chest compressions if needed.Because resuscitation after local anesthetic-induced circulatory collapse is so difficult, prevention of massive intravascular injection or excessive dosing is crucial.Negative aspiration of the syringe does not always exclude intravascular placement, incremental, fractionated dosing should be the rule for all patients undergoing major conduction blockade. Although changes on the ECG are not always present before circulatory collapse, they often are, and continuous attention to the ECG (including changes in QRS morphology, rate, rhythm, or ectopy) may be lifesaving by terminating injection before a lethal dose is administered.If a patient experiences profound cardiovascular depression or circulatory arrest after the administration of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or by extrapolation, other local anesthetics, then along with initiation of basic life support and theACLS protocol we support the recommendation of Weinberg and colleagues that a rapid bolus of Intralipid 20%<t\ 1.5 mL/kg (or roughly 100 mL in adults), be administered without delay, followed if necessary by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for the next 10 minutesTreatment of Bupivacaine Induced Cardiotoxicity Barash Anesthesia 6th/545""Potent local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine! can produce profound cardiovascular depression and malignant dysrhythmias that should be promptly treated. Oxygenation and ventilation must be immediately instituted, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed. Ventricular dysrhythmias may be difficult to treat and may need large and multiple doses of electrical cardioversion, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone. The use of calcium channel blockers in this setting is not recommended, as its cardiodepressant effect is exaggerated""A novel and promising treatment for cardiac toxicity is the administration of intravenous lipid to theoretically remove bupivacaine from sites of action. Administration of 100 mL of 20% lipid solution has been reported to allow successful resuscitation of a patient from bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias refractory to conventional therapy.These findings raise the question of whether standard propofol in a 10% lipid solution would be a preferred treatment for cardiac toxicity. However, the dose of lipid in a standard induction dose of propofol would be too small and the dose of propofol would lead to unacceptable cardiac depression",C
"In excessive burns, least useful is -",Blood,Dextran,Ringer lactate,Nasogastric intubation,"We know that Ringer's lactate is the preferred agent during initial 24 hrs.
Nasogastric intubation is done to decrease the risk of emesis and possible aspiration (as parlytic ileus develops in a pt. with significant burn)
Dextran is a colloid and can be used in 2nd 24 hrs., however albumin is the preferred and most widely used colloid.
Blood has also role in burn patient.
The need for Blood replacement is significant in extensive burns. Besides injury to red blood cells and their decreased half-life resulting in their early destruction, many patients may be anaemic. Hence, repeated and frequent transmission to maintain a hematocrit around 35% is necessary.
Schwartz 9/e p201 writes- ""The role of blood transfusion in burns has undergone a re-evaluation in recent years. A large multicenter study found that increased numbers of transfusions were associated with
increased infections and a higher mortality rate in burn patients, even when correcting for burn severity. A follow-up study implanting a restrictive transfusion policy in burned children showed that a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dL had no more adverse outcomes versus a traditional transfusion trigger of 10 g/dL.
These data, in concert with other reported complications such as transfusion-related lung injury, have led to recommendations that blood transfusions be used only when there is an apparent physiologic need.""",A

Regarding liver enzymes true is?,ALT is less specific than AST,Absolute levels of enzyme markers correlate with outcome,Glutathione-s-transferase used as hepatic prognostic marker following surgery,None.,"Glutathione-s-transferase used as hepatic prognostic marker following surgery REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition chapter 298 The aminotransferases (transaminases) are sensitive indicators of liver cell injury and are most helpful in recognizing acute hepatocellular diseases such as hepatitis. They include the aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) There is a poor correlation between the degree of liver cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. Thus, the absolute elevation of the aminotransferases is of no prognostic significance in acute hepatocellular disorders. Alanine aminotransferase: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was formerly known as SGPT. This enzyme enters the blood when liver cells are damaged or destroyed and circulates for a few days. ALT is found primarily in the liver. (More specific for liver pathology) This enzyme is a sensitive indicator of active liver damage but does not indicate the cause or reversibility of the damage. An increase of at least three times normal indicates significant liver damage within the previous 2 to 5 days. Aspaate aminotransferase: Aspaate transaminase (AST), also called as serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT). AST is found in the liver, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, pancreas, lungs, leukocytes, and erythrocytes in decreasing order of concentration. Alpha Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Increased GST indicates early hepatocyte injury. Alpha glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a superior marker of hepatocyte injury from toxicity; ischemia, and other liver injury. It is unique to hepatocytes, found in high concentrations, and is readily released in response to injury. Its rapid release into and removal from the circulation provides immediate information regarding liver status.",C

The development of a clinically significant metabolic alkalosis is secondary not only to the loss of acid or addition of alkali but also to renal responses that maintain the alkalosis (paradoxical aciduria). The normal kidney can tremendously augment its excretion of acid or alkali in response to changes in ingested load. However, in the presence of significant volume depletion and consequent excessive salt and water retention, the tubular maximum for bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. Correction of volume depletion alone is usually sufficient to correct the alkalosis, since the kidney will then excrete the excess bicarbonate. HCl infusion is usually unnecessary. Acetazolamide can be utilized to increase renal excretion of bicarbonate but should be avoided in volume-depleted individuals. Moreover, to the extent that acetazolamide causes natriuresis, it will exacerbate the volume depletion.",A

All the following are true about Meckel's diveiculum except-,Bleeding,Intussusception,Arises at the mesentric border,Located 60 cm from the cecal valve,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Arises at the Mesentric border Meckel's diveiculum is situated at the anti-mesenteric border of small intestine. Meckel's diveiculum is a true diveiculum as it has all the 3 layers of the intestine. It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract. Male to female ratio is 3 : 2. Approximately 60% of Meckel's diveicula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are -colonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue. A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diveicula is Rule of two : i.e. - 2% prevalence - 2 inch in length - 2 feet proximal to ilcocecal valve. half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age Meckel's diveicula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs. Complications Most common complication in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) --> bleeding in adults --> intestinal obstruction overall --> bleeding Following complications are noted in Meckel's diveiculum. (1) Bleeding - bleeding in Meckel's diveiculum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diveiculum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diveiculum. (2) Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diveiculum can result from several mechanisms. a) Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diveiculum to the umbilicus b) Intussusception with the diveiculum acting as the lead point. c) Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiveicular band (Mesodiveicular band is a remnant of left vitelline aery, it tethers the Meckel's diveiculum to the ileal mesentry.) d) Stricture secondary to chronic diveiculitis. (3) Diveiculitis - clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. - diveiculitis may lead to perforation. Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diveiculum is found in inguinal or femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia. Diagnostic studies Meckel's diveiculum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follow through can rarely demonstrate the diveiculum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diveicula in 75% of cases but is avoided during acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diveiculum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium"" peechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diveiculum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to meckel's diveicula.",C

Which of the following is true about spinal anesthesia?,Onset of analgesia takes about 15 minutes,Anesthesia is injected in subarachnoid space,Most common complication is PDPH,May lead to intra-operative tachycardia,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Anesthesia is injected in subarachnoid space * In spinal anesthesia LA is injected into subarachnoid space (space between pia matter and arachnoid matter).* Structure pierced during SA (from outside in) - Skin - subcutaneous tissue - Supraspinous & intraspinous ligament - Ligamentum falvum - Durameter - Arachnoid matter.* Site of spinal anesthesia is L2-3 or L3-4 intervertebral space in adult (In adult spinal cord ends at lower border of Llvertebrae). In children it is L4-5 intervertebral space (spinal cord ends at lower border L3 vertebrae in children).* Spinal anesthesia leads to creation of a zone of differential blockade, i.e., motor fibres are blocked two levels lower and autonomic fibers are blocked two levels higher than the sensory blockade due to different sensitivity of different fibers.* High spinal (Total spinal) anesthesia: - It occurs when the effect of spinal anesthesia ascends to higher (cervical) levels. It can also occur following attempted epidural/caudal anesthesia if there is inadvertent intrathecal injection. It causes severe hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory insufficiency with loss of consciousness.About other options* Hypotension is the most common complication of spinal anesthesia.* The onset of analgesia is approximately 15-30 minutes in an epidural, while it is approximately 5 minutes in spinal anesthesia.",B
All the following are true about Regional anesthesia Except,Increases blood loss,Less complications after vascular surgery,Decreases Shivering after induction of anaesthesia,Less Complications after colon surgery,"Davis et al. showed that spinal anesthesia decreases blood loss during hip replacement surgery. Christopher et al. showed that compared with general anesthesia, epidural anesthesia is associated with a lower incidence of reoperation for inadequate tissue perfusion and therefore main be advantageous for this surgical population. The paper showed 50 % reduction in the overall incidence of shivering in patients who received fentanyl, and there was some evidence to suggest that low-dose epidural fentanyl might reduce shivering by an influence on thermoregulation. Epidural analgesia with bupivacaine and morphine provided the best balance of analgesia and side effects while accelerating postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function and time to fulfillment of discharge criteria in relatively healthy patients. The presence of epidural analgesia was associated with a significantly lower odds of death at 7 days.",A
"All of the following statements regarding Gleason score are true, EXCEPT:",Used for grading prostate cancer,Scores range from 1-10,"Higher the score, poorer the prognosis",Helps in planning management,"Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10. Gleason score and grading system: Gleason score is the most commonly used histological grading system for prostate cancer. The two most predominant histological patterns of the prostate cancer are assigned a Gleason grade ranging from 1 - 5. Primary grade is assigned to the pattern of cancer that is most commonly observed in the histological slides of the specimen. Secondary grade is assigned to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen. Gleason score is the sum of the two grades. Thus it is also known as Gleason sum. If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and sencondary grades are repoed as the same grade. As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus range from 2 to 10. The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts prognosis and helps guide therapy.",B

What is not true regarding Bochdalek hernia ?,Early respiratory distress leading to early diagnosis and treatment are good prognostic sign.,Stomach and transverse colon are commonest content to herniate,Diagnosed prenataly by ultrasound,Common on left posterior side,"Ans is 'a' Early respiratory distress leading Neonates presenting with symptoms of respiratory distress within 24 hrs is a poor prognostic sign. The earlier the symptoms arise the worst is the prognosis. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia It is the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defect The defect may be posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia) retrosternal (Morgagni hernia) at the esophageal hiatus (hiatal hernia) adjacent to the hiatus (paresophageal hernia) Although all these defects are congenital, the term congenital diaphragmatic hernia is generally used for Bochdalek hernia. Bochdalek hernia Most Bochdalek hernia are on the left side (-80%)and may rarely be bilateral. Compression of the lung results in pulmonary hypoplasia, involving both the lungs (ipsilateral > contralateral) Pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal leading to pulmonary hypeension. Thus the two main factors that affect morbidity and moality are pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypeension. The most frequent clinical presentation of CDH is respiratory distress due to severe hypoxemia. - The anteroposterior diameter of the chest may be large along with a scaphoid abdomen. The diagnosis of CDH can be made prenatally by ultrasound. The postnatal diagnosis is relatively straightforward because a plain chest radiograph demonstrates the gastric air bubbles or loops of bowel within the chest. There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the side of the hernia.",A

A female presented with a pigmented lesion with irregular border and variegated coloring diagnosed as melanoma.

Depth of invasion is the most impoant histologic prognostic parameter in primary melanoma. Breslow depth and Clark level are two different classifications of depth of invasion. Breslow depth is a quantitative measurement of the depth of invasion by measuring the tumor thickness with an ocular micrometer. Clark's staging refers to the histologic level of invasion, using the epidermis, papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and subcutaneous fat as the histologic boundaries. With the 2002 AJCC staging classification, tumor thickness measured by Breslow depth was determined to be primary factor for T staging. The presence of ulceration was found to be a powerful predictor of survival, and hence it is incorporated in the staging system. Ref: Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery edited by Maria Z.

"Foot drop occurs due to the involvement of:September 2006, March 2013 (b, f g, h)",Sciatic nerve,Direct injury to the dorsiflexors,Common peroneal nerve palsy,All of the above,"Ans. D: All of the aboveFoot drop may follow direct injury to the dorsiflexors.A few cases of rupture of the tibialis anterior tendon leading to foot drop and suspicion of peroneal nerve palsy have occurred. This subcutaneous tendon rupture usually occurs after a minor trauma with the foot in plantar flexion.Compament syndromes also may lead to foot drop.March gangrene, a form of anterior compament syndrome, is thought to be due to edema and small hemorrhages in the muscles of the anterior compament occurring after strenuous activity in individuals not accustomed to it. Deep posterior compament syndrome also may result in foot drop as a late sequela due to resultant contracture formation.Neurologic causes of foot drop include mononeuropathies of the deep peroneal, common peroneal, or sciatic nerves. Lumbosacral plexopathy, lumbar radiculopathy, motor neuron disease, or parasagittal coical or subcoical cerebral lesions also can manifest as foot drop. These lesions can be differentiated through clinical and electrodiagnostic examinations.A common behavioral cause of foot drop is habitual crossing of the legs. These cases typically resolve with discontinuation of the habit.Foot drop also may be seen as a combination of neurologic, muscular, and anatomic dysfunction. Charcot foot is one example.",D

Many lipomas are small (under one centimeter diameter) but can enlarge to sizes greater than six centimeterso Lipomas are commonly found in adults from 40 to 60 years of age, but can also be found in younger adults and children.o It is also known as universal tumourOther conditionso Lipomatosis is believed to be a hereditary condition in which multiple lipomas are present on the bodyo Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. Early studies mentioned prevalence in obese postmenopausal women. However, current literature demonstrates that Dercum disease is present in more women than men of all body types; the average age for diagnosis is 35 years.o Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years ofalcoholism. But, non-alcoholics and females can also be affected.Treatmento Usually, treatment of a lipoma is not necessary, unless the tumor becomes painful or restricts movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons, if they grow very large, or for histopathology to check that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma..o Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. This cures the great majority of cases, with about 1-2% of lipomas recurring after excision.o Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissuecomponent. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth.",D

You assist to deliver a full term baby boy who is otherwise normal but has a left cleft of the upper lip that extends upward toward the left nostril and left anterior cleft of the primary palate just deep to the cleft lip. These defects are most likely due to a failure of which of the following?,Mandibular process to fuse with the lateral nasal process,Mandibular process to fuse with the medial nasal process,Maxillary process to fuse the lateral nasal process,Maxillary process to fuse the medial nasal process,The lateral nasal process forms the alar region of the nose. Normally the maxillary process moves medially and fuses with the medial nasal process at the philtrum on both sides of the upper lip. The fact that the cleft involves both the lip and bony primary palate suggests failure of the maxillary process to fuse with the medial nasal process. The mandibular process does not normally fuse with either the lateral or medial nasal processes. That would reduce the size of the mouth.

"A gastric biopsy is performed on a patient with suspected graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation. The biopsy demonstrates many isolated dying epithelial cells in crypts showing fragmented, hyperchromatic nuclei and small discrete blebs containing both cytoplasm and nuclear fragments. The biopsy demonstrates which of the following?",Apoptosis,Caseous neurosis,Coagulative necrosis,Gangrenous necrosis,"The changes described are those of apoptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis can be seen in a variety of settings. In this case, it is occurring in the context of graft-versus-host disease, which is mediated by CD8+ and CD4+ cells. Apoptosis also occurs during embryogenesis, during hormone-dependent involution in the adult (eg, during menstruation), during rapid proliferation of cell populations (eg, intestinal crypt epithelia), and in the immune system (e.g., in developing thymus). It can also occur after duct obstruction in organs such as pancreas and during some viral diseases. The hallmark of this programmed method of cell death is the fragmentation of the cell with formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized by other healthy cells. Caseous necrosis, such as is seen in tuberculosis, shows necrotic, amorphous granular debris surrounded by a granulomatous response. Coagulative necrosis, such as is seen in myocardial infarction, shows coagulated, anuclear cell ""ghosts.""

The advantages of occluding the subdiaphragmatic aorta (as opposed to the supradiaphragmatic aorta) are that it: (a) avoids opening another major cavity; and (b) results in less diminution of blood flow to the spinal cord and renal circulation. Further attempts to resuscitate the patient with whole blood will not be successful until bleeding sites are controlled; such measures may even increase bleeding by elevating blood pressure, which reopens vessels that have already stopped bleeding.

True statement (s) about sugammadex:,Antisuccinylcholine in action,Selectively binds to rocuronium,Used along with rocuronium for rapid induction Anesthesia,Discovered to reverse the effects of atracurium,"B. Selectively binds to rocuroniumSugammadex Morgan 5th/23lSugammadex is a novel selective relaxant-binding agentIts three-dimensional structure resembles a hollow truncated cone or doughnut with a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic exterior.Hydrophobic interactions trap the drug (e.g., rocuronium) in the cyclodextrin cavity (doughnut hole), resulting in tight formation of a water-soluble guest-host complex in a 1:1 ratio. This terminates the neuromuscular blocking action and restrains the drug in extracellular fluid where it cannot interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.It is essentially eliminated unchanged via the kidneys.It produces rapid and effective reversal of both shallow and profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in a consistent manner.* Barash 6th/Chap 20Sugammadex, previously called ORG 25969, leads to restoration of normal neuromuscular function not by interfering with acetylcholine, the nicotinic receptor or acetylcholinesterase, but by selectively binding to rocuronium, and to a lesser extent to vecuronium and pancuronium.Selective relaxant binding agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) induced by rocuronium or vecuronium in adults undergoing surgery""-reference.medscape.comThe compound is a cyclodextrin, made up of eight sugars arranged in a ring to make a center to accommodate the rocuronium molecule. Once bound, rocuronium is held in place by polar side chains attached to the ring.Because sugammadex does not bind to any known receptory it is devoid of major cardiovascular or other side effects.It does not bind neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not have a steroid nucleus.The benzylisoquinolines, such as atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium, and succinylcholine are unaffected by sugammadex.After injection of sugammadex, evidence suggests that binding of rocuronium to sugammadex in plasma leads to a marked decrease in free (unbound) rocuronium concentration, 153 leading to the establishment of a concentration gradient of rocuronium between the neuromuscular junction and plasma. This favors movement of rocuronium from neuromuscular junction to plasma, producing less neuromuscular block. Vecuronium has less affinity for sugammadex than rocuronium does, and pancuronium has less still.Sugammadex could also be used in the case of a failed intubation. If rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was given, sugammadex 8 mg/kg might be effective as early as 3 minutes after rocuronium injection, and if the dose of rocuronium is doubled to 1.2 mg/ kg, one might need 16 mg/kg of sugammadex. The availability of sugammadex might make succinylcholine obsolete for intubation.",B

About CPAP all are true except:,Given prophylactically in all preterm with respiratory distress,Staed with Fi02 50 to 60 percent,Given in infants less than 28 weeks and less than 1 kg weight,Improves oxygenation and improves lung compliance,"B. i.e. Staed with Fi0250-60% (Nasal CPAP or intubation at bih for very preterm infants. The new England journal of medicine Feb 08 vol 358: 700 - 708 nuber 07) Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is associated with ventilation (intubation) & 02 treatment. Infants who were born at 25 -28 weeks gestation and were breathing spontaneously were treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) sholy (at 5 minutes) after bih. 50% were subsequently intubated. Infants in CPAP group had a better outcome at 28th day than did those in intubated group (i.e. required significantly lower rate of 02 treatment and underwent fewer days of ventilation) even though the rate of pneumothorae was higher in CPAP group. A CPAP of 8 - 12 cm of water was used to maintain functional residual capacity and for improving lung compliance and oxygenation. The study suggests that staing respiratory suppo with CPAP does not adversely affect, infants even if upto 50% of them subsequently undergo ventilation (intubation), some because of pneumothorax. Ammar et al also showed that 76% of infants < 1.251 kg and 50% of those weighing < 0.751 kg did not need to undergo ventilation (intubation). Previous research suggest that CPAP (nasal) application in preterm infants is associated with benefits in terms of reduced respiratory failure and reduced duration and invasiveness of respiratory suppo; without worsening of other standard measures of neonatal outcome (bronchopulmonary dysplasia & death). Among spontaneously breathing very premature infants, surfactant therapy administered within 10 hour of life along with nasal CPAP decreases the oxygen requirement, need for mechanical ventilation and may prevent chronic lung disease.",B

No single parameter is 100% predictive; attempted extubation should be based on correction of the underlying pathology, clinical status and hemodynamic stability, and a combination of the following parameters. The rapid shallow breathing index is the ratio of the respiratory rate to tidal volume. There is evidence to suggest that an index between 60 and 105 predicts successful extubation. The negative inspiratory force should be at least greater than -20 cm H2O. The patient should be weaned to 5 cm H2O PEEP before attempting extubation.

It is an inverting suture, that can be either continuous or interrupted, used to join two segments of an intestine without entering the lumen (the inner channel through which stomach contents flow).Methods of Intestinal AnastomosisSutured anastomosisStapled AnastomosisOther*.

Compression rings*. Tissue adhesives*. Metal wires*. Magnets Single Layer Anastomosis: An interrupted seromuscular suture, with absorbable thread. The submucosal layer is strong & the blood supply is only minimally damaged.Double Layer Anastomosis:An inner continuous absorbable suture, with stitching of all layers.An outer, seromuscular, interrupted non-absorbable suture.Serosa apposition & mucosa inversion, the inner layer has a hemostatic effect, but the mucosa is strangulated. Connell stitch - continuous.Other Options[?]Principles of Anastomosis:No disparity between the two ends of lumen. If one end is narrower it can be enlarged by 'fish mouthing' of the end.To prevent leakage of contents & to steady the two ends, non-crushing clams or stay sutures to be applied across the gut.Three types of suture can be used for anastomosis of the gut:-All coat stitches: All layers of the gut are taken. Advocated by Halsted.-Extra-mucosal or sero-submucosal technique: All layers are included except mucosa. Submucosa is the strongest layer, as it contains plenty of collagen tissue.-Sero-muscular stitch: Bites taken through the serosa & part of the muscular layer. Also known as Lembert stitch. Used as a second layer to strengthen the first layer.[?]Suture Material:Two-layer anastomoses are made with an inner layer of absorbable suture & outer layer of non-absorbable sutures. Single layer anastomoses are usually made with non-absorbable materials.Polyglycolic acid & Polyglactin most popular absorbable suture material.Non-absorbable sutures on the mucosal aspect of gut provoke a significant foreign body reaction & granuloma formationThis is of little practical significance in small & large intestinal anastomoses but in gastric mucosa may result in ulceration & clinical symptoms.Theoretically mono-filament sutures like nylon or polypropylene may cause less tissue reaction than braided sutures, but the difference in the intestine appears to be relatively minor & the mono-filament sutures have inferior handling qualities.Most surgeons prefer braided silk because of good handling.Size of the gauge used for anastomoses is use 2-0/3-0 in adult surgery as the finer sizes will have tendency to cut through.[?]Surgical Intervention Urgent Laparotomy:Gangrenous small intestine or Right colon = Resection & primary anastomosis Infarction of large intestine 'rare' due to embolization of middle colic artery.

In relation to Ethylene glycol poisoning,It may present with an acute ascending motor and sensory neuropathy,A normal anion gap acidosis is usually seen,Alcohol dehydrogenase catabolises the metabolism of EG into metabolites including oxalate and glycolic acid,Haemodialysis is not effective,"Ethylene Glycol poisoning presents in three phases depending on timing: initially (30-60 minutes) after ingestion acute intoxication occurs. This may also result in excitatory symptoms, cerebral oedema, convulsions and coma. The second phase occurs at 12-18 hours with predominantly cardiovascular effects including dysrhythmias and cardiac failure. Profound metabolic acidosis often causes death during this phase. Phase three occurs at 2-3 days with predominantly renal failure and acute tubular necrosis due to calcium deposition. Finally, a delayed neurologic phase can occur 5-20 days post-ingestion, presenting with neurological effects including profound limb weakness, cranial nerve palsies and sensory disturbance. EG causes an increased anion gap acidosis. Other causes of a raised anion gap acidosis include lactate, toxins (ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paraldehyde, aspirin, cyanide, iron, isoniazid), and ketoacidosis (diabetes, alcohol). Causes of a normal anion gap acidosis include gastrointestinal losses (diarrhea), renal loss of bicarbonate (proximal renal tubular acidosis), renal failure and hyperchloraemic acidosis. Renal replacement therapy is a very effective treatment for EG poisoning, as it corrects acid-base status and eliminates EG and some of the harmful metabolites. Fomepizole is a potent inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase preventing the production of toxic metabolites of EG. It is given as a loading dose 15mg/kg and then 10mg/kg every 12 hours for the next 48 hours. After which, the dose is increased to 15mg/kg 12hourly.

Polyps less than 1 cm can be followed with serial ultrasonography to detect any change in size or character as the incidence of malignancy in polyps less than 1 cm is extremely low.* Radical en-bloc resections which may include segmental or extended hepatectomy, bile duct resection and regional lymphadenectomy should be considered in selected patients. The aim is to remove the tumour entirely and achieve negative histopathological margins. This option can be considered in the operable patients with carcinoma of gall bladder, who come under stage IIA of gall bladder carcinoma and beyond.* Note: Hepatic lobectomy is indicated for the gall bladder carcinoma with local infiltration in the liver tissue. This comes under T3 in the TNM classification. Such patients are not included in the sage of gall bladder carcinoma <stage IIA. Thus resection of hepatic lobe for operable cases of gall bladder carcinoma can only be considered from / beyond stage IIA of gall bladder carcinoma. Gall bladder cancer for most patients is a lethal disease with a grim prognosis. The median survival is less than six months and a five-year survival figure of 5 per cent reported.",B

Tenderness in the anatomist's snuffbox may be observed. Select the type of fracture or dislocation with which it is most likely to be associated (SELECT 1 INJURY),Navicular (scaphoid) fracture,Monteggia's deformity,Greenstick fracture,Spiral fracture,"Fractures of the navicular bone of the wrist should be suspected in anyone, particularly a young person, who falls on an outstretched hand. Although x-rays are mandatory, it is important to realize that the fracture may not be seen on the initial x-ray and that a presumptive diagnosis can and should be made on clinical grounds alone. Typically, there will be tenderness to palpation over the navicular tuberosity and limitation of wrist flexion and extension. Immobilization of the wrist for about 16 week and sometimes up to 6 month is required. Nonunion or avascular necrosis is not uncommon and may require bone grafting for correction.Dislocation of the radial head with a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna is known as Monteggia's deformity. Usually, the radial head is dislocated anteriorly. The injury is usually caused by forced pronation. The injury can be treated by reduction and stabilization of the ulna followed by reduction of the radial head via supination and direct pressure.Anterior shoulder dislocations occur more frequently than posterior dislocations. However, posterior dislocations are seen in special situations, such as during an epileptiform convulsion and during electroshock therapy. Closed reduction followed by immobilization is usually sufficient therapyA spiral fracture, frequently seen in the tibia in skiers, results from the application of torque to a long bone. Greenstick fractures are common in children. The bones of young children are able to bend to a greater degree than those of adults; the fracture may occur only at the site of maximal cortical stress but not at the opposite cortex, the site of maximal longitudinal compression.",A

Commonest operation done for gastric outlet obstruction with peptic ulcer is: March 2007,Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy,Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy,Highly selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty,Gastrojejunostomy,"Ans. A: Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomyGastric outlet obstruction is manifested by obstruction at the level of the pylorus, which is the outlet of the stomach. Patients may develop vomiting, which may be projectile but non-bilious in nature, nausea or abdominal pain. An unusual finding that may lead to the diagnosis is the succussion splash, a splash-like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient, with or without the stethoscope.The diagnosis is typically made by X-ray, which will show an absent air bubble in the stomach, or by CT scan.Causes of gastric outlet obstruction include peptic ulcer disease; tumours of the stomach, including adenocarcinoma (and its linitis plastica variant), lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours; infections, such as tuberculosis; and infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis.Metabolic alkalosis may develop as a result of loss of acid.Traditionally severe cases of Gastric outlet obstruction are treated usually by a gastroenterostomy rather than a pyloroplasty. Truncal vagotomy leads to reduction of the maximal acid output by 50% as vagus nerves are sectioned which critically controls the secretion of gastric acid.",A

False about hydatid cyst-,Mostly asymptomatic,Most commonly located in right lobe,Causative organism is echinococcus granulosus,Hepatic resection is never done,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Hepatic resection is never done Hydatid cyst of liver f (or Echinococcosis)o Cystic hydatid disease is caused by the larval/cyst stage of the tapeworm - Echinococcus granulosus (Other Echinococcus species affecting human are E. multiloculasis, E. vogeli & E. oligarthus).Man is the intermediate host of Echinococcus.Dog is the definitive host.Sheeps are the usual intermediate host, but humans are accidental intermediate hosts,o Organs commonly involved are liver and lung.The liver is involved in about two-third of E. granulosus infection and in nearly all E. multiloculasis infection,o Usually the cysts are single and involve the rt. lobe of liver.Clinical manifestationo Slowly enlarging echinococcal cysts are usually asymptomatic until their expanding size or their space occupying effect in the involved organ prduces symptoms o Symptoms when produced are - abdominal pain, dyspepsia, vomiting, hepatomegaly.DiagnosisoUSG and CT can diagnose the cystic lesion. There are certain signs which if present are pathognomic of hydatidDaughter cyst within the large cyst (may produce rosette appearance)Calcification of the wallo Serodiagnostic assay (ELISA) can be helpful in over 85% of patients.Treatmento Books differ on the treatment.According to Harrison-o Surgery has traditionally been the principal definitive method of treatment.o Currently 'PAIR' is the preferred method of t/t for sonologically appropriate lesions.PAIR is contraindjcatgiLfor :o Superficially located cysts (because of the risk of rupture)o For cysts with multiple thick internal septal divisions (honeycombing pattern)o For cysts communicating with the biliary tree,o Dead or inactive cystsPAIR stands for Percutaneous Aspirat ion Jn fusion ofscolicidal agents andReaspiration.In PAIR pt. is given prophhylactic coverage of albendazole; cyst is aspirated under ultrasound or CT guidance and scolicidal agents (ethanol or hypertonic saline) infused. Scolicidal agent is then reaspirated.PAIR has been found to'be equally effective as surgery with less morbidity and shorter hospital stay.o Surgery remains the treatment of choice for cysts where PAIR is not possible or cysts are refractory to PAIR and for complicated cysts (e.g. those communicating with the biliary tract). y Pericystectqmy is the preferred surgical approach, in which the complete cyst with surrounding fibrous tissue are removed.If surgical cystectomy is not technically feasible, then formal liver resection can be done.o For those patients who are poor candidates for cyst directed intervention (i.e. PAIR or surgery) - long durations of Albendazole is the mainstay of therapy.According to Schwartz (and Sabiston) -o Surgery is the preferred method of treatment, unless the cysts are small or the patient is not a suitable candidate for surgical resection.o For most cysts surgical resection involving laparoscopic or open complete cyst removal with instillation of a scolicidal agent is preferred and usually is curative.y If complete cystectomy is not possible, then formal anatomic liver resection can be used.o Treatment of Echinococcus multiloeularis.E. multiloeularis cyst is always multiloculated _T/t is surgical resection",D

Circumcision is contraindicated in -,Balanitis,Hypospadias,Paraphimosis,Exostrophy of bladder,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Hypospadias o Circumcision is not done in patients with hypospadias as the prepuce can later be used in surgical repair.o Circucision is mostly done for cultural reasons,o The medical indications for circumcision are:Phimosis & ParaphimosisRecurrent balanoposthitis. (i.e. inflammation of the foreskin)Recurrent urinary tract infection. (Circumcision is occasionally justified in boys with an abnormal upper urinary tract and recurrent urinary infection. It may also help boys with spina bifida who need to perform clean intermittent urethral catheterisation.)An emerging and still controversial indication for circumcision is in the prevention of sexually acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in communities where this disease is common; large clinical trials have recently shown that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV transmission.o Circumcision for medical reasons is best performed under general anaesthesia.Also know:o Circumcision soon after birth confers immunity against carcinoma of the penis.

All are true regarding mesothelioma except?,Bilaterally symmetrical,Associated with asbestos exposure,Histopathalogy shows biphasic pattern,Occurs in late middle age,"• Malignant mesothelioma is MC tumor of the pleura
• In 20% of malignant mesotheliomas, the tumor arises from peritoneum
• Exposure to asbestos is the major known risk factor
• More common in males, most common after 40 years of age.
• Three types: Epithelial, sarcomatous, and biphasic
• Epithelial types are associated with a more favorable prognosis
Pathophysiology
• Physical characteristics of specific fibers (referred to as serpentine or amphibole) have been shown to be important.
• Serpentine fibers: Large and curly, not able to travel beyond larger airways.
• Straight amphibole fibers: In particular the crocidoliteQ fibers navigate distally into the pulmonary parenchyma, most clearly associated with mesotheliomas.
• Latency period between asbestos exposure and the development of mesothelioma is at least 20 years.
• Multicentric tumor with multiple pleura-based nodules coalescing to form sheets of tumor (but not bilaterally symmetrical)
• Natural history of the disease in untreated patients culminates in death due to local extension.
Clinical Features
• Most patients present with dyspnea and chest pain.
• Over 90% have a pleural effusion.
Diagnosis
• Results of thoracentesis are diagnostic in <10% of patients.
• Chest X-ray: Pleural effusion, generalized pleural thickening and shrunken hemithorax.
• Thoracoscopy or open pleural biopsy with special staining of tumor samples is required to differentiate mesotheliomas from adenocarcinomas.
Management
• No effective therapy
• Treatment options: Supportive care only, surgical resection, and multimodality approaches (using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy).",A

""Melanoma is a neoplastic disorder produced by malignant transformation of the normal melanocytes. Melanocytes are the cells responsible for the production of the pigment melanin.
During the first trimester of fetal life precursor melanocytes arise in the neural crest. As the fetus develops, these cells migrate to areas such as the skin, meninges, mucous membranes, upper esophagus and eyes.
In each of the these locations, melanocytes have demonstrated a potential for malignant transformation, but the site most commonly associated with melanocytic transformation is the skin, where melanocytes reside at the dermal/epidermal junction"".",A
"A man takes peanut and develop stridor, neck swelling, tongue swelling and hoarseness of voice.

Harrison 17th/e p 2066 & 16riVe p 52, 1952] Angioedema is essentially an anaphylaxis limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues and can be due to drug allergy, insect stings or bites, desensitization injections or ingestion of ceain foods (paicularly eggs, shellfish or nuts) Sometimes reactions occur explosively after ingestion of minute amounts. Others (e.g. reactions to strawberries), may occur only after overindulgence and possibly result from direct (toxic) mediator liberation. It is characterized by a diffuse and painful swelling of loose subcutaneous tissue, e.g. dorsum of hands or feet, eyelids, lips, genitalia and mucous membrane. Edema of the upper airways may produce respiratory distress and the stridor may be mistaken for asthma. Treatment Epinephrine should be the first treatment for acute pharyngeal or laryngeal angioedema. This may be supplemented, by a nebulized agonist (e.g. albuterol) and an I.V. antihistamine (diphenhydramine). This is usually sufficient to prevent airway obstruction hut intubating or performing a tracheostomy and administering 0, might be necessary. Also know Uicaria This is also an anaphylaxis reaction, but in uicarias the disease is limited to the superficial tissues. Uicaria is characterized by local wheals and erythema in the superficial dermis whereas angioedema is a deeper swelling due to edematous areas in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Generally, pruritus is the first symptom, which is followed sholy by the appearance of wheals that may remain small (1-5 mm) or enlarge. The larger ones tend to be clear in the centre and may be noticed, first as large rings (> 20 cm across) of erythema and edema. Also know If acute angioedema is recurrent progressive, painful rather than pruritic and not associated with uicaria a hereditary enzyme deficiency should be considerd. Hereditary angioneurotic edema occurs due to loss of C1 inhibitor (regulatory protein) CIF of hereditary angioneuroedema - Episodes of laryngeal edema - Prominence of recurrent gastrointestinal attacks - lack of pruritus and of uicarial lesions Laboratory diagnosis of hereditary angioneuroedema - It depends upon demonstrating the deficiency of C1 inhibitor",D

Removal of the malignant lesion is the secondary goal but a single operation to accomplish both objectives is preferred whenever possible.There are a variety of operation available and the operative strategy depends on many factors - the patients physical condition & age, location and extent of tumor and the experience of the surgical team.Obstructing lesion of the right colonIf the patient's condition is stable and the remaining bowel appears healthy - resection and ileocolic anastomosis in a single stage is the preferred op.If the patient's condition is unstable or bowel perforation has occurred - lesion is resected but no anastomosis done, an ileostomy is done and anastomosis is performed at a second operation.Nonresectable lesions- are bypassed by diversion procedures (colostomy or cecosigmoidostomy)Obstructing lesion of left colonTraditionally and most commonly performed procedure is - resection of lesion and proximal diversion done with proximal end colostomy or ileostomy (also known as Hartman's procedure)However, there is an increasing trend towards doing & primary anastomosis in a single stage operation. Primary anastomosis done in emergency setting in an unprepared bowel is associated with increased infection and anastomotic failure; but recent techniques of on-table lavage and more liberal application of extended resection coupled with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive perioperative care has improved the outcome for primary anastomosis.So in a stable patient with no diffuse peritonitis, no severe bowel injury and a resectable tumor- a resection and primary anastomosis should be preferred.If the patient is unstable, or the bowel is compromised - resection and proximal diversion is done.Another option available for left sided obstructing lesion is- subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis in one stage. It can be done if the proximal colon looks unhealthy (vascular compromise, serosal tears, perforation).Another option available is a colonic stent placement. This allows for decompression of the obstruction and converts the emergency situation into an elective setting. Stents may also be considered for palliation in patients whose life expectancy is less than 6 months, which is the expected patency of the colonic stent.If lesion is unresectable- a diversion procedure is done with a colostomy (external diversion) or a cecosigmoidostomy (internal diversion)",C

""--Bailey 26/e p111""In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents.

Sch is the muscle relaxant of choice for intubation. Sallieck's maneuver is done to prevent aspiration. Manual ventilation before intubation is avoided as this inflates the stomach and encourages regurgitation & aspiration. Rapid sequence anaesthesia When anaesthesia is given for emergency surgery, it is called a ""rapid sequence anaesthesia"". The patients have full stomach because there is no starvation for anaesthesia (it is an emergency surgery) and gastric emptying is delayed due to trauma, acute abdomen. Therefore, the objective of rapid sequence anaesthesia is to secure the airway rapidly and prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Procedure of rapid sequence has following steps : - Li The patient is preoxygenatedfor full 3 minutes. Intravenous induction agent (thiopentone or propofol) is given. Sellick's maneuver (cricoid/pressure) is done to prevent aspiration. After ensuring the correct position of tube cricoid pressure is released and maintenance anaesthesia (NCO 66%, 02% 33%, & inhalational agent) is given. A non-depolarizing blocker is now added.

"Fall from 15 feet, perineal hematoma and suprapubic mass. Injury to",Urinary bladder,Anus,Urethra,Rectus abdominis,"Rupture of the membranous urethra Rupture of the membranous urethra typically occurs in association with a fractured pelvis and may be associated with an extraperitoneal rupture of the bladder. When the pelvis fractures, the membranous urethra is ruptured as it passes through the bony ring of the pelvis. The urethra is elastic at this point, and if the fracture results in only a minor displacement, then the tear may only be paial, but more typically the rupture is complete, such that the two ends are completely displaced,with the development of a significant interposing haematoma. About 1-2% of cases of fractured pelvis have an associated urethral injury and such injuries are almost universally seen in men. CLINICAL FEATURES The most common causes of pelvic fracture are road traffic accidents, severe crush injuries and falls. Typically there are multiple associated injuries that may be immediately life threatening and the overriding priority is to keep the patient alive by appropriate resuscitation. Under these circumstances the management of the other injuries takes precedence. The clinical features include urinary retention, blood at the urethral meatus and a high riding prostate on digital rectal examination. There is typically marked bruising of the pubic area, scrotum and penis. If the diagnosis is suspected, a urethrogram performed with water-soluble contrast media is confirmatory. A suprapubic catheter should be inseed as soon as practicable using the Seldinger technique. The distended bladder may be palpable, making suprapubic catheterisation straightforward, but often the bruising and swelling associated with the fracture makes this difficult and ultrasound guidance is required. When suprapubic urinary diversion has been achieved then no fuher urological management is required until the patient has stabilised. In the presence of a coexisting extraperitoneal bladder injury, no bladder will be apparent on ultrasound examination, and surgical exploration, bladder repair, suprapubic catheter placement and drainage of the retropubic space is needed. In a patient with a pelvic fracture who does not have blood at the urethral meatus but who has not yet passed urine (such that there is unceainty as to whether there is a urethral injury), a single, gentle attempt at catheterization, by an experienced doctor, is permissible. In adults a 16F soft, silicone catheter should be used. If the catheter will not pass or passes and drains only blood, the balloon should not be inflated, but the catheter should be withdrawn and a retro grade urethrogram should be performed. Complications Urethral disruption injury Urinary incontinence Erectile dysfunction. Extravasation of urine Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1481",C

• MC primary site for GIST: Stomach (60–70%) > small bowel (20–25%) > colorectum and esophagus (5% each).
• Most GISTs are positive for CD-117 (95%), BCL-2 (80%), CD-34 (70%)
• Types: Spindle cell (70%) and Epitheloid (30%)
Pathology:
• Arise from the muscularis propria and most likely originate from the cells of Cajal
• Expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT (CD 117), 5% express platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA).
• PDGFRA mutations in GIST appear to confer a very favorable prognosis with low risk of recurrence.
• Spindle cell pattern (70%) of GIST is more common than epitheloid or round cell pattern (30%).
• New tumor markers of GIST: DOG-1 (discovered on GIST-1) and protein kinase C-theta
Clinical features:
• Patients usually present after the fourth decade, with the mean age of 60 years at diagnosis.
• MC presentations of gastric GISTs: GI bleeding and pain or dyspepsia.
Carney triad
• Association of extra-adrenal paragangliomas, pulmonary chondromas and multifocal GIST
Diagnosis:
• CT: IOC for evaluation of primary tumor and accurate staging
• PET-CT: Gold standard for recurrent GIST
• Percutaneous or endoscopic biopsy should only be performed if the results would obviate the need for surgeryQ.
Treatment:
• Bleeding manifestation is the MC indication for surgery.
• GIST should be treated with segmental resectionQ (margins of 1cm)
• LN metastasis are uncommon, regional lymphadenectomy is not recommended
• Intraoperative incisional biopsy prior to resection should be avoided, because it risks tumor spillage
• Imatinib (selective inhibitor of type 3 tyrosine kinase KIT), is approved for use in CD117-positive unresectable and metastatic GISTs.
• Functional imaging of GIST with 18FDG-PET scanning represents a useful diagnostic modality for early-response assessment with imatinib therapy.
• Sunitinib is used in imatinib-refractory disease.
Prognosis:
• Tumor size is a predominant factor for survival in surgical series for primary GIST.
• MC sites of disease failure after complete resection: Liver, omentum or peritoneal cavity.
• Half to two third primaries will have disease failure within the liver and nearly 40% will have liver as the only site of failure. Generally hepatic involvement is multifocal.

It is also an alternative to supraclavicular block for anaesthetizing the upper arm. The veical infraclavicular is better than the lateral approaches in this respect and has similar rates of pneumothorax but less frequent phrenic nerve paresis. The lateral approach performed with ultrasound control has a minimal risk of phrenic nerve paresis or pneumothorax and so may be a better choice in those with respiratory compromise, but provides less reliable upper arm anaesthesia. Complications are rare and less frequent than supraclavicular approaches and vary depending on the specific infraclavicular technique used. Although the axillary block provides safe and straightforward regional anaesthesia of the arm, the infraclavicular approach does offer an alternative in some specific situations and can be considered a ble routine alternative in experienced hands.

All are true about staing of b-Blocker therapy in a case of CHF except aEUR',They should be staed with optimal doses,They should be gradually increased over weeks,Special precautions should be taken in cases of NYHA class III and IV,Carvedilol and Metoprolol are the preferred drugs,"They should be staed with optimal dose Beta blocker therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of patients with depressed ejection fraction. - Although the negative inotropic effect of beta blocker resulted in their contraindication in left ventricular dysfunction until very recently, there is now evidence that, not only are they tolerated, but they greatly improves prognosis. How does blockade of fi receptors help in hea failure?? Left ventricular dysfunction results in neurohormonal activation (renin angiotensin aldosterone system, sympathetic system, cytokine release) which, although beneficial in acute cases is reponsible for gradual deterioration in myocardial function. For instance , in response to decrease in cardiac output, an increase in circulating norepinephrine (NE) can be seen which acts on the sympathetic myocardial receptors paicularly beta-1 thus increasing tnyocardial contractility. In addition, by stimulating peripheral alpha receptor, NE induces peripheral vasoconstriction, which helps to maintain blood pressure - This effect is counter balanced by peripheral *to-2 stimulation and consequent vasodilation. Prolonged exposure of hea to alpha and beta receptor stimulation unfounately, promotes left ventricular modelling, cell death due to necrosis or apoptosis and water/ salt retention. 8 blockers interfere with the harmful effect of sustained activation of the adrenergic nervous system by competitively antagonizing one or more adrenergic receptors. When given along with ACE inhibitors beta blockers reverse the process of RV remodelling, improve patient symptoms, prevents hospitalisation and prolongs life. Therefore II blockers are indicated for patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic HF and depressed Ejection Fraction < 40%. There are three beta blockers that have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of death in patients with chronic HE : - Bisoprolol - Metoprolol - Carvedilol Current recommendation are to consider the addition of fl blockers in the case of patients presenting with functional class II or Ill congestive hea failure if caused by systolic function. Dose of 13eta blockers First of all, treatment should be staed at extremely low doses:? - This dosage should be maintained for at least two to .four weeks and is increased only if the patient has tolerated it well. - if the patient does not tolerate the increased dosage the medication should not be considered a failure and treatment should be maintained at the tolerated dose. - The dose of beta blocker should he increased, until, the dose, used are similar to those that have been repoed to be effective in clinical trials. Administering ,8 blockers may lead to worsening fluid retention consequent to the withdrawl of adrenergic suppo to the hea and the circulation. - Thus it is impoant to optimize the dose of diuretic before staing therapy with beta blockers. - The increased, fluid retention can usually be managed by increasing the dose of diuretics. Beta blockers in NYHA class IV :? Since most of the clinical trials of Beta blocking agents have been conducted in patients with hea failure NYHA .functional class 11/ HI, until recently, there was limited information regarding safety and efficacy of Beta blockers in patients with hea failure NYHA functional class IV. Carvedilol prospective Randomized cumulative survival (COPER- NICUS) - The COPERNICUS TRIAL was designed as multicentric multinational trial in patients with severe hea failure randomized to Carvedilol vs Placebo. -The result of COPERNICUS demonstrates that even in patients with advanced hea .failure, Carvedilol exes a beneficial effect.",A

It contains visceral afferent and efferent fibers divided from T5 to T12. by means of greater, lesser and least splanchnic nerves. Celiac plexus innervates most of the abdominal viscera, therefore this procedure blocks the nerves which come from the pancreas, liver, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, spleen, kidney and adrenal glands.o A celiac plexus block can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdominal surgery.o Because celiac plexus block results in blockade of the autonomic nervous system, this block may help to reduce stress and endocrine responses to surgery. For the same reason, the most common complication of celiac plexns block is postural hypotenstion because of blockade of lumbar sympathetic chain leading to upper abdominal vessel dilation and venous pooling.o Celiac plexus block can be done by following three approaches : - Retrocrural (classic) approach, anterocrural approach and splanchnic nerve block.o Celiac plexus block is given to treat intractable pain in chronic pancreatitis, gastric & pancreatic malignancies. It can be combined with an intercostal block to provide anesthesia for intra-abdomiual surgery.o Postural hypotension is the Most common complication of classic retrocrural and splanchnic nerve block. Where as most common complication of Anterocrural approach is transient diarrhoea.",A

"A 12-year-old girl fractures her right radius and ulna in a motor accident. Her arm is placed in a cast extending over the elbow, which nearly eliminates movement of her forearm muscles. Which of the following will occur in her forearm muscles after several weeks in the cast?",Decreased capillarity,Decreased intracellular pO2,Decreased myoglobin oxygen saturation,Increased metabolic rate,"The primary function of blood vessels in skeletal muscles is to supply nutrients and remove metabolic waste products from the muscle tissues. Prolonged increases in metabolic rate lead to growth of the vasculature; decreases in metabolic rate lead to vascular rarefaction, i.e., loss of capillaries as well as other types of blood vessels. In other words, blood vessels grow where they are needed and regress when they are not needed. When a limb is immobilized in a cast, the muscles are inactive and their metabolic rate decreases. This decrease in metabolic rate leads to a decrease in capillarity in the skeletal muscles by mechanisms that are poorly understood. When the metabolic rate of immobilized skeletal muscle decreases, the oxygen consumption of the muscle decreases, which is likely to cause an initial increase in both myoglobin oxygen saturation and intracellular pO2.",A

Injection of a sclerosant , may reduce the size of the cyst; however, they are commonly multicystic and if the injection is extracystic subsequent surgery may be more difficult.CYSTIC HYGROMA# In this developmental abnormality of the lymphatic system, lymphatic fluid collects in a cystic space which is often multilocular and situated in the base of the neck (post triangle).# Association with Turner's syndrome is known.# Cystic hygroma usually presents in the neonate or in early infancy, and occasionally may present at birth and be so large as to obstruct labour. The cysts are filled with clear lymph and lined by a single layer of epithelium with a mosaic appearance. Swelling usually occurs in the neck and may involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue and floor of mouth areas. The swelling may be bilateral and is soft and partially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent.# The cheek, axilla, groin and mediastinum are other less frequent sites for a cystic hygroma.# The behaviour of cystic hygromas during infancy is unpredictable. Sometimes the cyst expands rapidly and occasionally respiratory difficulty ensues, requiring immediate aspiration and even occasionally a tracheostomy.

Which sensitizes the myocardium to catecholamines,Isflurane,Ether,Halothane,Propofol,"Halothane-catecholamine sensitization also promotes abnormal automaticity of dominant and latent atrial pacemakers. These effects may produce premature ventricular contractions and arrhythmias originating from the His bundle. Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

Hangman's fracture is ?,Subluxation of C5 over C6,Fracture dislocation of C2,Fracture dislocation of ankle joint,Fracture of odontoid,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fracture dislocation of C2 Hangman's fracture Hangman's fracture is bilateral fracture of the pars interaicularis of axis (C2) with traumatic spondylolisthesis of axis (C2) over C3 veebrae. Thus Hangman's fracture is not simply a fracture, but fracture dislocation of axis (C2). The mechanism of injury is extension with distraction (in true, judicial hangman's fracture) and hyper-extension, axial compression &. flexion (in civilian injuries, which are now more common). It is second most common type of Axis (C2) fracture, second only to odontoid fractures. Fatalaties are common, However, neurological deficit is unusual as the fracture of posterior arch decompress the spinal cord. Most of the fatalities occur at the scene of injury, acute post admission moality is low. Successful healing of C2 traumatic spondylolishesis is repoed to approach 95%. This is most commonly achieved with non-operative measures, even in the presence of displacement of pars inter-aicularis. Undisplaced fractures are treated in a semi-rigid ohosis, and displaced fracture are closed reduced & treated with halo-vest. Occasionally, the hangman's fracture is associated with a C2/3 facet dislocation. This is a severely unstable injury; open reduction and stabilization is required.",B

"Condition which builds within hemithorax resulting in collapsed lung, flattened diaphragm, contralateral mediastinal shift and compromised venous return to right side of hea is known as: September 2007",Open pneumothorax,Flail chest,Massive pulmonary hemorrhage,Tension pneumothorax,"Ans. D: Tension pneumothorax Tension pneumothorax is the accumulation of air under pressure in the pleural space. This condition develops when injured tissue forms a 1-way valve, allowing air to enter the pleural space and preventing the air from escaping naturally. Arising from numerous causes, this condition rapidly progresses to respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular collapse, and, ultimately, death if unrecognized and untreated. Favorable patient outcomes require urgent diagnosis and immediate management.",D

Most common site of subclan aery obstruction in subclan steal syndrome is:,1st pa,2nd pa,3rd pa,4th pa,"The 1st pa of the subclan aery extends from the origin of the subclan aery to the medial border of the scalenus anterior muscle. This pa gives off the veebral aery, the thyrocervical trunk, and the internal thoracic aery. The subclan steal syndrome is characterized by reversal of flow through the veebral aery due to a more proximal (1st pa) occlusion or stenosis of the subclan aery (ie, the veebral aery serves as a collateral to supply blood to the arm). Symptoms of effo fatigue in the involved extremity are more common than neurologic complaints. Treatment consists of bypass grafting from the common carotid to the subclan aery distal to the lesion or transposition of the subclan aery beyond the lesion to the side of the nearby common carotid aery.

Most common congenital anomaly of the face is:March 2009,Cleft lip alone,Isolated cleft palate,Cleft lip and cleft palate,All have equal incidence,"Ans. C: Cleft lip and cleft palateThe typical distribution of cleft types is:Cleft lip alone-15%Isolated cleft palate-40%Cleft lip and cleft palate-45%Cleft lip alone (hare lip): It is due failure of fusion between the frontonasal (philtrum) and the maxillary processes.Types :- Unilateral 85% usually on the left side 75%, bilateral 15%.- Upper or lower: lower cleft lip is very rare and is due to failure of fusion between the mandibular processes. Complete or incomplete: according to whether it extends to the nostrils or not.- Simple or alveolar: if it involves the bony alveolus.- Complicated or not: If it is associated with cleft palate.Complications:- Disfigurement.- Difficult suckling if it is complicated.Treatment:- Timing of surgery for cleft lip alone:Unilateral-one operation at 5-6 monthsBilateral-One operation at 4-5 months.- (Millard's operation- When the patient is 10 weeks old, Hb = 10 gm% and the weight is 10 pounds (rule of ten)). II. Isolated cleft palate:The palate is developed from- Premaxilla from the frontonasal process.- Two maxillary shelves: from the maxillary processCleft palate occurs due to failure (total or paial) of fusion between the maxillary and frontonasal process or the 2 maxillary processes.Types :- Soft palate only, usually asymptomatic.- Intermaxillary : the cleft is only between the 2 maxillary shelves.- Bipaate : as intermaxillary but extends to one side of the premaxilla. Tripaate : as intermaxillary but extends to both sides of the premaxilla.Complications:- Impaired feeding due to:Difficult suckling.Wide pharynx : so the soft palate can't close the nasopharynx during swallowing leading to nasal regurgitation of food, leading to pharyngitis, rhinitis, otitis media and deafness.Difficult speech : specially consonant e.g. D, P, T, B, K, J.- Teeth malformation.Pierre Ribon syndrom : Cleft palate with receding lower jaw (micrognathia) and posterior displacement of the tongue which obstruct air way.- Malformed nose.Treatment :In cases of cleft palate alone, surgical correction is indicatedSoft palate only-One operation at 6 monthsSoft and hard palate-Two operations.

What is the explanation",Pseudocholinesterase deficiency increasing action of syccinylcholine,Phase 2 blockade produced by succinylcholine,Undiagnosed muscular dystrophy and muscular weakness,Muscular weakness due to fasciculation produced by succinylcholine,"Xenon [Ref: Morgan's Anaesthesia 4/e p 781, 166, 167; Miller's Anaesthesia p 626, 6491 Xenon seems to be the best answer because all other inhalational anaesthetics mentioned in the question produce some cardiovascular effects that may harm the patient with mitral stenosis. Mitral stenosis is a disorder where cardiac output remains relatively fixed. Decrease in cardiac output should he avoided at any cost. - Any drug that increases the hea rate will reduce the cardiac output in patient with M.S. All the inhalational agents mentioned in the question decrease systemic vascular resistance and also increase the hea rate. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance leads to fall in blood pressure. Moreover, they may also decrease B.P. by their cardiodepressant action on myocardium. Therefore these drugs should not be used in patients with M.S. ""Xenon has no effects on cardiac output or cardiac rhythum and is not thought to have significant effect on systemic vascular resistance It also does not affect pulmonary function and is not known to have any renal or hepatic toxicity"". The main drawback of Xenon is its high cost and insufficient availability. -Xenon is an ine gas which is quite difficult to obtain and hence extremely expensive. - Xenon has received considerable interest in the last few years because it has many characteristics approaching those of an ""ideal"" inhaled anaesthetics. Mitral stenosis Due to mitral stenosis less blood .flows through the mitral valve to left ventricle. Left ventricle functions normally but is small and poorly.filled. Initially the left ventricle dilates keeping the pulmonary aery pressure low. As disease progresses pulmonary aery pressure increases and medial hyperophy develops resulting in chronic reactive pulmonary hypeension. The right hea hyperophies to pump against a pressure overload, then.fails. The pressure gradient across the narrow mitral orifice increase with the square of cardial output. Rapid hea rates, especially with atrial fibrillation decreases diastolic .filling time and markedly decreases cardiac output. Li / .filling is optimized by slow hea rate. Hemodynamic goals Low normal hea rate 50-70/min, treat tachycardia aggressively with /8 blockers. Maintain sinus rhythmus if possible. Maintain adequate preload Maintain high normal systemic vascular resistance Avoid hypercarbia, acidosis and hypoxia which may exacerbate pulmonary hypeension. The cardiac output is relatively fixed, maintain adequate afterload, slow the hea rate and avoid hypovolemia. Measure CVP and PAOP and maintain high preload. Avoid rapid decrease in afterload.",C

Most common presentation of Wilm's tumour?,Fever,Hematuria,Abdominal mass,UTI,"Ans. C. Abdominal mass. (Ref. Robin's Pathology 8th/pg. 271; Love and Bailey 26th/pg.l24; 1304).Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour)# Usually presents in the first five years of life# Typically presents with an abdominal mass# May cause haematuria, abdominal pain or fever# It extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs.# Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery.Wilms' tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from 1 to 4 years. A mutation in the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene (WT1) is responsible for some cases. It usually presents as an abdominal mass. The tumour extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs. Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery. Survival depends on tumour spread, completeness of surgical excision and histology but exceeds 70% even among patients with advanced tumours.Wilms' Tumor (nephroblastoma)# Most common primary tumor of the kidney in children.# malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from one to four years. Following are associated with an increased risk of developing Wilms' tumor:- WAGR syndrome: aniridia, genital abnormalities, and mental retardation, have a 33% chance of developing Wilms' tumor.- Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS):extremely high risk (?90%) of developing Wilms' tumor. Characterized by gonadal dysgenesis and renal abnormalities.- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS): enlargement of individual body organs (e.g., tongue, kidneys, or liver) or entire body segments (hemihypertrophy); enlargement of adrenal cortical cells (adrenal cytomegaly) is a characteristic microscopic feature. BWS is an example of a disorder of genomic imprinting. The genetic locus that is involved in these patients is in band pi5.5 of chromosome 11 distal to the WT1 locus.- Microscopically, Wilms' tumors are characterized by recognizable attempts to recapitulate different stages of nephrogenesis. The classic triphasic combination of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial cell types is observed in most lesions. Sheets of small blue cells, with few distinctive features, characterize the blastemal component.- Nephrogenic rests are putative precursor lesions of Wilms' tumors.- The prognosis for Wilms' tumor is generally very good, and excellent results are obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy.- Anaplasia is a harbinger of adverse prognosis, but careful analyses by the National Wilms' T\imor Study group in the United States have shown that as long as the anaplasia is focal and confined within the resected nephrectomy specimen, the outcome is no different from tumors without evidence of anaplasia. In contrast, Wilms' tumor with diffuse anaplasia the prognosis is poor.Additional Educational points:Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of neuroblasts in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia and typically presents as an abdominal or paravertebral mass. It metastasises to lymph nodes, bones and liver and causes elevated urinary catechola- mines. Small-localised tumours are excised. More advanced tumours are treated by chemotherapy and surgery. Survival is related to tumour biology and stage (>90% for small localised tumours, < 50% for advanced tumours).Neuroblastoma is the most common abdominal tumor of infancy. It is much less common than the relatively common hydronephrosis. The most common abdominal mass in a newborn infant is hydronephrosis. It is a common finding in prenatal ultrasounds. It will usually resolve without therapy. Hepatomas and Wilms tumors are even rarer than neuroblastoma.",C

Cleft lip surgery should ideally be done at:,2 - 3 months,5 - 6 months,10-12 months,12-24 months,"Ans. B. 5 - 6 months. (Ref. LB 25th/pg. 660)""Cleft lip repair is commonly performed between 3 and 6 months of age whereas cleft palate repair is frequently performed between 6 and 18 months"".Cleft lip:Embryology & pathogenesis:# Unilateral cleft lip results from failure of the maxillary prominence on the affected side to fuse with medial nasal prominences. The result is called a persistant labial groove.# A unilateral cleft lip, commonly on the left side, is more common than a bilateral cleft lip.# Single gene defects that are associated with cleft lip include: Van der Woude syndrome, Opitz Syndrome, Aarskog syndrome, Fryns syndrome, Waardenburg, and Coffin-Siris syndrome.# Medications that can cause it if taken antenatally include alcohol, steroids, antiseizure drugs, vitamin A, and oral anti- acne medications (such as Acutane) taken during the first trimester.# Risk of cleft lip increases with paternal age, especially over 30 yrs at the time of conception.# When the affected child has unilateral cleft lip and palate, the risk for subsequent children increases to 4.2%.# A complete cleft involves the entire lip, and typically the alveolar arch. An incomplete cleft involves only part of the lip.Incidence:# Cleft occurs in somewhere between one in 600 and one in 800 births.# Cleft lip occurs more commonly in males, while cleft palate is more likely to occur in females.Surgical procedure: Patients are: (Rule of 10)# Operated at 10 weeks of age,# With 10 pounds weight, and at# Hb of 10gm%.- ""Cleft lip repair is commonly performed between 3 and 6 months of age whereas cleft palate repair is frequently performed between 6 and 18 months"".- Operations done for cleft lip are Millard procedure and Mirault-Blair operation.# The Millard procedure begins with an incision on the edge of the cleft side of the philtrum, and the cutting continues upward, medially, and to the side. A second incision extends to the buccal sulcus. The length of this incision depends on the size of the gap to be closed. In this second incision, the surgeon frees soft tissue, which allows him or her to completely lift the lip from the underlying bone. Advantages of the Millard rotation advancement technique include: It is the most common procedure (i.e., surgeons more familiar with it). The technique is adaptable and flexible. It permits construction of a normal-looking Cupid's bow. A minimal amount of tissue is discarded. The suture line is camouflaged. The disadvantage of the Millard rotation advancement technique is the possible development of a vermilion notch (shortening of the entire lip in the vertical direction), resulting from contracture of the vertical scar.Cleft palate occurs due to failure of fusion of medial nasal process to the two palatine processes of maxillary process.Operations for it include Langenbeck's operation.

The most suitable agent for IV induction and maintenance in a day care surgery,Etomidate,Ketamine,Propofol,Thiopentone,"PROPOFOL The active ingredient in propofol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, is essentially insoluble in aqueous solutions and is formulated only for IV administration as a 1% (10 mg/ml) emulsion in 10% soybean oil, 2.25% glycerol, and 1.2% purified egg phosphatide. In the United States, disodium EDTA (0.05 mg/ml) or sodium metabisulfite (0.25 mg/ml) is added to inhibit bacterial growth. The induction dose of propofol in a healthy adult is 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg and it has an onset and duration of anesthesia similar to thiopental. As with barbiturates, dosages should be reduced in the elderly and in the presence of other sedatives and increased in young children. Because of its reasonably sho elimination half-life, propofol often is used for maintenance of anesthesia as well as for induction. For sho procedures, small boluses (10% to 50% of the induction dose) every 5 minutes or as needed are effective. An infusion of propofol produces a more stable drug level (100 to 300 mg/kg per minute) and is better suited for longer-term anesthetic maintenance. Infusion rates should be tailored to patient response and the levels of other hypnotics. Sedating doses of propofol are 20% to 50% of those required for general anesthesia. However, even at these lower doses, caregivers should be vigilant and prepared for all of the side effects of propofol discussed below, paicularly airway obstruction and apnea. Propofol elicits pain on injection that can be reduced with lidocaine and the use of larger arm and antecubital veins. Excitatory phenomena during induction with propofol occur at about the same frequency as with thiopental, but much less frequently than with methohexital. Side Effects: Nervous System: The CNS effects of propofol are similar to those of barbiturates. Propofol decreases CMRO2, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial and intraocular pressures by about the same amount as thiopental. Like thiopental, propofol has been used in patients at risk for cerebral ischemia; however, no human outcome studies have been performed to determine its efficacy as a neuroprotectant. Results from studies on the anticonvulsant effects of propofol have been mixed; some data even suggest it has proconvulsant activity when combined with other drugs. Thus, unlike thiopental, propofol is not a proven acute intervention for seizures. Cardiovascular. Propofol produces a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure that is significantly greater than that produced by thiopental. The fall in blood pressure can be explained by both vasodilation and mild depression of myocardial contractility. Propofol appears to blunt the baroreceptor reflex or is directly vagotonic because smaller increases in hea rate are seen for any given drop in blood pressure after doses of propofol. As with thiopental, propofol should be used with caution in patients at risk for or intolerant of decreases in blood pressure. Respiratory and Other Side Effects: At equipotent doses, propofol produces a slightly greater degree of respiratory depression than thiopental. Patients given propofol should be monitored to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Propofol appears to be less likely than barbiturates to provoke bronchospasm. It has no clinically significant effects on hepatic, renal, or endocrine organ systems. Unlike thiopental, propofol appears to have significant anti-emetic action and is a good choice for sedation or anesthesia of patients at high risk for nausea and vomiting. Propofol provokes anaphylactoid reactions and histamine release at about the same low frequency as thiopental. Although propofol does cross placental membranes, it is considered safe for use in pregnant women, and like thiopental, only transiently depresses activity in the newborn.",C

In select circumstances, control of the vena cava may be desired. Either the individual poal structures can be identified and ligated early in the course of the procedure, or simply the entire poal triad can be circled with an umbilical tape tourniquet in preparation for the Pringle maneuver. If temporary poal inflow occlusion is used, intermittent 10 to 20 minute intervals of clamping with 3 to 5 minutes to reestablish blood flow is recommended. The division of the hepatic parenchyma begins with scoring of Glisson's capsule with cautery or knife and proceeds with division of the hepatic surface using either blunt dissection by finger fracture, the blunt edge of an instrument or suction tip, or using an ultrasonic dissector. Individual vessels and bile ducts are cauterized, sutured, or clipped in rapid succession from anterior to posterior. The hepatic veins are encountered in the hepatic substance near the vena cava and are carefully clamped and suture ligated to complete the resection.

Fastest acting agent,Sevoflurane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,None.,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood. The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

True About ketamine,Bronchodilator,Depressed airway reflexes,Causes hypotension,Decreases ICT,"Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

All are indications for penile angiography except,Painful priapism,Peyronie's disease,Erectile dysfunction,Aerio-venous malformation,"Priapism Priapism means a persistent erection lasting longer than 4 hours and it is a surgical emergency. There are two main types of priapism. ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM Ischaemic or venogenic priapism is the commoner and is due to venous congestion, with consequent thrombosis and ischaemia. The penis remains erect and becomes painful. This is a pathological erection and the glans penis and corpus spongiosum are not involved. The condition is most commonly seen as a side effect of medication, most notably antipsychotic medication and intracavernosal injections, but it can also arise as complication of a hypercoagulable blood disorders such as sickle cell disease or leukaemia. A tiny propoion of cases are caused by malignant disease in the corpora cavernosa or the pelvis. The clinical features are of a painful erection not involving the glans penis. Blood taken from the penis shows hypoxia, hyercapnoea and acidosis, while Doppler scanning shows an absence of blood flow within the penis. An underlying cause should be excluded and the patient should be referred for specialist urological care. Treatment is an emergency, since delay beyond 6 hours results in progressive, irreversible damage to the corpus cavernosal tissue with subsequent fibrosis and ED. Aspiration of the sludged blood in the corpora cavernosa is the first-line therapy but if this fails, then intracavernosal injection of phenylephrine (an alpha adrenoceptor agonist) is the next line of therapy. If that proves ineffective, it may be necessary to decompress the penis by creating a shunt between the corpus cavernosum and either the glans penis or the corpus spongiosum. Treatment initiated after 24-36 hours rarely restores normal erectile function. NON-ISCHAEMIC PRIAPISM This rarer form of priapism arises as a consequence of traumatic damage to the central penile aery, usually as a consequence of blunt perineal trauma. A fistula develops between the aery and the sinusoidal space, which results in a persistent erection that is painless, in contrast to the ischaemic priapism. Blood gas analysis shows the characteristics of aerial blood and Doppler scanning and selective aeriography will demonstrate the fistula. Treatment is not an emergency, since there is no ischaemia, and is most appropriate achieved by selective aerial embolisation. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1491",A

About 50% of hemangiomas of bone occur in veebrae and are most commonly situated in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Other common site of involvement (20%) is skull. Small bones of hands and feets may also be affected. Haemangioma of the veebra has a typical radiographic picture in the form of loss of horizontal striations and prominence of veebral striations. There is Polka dot appearance on CT. In the skull, hemangioma generally affects the calverium and is seen as an expansile lytic lesion which has a sunburst appearance with striation radiating from the centre. A hemangioma may be identified due to associated phlebolith and it may cause local gigantism of the invovled area.

Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis associated with,Hypokalemic acidosis,Hypokalemic alkalosis,Hyperkalemic acidosis,Hyperkalemic alkalosis,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Hypokalemic alkalosis Repeat from Nov 09Repetitive vomiting leads to hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. The urine is alkaline initially but eventually it becomes acidic (paradoxical aciduria)Cause of paradoxical aciduriaInitially the kidney compensate for metabolic alkalosis by reabsorbing hydrogen and chloride ions in exchange for sodium, potassium and bicarbonate. But gradually as the body stores of sodium and especially potassium become depleted, kidney starts retaining these ions in exchange of hydrogen ions, thus the urine becomes acidic and metabolic alkaline state is further aggravated.Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (HPS)The musculature of the pylorus and adjacent antrum is grossly hypertrophied, the hypertrophy being maximum in the pylorus itself.It occurs in approximately 3 in 1000 live birth and is the most common surgical cause of vomitting in infancy.M > F (4 : 1)*Characteristically the first born male child is affected.The condition is most commonly seen at 4 wks. after birth ranging from the 3rd wk. to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from birth, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after birth.Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fourth week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t.These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions.""The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on physical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the right upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen.When the olive cannot be palpated, ultrasound in experienced hands will diagnose the condition accurately in 95 percent of pts.

Both breasts are affected in which type of breast carcinoma: September 2009,Inflammatory,Infiltrative,Ductall,Lobular,"Ans. D: Lobular Carcinoma of the breast is a histologically heterogeneous disease. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 8-14% of all breast cancers. The morphologic features of lobular carcinoma differ from those of ductal carcinoma. ILC is characterized by small, round cells that are bland in appearance and have scant cytoplasm, which infiltrate the stroma in single file and surround benign breast tissues in a targeted manner. Infiltration typically does not destroy anatomic structures or incite a substantial connective tissue response. By viue of their distinctive growth pattern and biology, lobular carcinomas often fail to form distinct masses that can easily be diagnosed by palpation or mammography. This can make early diagnosis challenging and breast conservation approaches more difficult. Lobular carcinomas may have a substantially increased propensity for multifocal and multicentric distribution and for bilaterality.",D

Examples of Newtonian fluid are: water, oils, gases, mercury, alcohol etc. A Non-Newtonian fluid is one that does not follow the Newtonian (friction) law. Its viscosity changes with agitation or varying shear rate. A Non-Newtonian fluid can be Thixotropic or Rheopectic. Thixotropic is one whose viscosity decreases with agitation or varying shear rate. (Thus thixotropic fluid are thick (viscous) under normal conditions, but become thin, less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed.) Eg. Synol fluid, ketchup. Rheopectic is one whose viscosity increases with agitation or varying shear rate. Eg. gypsum pastes, printers inks, and some lubricants. Synol fluid has thixotropic propeies. Its viscosity decreases with increase in the rate of movement, thus it is able to provide better lubrication to the joints.",A

Which of the following insufflation gases should not be used with radiofrequency (RF) electrosurgery ?,CO2,Nitrous oxide,Argon,Helium,"CO2 is the most commonly used gas for peritoneal insufflation, but alternative gases are available. Nitrous oxide has been used for procedures performed under local anesthesia because it does not cause the acid-base disturbances associated with CO2 pneumoperitoneum and may cause less postoperative pain. However, it suppos combustion, and its use is not recommended in procedures that require RF electrosurgery. Use of ine gases, such as helium and argon, also prevents acid-base problems; however, these agents are rarely used because they are expensive and have low solubility, which may increase the risk for gas embolism.",B

A three years old boy presents with poor urinary stream. Most likely cause is -,Stricture urethra,Neurogenic bladder,Urethral calculus,Posterior urethral valve,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Posterior urethral valve Poor urinary stream in 3 years old boy suggests urinary tract obstruction (usually infravesical) and the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in a male child is posterial urethral valve. Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by (a) voiding cystourethrogram* & (b) endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First a small polyethylene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days. Then fuher management is done according to serum creatinine level. (a) with normal serum creatinine --> transurethral ablation of the valve leaflets. * (b) With increased serum creatinine and the worsening of condition --> vesicostomy to bypass the obstruction and when normal creatinine levels are achieved, transurethral ablation is done.",D

Most common site of pseudoaneurysm in I.V. drug abusers is:,Carotid,Brachial,Femoral,Radial,"In the IDU, frequent direct trauma to peripheral vessels produces damage to the vessel wall and an initial sterile perivascular hematoma. Injection of chemical agents in illicit drugs also causes tissue necrosis. The vascular wall usually becomes infected by contiguous spread from adjacent subcutaneous abscesses or areas of cellulitis. The infection causes liquefaction of the central poion of the hematoma in communication with the aerial or, less commonly, the venous wall, forming a secondary (false) pseudoaneurysm. The common femoral aery is the most frequent location, followed by the deep femoral and superficial femoral aeries. Because most IDUs are right handed, left-sided groin infections and aneurysms are more common. Primary mycotic aneurysms in which the damaged vessel wall is infected secondary to unrelated bacteremia are rare and are more likely to involve cerebral vessels as a complication of endocarditis. Pathogenesis includes septic embolization from valvular vegetations to the vasa vasorum of smaller vessels, such as the middle or posterior cerebral and visceral infra-abdominal aeries, which are more frequently involved than the aoa.",C

The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. - In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. - In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) - it has shown to down-stage the tumor.",A

They are located near the hilum of the spleen in 50% of the cases and are related to the splenic vessels or behind the tail of pancreas in 30%. The reminder are located in the mesocolon or the spelnic ligaments. Their significance lies in the fact that failure to identify and remove these at the time of spelnectomy may give rise to persistent disease"".Additional Educational points:FUNCTIONS OF SPLEEN# Immune# Filter function# Pitting# Reservoir# Cytopoiesis# Splenectomy harms the patientCONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES OF SPLEEN# Splenic agenesis is rare but is present in 10% of children with congenital heart disease.# Polysplenia is rare condition resulting from failure of splenic fusion.The 2 primary subtypes of situs ambiguous include :1) right isomerism, or asplenia syndrome, and2) left isomerism, or polysplenia syndrome.In classic right isomerism, or asplenia, bilateral right-sidedness occurs. These patients have bilateral right atria, a centrally located liver, and an absent spleen, and both lungs have 3 lobes. The descending aorta and inferior vena cava are on the same side of the spine. In left isomerism, or polysplenia, bilateral left-sidedness occurs. These patients have bilateral left atria and multiple spleens, and both lungs have 2 lobes. Interruption of the inferior vena cava with azygous or hemiazygous continuation is often present.The features of situs ambiguous are inconsistent; therefore, situs ambiguous cases are challenging and require thorough evaluation of the viscera. The location and relationships of the following should be reviewed carefully: abdominal viscera, hepatic veins, SVC, IVC, coronary sinus, pulmonary veins, cardiac atria, atrioventricular connections and valves, cardiac ventricles, position of the cardiac apex, and aortic arch and great vessels.SPENIC CYSTNon-parasitic splenic cysts are rare. Splenic cysts are classified as primary cysts (true) or pseudocysts (secondary) on the basis of the presence or absence of lining epithelium. True cysts form embryonal rests and include dermoid and mesenchymal inclusion cysts. True cysts of the spleen are very rare and are frequently classified as cystic hemangiomas, cystic lymphangiomas and epidermoid and dermoid cysts. Epidermoid cysts are thought to be of congenital origin and represent 10 % of the splenic cysts. They are lined by flattened squamous epithelium and are more frequent in children and young patients.

Which of the following is not true about Xenon anaesthesia,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side effects,slow induction and slow recovery,Low blood gas solubility,"Xe has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

A middle-age woman has right leg and foot nonpitting edema associated with dermatitis and hyperpigmentation. The diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency is made. What is the treatment of choice?,Vein stripping,Pressure-gradient stockings,Skin grafting,Perforator vein ligation,"The mainstay of treatment of chronic venous insufficiency and its complication, venous stasis ulceration, is conservative management. Elastic stocking support, frequent elevation of the legs, and avoidance of prolonged sitting and standing is used for venous insufficiency in the absence of ulceration. If venous stasis ulcers develop, then paste boots (e.g., Unna's boots) are used along with appropriate bed rest and foot elevation until the ulcer heals. Patients whose ulcers fail to heal after such conservative management may need perforator vein ligation. Skin grafting should be considered for chronic stasis ulcers that are large, and perforator incompetence has been treated. Venous reconstruction procedures, including valvuloplasty, can be useful for a selected group of patients, especially those with venous claudication to less than half a block, that have been treated with all the procedures above, including stripping and ligation. Unlike previous opinions, superficial venous stripping and ligation is not always contraindicated in the presence of chronic venous insufficiency and even previous history of deep vein thrombosis.",B
Which of the following is a controlled delivery device which is used to deliver a fixed concentration of oxygen?,Venturi mask,Nasal cannula,Nasal mask,Non breathing mask,Venturi mask is a type of HAFOEmask (High Air Flow Oxygen Enrichment Devices). It is used to deliver a controlled oxygen concentration to a patient. The patient breathes a fixed concentration of oxygen enriched air because the gas flow is greater than the peak inspiratory flow rate of the patient. Thus there is minimal dilution from atmospheric air. The high gas flow flushes expired gas from the mask preventing rebreathing. Nasal cannula isused when a low-flow of oxygen is indicated. These do not increase dead space. Inspiratory oxygen concentration depends on the flow rate. No rebreathing occurs. Non-rebreathing mask has a one way valve prevents the exhaled air from entering the reservoir bag. It provides the patient with enriched oxygen during inhalations. Nasal masks are effective interfaces for non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in most pediatric patients. It allows better removal of CO2.,A

A person is not able to extend his metacarpophalangeal joint. This is due to injury to which nerve?,Ulnar nerve,Radial nerve injury,Median nerve injury,Post. Introsseus nerve injury,"Ans. is 'd > b' i.e., Post. Introsseus nerve injury > Radial nerve injury Extension of MP joint is caused by muscles supplied by posterior interosseus nerve. Posterior interosseus nerve is a branch of radial nerve, so radial nerve palsy also results in loss of ability to extend MP joint. However, for single answer, the best option is posterior interosseus nerve because the only finding in PIN palsy is inability to extend MP joint of thumb & fingers, and inability to do radial abduction of thumb. In radial nerve palsy other findings will also be there. Clinical features of radial nerve palsy Clinical features depend upon the site of lesion. 1. If lesion is high Wrist drop, thumb drop and finger drop.

This is thought to be due to the streaming effect of superior mesenteric venous inflow to the right lobe. In addition, the greater volume of the right lobe predisposes more tissue to seeding by bacterial organisms. While appendicitis comprised 25% to 40% of cases in early series, early recognition and operative therapy for appendicitis have reduced its impoance significantly. In current series, malignant or benign biliary obstruction is the underlying cause of 35% to 50% of cases.

To confirm the diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, blood should be tested for levels of which of the following?",Parathyroid hormone,Histamine,Pepsin,Gastrin,"Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by secretion of excessive amounts of gastrin by islet cells of the pancreas (gastrinoma). It should always be thought of in patients with peptic ulcer disease, whose ulcers are severe, refractory to management, recurrent or located distally, beyond the first part of the duodenum. Gastrin levels in the blood are increased markedly and can be raised further by secretin injection (paradoxical response). The source of gastrin level in the blood may arise from hyperplasia, adenoma, or most commonly carcinoma of the islets. Most gastrinomas are sporadic, but 25% of patients have a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia.",D
High airway resistance is seen in,Respiratory bronchiole,Intermediate bronchiole,Terminal bronchiole,Main bronchus,"Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

A 70-year-old woman with a history of veebral crush fracture presents to the osteoporosis outpatient clinic. Which of the following investigations is most useful to assess the extent of her osteoporosis?,Spinal x-rays,DEXA scan,"Full blood count, bone and liver biochemistry blood test",Vitamin D levels,"Osteoporosis is a loss of the bone mass. It is impoant to note that the mineralization of the bone is normal. This loss of bone mass means there is an increasing likelihood of fracture with increasing age. Due to the accelerated loss of bone mass following the menopause, elderly women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than men. There are numerous risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. Among them are Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups, female sex, increasing age, early menopause, smoking, excess alcohol, coicosteroid use, hypogonadism and rheumatoid ahritis. The reduced bone mass of osteoporosis may result in veebral crush fractures, the majority of which are asymptomatic. The extent of osteoporosis is best investigated with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. This gives a T score, which is the number of standard detions the patient's bone mineral density differs from the population average for a young healthy adult. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a T score of -2.5 or greater (i.e. the bone mineral density of more than 2.5 standard detion below that of the average for a young healthy adult). A T score of between -1.5 and -2.5 is defined as osteopenia. Spinal x-rays (A) are useful to assess veebral crush fractures but cannot assess extent of osteoporosis. Full blood count, bone and liver biochemistry tests (C) are not affected by osteoporosis, making this answer incorrect. Treatment options in osteoporosis include use of bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy and raloxifene (a selective oestrogen receptor modulator).",B

Biliopancreatic diversion e. Duodenal switch The surgical treatment of morbid obesity is known as bariatric surgery. Morbid obesity is defined as body mass index of 35 kg/m2 or more with obesity related comorbidity, or BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater without comorbidity. Bariatric operations produce weight loss as a result of 2 factors. One is restriction of oral intake. The other is malabsorbtion of ingested food. Gastric restrictive procedures include Veical banded gastroplasty & Adjustable gastric banding. Malabsorbtive procedures include Biliopancreatic diversion, and Duodenal switch. Roux-en Y gastric bypass has features of both restriction and malabsorption. Veical Banded Gastroplasty This procedure has now largely been abandoned in or of other operations because of high rate of stenosis of the gastric outlet and poor long term weight loss.Adjustable Gastric Banding A silicone band is put around the proximal stomach to restrict the amount of solid food that can be ingested at one time. The adjustable nature of the band allows the amount of restriction to be increased or decreased, depending upon the patient's weight loss.Gastric band placement, unlike malabsorptive weight loss surgery (e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RNY), Biliopancreatic Diversion (BPD) and Duodenal Switch (DS)), does not cut or remove any pa of the digestive system. It is also usually easy to remove the band and reverse the surgery, requiring only a laparoscopic procedure. after which the stomach usually returns to its normal pre-banded state.Roux-en Y Gastric Bypass A gastric bypass first divides the stomach into a small upper pouch and a much larger, lower ""remnant"" pouch. Next the jejunum is divided and the lower pa of the small intestine is then attached to the new stomach pouch thus bypassing most of the stomach and the upper pa of small intestine. RYGB is thus both a gastric restrictive procedure and a mildly malabsorbtive procedure. Biliopancreatic Diversion BPD produces weight loss based primarily on malabsorption but it does have a mild restrictive component. Pa of the stomach is resected (Distal hemigastrectomy), creating a smaller stomach. The distal pa of the small intestine is then connected to the pouch, bypassing the duodenum and jejunum. The intestinal tract is reconstructed is a fashion to allow only a sho so-called common channel of the distal 50 cm of terminal ileum for absoption of fat and protein. Duodenal Switch This is a modification of the Biliopancreatic Diversion procedure developed to lessen the high incidence of marginal ulcers after BPD. The mechanism of weight loss is similar to that of BPD. The major difference between DS and BPD is the gastrectomy and the proximal anatomy. Instead of a distal hemigastrectomy, a",D

The impoance of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of asthma is suggested by the common association between the disease and the presence of allergic diseases, skin-test sensitivity, and increased serum IgE levels. In addition, many susceptible persons develop bronchospasm after inhalation challenge with airborne allergens. A large propoion of asthmatic subjects, however, have none of these markers of immunologic activity and are classified as having idiosyncratic asthma. When tested for bronchial hyperirritability with various nonantigenic bronchoprovocational agents (e.g., histamine and cold air), asthmatic subjects are found to be more sensitive than normal, and the bronchoconstriction is generally reversible after exposure to a j3-adrenergic agonist; the reason for this airway hyperirritability, which is a common feature in all asthmatic persons, is unlmown.

Xerophthalmia is a term exclusively used for eve manifestations in Vitamin A deficiency. So, two options are wrong Most probably, they would have asked about Sjogren's syndrome, not primary Sjogren's syndrome. Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic disease characterized by ? - Dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) - Dry mouth (xerostomia) It results from immunologically mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The characteristic decrease in tears and saliva is the result of lymphocytic infiltration and .fibrosis of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The infiltrates are predominantly activated CD4+ helper T cells. There has been some association of Hepatitic C infection with .sjogren's syndrome. Sjogrens syndrome is associated with antibodies directed against two ribonucleoprotein antigens SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La). These antibodies are seen in upto 90% of the patients. Sjogrens syndrome can occur in two forms:- Primary form (isolated disorder) also known as Sicca syndrome. Secondary form (associated with other connective tissue disease). Connective tissue disorders associated with Sjogren's syndrome - Rheumatoid ahritis - SLE - Polymyositis - Sclerodenna - Vasculitis - Mixed connective tissue disease - Thyroiditis Clinical features Sjogrens syndrome occurs most commonly in older women typically between ages 50-60.

How does acyclovir inhibit herpes virus replication?,They block capping of viral mRNA,They inhibit reverse transcriptase activity,They inhibit viral polymerase activity,They block viral uncoating,"Acyclovir and ganciclovir are variants of acycloguanosine and are used to treat herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections, respectively. Both agents are viricidal and act by interfering with viral polymerase activity. In the case of herpes simplex virus infection, the virally- coded thymidine kinase monophosphorylates the acyclovir. Cellular kinases then add two more phosphates, creating a nucleotide that is accepted by the virally-coded DNA polymerase. The structural analog is incorporated into the growing DNA chain and elongation is terminated. Ribavirin, used to treat paramyxovirus (respiratory syncytial virus) infection, works by interferring with viral messenger RNA (mRNA) capping. Amantadine, used to treat influenza A infections, blocks viral un coating. It is most effective when given before viral infection occurs. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., azidothymidine, didioxycytocine, didioxyinosine) directly interfere with normal enzyme activity. These agents are virostatic, and virus growth occurs when the agents are removed. Interferons are induced as a result of viral infection of a cell. Products of viral nucleic acid replication activate genes that code for interferons, which directly prevent virus growth by inducing an antiviral protein within virus- infected cells.",C

W hen the film is improperly cleared, the remaining unexposed silver halide crystals darken upon exposure to light and obscure the image. * An antioxidant preservative, for example sodium sulfite, prevents the decomposition of the fixer chemical. * An acidifier such as acetic acid, that is necessary for the correct action of the other chemicals and also neutralizes any alkaline developer that may be carried over by the film or hanger.",C
All of the following is true about BLS in a child except:,Compresions: ventilation ratio is 15:2 when more than one rescuer is present in an infant,Brachial pulse check in an infant,Most common cause of cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation,Adrenaline is the drug of choice,"In children, the more common cause of cardiac arrest isasphyxiarather than ventricular. Even though asphyxia is the more common cause,pediatric resuscitation stas with chest compressions rather than rescue breaths as in adultsfor simplicity in training. This is because the cycle of30 chest compressionsbefore rescue breathing delays ventilation for only15 to 20 seconds. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation of infants and children, the ratio of chest compression to rescue breaths is 30:2 for a single rescuer and 15:2 if 2 or more rescuers are present. The initial energy to be set for defibrillation is at 2 J/kg for both monophasic and biphasic waveforms.It can be increased to 4 J/kg if a second shock is to be delivered. In adults, the ratio is 30:2irrespective of the number of rescuers. In infants and children, the depth of compression should be at least one-third of the anteroposterior diameter of the chest which is about 5 cm in children and 4 cm in infants. The compression rate should be 100-120/ minute. Allow complete chest recoil after each compression. Minimize interruptions in compressions (10 seconds or less). Rotate compressor every 2 minutes or earlier if fatigued. Avoid excessive ventilation.",C

Most appropriate cause is,Deep vein thrombosis,Pulmonary embolism,Disseminated intra vascular coagulation,Normal,"Deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a well-known and, when complicated by pulmonary embolus, potentially fatal complication of surgery. All hospitals must have a pro cess for screening all surgical patients to identify those at risk and for implementing prophylactic measures. There is inter- national agreement on risk and therapeutic options. Methods of prevention are guided by the risk score and include the use of compression stockings, calf pumps and pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin. The symptoms and signs of DVT include calf pain, swelling, warmth, redness and engorged veins. However, most will show no physical signs. On palpation the muscle may be tender and there may be a positive Homans' sign (calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot), but this test is neither sensitive nor specific. Duplex Doppler ultrasound and venography can be used to assess flow and the presence of a thrombosis. Other investigations include D-dimer. If a significant DVT is found (one that extends above the knee), treatment with parenteralanticoagulation initially, followed by longer-term warfarin or new oral anticoagulant. In some patients with a large DVT, a caval filter may be required to decrease the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pg no : 296",A

Transhiatal esophagectomy was planned for adenocarcinoma of lower end of esophagus. The approach would be in the following order:,Abdomen-Neck,Abdomen-Thorax-Neck,Neck-Thorax-Abdomen,Abdomen-Thorax,"Abdomen-Neck [Ref In transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) the thorax dosen't needs to be opened. Esophagus is removed through the diaphragmatic hiatus by making incisions in the abdomen and the neck. In this operation, first an upper abdominal incision is made. The surgeon mobilizes the esophagus by working upward through the diaphragmatic hiatus. With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis). Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and moality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are 1) Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and 2) Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a ""leak"" from intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. After a TIC, because the patient has not had the chest opened, there is less pain early after surgery, the patient can move about better as a result, and lung complications are less. Fuhermore, if an anastomotic leak occurs, it can be easily managed by a simple cervical drainage as the anastomosis here is placed in the neck.",A

Zenker's diveicula are rarely seen below 30 years of age, most patients are over 50 years of age. Dysphagia is the most common symptom. Other common symptoms include regurgitation of digested food specially when the patients is in the recumbent position, swelling of the neck, gurgling noise after eating, halitosis and foul metallic taste in the mouth. It is a pulsion diveiculum i.e caused by an increased intraluminal pressure in the esophagus (secondary to abnormal motility of esophagus) which push the mucosa and submucosa through the muscular defect. It is not a true diveicula as it does not contain all layers of esophageal wall. Other type of diveicula are traction diveicula in which the inflamed or scarred peribronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes pull the full thickness of the wall of esophagus out, creating a true diveicula.

The hematoma can be large enough to compromise intravascular volume, with resultant signs of hypovolemic shock including hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea.ii) Abdominal examination# Typically, the abdominal examination reveals a palpable, painful, firm, nonpulsatile abdominal mass corresponding to the rectus sheath. The mass may be bilobar with a central groove. The mass does not move with respiration. Because the hematoma is deep to the subcutaneous tissue and rectus muscles, the mass is not always palpable, particularly in obese patients.",C

"Delirium, mental confusion and nausea in patients who had undergone transurethral resection of prostate suggests: September 2009, September 2012",Hypernatremia,Sepsis,Hepatic coma,Water retention,"Ans. D: Water retention Water intoxication occurs in TURP. Significant amounts of fluid may be absorbed during a TURP, especially if venous sinuses are opened early or when the operation is prolonged. On average during a TURP, approximately 20 mL of fluid per minute is absorbed, or approximately 1000-1200 mL in the first hour of resecting time. One third of this fluid is absorbed directly into the venous system. This may lead to dilutional hyponatremia (TUR syndrome), which causes mental confusion, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, hemolysis, hemoglobin nephropathy, coma, and shock. Symptoms of TUR syndrome generally do not occur until the serum sodium level has decreased to 125 mEq or less. There will be clonus and positive Babinski responses. Papilloedema, with dilated, sluggishly reacting pupils can occur. The EEG will show low voltage, bilaterally. Hemodynamically, this is characterized initially by increased central venous pressures, hypeension, bradycardia, and other signs of early vascular overload, including restlessness, tachypnea, and sometimes dusky skin changes of the conjunctiva, mucous membranes, or fingernails. The incidence of this condition has been reduced since the introduction of isotonic glycine for performing the resections and the use of isotonic saline for postoperative irrigations.",D

The treatment of choice is:",Colostomy,Anterior resection,Abdominoperineal resection,Dysfunctional anastomosis,"Treatment of rectal cancer: Surgical and oncological management varies greatly depending on the stage of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. Low anterior resection: This is a sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed. The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper ? rd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower ? of rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesions but above the dentate line. 1 cm of margins can be adequate, provided the carcinoma is well differentiated. Abdominoperineal resection (also known as Miles procedure): In this procedure there is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by the concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for LAR cannot be obtained i.e. for carcinoma in lower rectum. Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transrectal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Palliative procedures: unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulguration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. ""In this patient the tumor lies 3.5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is just 2 cms from the anl verge so the tumor is just 1.5 cm from the dentate line.

Voluntary splinting as a result of pain, mechanically impaired chest wall movement and the associated lung contusion are all causes of the hypoxia. The patient is also at high risk of developing a pneumothorax or haemothorax. Traditionally, treatment consisted of mechanical ventilation to 'internally splint' the chest until fibrous union of the broken ribs occurred. The price for this was considerable in terms of intensive care unit resources and ventilation dependent morbidity. Currently, treatment consists of oxygen administration, adequate analgesia (including opiates) and physiotherapy. If a chest tube is in situ, intrapleural local analgesia can be used as well. Ventilation is reserved for cases developing respiratory failure despite adequate analgesia and oxygen. Surgery to stabilise the flail chest is currently in use again.

The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin A is best described by:,Postsynaptic receptor blockade,Acetylcholinesterase inhibition,Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release,Slowing of myelinated nerve fiber transmission,"Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release Botulinum toxin is an effective inhibitor of presynaptic acetylcholine exocytosis. Acting at the neuromuscular junction, cellular uptake is believed to occur through an active cell surface receptor-mediated process. This three-step chemical denervation is initiated by the toxin selectively binding to sites on the surface membrane of cholinergic nerve endings. An energy-dependent endocytotic process ensues internalizing the cell membrane with bound protein. The final step is presumed to act on calcium-mediated exocytosis, preventing the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. It is also believed that Botulinum toxin acts as a zinc-dependent metalloendo protease to inhibit exocytosis.",C

The surgeon should be particularly concerned about which coagulation function in patients receiving anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications?,APTT,PT,Reptilase time,Bleeding time,"Platelet dysfunction, measured by bleeding time, has been associated with a long list of drugs. Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications, aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, acetaminophen, and phenacetin have been implicated, along with aminopyrine and codeine. Ibuprofen, however, has not. In addition, many antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and sedatives have been associated with thrombasthenia. Any time platelet abnormalities are suspected, a careful review of the drugs the patient is receiving should be undertaken, and a measurement should be made of the platelet count and bleeding time.

"In a pregnant lady there is decreased requirement of anaesthetic agents because of all the following, EXCEPT:",Higher sensitivity of nerves to anaesthetics,Increased lumbar lordosis,Engorged spinal veins,Decreased sub arachnoid space,"During pregnancy there is a reduction in the requirement of anaesthetic agent. Factors contributing to this are -increased levels of B-EP -increased neuronal sensitivity -vascular congestion in spinal canal and -increased levels of progesterone. Increased lumbar lordosis has not been mentioned any where as a contributing factor for decreasing requirement of anaesthetic agents in pregnancy. During pregnancy enlarged uterus obstructs the inferior venacava and distends epidural venous plexus and increases epidural blood volume. This inturn results in decreased spinal CSF volume, decreased potential volume of subarachnoid space and increased epidural space pressure. The first two effects enhance the spread of LA solutions during spinal and epidural anaesthesia respectively whereas last may predispose to higher incidence of dural puncture with epidural anaesthesia.

Syndrome of internal iliac aery occlusion manifested by,Pain in calf,Absent pulse at the dorsalis pedis aery,Intermittent claudication,Gangrene,"Aerial pulses It is standard practice to examine the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis aeries together with the abdomen for an aoic aneurysm or renal aery bruit, which may coexist with lower limb occlusive disease. Diminution of a femoral and/or popliteal pulse can often be appreciated by comparing it with its opposite number; however, pedal pulses are either clinically palpable or absent. Popliteal pulses are often difficult to feel; a popliteal aery aneurysm should be suspected if the popliteal pulse is prominent with concomitant loss of the natural concavity of the popliteal fossa. Pulsation distal to an aerial occlusion is usually absent although the presence of a highly developed collateral circulation may allow distal pulses to be palpable - this is most likely to occur with an iliac stenosis. In this case, exercise (walking until claudication develops) usually causes the pulse to disappear as vasodilation occurs below the obstruction, causing the pulse pressure to reduce. An aerial bruit, heard on auscultation over the pulse, indicates turbulent flow and suggests a stenosis. It is an unreliable clinical sign as tight stenoses often do not have bruits. A continuous 'machinery' murmur over an aery usually indicates an aeriovenous fistula.

"A patient undergoing surgery suddenly develops hypotension. The monitor shows that the end tidal CO, has decreased abruptly by 155 mm Hg. What is the probable diagnosis -",Hypothermia,Pulmonary embolism,Massive fluid deficit,Myocardial depression due to anaesthetic agent,"Ans is 'b' i.e. pulmonary embolism First what is end tidal CO2 - The air exhaled during normal respiration initially consists of the dead space. Then a mixture of dead space air plus alveolar air comes out. The air coming out at the end consists purely of alveolar air. - Measurement of concentration of gases in this alveolar air is useful for analysis. The CO2 concentration in the last 10m1. of tidal volume is known as end tidal CO2 In pulmonary embolism the blood supply to ceain pas of the lung is cut off due to the emboli in circulation. This reduces the exchange of gases between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, as a result the conc. of CO2 in alveolar air decreases (CO2 is carried from tissues to the lung by blood and is transferred to the alveoli in exchange of 02). The decrease in alveolar CO2 will lead to decrease in end tidal CO2. Other conditions in which end tidal CO decreases (i) Increase in dead space (decrease in end tidal CO2 in pulmonary embolism can be explained by this also. Pulmonary embolism causes increase in physiological dead space hence decreases the end tidal CO2) (ii) Hyperventilation (iii) Malignant hypeherinia",B

They usually appear in children younger than 10 years and increase in size and number until adolescence, remaining unchanged thereafter. Other areas in which they may be observed include in and around nails (ungual fibromas), scalp, and forehead, in the latter location reaching sizes up to several centimeters. In the oral mucosa, they may be observed in the lips, dorsa of tongue, and palate. Dental pitting occurs in about 90% of patients. A hand lens examination aids detection of these pits, which are less obvious in deciduous teeth.> Periungual fibromas (Koenen tumors) are smooth, firm, flesh-colored papules emerging from the nail folds. They can be the only manifestation in some individuals. These are noted around puberty and may increase in frequency as the patient ages.> Shagreen patches Are flesh-colored soft plaques that are frequently found in the lumbosacral area but may occur anywhere on the trunk.

Are usually noticed during the first decade.> White macules Are ovoid, hypopigmented, ash leaf-shaped macules that can be found on the trunks or limbs. White macules offer an excellent opportunity for early diagnosis because they may be found at birth or early infancy. The use of Wood lamp accentuates these macules. Color, even though described as white, lacks the depigmented white appearance of vitiligo. Careful examination is necessary before making any firm diagnosis because hypopigmented macules may be a normal finding in newborn babies. 3 or more white macules at birth should alert the clinician regarding the possibility of tuberous sclerosis.

What is the concentration of oxygen supplied by oxygen concentrator:-,90% and 96%,100%,30 and 60%,60% and 90%,"oxygen concentrator They are also known as pressure swing adsorbers. They can be considered as an alternative to a traditional supply where no reliable liquid oxygen supply is available, such as an off-shore site or a site where the safety criteria for liquid installations cannot be met. These devices can be small, designed to supply oxygen to a single patient or they can be large enough to supply oxygen for a medical gas pipeline system. The components of this system are: Duplex compressors and molecular sieves, receivers, dryers, vacuum pumps, filters, line pressure regulators, control system, oxygen performance monitoring system and back up cylinder manifold. Oxygen concentrators operate on the principle of adsorbing (under pressure) other gases in the atmosphere onto the surface of an adsorbent material, known as zeolite. Because oxygen is not adsorbed by the zeolite, it is free to pass through into the storage for use. Zeolite is hydrated aluminium silicates of the alkaline eah metals in a powder or granular form. The zeolite is sealed in a vessel known as sieve bed. The sieve beds operate in pairs, one adsorbs whilst the other regenerates. Ambient air is filtered and pressurised to about 137 kPa by a compressor and then exposed to a zeolite molecular sieve column, forming a very large surface area, at a ceain pressure. The sieve selectively retains nitrogen and other unwanted components of air. These are released into the atmosphere after heating the column and applying a vacuum. The changeover between the columns is made by a time switch. The process is capable of producing oxygen concentrations of about 95%. The remainder is made up of mainly argon with a small percentage of nitrogen. During closed circuit anaesthesia, argon accumulation could occur. Therefore, to avoid this, higher fresh gas flows are required. As the process generates a great deal of heat, hence ventilation and cooling are mandatory. If the plant fails, the emergency cylinder manifold will feed into the pipeline at higher concentrations (99.5%) than the plant's operating norm of 95%. This may have an effect on down line equipment, paicularly in the critical care areas. This low-flow (2-4 L/min), low-pressure system can provide continuous oxygen to the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. A typical unit operates on mains supply and can provide up to 5 L/min of oxygen at a concentration of 94%. It can be piped around the home in small wall mounted outlets .",A

Which of the following explanations account(s) for the fact that hepatitis C is the most common cause of posttransfusion hepatitis?,There are more carriers of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the normal population who serve as blood donors.,Blood infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) cannot be eliminated through routine testing,Current serologic tests for HCV antigen do not exclude carriers.,Questions designed to eliminate risk groups for HCV from the normal donor population may not be as specific as would be desirable,"The ability to specifically identify persons infected with HCV has only recently become available. Therefore, data about epidemiology are less than complete. It is very likely not true that more blood donors carry HCV because of the large preponderance of HBV in the United States. It is true, however, that successful elimination of most of the HBV carriers occurs through routine testing. Although serologic tests are available for HCV, they are tests, not of antigen, but of antibody. Therefore, this test alone may not screen out persons who are infected but have not yet developed or may never develop antibody. Risk groups for the relatively newly defined HCV may well not be comprehensively established, and therefore this explanation may be a contributor. There are no differences in virulence between these classes of hepatitis virus.",D
Diversion of urinary bladder is best done at,Jejunum,Ileum,Cecum,Colon,"Permanent urinary tract diversion is most commonly performed by conduit diversion. The ureters are implanted into a sho, isolated segment of ileum or, less commonly, colon. The conduit dives the urine onwards to a cutaneous stoma for collection in an ileostomy bag. Ileal segment is the best for urinary diversion after cystectomy. Still better method is ""Continent cutaneous diversion"" method. But the best method is ""Ohotopic neobladders"". ""Incontinent cutaneous urinary diversion"" by ileal conduit: a segment of ileum is exteriorized in the form of a stoma through the abdominal wall, around which an appliance is secured and into which urine continuously drains. ""Continent cutaneous diversions"" -- All continent cutaneous reservoirs rely upon a low-pressure pouch constructed of various detubularized bowel segments and a functional mechanism that connects the reservoir to the skin, designed to prevent involuntary urine flow. The most obvious advantages of this type of diversion are the ability to avoid continuous urine drainage and the need for an external appliance. These continent cutaneous diversions require intermittent clean self-catheterization through the stoma both to empty the reservoir and to irrigate mucous. No stomal appliance is usually required. Although continent cutaneous diversions have been largely supplanted by the ohotopic neobladder, this procedure is used when the urethra or bladder neck is non-functional or involved by tumor, and avoidance of an external appliance is desired. ""Ohotropic neobladders""-- Ohotropic neobladders are internal reservoirs that are connected to the native urethra and rely upon the external striated sphincter for continence. These reservoirs are constructed from a segment of detubularized intestine (usually ileum) anastomosed to the native urinary outflow tract. Because this approach facilitates the restoration of normal self-image by approximating normal voiding, construction of an ohotropic neobladder has become the procedure of choice for most patients following cystectomy for bladder cancer in both men and women. It is contraindicated if the urethra is nonfunctional or involved with tumor. Bailey and Love Pg : 1336",B

True statement about burn resuscitation ?,Colloid preferred in initial 24 hrs,Colloid preferred if burnt area is > 15 % of total BSA,Half of the calculated fluid given in initial 8 hrs.,Urine output should be maintained at 50-60 mL/hr.,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Half of the calculated fluid given in initial 8 hrs Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient. The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compament to the extravascular compament (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned pas and non burned pas of body) This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs. Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extravascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume. - The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas) - half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs. Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning) A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients. * There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation. Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",C

Most radiation oncologists will not treat patients with scleroderma or active lupus erythematosus, considering it an absolute contraindication. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is not a relative or an absolute contraindication.The presence of multiple gross tumors in the same quadrant and indeterminate calcifications must be carefully assessed for suitability because studies in this area are not definitive.Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication to breast conservation treatment, although there is little published experience in treating patients with tumor sizes greater than four to five cm. However, a relative contraindication is the presence of a large tumor in a small breast in which an adequate resection would result in significant cosmetic alteration. In this circumstance, preoperative chemotherapy should be considered.Breast size can be a relative contraindication. Large pendulous breast is a relative contraindication, as it presents difficulty in delivering a uniform radiation dose.Centrally located tumor for which removal of the nipple areola complex is required to obtain a tumor free margin is a relative contraindication.

Crystalloid required for replacement of 300ml of blood loss is:,300ml,600ml,900ml,1200ml,"For crystalloid replacement ratio is 3:1 For colloid replacement ratio is 1:1 Distribution of Body fluids. Total body fluid accounts for about 60% of the lower body weight in male and 50% of the lower body weight in females. Intracellular fluids accounts for 40% of total body fluids and extracellular accounts for 20% of which only 5% is intravascular. Thus volume of blood accounts for 6% to 7% of body weight and only 11-12% of total body fluid. The meager distribution of total body fluid in the vascular compament is an impoant factor in the intolerance to blood loss. Plasma vs interstitial fluid Extracellular fluid accounts for about 20% of the total body fluid, and is composed of extra vascular (interstitial) and intravascular (plasma) fluid compament Comparison of interstitial fluid and plasma volumes Plasma volume is about 25% of interstitial fluid volume.

Post-anesthetic nausea and vomiting is uncommon with:,Propofol,Halothane,Fentanyl,Sufentanil,"Ans. (a) PropofolSalient Features of Propofol* It is a milky white powder that is preservative free. Therefore, it must be used within 6 hours.* It is an oil based preparation, therefore injection is painful.* Onset of action: 15 seconds* Duration of action: 5-10 min. (due to redistribution)* Due to rapid action, post anesthetic nausea and vomiting is uncommon with propofol* It possesses very strong antiemetic and antipruritic action.* It decreases blood pressure and impairs baroreceptor reflexes.* It produces more severe and prolonged respiratory depression than thiopentone.* It has no muscle relaxant property.* It has cerebroprotective activity but does not possess anticonvulsant activity. Rather, myoclonic jerking and muscle twitching can be seen with the use of propofol.* It is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for day care surgery.* It is also the intravenous anaesthetic of choice for sedation in ICU.* Propofol is the intravenous anaesthetic of choice in the patients with malignant hyperthermia.* Along with opioids (alfentanil or fentanyl) propofol is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA).",A

Which of the following is true about skeletal tuberculosis in children?,"Most common sites are hip (40%), Spine (20%), Knee (10%)",Most common site is upper limb,Dorsolumbar spine is most commonly affected,Progression to kyphosis deformity is least with lumbar lesions,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Progression to kyphosis deformity is least with lumbar lesions Tuberculosis in children Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis accounts for 5 - 10% of total cases of tuberculosis in children o About 1/3 of children with tuberculosis have extrapulmonary tuberculosis The most common mode of presentation in a child less than 2 years is development of a gibbusof the dorsal area. o Under the age of four, backache in children should be regarded as pathological unless and until proved otherwise. o MRI cannot differentiate between pyogenic or tuberculous infection. Veebral tuberculosis is the most common form of skeletal tuberculosis in children, accounting for 50% of all cases in repoed series. Approximate distribution in the skeleton are spine (50%), hip (20%), knee (10%), ankle and foot (5%), hand and wrist (3%), elbow (2%), shoulder (1 %), bursal sheaths and other bones (8%) The thoracic spine is most commonly affected; the radiological features include bone marrow oedema and enhancement, posterior element involvement, canal stenosis, and spinal cord or nerve root compression. Inter-veebral disc enhancement, veebral collapse and kyphosis deformity are paicularly suggestive of tuberculosis. Those with dorsal lesions have maximal deformity at the time of presentation, paly due to the additive effect of the normal thoracic kyphosis. However, the rib cage offers protection against additional collapse. Patients with dorsolumbar lesions have the worst prognosis as they tend to collapse more during the active phase of the disease and even more during the growth period. Those with lumbar lesions have the best prognosis with the least deformity at presentation, a lesser increase during the active phase, and also a tendency for substantial decrease during the growth period.",D

Which of the following is the best way of preventing the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the postoperative period?,Early ambulation,Physiotherapy,Prophylactic heparin,Low dose aspirin,"Patients are at increased risk for developing venous thromboembolism after:

Major abdominal surgery
Major orthopaedic surgery
Has sustained major trauma
Has prolonged immobility (>3 days)

These patients need some form of prophylaxis. The prophylaxis can be mechanical or pharmacological.
Prophylaxis for DVT 
Mechanical Prophylaxis include : 
Early ambulation 

It is the simplest method of prophylaxis
It acts by activating the calf pump mechanism

Pneumatic compression devices

It is the most common method of prophylaxis
Pneumatic compresses prevents the stasis by periodically compressing the calves.

Pharmacological Prophylaxis include

Use of unfractionated heparin - Now being replaced by fractionated low molecular weight heparin
Use of fractionated low molecular - Better efficacy than unfractionated heparin
weight heparin - No laboratory monitoring is necessary

Comparison of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with mechanical prophylaxis demonstrates superiority of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in reduction of the development of venous thromboembolic disease.  Prospective trials evaluating LMWH in head injured and trauma patients have also proven the safety of LMWH with no increase in intracranial bleeding or major bleeding at other sites. In addition, LMWH shows significant reduction in the development of venous thromboembolism compared to other methods.
In short, LMWH should be considered the optimal method of prophylaxis in moderate and high risk patients. Even the traditional reluctance to use heparin in high risk groups such as the multiply injured trauma patient and the injured patient must be reexamined, given the efficacy and safety profile of LMWH in multiple prospective trials.",C

Thiopentone is C/I in,Acute intermittent porphyria,Bronchial asthma,Shock,All the above,"Barbiturates promote aminolevulinic acid synthetase, which stimulates the formation of porphyrin (an intermediary in heme synthesis). This may precipitate acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria in susceptible individuals. Barbiturates incompletely depress airway reflex responses to laryngoscopy and intubation, and airway instrumentation may lead to bronchospasm (in asthmatic patients) or laryngospasm in lightly anesthetized patients. In situations where the baroreceptor response will be blunted or absent (eg, hypovolemia, congestive hea failure, b-adrenergic blockade), cardiac output and aerial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated peripheral pooling of blood and direct myocardial depression.

Water hammer pulse seen in,>Aoic stenosis,>Aoic regurgitation,>Aoic stenosis and Aoic regurgitation,>Mitral regurgitation,"Aoic regurgitation Water hammer pulse It is a large bounding pulse, associated with increased stroke volume of the left ventricle and decrease in the peripheral resistance, leading to a wide pulse pressure. The pulse strikes the palpating finger with a rapid, forcefid jerk and quickly disappears. It is best felt in the radial aery with the patients arm elevated. It is seen in Aoic regurgitation. Pathophysiology of water hammer pulse In Aoic regurgitation the stroke volume is high, so the systolic pressure is high and this is responsible for sharp rise in the pulse. The stroke volume is high because the left ventricle gets blood from two sources during the diastole i.e. blood leaking from the Aoa and the blood it receives from left atria. The collapse occurs because Diastolic leak of blood into the left ventricle from the Aoa Rapid run off to the periphery as a result of low systemic vascular resistance (the increased cardiac output stimulates the baroreceptors in the aoic arch and the result is reflex vasodilatation of the peripheral vessels into which the blood flows rapidly). Wiry are arms elevated in the examination ? When the arm is raised there is fall of blood column resulting in vasodilation and thus helps to reduce the diastolic pressure more, so the pulse pressure widens. It may be so that the aery palpated becomes more in the line of Aoa after elevation of the arm and thus allows the direct systolic ejection and diastolic backward flow.",B

Strictly it should be 'agenesis' and 'atresia' of the rectum and anus.)> One infant in 4500 is born with an imperforate anus, or with imperfect fusion of the post-allantoic gut with the proctodaeum.> The condition is divided into two main groups: the high and the low, depending on whether the termination of the bowel is above or below the pelvic floor.> Low varieties are easy to diagnose and relatively simple to treat, and the outlook is good.> High varieties often have a fistula into the urinary tract together with a deficient pelvic floor, and are difficult to treat.# Low abnormalities:> Covered anus. The underlying anal canal is covered by a bar of skin with atrack running forwards to the perineal raphe. The track should be opened with scissors, followed by routine dilatation of the anus.> Ectopic anus. The anus is situated anteriorly and may open in the perineum in boys, or more commonly in the vulva in girls, or rarely into thevagina. A plastic 'cut back' operation isrequired (Pena).> Stenosed anus. The anus is microscopic, but careful examination usually reveals a minute opening which responds to regular dilatation.> Membranous stenosis. Here the anus is normally sited, but is covered with a thin membrane which bulges with retained meconium. It is rare, and an incision will cure the condition.# High abnormalities:> These are often associated with a fistulous connection between the blind rectal stump and the bladder, or other abnormalities of the pelvic structures.> Anorectai agnesis. A blind rectal pouch lies just above the pelvic floor -- its anterior aspect in the male is attached to the bladder and often there is a rectovesical fistula manifested by the passage of gas or meconium in the urine. In the female, the fistula is usually into the posterior fornix.> Rectal atresia. The anal canal is normal but ends blindly at the level of the pelvic floor. The bowel also ends blindly above the pelvic floor without a fistulous opening. This anomaly is rare but must be treated by mobilisation of the rectum and excision of the stricture. After that, end-to-end anastomosis of the anus and rectum must be attempted.> More conservative measures are followed by an intractable stricture.> Cloaca. This occurs only in females and here the bowel, urinary and genital tracts all open into a common wide cavity. Commonly severe malformations of the area are associated with other developmental abnormalities, e.g. tracheobronchial fistula.",C

"After bone fracture, primary healing will show which of these features:",Callus molding can be evaluated on the radiograph.,Cannot be seen.,Fracture line disappears very soon radiographically.,Does not disappear.,"Primary or direct healing with rigid fixation of bone segments prevents any interfragmentary mobility and causes bone healing where no callus forms. The bones instead go on to heal by a process of haversian remodeling. Histologically, osteoclasts cross the fracture gap and are followed by blood vessels and osteoblasts. New bone is laid down by the osteoblasts, forming osteons which cross the gap and impart microscopic points of bony union to the fracture. A remodeling phase then converts the entire area to morphologically normal bone.",C

Peripheral intravenous catheter insertion is often difficult, if not impossible, in infants and young children with circulatory collapse. An intraosseous line is as efficient as an intravenous route and can be inserted quickly, even in the most poorly perfused patientso The marrow of long bones has a rich network of vessels that drain into a central venous canal, emissary veins, and, ultimately, the central circulation. Therefore, the bone marrow functions as a noncollapsible venous access route when peripheral veins may have collapsed because of vasoconstriction. This approach is particularly important in patients in shock or cardiac arrest, when blood is shunted to the core due to compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction. The intraosseous (IO) route allows medications and fluids to enter the central circulation within secondso Intraosseous (IO) insertion was typically recommended for use in children younger than 6 years; however, it is now recognized to be both safe and effective in older children and adultso The problems with IO use in older patients arise from the increased difficulty of insertion through thicker cortex of the bone and the smaller marrow cavity. Inability to enter the marrow may increase the likelihood of fracturing the bone.",A

Which is wrong regarding somato sensory evoked potentials (SSEP)?,Can be used intraoperatively inside OT,Can be used to monitor CNS during intracranial surgery,Can be used during spinal cord surgery to detect spinal cord damage,Is contraindicated under general anaesthesia,"Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP or SSEP) is the electrical activity of the brain that results from the stimulation of touch. SEP tests measure that activity and are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the coex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by viually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingeip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early coical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory coex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional coical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory coex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal coices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures.

First we, look at the causes of isolated prolongation of APTT. Causes of isolated prolongation of PT Heparin - Lupus anticoagulant - Coagulation factor deficiency (factor V111, IX and XI, XII, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) Specific coagulation factor inhibitors (antibodies against .factor VIII or IX) Now we look for those causes of prolonged APTT which are not associated with bleeding Now we move on to the options and find out which among them will cause prolongation of PTT with no bleeding. Factor Ville assay:- Factor Ville or intrinsic factor VIII can be ruled out because its deficiency is associated with bleeding. Platelet aggregation tests :? Platelet aggregation test measures platelet function Any defect in platlet function will cause clinical bleeding Platelet .function defect does not affect PTT (it affects bleeding time, BT) Ristocetin co-factor assay :- Ristocetin co:factor assays are used to detect Von wilebrand's disease Von wilebrands disease cause prolongation of PTT but it is also associated with clinical bleeding so it can be ruled out. Russel viper venom test (Dilute Russel viper venom test) (dRVVT) Dilute Russel viper venom test is one of the test to detect lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulant is associated with prolongation in PTT and thrombosis (no bleeding) Lupus anticoagulant Lupus anticoagulants are acquired inhibitors directed against phospholipid binding proteins and are a common cause of APTT prolongation In Vivo, Lupus anticoagulant do not interfere with coagulation factor complex .formation on the platelet surface and are not usually associated with bleeding tendency, instead they are frequently associated with thrombosis. In Vitro, This prolongation results in paradoxical prolongation of phospholipid based clotting assays such as P77, kaolin clotting time and Dilute Russel viper venom antibody (dRVVT testing). A panel of test is required to confirm the presence of lupus antico- agulant These are:? - PTT - Kaolin clotting time - Dilute Russel viper Venom test (DRVT) These are phospholipid dependent tests We have already discussed that Lupus anticoagulant act against phospholipids and in vitro this inhibition leads to prolongation of phospholipid dependent assays. Follow up testing is performed to confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant:-These may include :- Mixing study - An equal volume of patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and a PTT or DRVVT is performed on this mixture. The basic principle is that the normal plasma contributes a sufficient amount of clotting factor to correct .for a factor deficiency. - A mixing study that corrects the APTT is characteristic of a coagulation factor where as one that does not correct indicates a factor inhibitor. Correction neutralization (with phospholipids) :? - An excess of pho.spholipid is added to the patient sample and APII, DRVVT is performed. - The basic principle behind this is that lupus anticoagulant is directed against phospholipid. Hence phospholipid dependent assays are prolonged. - When excess phospholipid is added it overcomes the LA inhibition and corrects the test.",B

It arises from the remnants of second branchial cleft. Normally, 2nd, 3rd, 4th clefts disappear to form a smooth neck. Persistent 2nd cleft is called as cervical sinus (of His) which eventually gets sequestered to form branchial cyst. 
Six branchial arches with five pharyngeal pouches (endoderm lining) inside and five pharyngeal clefts (ectoderm lining) outside are present. 
Swelling in the neck beneath the anterior border of upper third of the sternomastoid muscle. It is smooth, soft, fluctuant, often transilluminant with a sensation of ‘Half-filled double hot water bottle’.
It is equal in both sexes. Even though congenital, it is seen in late adolescents and early 3rd decade.
In 3% cases, it is bilateral; it can be familial also.
Usually painless unless it is infected. 
It contains cholesterol crystals which is from the lining of mucous membrane which contains sebaceous gland. Cheesy toothpaste like material is typical.
Histologically, it is lined by squamous epithelium. Occasionally it contains ciliated columnar epithelium. Cyst wall shows plenty of lymphoid tissue. 

Key Concept:

Salvage abdominoperineal resection is reserved for recurrent or residual pelvic disease after chemoradiation.* The management of inguinal node disease is variable. Due to the high morbidity rate, prophylactic groin dissection is not recommended. Clinically significant inguinal adenopathy can be included in the field of radiation.* The overall response to chemoradiation should be assessed clinically at about 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. At this point, up to 85% of patients will have complete clinical response.* Those with good partial response may be observed closely to ensure that complete response does occur.* Any lesions suspicious for residual disease or progression of disease should be biopsied at that time.* For those patients with complete clinical response, surveillance entails DRE and examination of inguinal nodes every 3-6 months for the first 2 years and annually there after up to 5 years.",A

"Regarding adhesive intestinal obstruction, TRUE is ?",Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours,Never operate,Operate after minimum 10 days of conservative treatment,Immediate operation,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours There are three main measures in the tit of acute intestinal obstruction. These are 1) Gastro intestinal drainage (Nasogastric suction) 2) Fluid and electrolyte replacement 3) Surgery for relief of obstruction The first two steps are always necessary prior to the surgical relief of obstruction. Surgical treatment is necessary for most cases of intestinal obstruction, but it should always be delayed until resuscitation is complete. The timing of surgical intervention is dependent on clinical picture. The classical clinical advice on a case of unrelieved intestinal obstruction is that ""Sun should not both rise and set"" i.e., the operative procedure should not be delayed beyond 24 hrs. But, there are ceain exceptions to this rule. In some cases operation is delayed in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In adhesive intestinal obstruction, usually occuring after surgery the upto 72 hours in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In these cases continued radiological evidence of obstruction.

All of the following are seen in chronic pyloric obstruction except: March 2010,Alkaline urine,Acidic urine,Hypochloremia,Hypokalemia,"Ans. A: Alkaline urine Paradoxical aciduria occurs when a metabolic alkalosis caused by severe vomiting as seen in pyloric obstruction. Blood tests initially will reveal hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis due to loss of hydrochloric acid vomiting, but sodium and potassium levels are normal. However as dehydration progresses, more profound metabolic abnormalities arise, paly due to renal dysfunction. Initially the urine has low chloride and high bicarbonate content, reflecting primary metabolic abnormality. This bicarbonate is excreted along with sodium and so, with time patient becomes progressively hyponatremic and more profoundly dehydrated. Because of dehydration, a phase of sodium retention follows and potassium and hydrogen are excreted in preference. This results in urine becoming paradoxically acidic and hypokalemia ensues.",A

True about anesthesia circuit is:,Bain circuit is best suited for spontaneous respiration,Mapleson F circuit is used for children <6 years,Schimmelbusch mask is a type of semi closed circuit,Fresh gas flow in bain circuit is equal to minute ventilation for spontaneous ventilation,"Bains circuit is circuit of choice for controlled ventilation. MAPLESON A or the Magill circuitis the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. Baincircuit is a coaxial modification of the Mapleson D circuit. It consists of a fresh gas flow inlet, a narrow inner tube, a corrugated outer tube, a reservoir (breathing) bag, an adjustable pressure limiting valve and a facemask at the patient end. Itdoes nothave aCarbon dioxide absorberunlike the circle breathing systems. Rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. The fresh gas flows through the inner tube. When anesthetic gas inflow is much greater than the uptake by the patient and the circuit, excess pressure builds up, which leads to the opening of the adjustable pressure valve and expelling out of the gases. The reservoir bag as the name suggests, serves as a reservoir of anesthetic gases and to generate positive pressure ventilation. scheimmblebush mask is mask used for delivering ether",B

Postoperatively, she develops a leak from the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis and becomes septic. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed, which demonstrates an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. She also develops acute renal failure and oliguria. Which of the following is an indication to sta dopamine?",To increase splanchnic flow,To increase coronary flow,To decrease hea rate,To lower peripheral vascular resistance,"Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension.",B

Lymphoma

Lymphoma is a rare malignancy of thyroid (< 1%).
Most are of non-Hodgkin's B-cell type.
Although the disease can arise as part of a generalized lymphomatous condition, most thyroid lymphomas develop in patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's ds.)
Presenting symptoms are :

- rapidly enlarging mass (similar to anaplastic ca but is often painless.)
- acute respiratory distress
- hoarseness
- dysphagia
- fever

Diagnosis is usually suggested by FNA biopsy, although core needle or open biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis.

Treatment
- Thyroid lymphoma responds rapidly to chemotherapy (CHOP - cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)
- Combined t/t with radiotherapy & chemotherapy is recommended.
- Surgical resection is recommended to alleviate pressure symptoms.",B

Serum fructosamine can be used in all exceptaEUR',Screening of diabetes,Rapid change in DM treatment,Monitoring sho term control of DM,Screening of DM in pregnancy,"Screening of diabetes Fructosamine is the product of a reaction between fructose and protein. Fructosamine is a compound that is fOrmed by the nonenzymatic reaction between fructose and ammonia. When .fructosamines are fanned from blood proteins such as albumin, they are known as glycated serum protein or glycated albumin. Since albumin has much shoer half life than hemoglobin, serum fructosamine generally reflects the state of glycemic control for only the preceeding 2 weeks. Fructosamine measurement has been present since long to monitor sugar control in diabetes. The test for ,fructosamine is simpler and less costly than for glycated hemoglobin. However, the trials have shown it to be too unspecific to replace the increasingly well established and generally recommended determination of HbAc. Glucose control in diabetics is usually assessed with the help of glycosylated hemoglobin that indicates average glucose level over the preceeding 12 weeks as reflected by the permanent glycosylation of a small fraction of the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. However, its measurement is not appropriate where there has been a recent change in the diet or treatment within 6 weeks of if there are abnormalities in red blood cell aging or mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence people with recent blood loss or hymolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell disease are not suitable for glycosylated hemoglobin method that do not account for higher turnover of hemoglobin. Fructosamine is used in these circumstances. It is also used in conditions such as pregnancy in which hormonal changes cause greater sho term fluctuation in glucose concentrations. The American diabetes Association says that fructosamine may be a better choice when glycosylated hemoglobin cannot be reliably measured : These situations include: 1) The evaluation of changes in diabetic treatmentQ, since the effects of adjustment can be evaluated after a couple of weeks rather than months. 2) In pregnancyQ, since the glucose and insulin needs of the mother and fetus changes rapidly during gestation. 3) Any condition that effects the average age of red blood cellsQ such as hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia or blood loss. Fructosamine is not affected by such conditions and may be a better choice for monitoring glucose control. 4) In monitoring sho term and intermediate glycemic control. Disadvantages of fructosamine:- Measured fructosamine may be falsely low in the setting of decreased protein levels such as nephrotic syndrome or hepatic disease. Fuher, because of lack of standardization and concern with reproducibility, fructosamine is not recommended for routine use or as a replacement or supplement for glycated hemoglobin in the assessment of glucose in diabetes.",A

Type of anaemia caused by pulmonary TB,Iron-deficiency,Megaloblastic,Sideroblastic,Microcytic Hypochromic anaemia,"Microcytie hypochromic anaemia Tuberculosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder. It is associated with anemia of chronic disease Anemia that is often observed in patients with infectious inflammatory or neoplastic disease that persists for more than 1 or 2 months is called anemia of chronic disease. - The characteristic feature of this group is occurrence of anemia in the presence of ample storage iron. The erythrocytes in anemia of chronic disease are usually normocytic and nonnochronic, however hypochromia and microcytosis may also be observed. The morphological features are determined by the primary disease. - ""For instance many patients with cancer have anemia that is typically normocytic and normochromic. In contrast patients with long standing active rheumatoid ahritis or chronic infections such as tuberculosis will have a microc tic hypochromic anemia"". The key pathological feature in anemia of chronic disease is failure to mobilize stored irony (ferritin). Ferritin is present in the macrophages of bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system. Under normal circumstances, iron can be mobilized back from the ferritin into the circulation. When developing erythrocytes require iron, the iron stored as ferritin is presented to the plasma from where it is carried to the developing erythrocytes. Why there is failure of iron mobilization in anemia of chronic disease? Anemia of chronic disease occurs in ceain inflammatory conditions or chronic disease. In these conditions macrophages are activated and they release ceain cytokines e.g. IF, IL-1, TNF. These cytokines stimulate synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. Increased hepcidin synthesis inhibits release of iron from the storage pool. Thus in anemia of chronic diseases, the macrophages, despite being rich in stored iron cannot provide iron to developing erythrocyte. The other impoant effect of cytokines released by rnacrophages in chronic inflammatory disorders is inhibition of CFUE (colony forming units erythroid). The inhibition leads to decreased synthesis of erythropoletin which in turn decreases erythropoiesis and produces anemia.

Which of the following does not cause malignant hypehermia,Isoflurane,Desflurane,N2O,Enflurane,"Anesthetic drugs that trigger Malignant Hypehermia include ether, halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, anddepolarizing muscle relaxants, succinylcholine being the only anesthetic drug currently used. Desflurane and sevoflurane appear to be less potent triggers than halothane and produce a more gradual onset of MH. The onset may be explosive if succinylcholine is used. Mild hypothermia and the preadministration of barbiturates, tranquilizers, propofol, or nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers delay or prevent the onset of MH The two classic clinical manifestations of fulminant MH syndrome may sta with one of the following two scenarios:1. Rigidity after induction with succinylcholine but successful intubation, followed rapidly by the symptomslisted after scenario 22. Normal response to induction of anesthesia and uneventful anesthetic course until the onset of the following symptoms:* Unexplained sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias (or both)* Tachypnea, if spontaneous ventilation is present* Unexplained decrease in oxygen (O2) saturation (because of a decrease in venous O2 saturation)* Increase in end-tidal paial pressure of CO2 (Pco2) with adequate ventilation and, in most cases, unchanged ventilation* Unexpected metabolic and respiratory acidosis* Central venous desaturation* Increase in body temperature above 38.8deg C with no obvious cause. TREATMENTAcute management for MH can be summarized as follows:1. Discontinue all anesthetic agents and hyperventilate with 100% O2 with a fresh flow to at least 10 L/min. With increased aerobic metabolism, normal ventilation must increase. However, CO2 production is also increased because of neutralization of fixed acid by bicarbonate; hyperventilation removes this additional CO2.2. Reconstitute dantrolene in sterile water (not saline), and administer rapidly (2.5 mg/kg intravenously to a total dose of 10 mg/kg IV) every 5 to 10 minutes until the initial symptoms subside.3. Administer bicarbonate (1 to 4 mEq/kg IV) to correct the metabolic acidosis with frequent monitoring of blood gases and pH.4. Control fever by administering iced fluids, cooling the body surface, cooling body cavities with sterile iced fluids, and, if necessary, using a heat exchanger with a pump oxygenator. Cooling should be halted when the temperature approaches 38deg C to prevent inadveent hypothermia.5. Monitor urinary output, and establish diuresis if urine output is inadequate. Administer bicarbonate to alkalinize urine to protect the kidney from myoglobinuria induced renal failure.6. Blood gases, electrolytes, CK, temperature, arrhythmia, muscle tone, and urinary output guide fuher therapy. Hyperkalemia should be treated with bicarbonate, glucose, and insulin. Effective doses of dantrolene to reverse MH are the most effective way to lower serum potassium levels. In severe cases, calcium chloride or calcium gluconate may be used.7. Analyze coagulation studies (e.g., international normalized ratio , platelet count, prothrombin time, fibrinogen, fibrin split degradation products). Safe anesthetics consist of nitrous oxide, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, opiates, tranquilizers, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine must be avoided at all times, even in the presence of dantrolene. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",C

Cunningham, 21/e, pp 43, 1281.) The patient is giving a classic description of round ligament pain. Each round ligament extends from the lateral poion of the uterus below the oviduct and travels in a fold of peritoneum downward to the inguinal canal and inses in the upper poion of the labium majus. During pregnancy, these ligaments stretch as the gravid uterus grows fuher out of the pelvis and can thereby cause sharp pains, paicularly with sudden movements. Round ligament pain is usually more frequently experienced on the right side due to the extrorotation of the uterus that commonly occurs in pregnancy. Usually this pain is greatly improved by avoiding sudden move- ments and by rising and sitting down gradually. Local heat and analgesics may also help with pain control. The diagnosis of appendicitis is not likelybecause the patient is not experiencing any fever or anorexia. In addition, because the gravid uterus pushes the appendix out of the pelvis, pregnant women with appendicitis often have pain located much higher than the groin area. The diagnosis of preterm labor is unlikely because the pain is localized to the groin area on one side and is alleted with a heating pad, which would not be the case with labor contractions. In addition, when labor occurs, the pain would persist at rest, not just with movement. A urinary tract infection is unlikely because the patient has no urinary symptoms. A kidney stone is unlikely because usually the patient would complain of pain in the back, not low in the groin.

Chylothorax means pleural cavity containing,Lymph,Blood,Air,Pus,"(A) Lymph # CHYLOTHORAX OR CHYLE LEAK is a type of pleural effusion &results from lymph formed in the digestive system called chyle accumulating in the pleural cavity due to either disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct.> Causes: It is rare but serious, and It results from leakage of lymph fluid from the thoracic duct (or one of its tributaries). This can result from direct laceration (e.g., from surgery) or from nontraumatic causes. The most common nontraumatic cause is malignancy, especially lymphoma. Less common is left-heart failure, infections, and developmental abnormalities such as Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome.> Treatment of Chylothorax: Drainage of the fluid out of the pleural space is essential to obviate damage to organs, especially the inhibition of lung function by the counter pressure of the chyle. Pleuroperitoneal shunting (creating a communication channel between pleural space and peritoneal cavity). Loss of essential triglycerides that escape the thoracic duct can be prevented. Omitting fat (in particular FFA) from the diet is essential. Surgical or chemical pleurodesis: leaking of lymphatic fluids is stopped by irritating the lungs and chest wall, resulting in a sterile inflammation.

True regarding cystic hygroma is: March 2008,Always unilateral,Brilliantly translucent,Subsides itself,Always presents at bih,"Ans. B: Brilliantly translucent Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs that result from a blockage in the lymphatic system and are lined by single layer of epithelium. Cystic hygromas are single or multiple cysts found mostly in the neck region. Swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child cough or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other swelling of the neck is that it is brilliantly translucent. A cystic hygroma can be present as a bih defect (congenital) or develop at any time life. A cystic hygroma in a developing baby can progress to hydrops (an excess amount of fluid in the body) and eventually fetal death. Some cases of congenital cystic hygromas resolve leading to webbed neck, edema (swelling), and a lymphangioma (a benign yellowish-tan tumor on the skin composed of swollen lymph vessels). In other instances the hygroma can progress in size to become larger than the fetus. Cystic hygromas occur in approximately 1% of fetuses between weeks 9 and 16 of pregnancy. Definitive management is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of the sclerosing agent (picibanil) may reduce the size of the cyst.",B

Once atelactasis and collapse have occurred cPAP might not help much. Therefore all pretenn infants < 35 weeks with any sign of respiratory distress should be staed immediately on cPAP. Prophylactic cPAY Extending the above logic some have advocated the use of prophylactic cPAP before the onset of respiratory distress in preterm VLBW infants as majority of them would eventually develop respiratory distress. However there is no evidence for any additional benefits with this approach, indeed there are concerns regarding increased adverse effect such as intraventricular hemorrhage. ""Hence prophylactic cPAP is not recommended at present"". Beneficial effects of cPAP Increase in. functional residual capacity Increased pulmonary compliance Prevents alveolar collapse Increases airway diameter Conserves surfactant Decrease in alveolar aerial 02 pressure gradiant. More on cPAP Continuous positive airway pressure is a modality in which increased pulmonary pressure is provided during the expiratory phase of respiration in spontaneously breathing neonates.

A 39-year-old man is undergoing resuscitation with blood products for an upper GI bleed. He is suspected of having a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Which of the following is appropriate in the management of this patient?,"Removal of nonessential foreign body irritants, for example, Foley catheter",Fluid restriction,0.1 M HCl infusion,Fluids and mannitol,"Hemolytic transfusion reactions lead to hypotension and oliguria. The increased hemoglobin in the plasma will be cleared the kidneys, which leads to hemoglobinuria. Placement of an indwelling Foley catheter with subsequent demonstration of oliguria and hemoglobinuria not only confirms the diagnosis of a hemolytic transfusion reaction but is useful in monitoring corrective therapy. Treatment begins with discontinuation of the transfusion, followed by aggressive fluid resuscitation to suppo the hypotensive episode and increase urine output. Inducing diuresis through aggressive fluid resuscitation and osmotic diuretics is impoant to clear the hemolyzed red cell membranes, which can otherwise collect in glomeruli and cause renal damage. Alkalinization of the urine (pH >7) helps prevent hemoglobin clumping and renal damage. Steroids do not have a role in the treatment of hemolytic transfusion reactions.",D

Primary prosthetic replacement should be reserved for the very old or infirm, and for pathological, irreducible, or grossly comminuted fractures. (i.e. when preserving head is almost not possible). United femoral neck fracture with an intact head is better than any prosthesis and where there is a reasonable chance of good internal fixation, and accurate reduction can be obtained close reduction and internal fixation should be the treatment of choice. The two main treatment modalities are - ahroplasty (hemi replacement & THR) and reduction and internal fixation by canulated cancellus screws. The prosthetic replacement allows immediate weight bearing & eliminates chances of nonunion and avascular necrosis and in limited life expectancy reduces the chances of reoperation.

After Hyperventilating for some time holding the breath is dangerous because –,Decrease CO2 shift the O2 dissociation curve to the left,Alkalosis can lead to tetany,It can lead to CO2 Narcosis,"Due to lack of stimulation by CO2, anoxia can go into dangerous levels","In our body its not O2, but CO2 that maintains the respiratory drive (though main function of respiration is to maintain adequate oxygen level in the body)
Thus its not hypoxia but hypercarbia that is required to inform the brain that respiration is inadequate.
If normally a person holds his breath he will soon have decrease O2 level (hypoxia) and increase CO2 level (hypercarbia)
Hypercarbia will stimulate the brain and increase the respiratory drive, forcing the person to take breath.

Lets see what happens when a person hyperventilates

Decreased PaCO2 of blood
Normal O2 saturation (despite hyperventilation arterial O2 saturation remains same as blood is almost fully saturated at normal ventilation rate)

Lets see what happens when such a person holds his breath.
● Soon his blood O2, level will fall (hypoxia) but his blood CO2 level will be normal or below normal (as he was hypocapnic due to hyperventilation)
● His blood O2 level will continue to fall, but his CO2 level will still be not high enough to stimulate the brain for respiratory drive.

The person will continue to hold his breath and his O2 level may fall to lethal levels without any respiratory drive (his brain is still unaware that he is in danger of dying from hypoxia).",D

Which of the following is true regarding bone marrow transplantation?,Marrow is highly immunogenic and easily rejected by the non-immunosuppressed host,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of aplastic anemias,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of congenital immunodeficiency diseases,Marrow transplantation can be used as a successful therapy for stage IV breast cancer following high-dose chemotherapy,"Bone marrow cells are highly immunogenic. Successful engraftment requires the use of powerful immunosuppressants that permit the transplanted cells not only to survive the host's immune response, but also to mount a graft-versus-host response against recipient tissues. The graft-versus-host response is the major impediment to more widespread clinical use of this technique. Despite these barriers, human bone marrow transplantation has had important clinical application in the treatment of aplastic anemias and congenital immunodeficiency diseases and several hematologic malignancies. Stem cell transplantation involves harvesting of a patient's own pluripotent bone marrow cells and subsequent reestablishment of the marrow following high-dose, toxic chemotherapy for advanced cancer. This modality has been used in the treatment of recurrent breast cancer, but recent metanalyses of the results have failed to show any significant survival benefit. In experimental models, work with bone marrow transplantation for the induction of tolerance to organ allografts has proved highly promising. This may provide a key for the development of treatment protocols in organ transplant recipients that would avoid or reduce the need for toxic systemic immunosuppressants.",A
Induction agent of choice in bronchial asthma,Thiopentone,Methhexitone,Ketamine,Propofol,"Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

Pain during injection occurs all except,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,Etomidate,"Induction of anesthesia with propofol is often associated with pain on injection, apnea, hypotension, and, rarely, thrombophlebitis of the vein into which propofol is injected.Pain on injection is reduced by using a large vein, avoiding veins in the dorsum of the hand, and adding lidocaine to the propofol solution or changing the propofol formulation. Multiple other drugs and distraction techniques have been investigated to reduce the pain on injection of propofol. Pretreatment with a small dose of propofol, opiates, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ketamine, esmolol or metoprolol, magnesium, a flash of light, a clonidine-ephedrine combination, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide all have been tested with variable efficacy. Ketamine has been administered by the IV, intramuscular (IM), transcutaneous, oral, nasal, and rectal routes and as a preservative-free solution epidurally or intrathecally. Most clinical use involves the IV and IM routes, by which the drug rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations. The dose depends on the desired therapeutic effect and on the route of administration. There is no pain on injection. Although etomidate provides stable hemodynamics and minimal respiratory depression, it is associated with several adverse effects when it is used for induction, including nausea and vomiting, pain on injection, myoclonic movement, and hiccups. Etomidate has been associated with PONV. More recently, etomidate in a lipid emulsion was associated with equal or an increased incidence of postoperative nausea compared with propofol. The lipid formulation of etomidate is associated with a much less frequent incidence of pain on injection, thrombophlebitis, and histamine release. Pain on injection may be reduced by injecting IV lidocaine, 20 to 40 mg immediately before injection of etomidate. Ref: Millers anesthesia 8th edition",C

All are true about cancrum oris except -,Associated with malnutrition and vitamin deficiency,Follows chronic infection,Involves jaw,Treatment is excision and skin grafting with tubed pedicle graft,"Answer is 'b' i.e. Follows chronic infection Cancrum oris (also k/a Noma and Gangrenous stomatitis) Cancrum oris is now rarely seen in developed countries, but is still not uncommon in many developing countries. It is a gangrenous process of the mouth, which stas suddenly, rapidly involve the adjacent tissues of the face, quickly becomes well demarcated, and then spreads no fuher. It most often affects one or both sides of the jaw, and occasionally the front of the face (mouth, lips, nose & chin). The gangrenous process may spread to destroy the bones of the face. This disease occurs primarily in severely malnourished child less than 5 yrs of age. Often they have had a preceeding illness such as measels, malaria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, malignancy or immunodeficiency, which has weakened the general health of the child. The exact cause is not known, but may be bacterial. Fusiformis & Borrelia are largely responsible, but the ds. is not contigious. Untreated cancrum oris is almost always quickly fatal, due to associated illness or a complication, such as septicemia or aspiration pneumonia. Management involves a) correction of general condition b) antibiotics (Penicillin + Metronidazole) c) Excision of the dead tissue d) Plastic surgery Coming to the question, the best choice is option 'b' i.e. follows chronic infection, as the ds. not always follows an infection.

"An 80-year-old man presents with slowly progressive enlargement of his head circumference, deformities of long bones and spine, and chronic pain of the affected skeletal segments. Laboratory studies show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and high urine hydroxyproline. X-ray findings are consistent with Paget disease. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenetic mechanism of this condition?",Generalized reduction in bone mass,Genetic deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II,Monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells,Paramyxovirus infection of osteoclasts,"Paget disease, also known as osteitis deformans, is a frequent bone condition affecting middle-aged to elderly persons. Usually polyostotic, it affects the axial skeleton, including the spine, pelvis, proximal femur, and head. Often, it presents with gradual enlargement of the head and chronic bone pain. Affected bone is thickened and coarse, with disorderly osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Paget himself proposed a viral hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this condition, but only recent immunologic and molecular techniques have allowed identification of paramyxoviruses (measles and respiratory syncytial virus) in osteoclasts of affected bones. In most cases, the diagnosis can be made by radiologic investigations. Generalized reduction in bone mass is the defining feature of osteoporosis. In its most common form, the condition affects elderly persons, especially women after menopause. It characteristically causes compression fractures of veebral bones or pathologic fractures of the femoral neck. Genetic deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II is one cause of the rare hereditary disorders collectively known as osteopetrosis, which are due to osteoclast dysfunction. This condition manifests in infancy or childhood with bone fragility and recurrent fractures. The bone has a stony hard consistency, but is brittle. Monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells is the underlying cause of multiple myeloma, the most frequent primary bone neoplasm. Multiple myeloma results in multifocal accumulation of neoplastic plasma cells in bones, manifesting with punched-out osteolytic lesions on x-ray films.

It is more potent and has longer onset time than atracurium. Metabolism is similar to atracurium. It releases less histamine than atracurium. Cisatracurium does not cause histamine release unlike atracurium. Cisatracurium produces laudanosine but is about five times lesser than that of atracurium. Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent. Cisatracurium undergoesHofmann Eliminationwhich is a spontaneous non-enzymatic organ-independent degradation. So its clearance is independent of renal function. Hence it is theagent of choice in renal failure patients.,C

Bochdalek hernia is related to -,Inguinal canal,Pleuroperitoneal canal,Femoral canal,Obturator foramen,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Pleuroperitoneal canal Bochdalek herniao Most Bochdalek hernia are on the left side (~80%) and may rarely be bilateral.o Compression of the lung results in pulmonary hypoplasia, involving both the lungs (ipsilateral > contralateral)o Pulmonary vasculature is also abnormal leading to pulmonary hypertension.o Thus the two main factors that affect morbidity and mortality are pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.o The most frequent clinical presentation of CDH is respiratory distress due to severe hypoxemia,o The anteroposterior diameter of the chest may be large along with a scaphoid abdomen,o The diagnosis of CDH can be made prenatally by ultrasound.o The postnatal diagnosis is relatively straightforward because a plain chest radiograph demonstrates the gastric air bubbles or loops of bowel within the chest. There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the side of the hernia.o Historically, the surgical repair of a CDH was considered to be a surgical emergency' because it was believed that the abdominal viscera within the chest prevented the ability to ventilate. More recently with the recognition of the role of pulmnary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia and the adverse effects of early operative repair on the pulmonary function has caused a policy of delayed repair.o Thus most pediatric surgeons wait for a variable period (24 to 72 hrs) to allow for stabilization of the infant before doing surgical repair.Congenital diaphragmatic herniao It is the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defecto The defect may be:Posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia)Retrosternal (Morgagni hernia)At the esophageal hiatus (hiatal hernia)Adjacent to the hiatus (paresophageal hernia)o Although all these defects are congenital, the term congenital diaphragmatic hernia is generally used for Bochdalek hernia.",B

The other etiologic factor most commonly associated with penile carcinoma is poor hygiene. Lichen sclerosus (also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans) may also be a risk factor. Symptoms Redness, irritation and a sore or a lump on the penis. Pathology Precancerous Dermatologic Lesions Carcinoma in Situ (Bowen Disease, Erythroplasia of Queyrat) Invasive Carcinoma of the Penis A Squamous cell carcinoma usually originating in the glans or foreskin is by far the most common type, occurring in 9 out of 10 cases. Staging The stages are assessed as follows: Stage I - Cancer has only affected the glans and/or foreskin. Stage II - Cancer has spread to the shaft of the penis. Stage III - Cancer has affected the penis and surrounding lymph nodes. Stage IV - Cancer has moved beyond the groin area to other pas of the body. Recurrent - Cancer that has returned after treatment. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery: Wide local excision - The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed Microsurgery - Surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible Laser surgery - laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells Circumcision - cancerous foreskin is removed Amputation (penectomy) - a paial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated lymph nodes. This is the most common and effective treatment. Radiation therapy is usually used adjuvantly with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. With earlier stages of penile cancer, a combination of topical chemotherapy and less invasive surgery may be used. More advanced stages of penile cancer usually require a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.",C

Horner's syndrome. All true exceptaEUR',Miosis,Anhydrosis,Hyperchromatic iris,Apparent exophthalmos,"Apparent exophthalmoses [Ref: Adams victor principles of neurology 8/e p. 2541 Horner's syndrome is a classic neurologic syndrome whose signs include: -- Miosis, - Ptosis, and - Anhidrosis Also called oculosympathetic paresis, a Horner's syndrome can be produced by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye, and neck. Neuroanatomy Horner's syndrome can result from a lesion anywhere along a three-neuron sympathetic (adrenergic) pathway that originates in the hypothalamus - The first-order neuron - Descends caudally from the hypothalamus to the first synapse, which is located in the cervical spinal cord (levels C8-12, also called ciliospinal center of Budge). - The second-order neuron - Travels .from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex. It then ascends to the superior cervical ganglion, located near the angle of the mandible and the bifurcation of the common carotid aery. - The third-order neuron - Then ascends within the adventitia of the internal carotid aery, through the cavernous sinus, where it is in close relation to the sixth cranial nerve. The oculosympathetic pathway then joins the ophthalmic (VI) division of the ,fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). In the orbit and the eye, the oculosympathetic fibers innervate the iris dilator muscle as well as Muller's muscle, a small smooth muscle in the eyelids responsible for a minor poion of the upper lid elevation and lower lid retraction. Clinical features The classic signs of a Horner's syndrome are: ? - PtosisQ - Miosise - A n hidrosisQ The degree of anisocoria is more marked in the dark than in light. - There is associated dilation lag, an asymeetry in papillary redilation between the two eyes when the light source is moved away .from the eye. - The homer's pupil will redilate more slowly (by 15 to 20 seconds) than the normal pupil. The ptosis is minor (less than 2 mm) and occurs as a result of paralysis of the Muller's muscle, which is innervated by the sympathetic pathway. The lower as well as the upper lid is affected producing the so-called ""upside-down ptosis"". Anhidrosis is present in central or preganglionic (first or second order) lesions. The sympathetic fibers responsible for facial sweating and vasolidation branch off at the superior cervical ganglion from the remainder of the oculosympathetic pathway; thus, anhidrosis is not a feature of postagangkonic or third-order lesions. This sign is .frequently not apparent to patients or clinicians. A congenital Horner's syndrome should be suspected when anisocoria is associated with heterochromia (unequal iris color, with the affected iris being lighter). - This occurs because formation of iris pigment in the first several months of age is under sympathetic control. This may only be apparent if the natural color is relatively dark. ETIOLOGY The etiology of Horner's syndrome in adults relates to the lesion location. First-order syndrome (central) Lesions of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem or cervicothoracic spinal cord can produce a first-order Homer's syndrome. Lateral medullary syndromes (M.C.) - Brainstem disease (stroke, tumour, demyelinating disorder) - Syringomyelia - Cervical cord trauma (including surgery) - Spinal cord tumour - Diabetic autonomic neuropathy - Multiple sclerosis Second-order syndrome (preganglionic) - Trauma or surgery involving spinal cord, thoracic outlet lung apex. - Pancoast tumour - Carotid and Aoic aneurysm and dissection - Lumbar epidural anaesthesia. Third-order syndrome (Postganglionic) - Lesions of internal carotid aery such as - Dissection, thrombosis - Otitis media - Cavernous sinus mass Surgery for raynaud's syndrome (cervical sympathectomy) may cause trauma to cervical spinal cord.",D

"For the pathologic sign ""Renal stones"" select the mediastinal tumor with which it is most likely to be associated (SELECT 1 TUMOR)",Thymoma,Hodgkin's disease,Neuroblastoma,Parathyroid adenoma,"Neuroblastoma, a highly malignant tumor of children, occurs along the distribution of the sympathetic nervous system. It is derived from ganglion cell precursors and thus usually causes an increased excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. Because of its propensity to metastasize to bone and its histological resemblance to Ewing's sarcoma, its association with elevated catecholamine levels is a major factor in differential diagnosis.Renal stones occur in about half the cases of hyperparathyroidism. Other disorders sometimes associated with hyperparathyroidism include peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and bone disease; central nervous system symptoms may also arise in connection with hyperparathyroidism. Occasionally, parathyroid adenomas occur in conjunction with neoplasms of other endocrine organs, a condition known as multiple endocrine adenomatosis.Cystic teratomas, or dermoid cysts, include endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal elements. They are characteristically cystic and contain poorly pigmented hair, sebaceous material, and occasionally teeth. Dermoid cysts occur in the gonads and central nervous system, as well as in the mediastinum. With rare exceptions, these lesions are benign.Thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis, agammaglobulinemia, and red blood cell aplasia. These tumors are typically cystic and occur in the anterior mediastinum. Most thymic lesions associated with myasthenia gravis are hyperplastic rather than neoplastic.Persons afflicted with Hodgkin's disease have impaired cell-mediated immunity and are particularly susceptible to mycotic infections and tuberculosis. The severity of the immune deficiency correlates with the extent of the disease. The nodular sclerosing variant of primary mediastinal Hodgkin's disease is the most common type.",D

"Sho acting anesthetic agent used for day care surgery is: September 2005, 2010",Diazepam,Ketamine,Propofol,Sevoflurane,"Ans.: C: Propofol Propofol is a sho-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent. Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and ""clear"" when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia.

Class ID wounds are similar except that a prosthetic device 9e.g. , mesh or valve) is inseed. Clean/ contaminated wounds (class II) includes those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary, or genitourinary tract with indigenous bacterial flora is opened under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. Contaminated wounds (class III) include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with the extensive introduction of the bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major break in the sterile techniques (e.g. Open cardiac massage), gross spillage of the viscus contents such as from the intestine, or incisio through inflamed, albeit nonpurulent, tissue. Diy wounds (Class IV) include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occured and in which the necrotic tissue is present, those created in the presence of ove infection as evidenced by the presence of purulent material, and those created to access a perforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. The microbiology of SSIs (surgical site infections) is reflective of the initial host microflora such that SSIs following creation of class I wound are invariable, due solely to skin microbes found on that poion of te body, while SSIs subsequent to a class II wound created for the purpose of elective colon resection may be caused by either skin microbes or colonic microflora, or both.

The following is a marker of Paget's disease of the mammary gland,S-100,HMB 45,CEA,Neuron specific enolase,"Ans is 'c' ie CEA Paget's ds is a chronic eczematous disease on the skin of the nipple and the areola , with an associated intraductal carcinoma of the underlying mammary gland. Pathophysiology: The pathogenesis of mammary PD and the origin of Paget cells were once controversial. It is now widely accepted as an underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium. Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. Paget cells often express cell markers that mimic those of the underlying breast carcinoma, including glandular epithelial cell markers (ie, low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, or CAM 5.2). They also express tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (TP53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast.",C

Ayer's T Piece is:,Mapelson A circuit,Mapelson B circuit,Mapelson D circuit,Mapelson E circuit,"Ans. D. Mapleson E. (Ref. Paul's Clinical Anesthesia/Pg. 671)The Mapleson E is a modification of Ayre's T-piece, which was developed in 1937 by Phillip Avre for use in paediatric patients undergoing cleft palate repair or intracranial surgery.ConstructionA three-way T-tube whose limbs are connected to (F) the fresh gas supply from the anaesthesia machine, (R) a length of corrugated reservoir tube and (P) the patient connector. It has minimal dead space, no valves and minimal resistance.Function:Inspiration - The patient inspires fresh gas from the reservoir tube.Expiration - The patient expires into the reservoir tube. Although fresh gas is still flowing into the system at this time, it is wasted, as it is contaminated by expired gas. An expiratory limb volume greater than the patient's tidal volume prevents entrainment of room air (which would dilute anaesthetic gases and oxygen).Expiratory pause - Fresh gas washes the expired gas out of the reservoir tube, filling it with fresh gas for the next inspiration.A fresh gas flow greater than three times the minute ventilation prevents rebreathing.Spontaneous ventilationThe fresh gas and exhaled gas flow down the expiratory limb. Peak expiratory flow occurs early in exhalation. Thus, the proportion of fresh gas added to the exhaled gases increases. During the next breath, fresh gas is drawn from the fresh gas inlet and the expiratory limb.The original analysis of the Mapleson E system suggested that a gas flow rate of 2.5 to 3 times the minute volume was required to prevent rebreathing of expired gas. However, this assumed a square-wave respiratory pattern, and investigations using a more realistic breathing pattern have suggested that 1.5-2 times the minute volume is acceptable in spontaneously breathing patients:Body weight (kg)Fresh gas flow (L/min)51.4-1.8102.4-3.2204.1-5.4407.2-9.6Controlled ventilationIn contrast to Mapleson A systems, Mapleson D and E circuits are more efficient during controlled than spontaneous ventilation. This is because the tidal volume must be supplied during the expiratory pause. With the almost sinusoidal respiratory pattern of spontaneous respiration, there is relatively little time for this volume to be supplied, so the fresh gas flow rate must be high. The pattern of controlled ventilation, however, is usually one of a rapid inspiration, expiration and a relatively prolonged expiratory pause. This long expiratory pause gives ample time for the tidal volume requirement to be supplied, even with a fairly low fresh gas flow rate. Consequently, during controlled ventilation, the recommended fresh gas flow rate is similar to that of the Mapleson A systems during spontaneous ventilation.Intermittent positive pressure ventilation may be performed by intermittently occluding the end of the reservoir tube.",D

A 25 year old male with roadside accident underwent debridement and reduction of fractured both bones right forearm under axillary block.On the second postoperative day the patient complained of persistent numbness and paresthesia in the right forearm and the hand. The commonest cause of this neurological dysfunction could be all of the following except :,Crush injury to the hand and lacerated nerves,A tight cast or dressing,Systemic toxicity of local anaesthetics,Tourniquet pressure,"C i.e. Systemic toxicity of Local AnaestheticsSystemic toxicity of LA include - CNS toxicity, cardiovascular system, methemoglobinemia & Allergies.CNS is paicularly vulnerable to toxicity & is the site of premonitory signs of overdose in awake patients. Coical inhibitory pathways are most susceptible resulting in excitatory motor phenomenon in initial stages of LA toxicity.Hypercapnia, respiratory & metabolic acidosis exacerbates CNS toxicityQ. Increased PaCO2 increases cerebral blood flow delivering greater dose of LA more rapidly to brain.

The initial treatment for this patient should be","10% calcium gluconate, 10 mL","Digoxin, 0.25 mg every 3 h for three doses",Oral Kayexalate,"Lidocaine, 100 mg","The electrocardiogram exhibited in the question demonstrates changes that are essentially diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. Correct treatment for the affected patient includes administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the neuromuscular effect of potassium) and administration of sodium ions (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium- potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would not only be ineffective but contraindicated since they would further depress the myocardial conduction system.",A

Auxiliary ohotopic liver transplant is indicated for:,etabolic liver disease,As a standby procedure until finding a suitable donor,Drug induced hepatic failure,Acute fulminant liver failure for any cause,"Acute fulminant liver failure for any cause Following arc the types of liver transplantation: Cadaver donor transplantation: The donor liver is obtained from a person who is diagnosed as brain dead whose family volunteers to donate the organ for transplantation. Living donor transplant: A healthy family member or a volunteer donates pa of his liver for transplantation. Ohotropic liver transplant: it involves the replacement of the patient's diseased liver with the donor's liver. Auxiliary liver transplant Auxiliary transplantation (A-OLTX): Here the patient's liver is not removed. Pa of the liver of a healthy adult donor (living or cadaver) is transplanted into the recipient, alongside pa of the patient's own liver. Auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation is theoretically attractive because it leaves the recipient's liver in place. The surgical trauma of hepatectomy is avoided, and failure of the graft does not necessarily lead to the death of the patient or a second, emergency transplantation. Another advantage is that matching the body sizes of the donor and the recipient is not mandatory, which increases the number of possible donors The following aicle-""Auxiliary Paial Ohotopic Living Donor Liver Transplantation: Kyoto University Experience"" (at the .following website latp://www.inedscape.combiewaicle/500102) mentions four indications for auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation: reversible fulminant hepatic failure non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease snzall-for-size grafts for ABO-incompatibility Fultninant hepatic failure: Total ohotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) is a lifesaving therapeutic option for patients with FI-1F, but requires lifelong immunosuppression to maintain the graft. Auxiliary paial ohotopic liver transplantation whereby only a poion of the native liver is removed, and the remainder of the native liver is left in situ, provides temporary suppo until the native liver recovers and then immunosuppression can be withdrawn. The advantage claimed for APOLT in non-cirrhotic metabolic liver disease (most commonly Crigler-Najjar syndrome) is that it can compensate for enzyme deficiencies without complete removal of the native liver, which may have to aid the recipient in case of potential graft failure. The remaining native liver could benefit in the future from potential success in gene treatment Transplants of ABO-incompatible grafts are often unavoidable due to the limited number of potential donor candidates. A high incidence of early graft failure with a high rate of binary and vascular complications in ABOincompatible liver transplantation was repoed. The remnant native liver could sustain a patient's life if the anticipated graft failure occurred in an ABO-incompatible case. The rationale of APOLT for a small-for-size graft is that the remnant native liver is expected to suppo the function of the implanted graft during the early post-operative period. The graft liver expands its function in propoion to volume growth. After the graft liver has grown sufficiently, it can be expected to meet the hepatic functional demands of the recipient. The following aicle ""Auxiliary paial liver transplantation for end-stage chronic liver disease"" in The New England Journal of Medicine Volume 319:1507-1511December 8, 1988Nutnber 23 (at the following website gi/content/abstract/319/23/1507) mentions another indication for A-OLTX - End-stage chronic liver disease who are high-risk patients. These patients are not accepted for ohotopic liver transplantation because of massive ascites, deficient clotting function, cachexia, or poor pulmonary reserve. So we see that all the options except 'b' are indications for A-OLTX We have chosen acute liver ds. as the answer as it's the probably the most common indication as evident by maximum number of aicles on the net describing A-OLTX for acute liver failure. This book -""Atlas of Upper Gastrointestinal and Hepato-Pancrato-Biliary surgery- publisher: Springer Berlin Heidelberg "" mentions only acute liver failure as an indication for A-OLTX.",D

Open biopsy is especially indicated when the patients history and physical findings suggest malignancy i.e solitary, hard, nontender cervical node in an older patient who is a chronic user of tobacco, supraclavicular adenopathy and in solitary or generalized adenopathy that is firm and mobile suggestive of lymphoma. Fine-needle aspiration should be reserved for thyroid nodules and for confirmation of relapse in patients whose primary diagnosis is known.

Metacarpophalangeal joints are most commonly affected in: March 2005,Osteoahritis,Psoriatic ahritis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Rheumatic fever,"Ans. C: Rheumatoid Ahritis RA is characterized by diffuse cailage loss and erosion of bone and cailage. It stas in the synol membrane, with the initial processes of edema, neovascularization, and hyperplasia of the synol lining. Proliferation of synoviocytes and macrophages causes thickening of the synol lining and, together with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells, develops into pannus. Pannus is a sheet of invasive cellular tissue that is continuous with the synol lining. As a result of the higher propoion of synoviocytes and macrophages, pannus causes erosion of bone and cailage at the margin of joints. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints are most frequently involved. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved only in the presence of a coexisting MCP or PIP disease. Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons causes a reduction in finger flexion and grip strength. Nodular thickening in the tendon sheath may also produce a trigger finger. In osteoahritis and psoriatic ahritis, DIP is commonly involved.",C

Which of the following is seen in multiple myeloma: March 2007,Raised serum calcium,Decreased serum calcium,Normal serum calcium,None of the above,"Ans: A: Raised Serum Calcium Multiple myeloma/ MM/ myeloma/ plasma cell myeloma/Kahler's disease is a type of cancer of plasma cells which are immune system cells in bone marrow that produce antibodies. The peak age of onset of multiple myeloma is 65 to 70 years of age. Multiple myeloma affects slightly more men than women. A mnemonic sometimes used to remember the common tetrad of multiple myeloma is CRAB ? C = Calcium (elevated), R = Renal failure, A = Anemia, B = Bone lesions. Myeloma bone pain usually involves the spine and ribs, and worsens with activity. Myeloma bone disease is due to proliferation of tumor cells and release of IL-6, which stimulates osteoclasts to break down bone. The breakdown of bone also leads to release of calcium into the blood, leading to hypercalcemia and its associated symptoms. These bone lesions are lytic in nature and are best seen in plain radiographs, which may show ""punched-out"" resorptive lesions. The anemia found in myeloma is usually normocytic and normochromic. The presence of unexplained anemia, kidney dysfunction, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a high serum protein (especially raised immunoglobulin) should raise the suspicion. Protein electrophoresis of the blood and urine may show the presence of a paraprotein (monoclonal protein, or M protein) band, with or without reduction of the other (normal) immunoglobulins (known as immune paresis). One type of paraprotein is the Bence Jones protein which is a urinary paraprotein composed of free light chains. Multiple myeloma can produce all classes of immunoglobulin, but IgG paraproteins are most common, followed by IgA and IgM. IgD and IgE myeloma are very rare. Myeloma activity sometimes appear as ""lytic lesions"" (with local disappearance of normal bone due to resorption), and on the skull X-ray as ""punched-out lesions"" (pepper pot skull).",A

Bishop-Koop operation done for,Meconium ileus,Hirhsprung's disease,Duodenal atresia,Meckel's diveiculum,".Meconium ileus is neonatal manifestation of fibrocystic disease of the pancreas wherein thick meconium, which is viscid and paste like, gets collected in the terminal ileum. Because of inspissation it forms a firm bolus leading to obstruction of the ileum. Neonates present with features of ileal obstruction as well as respiratory dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and high salt in the sweat (Na+ and Cl- more than 90 mmol/L).When patient's condition is critical with obstruction, Bishop-Koop operation is done. Proximal dilated segment is resected and resected end is anastomosed to side of the distal collapsed ileum. End of the distal ileum is brought out as ileostomy. Through the ileostomy gastrografin or acetyl cystine wash is given regularly to dissolve meco- nium pellets. This ileostomy can be kept for long time. Continuity is maintained at later period.Reference : page 927-28 SRB's manual of surgery 5th edition",A
"Micronodular cirrhosis is commonly seen in all except,",Chronic hepatitis B,Alcoholic liver disease,Hemochromatosis,Chronic extrahepatic biliary obstruction,"Chronic hepatitis B [Ref Robbin 7Th/e p. 8991 Cirrhosis of the liver is a pathological entity which clinically represents the end stage of chronic liver disease. It is characterized by three features. i) Bridging fibrous septa& in the form of delicate bands or broad scars linking poal tracts with one another and poal tracts with terminal hepatic veins. ii) Parenchymal nodulesQ containing proliferating hepatocytes encircled by fibrosis with diameters varying from very small to large. Cirrhosis is defined as micronodular or macronodular depending upon the size of parenchymal nodules Micronodular cirrhosisu - Parenchymal nodules < 3 mm in size Macronodular cirrhosisQ - Parenchymal nodules > 3 mm in size Viral hepatitis commonly causes macronodular cirrhosisdeg. In viral hepatitis the cirrhosis is characterized by irregularly large sized nodules separated by variable but mostly broad scars. This pattern of cirrhosis is historically called posnecrotic cirrhosise. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is not only applied to viral hepatitis but to all forms of cirrhosis in which the liver shows large irregular sized ntacronodules with broad scars regardless of the etiology. Also remember these Alcholic cirrhosis is typically micronodularQ, but can become macronodulare in later stages. Viral cirrhosis is typically macronodularQ. Cirrhosis associated with virus is called postnecrotic cirrhosis. Postnecrotic cirrhosis is also called posthepatitis cirrhosis macronodular cirrhosis and coarsely nodular cirrhosis. Cirrhosis in hemochromatosis is typically micronodularQ (can be macronodular sometimes). Wilson's disease causes macronodularQ cirrhosis.

Gold standard investigation for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumor is:,MRI,MIBG,USG,PET CT,"Ans is d i.e. PET CT Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) comprise a group of smooth muscle mesenchymal alimentary tract tumours of variable malignancy. The management of malignant GISTs has been revolutionised by the development of Imatinib (ST-571) which is, uniquely, a specific, highly effective, chemotherapeutic agent that targets a specific abnormal intracellular signalling molecule. The effective management of patients with these tumours requires regular imaging assessment for which CT has conventionally been the method of choice. Whilst CT remains most valuable in the initial diagnosis and staging of GISTs, it is now clear that PET imaging, preferably combined with CT, will become the gold standard method for assessment of response by viue of its unique dynamic functional characteristic which, when combined with CT, provides a more accurate assessment and prediction of the quality of response.",D

"Drug of choice for sedation of a patient in ICU is: September 2009, March 2013 (a)",Diazepam,Lorazepam,Propofol,Alprazolam,"Ans. C: Propofol Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, are widely used as sedative agents in the ICU. Diazepam use has become less common as newer shoer-acting benzodiazepines have become available. Lorazepam is more potent than midazolam and, because of its low lipid solubility, crosses the blood-brain barrier more slowly, delaying its onset of action and prolonging the sedative effect. Hence, it is recommended for longer-term sedation while midazolam is preferred for sho-term sedation Propofol, another frequently used sedative agent, resembles midazolam in terms of pharmacological profile. Midazolam and propofol have similar efficacy and safety in sedating various groups of critically ill patients. Midazolam is, however, cheaper than propofol Neveheless, propofol, when used as a sedative in mechanically ventilated patients, is associated with shoer weaning times and hence, while midazolam may be cheaper, the overall cost-benefit analysis taking into account duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay may in fact be better with propofol.",C

So if the diagnosis of the patient with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding cannot be confirmed endoscopically the patient should be given any gastric acid inhibitor (either H2 blocker or P.P.I.). This is also justified as 80% of bleeding is from non-variceal source (peptic ulcers, gastritis, esophagitis) In the question the clinical features of the patient indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to peptic ulcer. Variceal bleeding due to poal hypeension is very unlikely in the absence of moderate or massive splenomegaly (presence of mild splenomegaly is not enough evidence for variceal bleeding). So the most appropriate therapy in this case is pantoprozole whether you give it empirically or as a therapy for most likely clinical diagnosis Also know, In case of variceal bleeding somatostatin is more effective than vasopressin in control of bleeding.",C
"Regarding urinary bladder, stone one is Not true -",Common in Paediatric pt in tropics than that of non tropical areas,Uric acid stones are dropped from above,Jack stone is due to urea splitting bacteria,Commonly distal passage obstruction cause stone,"It is the oxalate stones that are usually dropped from above (i.e. formed in the kidney and dropped in the bladder through ureter). Uric acid stones are mostly formed within the bladder.
In general most of the bladder calculi are formed within the bladder itself Only some stones are formed in the kidney and pass into the bladder, where they grow by additional deposition of crystals.

Etiology for Bladder calculi 

Bladder outlet obstruction is the most common cause of vesical calculi in adults. Other causes are
neurogenic bladder leading to urinary stasis
a foreign body eg. Foley catheter and forgotten DJ stent, which serve as nidi for stones.
bladder diverticula
Bladder stones are commonly seen in older men (>50 yrs.) usually because of bladder outlet obstruction
In the Western world bladder stones are rare in pediatric population but bladder stones are endemic in children in underdeveloped nations (in North Africa, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia i.e. found near the tropics). This is because of low-protein, high carbohydrate diet and chronic dehydration. These are usually ammonium urate stones.
Common vesical stones are
Uric acid stones &
Struvite stones
Other less common stone types are
Oxalate stones
Cystine stones
Struvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones.
Struvite stones are composed of ammonium, magnesium and calcium phosphates and occurs in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, eg. Proteus.
Bladder stones are usually solitary but may also be multiple.",B

Usually sheep or goat intestines are used, but it is occasionally made from the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, ordonkeys.ManufactureCatgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants (cattle,sheep, goats) or from beef tendon2 The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with ethylene oxide gas & is of straw-coloredAlthough the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose.It is a type of surgical suture that is naturally degraded by the body's own proteolytic enzymes. Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly-healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.Catgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, anemia, and malnutrition. It also absorbed faster when used in the mouthand in the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms.Catgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as Vicryl and polvdioxanone. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries.In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.VariantsChromic catgut suture is a variant treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch- bolding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full tensile strength is extended to 18-21 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.Fast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.",B

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is used for,Breast carcinoma,Penile cacinoma,Retroperitoneal sarcoma,Hepatic carcinoma,"Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Biopsy

For breast cancer, sentinel lymph node is the largest lymph node in the axilla and is the first to receive the lymph and potential metastases drained from the breast.

Intraoperative lymphatic mapping and biopsy of the sentinel lymph node initially introduced for the staging of melanoma has been similarly used for the detection of axillary metastases in breast cancer, where it has also become the accepted standard of care.

In both the cases the method provides for minimally invasive surgery, and its success is now stimulating attempts to introduce it in the staging of the thyroid, gastric, colonic, lung and endometrial cancers.
In breast cancer surgery this technique avoids significant morbidity of axillary dissection and inexperienced hands has proven to provide acceptable rates of metastatic identification",A

Dislocation without fracture is seen in:,Sacral spine,Lumbar spine,Cervical spine,Thoracic,"C i.e. Cervical spine The craniocervical junction refers to the structures that extend from the skull base to C2, and is comprised of occipital condyles, Cl and C2. It has high vulnerability to injury because of large lever arm induced rostrally by cranium and the relative freedom of movement of craniocervical junction which relies dispropoionately on ligamentous structures rather than on intrinsic bony stability. The upper five cervical spine rely primarily on intact ligamentous system for stabilityQ. This unique anatomical feature allows for substantial poion of neck movements. The alar ligaments (key structure), tectorial membrane (is rostral extension of posterior longitudinal ligament) serve as impoant stabilizer of craniocervical junction, as do, to a lesser extent the joint capsules of respective aiculations, anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The primary stabilizing ligament of atlanto axial motion is the cruciate ligament complex which contains transverse atlantal ligament (TAL).

The incidence is 1--2% in full-term infants and up to 30% in premature babies. Operation is indicated after 1 year. Prior to age one, the testis may continue to descend into the scrotum. The cause is unknown. Undescended testes fail in spermatogenic function, but may continue to secrete androgens. Spermatogenic failure is progressive; therefore, surgical exploration and scrotal placement of the testis should be performed before 2-years of age. If placement of the testicle into the scrotum is not possible, then orchiectomy is indicated because of the high risk of testicular cancer when the testis is left in an intraabdominal position.The incidence of testicular cancer in an abdominal testis is 30 times higher than the normal population.

Its use has been recommended for patients with sho life expectancy or in salvage cases. It is contraindicated in infection eg TB, osteomyelitis, discitis etcQ. Veebroplasty & Kyphoplasty Veebroplasty is percutaneous placement of large spinal needles into the fractured / compressed veebral body through a channel made in the pedicle and injecting bone cement into th fractured bone. It requires high pressure injection b/o structure of the trabeculae and the high viscosity of the bone cement as it hardens. Veebroplasty was designed to decrease pain and strengthen the bone to prevent fuher collapse of a wedge compression fracture (that result from failure of anterior column by forward flexion forces). It does not restore veebral body height or prevent spinal deformity. Balloon Kyphoplasty is the next step in treatment of veebral compression fractures. This percutaneous minimally invasive procedure involves reduction & fixation performed through small instruments inseed into the veebral body through the pedicle. A small balloon is inflated to restore the height of collapsed veebral body and create a cavity inside. The balloon is deflated & withdrawn, and the remaining cavity is filled under low pressur with the surgeon's choice of material. This procedure restores veebral height & spinal alignment , which is impoant in preventing long term morbidity & moality that ariss from veebral compression fractures & spinal deformity (d/ t cardio-respiatory compromise) . It stabilities veebrae internally, facilitates pain relief and restores function rapidly. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is controlled injected in paste like consistency with fluoroscopic monitoring. 5g of barium sulfate and 2g of tungeston powder is mixed with each kit of PMMA cement to make it radiopaque enough to be visualized adqquately. Potential complications include extrusion of cement into the spinal canal, resulting in neurological compromise, infection, hematoma, pulmonary embolus, failure to relieve pain, and incomplete deformity correction. Pulmonary embolism was correlated with paraveebral venous cement leak, but not with the number of veebral bodies treated or the type of procedure (vetebroplasty or kyphoplasty).

Management

In the majority (-90% of patients the bleeding stops spontaneously and only supportive therapy is required.

Persistent bleeding is managed by
Endoscopic electrocoagulation

if fails

Angiographic techniques (embolization)

if fails
Surgery: Laparotomy with high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear.

It is important to rule out the diagnosis of variceal bleeding in cases of failed endoscopic therapy by a thorough examination of the GE junction. Recurrent bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear is uncommon.

True regarding Papillary carcinoma of thyroid is:March 2008,Undifferentiated carcinoma,Blood-borne metastasis is commoner,Excellent prognosis,Capsulated,"Ans. C: Excellent prognosisPapillary carcinoma is a relatively common well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, papillary carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, these tumors may spread easily to other organs. Papillary tumors have a propensity to invade lymphatics but are less likely to invade blood vessels.Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass in a normal thyroid parenchyma. They are very seldom encapsulatedThyroid cancers are more often found in patients with a history of low- or high-dose external irradiation. Papillary tumors of the thyroid are the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation.The life expectancy of patients with this cancer is related to their age. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years of patients with papillary cancers, about 11% present with metastases outside the neck and mediastinum.FNAB is considered the best first-line diagnostic procedure for a thyroid nodule; FNAB is a safe and minimally invasive procedure.Surgery is the definitive management of thyroid cancer, and various types of operations may be performed.Lobectomy with isthmectomySubtotal thyroidectomyThis is a near-total thyroidectomyPatients younger than 40 years who have papillary thyroid carcinoma nodules that are smaller than 1 cm, well-defined, minimally invasive, and isolated may be treated with hemithyroidectomy and isthmectomyTotal thyroidectomyPerform a total thyroidectomy (removal of all thyroid tissue but preserving the contralateral parathyroid glands) in patients who are older than 40 years with papillary carcinoma and in any patient with bilateral disease Compared with most cancers the prognosis in differentiated thyroid carcinoma is excellent.",C

Bird beak appearance on Ba swallow is diagnostic of-,Ca esophagus,Achalasia,Diffuse esophageal spasm,TOF,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Achalasia Achalasiao Achalasia cardia is a motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with surallowing, & the esophageal body undergoes nonperistaltic contractions. (Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced).o The pathogenesis of Achalasia is poorly understood. It involves :Neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach's myentric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophageal vagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus).Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The clolinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease.o As a result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary' peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findingso Both sexes are equally affected (Ref: Maingots 10/e, p 846)o May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.o Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.o Regurgitation and Pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.o Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.o Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propuloine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.Diagnosiso Chest x-ray - shows absence of gastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.o Barium swallow - shows dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'bird's beakr appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower two thirds of esophagus,o Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achlasia eg. carcinoma, stricture at LES.o ManometryIt's the most confrmatory> investigationIt is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophagusManometric characteristics of Achalasiao Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (< 75% relaxation)o Elevated LES pressureo Loss ofprimary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present,o Increased intraesophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline,o Cholecystokinin (CCK) which normally causes a fall in the sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of the LES (the CCK test). This paradoxical response occurs because, in achlasia the neurally transmitted inhibitory effect of CCK is absent owing to the loss of inhibitory neurons.Also know""Although complete absence of peristalsis in the esophageal body has been proposed as the major abnormality,present evidence indicates achalasia is a primary disorder of the LES Schwartzo The LES fails to relax on deglutition, - elevation of intraluminal esophageal pressure - esophageal dilatation - subsequent loss of primary peristalsis in the body of esophagus,o Other options are described ahead.",B

Many professional organization recommend that all pregnant women be routinely counseled about HIV infection and be encouraged to be tested. What is the most impoant reason for early identification of HIV infection in pregnant women?,A cesarean section can be planned to reduced HIV transmission to the newborn.,Breast feeding can be discouraged to reduce transmission to the new born,Early identification of a new born at risk of HIV infection will improve survival,Zidovudine therapy can be offered to reduce the chance of transmission of HIV to the newborn,"A randomized placebo controlled trial (ACTG 076) demonstrated that zidovudine (ZDV) given at the beginning of the second trimester, during labor and delivery, and to the newborn for 6 weeks significantly reduced the transmission of HIV to the newborn from 25.5 percent in the control group to 8.3 percent in the treatment group. Thus, ZDV can be highly effective for primary prevention in the newborn. Although a cesarean section has been shown to reduce veical transmission, it is less effective than ZDV and is not a routinely recommended procedure for HIV-infected pregnant women. HIV can be transmitted by breast feeding, and in some studies, the risk is increased by 14 percent. However, breast feeding has no impact on the highest risk of transmission, which occurs during gestation, labor, and delivery. Early identification of newborns at risk of HIV infection will guide the medical management and improve outcomes. It has no impact on the primary prevention of the infection to the newborn. Finally, all HIV-infected women should be made aware of the benefit of ZDV so they can make informed choices.",D

So if it is used while performing TURP, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper.o You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too.o Distilled wrater can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity' as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.)o There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP.True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not commonDistilled water is being replaced by 1[?]5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available)o Do not get confused by what is Written in -Bailey 24th/ep. 1377, 1378 (23/e, pi245, 1246)If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i.e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",B

Minimum score in Glassgow Coma Scale: March 2007,0,1,2,3,"Ans. D: 3 The Glasgow Coma Scale or GCS, also known as the Glasgow Coma Score is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable, objective way of recording the conscious state of a person, for initial as well as continuing assessment. The scale comprises three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The three values separately as well as their sum are considered. The lowest possible GCS is 3 (deep coma or death), while the highest is 15 (fully awake person). Best eye response (E) There are 4 grades staing with the most severe: No eye opening - Eye opening in response to pain. (Patient responds to pressure on the patient's fingernail bed; if this does not elicit a response, supraorbital and sternal pressure or rub may be used.) - Eye opening to speech. (Not to be confused with an awaking of a sleeping person; such patients receive a score of 4, not 3.) - Eyes opening spontaneously Best verbal response (V) There are 5 grades staing with the most severe: - No verbal response - Incomprehensible sounds. (Moaning but no words.) - Inappropriate words. (Random or exclamatory aiculated speech, but no conversational exchange) - Confused. (The patient responds to questions coherently but there is some disorientation and confusion.) Oriented. (Patient responds coherently and appropriately to questions such as the patient's name and age, where they are and why, the year, month, etc.) Best motor response (M) There are 6 grades staing with the most severe: - No motor response - Extension to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, extension of wrist, decerebrate response) - Abnormal flexion to pain (adduction of arm, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm, flexion of wrist, decoicate response) - Flexion/ Withdrawal to pain (flexion of elbow, supination of forearm, flexion of wrist when supra-orbital pressure applied ; pulls pa of body away when nailbed pinched) - Localizes to pain. (Purposeful movements towards painful stimuli; e.g., hand crosses mid-line and gets above clavicle when supra-orbital pressure applied.) Obeys commands. (The patient does simple things as asked.)

The best treatment for the following skin lesion is,Radio therapy,Chemotherapy,Surgery,Immunotherapy,"This is a case of basal cell carcinoma of skin. The most frequently occurring form of skin cancer BCCs are abnormal, uncontrolled growths or lesions that arise in the skin's basal cells, which line the deepest layer of the epidermis (the outermost layer of the skin). BCCs often look like open sores, red patches, pink growths, shiny bumps, or scars. Usually caused by a combination of cumulative UV exposure and intense, occasional UV exposure, BCC can be highly disfiguring if allowed to grow, but almost never spreads (metastasizes) beyond the original tumor site.",C

Most impoant prognostic factor for breast carcinoma is: March 2005,Age of the patient,Lymph node involvement,Genetic factors,Family history,"Ans. B: Lymph node involvement Prognostic factors include staging, (i.e., tumor size, location, grade, whether disease has traveled to other pas of the body), recurrence of the disease, and age of patient. The best indicators of likely prognosis in breast cancer remain tumour size and lymph node status, which are components of stage of a tumour. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the worse is the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10yr disease free survival.",B
A well differentiated follicular carcinoma of thyroid can be best differentiated from a follicular adenoma by:,Hurthle cell change,Lining of tall columnar and cuboidal cells,Vascular invasion,Nuclear features,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Vascular Invasion Repeat All India 09Differentiation between follicular carcinoma and follicular adenoma is dependent on histological criteria of capsular and vascular invasion.This invasion cannot be determined with the preoperative use of FNA cytology. It requires histological analysis. Robbins writes- ""While nuclear features are helpful in distinguishing papillary from follicular neoplasms, they are of little value in distinguishing follicular adenomas from minimally invasive follicular carcinomas. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. The criterion for vascular invasion is applicable only to capsular vessels and vascular spaces beyond the capsule; the presence of tumor plugs within intra-tumoral blood vessels has little prognostic significance.

A 30 year old woman with coarctation of aorta is admitted to the labour room for elective caesarean section. Which of the following is the anaesthesia technique of choice -,Spinal anaesthesia,Epidural anaesthesia,General anaesthesia,Local anaesthesia with nerve blocks,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., General anaesthesia In coarctation of Aorta, Aorta narrows anywhere along its course.The most common site for coarctation of Aorta isJust distal to origin of left subclavian arteryNear the insertion of ligamentum arteriosusSo, the common clinical presentation in coarctation of Aorta isHypotension, ischemia, distal to the obstruction, (circulation is usually diminished in abdominal organs and pulses are absent in lower extremities)Hypertension proximal to the site of obstruction (the B.P. in upper extremities and head and neck is increased)Effect of coarctation of Aorta on Pregnancy.Coarctation of Aorta may lead to compromise of placental circulation, because the placental circulation is derived from uterine artery, which is a branch of internal iliac artery (all the vessels originating distal to coarctation will have diminished perfusion)So, the fetal circulation is in a compromised state in coarctation of Aorta.Anaesthetic considerations that should be taken into account in case of coarctation of Aorta.In coarctation of Aorta, am decrease in cardiac output or cardiac return is deleterious to the fetus because the placental circulation is already compromised on account of coarctation.So any anaesthetic procedure or drug which causes hypotension should be avoided in these patients.Regional anaesthetic procedures such as spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia should be avoided in these patients because hypotension is the most common side effect of these procedures. The consequence of decreased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of these procedures would be hazardous to the patientGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred technique for performing ceasarean section in a patient with coarctation of Aorta as it has the advantage ofmore rapid inductionless hypotensionbetter airway and ventilation.Here are the quoted lines from an internet site further supporting our answerUncorrected coarctation is rare in pregnancy but when present tends to be exacerbated by normal physiologic changes with fixed aortic outflow obstruction and distal hypoperfusion. These patients are at increased risk of left ventricular failure, aortic dissection and rupture, endocarditis and cerebrovascular accident. Anesthetic goals should center on maintaining normal to slightly elevated SVR and heart rate and adequate preload. Regional anesthesia is relatively contraindicated. General anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean section with invasive hemodynamic monitoring with post ductal intraarterial catheter, CVP or PA catheters to guide fluid administration and to assess left ventricular function and use of ephedrine and dopamine as vasopressors of choice.",C

Which of the following local anaesthetic is a strong vasoconstrictor?,Procaine,Cocaine,Lignocaine,All of the above,"Cocaine inhibits the neuronal membrane transpoers for catecholamines, thereby potentiating the effect of NE at adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and reduced cocaine absorption in vascular beds where adrenergic effects predominate. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine also cause vasoconstriction. Cocaine is used only in the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, throat, and ear, where it uniquely produces vasoconstriction as well as anesthesia. The shrinking of mucous membranes decreases operative bleeding while improving surgical visualization. Comparable vasoconstriction can be achieved with other local anesthetics by the addition of a low concentration of a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine (0.005%). Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K.

B: Calcium Calcium is contraindicated in CPR Despite the fact that extracellular calcium enhances the contractile force of cardiac muscle, there is no evidence to indicate that calcium administration during CPR improves cardiac performance. In fact ischemia promotes intracellular calcium accumulation, leading to membrane disruption and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment at this time?",Complete the procedure but pretreat with dantrolene prior to future elective surgery.,Administer inhalational anesthetic agents.,Administer succinylcholine,Hyperventilate with 100% O2 .,"The cause of malignant hypehermia is unknown, but it is associated with inhalational anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. It may develop in an otherwise healthy person who has tolerated previous surgery without incident. It should be suspected in the presence of a history of unexplained fever, muscle or connective tissue disorder, or a positive family history (evidence suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern). In addition to fever during anesthesia, the syndrome includes tachycardia, increased O2 consumption, increased CO2 production, increased serum K+ , myoglobinuria, and acidosis. Rigidity rather than relaxation following succinylcholine injection may be the first clue to its presence. Treatment of malignant hypehermia should include prompt conclusion of the operative procedure and cessation of anesthesia, hyperventilation with 100% O2 , and administration of intravenous dantrolene. The urine should be alkalinized to protect the kidneys from myoglobin precipitation. If reoperation is necessary, the physician should premedicate heavily, alkalinize the urine, and avoid depolarizing agents such as succinylcholine. Pretreatment for 24 hours with dantrolene is helpful; it is thought to act directly on muscle fiber to attenuate calcium release.",D

A six yr. old female presents with constipation and urinary retention . On examination a presacral mass is noted. Most probable diagnosis is:,Pelvic neuroblastoma,Rectal duplication cyst,Sacrococcygeal teratoma,Anterior sacral meningocele,"Ans is d i.e Anterior sacral meningocele Well all 4 options can present as presacral mass and any large pelvic mass can cause constipation and urinary retention due to mass effect. All the above lesions are rare, so we go for the most probable choice i.e. Ant. Sacral meningocele. It appears to be the most common of all, at the given age. Some books/students would argue it to be sacrococcygeal teratoma. But points against it are: Its common age of presentation is in the newborn and infants. Most of the sacrococcygeal teratomas have external component, rarely it is entirely pelvic. Anterior sacral meningocele Anterior sacral meningocele is characterised by a defect of the anterior aspect of the sacrum involving one or more segments with herniation of the meningeal sac into the extra peritoneal pelvic region. It is more common in females than in males. The symptoms appear usually in the second to third decade of life. The symptoms of anterior sacral meningocele are primarily owing to the mechanical effects of a pelvic tumor. Occasionally minor nerve defects may be associated with the condition. - Abdominal pains, constipation, urogenital (urinary retention or incontinence), gynecological (dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia) and neurological (low back pain, radiation to the legs and meningitis) symptoms may be seen. On x-ray: A unilateral sickle shape distoion of the sacral bone - The "" Scimitar sacrum"" - is considered pathognomonic. This sign is not present in all cases. Sacrococcygeal Teratoma Teratomas are tumors comprising more than a single cell type derived from more than one germ layer Teratomas range from benign, well-differentiated (mature) cystic lesions to those that are solid and malignant (immature). The most common location is sacrococcygeal (57%). Sacrococcygeal teratomas are the most common tumors in newborns. Most SCTs are found in babies and children, but SCTs have been repoed in adults. The tumors are subdivided and classified according to their location: Type I - tumors predominantly external with only minimal presacral involvement; Type II - tumors presenting externally but with a significant intrapelvic extension; Type III - tumors apparent externally but with predominant pelvic mass and extending into abdomen; Type IV - Presacral with no external presentation . A sacrococcygeal teratoma can he distinguished from its primary differential meningo-cele by its more abundant internal soft tissue, whereas the meningocele is more completely cystic in nature. Rectal duplication cyst Gastrointestinal duplications are rare congenital malformations that may vary greatly in presentation, size, location, and symptoms. The small intestine is the most frequent site involved(about 44%). Rectal duplication cysts are the rarest form of duplication comprising less than 5% of all gastrointestinal duplications. Presentation depends on the size and location of the duplication. Presenting signs of colonic or presacral duplications may include constipation, rectal bleeding, hematochezia, rectal prolapse, hemorrhoids, fistula-in-ano, and perirectal abscess.

"Which of the following refinements of serum PSA is used to determine the need for TRUS guided biopsy of prostate, even though the level of serum PSA is still in normal range?",PSAD (prostate-specific antigen density),PSA velocity,Free/Total PSA,Complexed/Total PSA,"PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower ""upper"" limit of normal for younger males and higher ""upper"" limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0.15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0.75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the ""normal"" range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O .15, for complexed total PSA of <0.70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0.25 improved specificity in one study by 20%. These modifications are designed to reduce the frequency of biopsies in men without cancer.",B

Her serum glucose concentration is 48 mg/dL (hypoglycemic) upon arrival at the emergency depament, where she is deemed to be in critical condition. Which of the following drugs most likely aggravated this fasting hypoglycemia?",Acarbose,Glyburide,Metformin,Pioglitazone,"Glyburide Glyburide is a second-generation sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic. Of the main groups or chemical classes of oral antidiabetic agents, these are the ones typically associated with causing hypoglycemia, whether from overdose or as a rather expected response in some patients, paicularly before meals. Normally carbohydrates from a meal trigger insulin release; when blood glucose levels are low, as after the 18-h fast this patient experienced, physiologic insulin release would be low too. However, even in a fast-induced hypoglycemic state a sulfonylurea will release insulin and drive blood glucose down even fuher. The elderly are paicularly susceptible to sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. Pa of this may relate to diet. However, expected age-related falls of renal and/or hepatic function can reduce elimination of these drugs, thereby increasing their serum levels and their effects unless dosages are reduced accordingly. This propensity for preprandial hypoglycemia is shared by the meglitinides, repaglinide and nateglinide because they, too, increase pancreatic insulin release. The thiazadolinediones (glitazones) seldom cause symptomatic hypoglycemia because they do not release insulin. The same applies to metformin, the biguanide; and acarbose (with, along with miglitol, is an aglucosidase inhibitor). Because of a longer half-life, compared with glipizide, a sulfonylurea is more likely to cause preprandial hypoglycemia. Glipizide is contraindicated in patients with liver disease because it is metabolized in the liver. Care should be taken in the elderly because of their propensity to develop hypoglycemia, which is perhaps due to decreased hepatic and renal function that is evident in this patient population. Metformin, acarbose, and pioglitazone do not produce serious hypoglycemic reactions.",B

Treatment of Medullary Carcinoma thyroid:,Surgery and Radiotheryapy,Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy,Surgery only,Radioiodine ablation,"Pheochromocytoma must be operated on first.
These tumors are generally (>50%) bilateral. Total thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with MTC because of the high incidence of multicentricity, the more aggressive course, and the fact that 131I therapy usually is not effective.
Central compartment nodes frequently are involved early in the disease process, so that a bilateral central neck node dissection should be routinely performed.
In patients with palpable cervical nodes or involved central neck nodes, ipsilateral or bilateral, modified radical neck dissection is recommended.
The role of prophylactic lateral neck dissection is controversial.
However, in patients with tumors >1 cm, ipsilateral prophylactic modified radical neck dissection is recommended because >60% of these patients have nodal metastases.
If ipsilateral nodes are positive, a contralateral node dissection should be performed.
In the case of locally recurrent or metastatic disease, tumor debulking is advised not only to ameliorate symptoms of flushing and diarrhea, but also to decrease risk of death from recurrent central neck or mediastinal disease.
External beam radiotherapy is controversial, but is recommended for patients with unresectable residual or recurrent tumor.
There is no effective chemotherapy regimen.
Radiofrequency ablation done laparoscopically appears promising in the palliative treatment of liver metastases >1.5 cm.
In patients who have hypercalcemia at the time of thyroidectomy, only obviously enlarged parathyroid glands should be removed.
The other parathyroid glands should be preserved and marked in patients with normocalcemia, as only about 20% of patients with MEN2A develop HPT.
When a normal parathyroid cannot be maintained on a vascular pedicle, it should be removed, biopsied to confirm that it is a parathyroid, and then autotransplanted to the forearm of the nondominant arm.
Total thyroidectomy is indicated in RET mutation carriers once the mutation is confirmed.
The procedure should be performed before age of 5 years in MEN2A patients and before age 1 year old in MEN2B patients.

Myodesis is employed in amputations for all of the following indications except:,Trauma,Tumor,Children,Ischemia,"D i.e. Ischemia: * Myodesis is contraindicated in cases of severe dysvascularity (ischemic limb) in which blood supply to the muscle appears compromised for fear of damaging the already precarious blood supply.* Myodesis should not be performed when vascularity is compromised (Ischemia) In Myodesis the residual musculature is stitched to the bone such that it retains the ability to developtension. This helps in achieving structurally stable residual limbs and to reduced atrophy. Myodesis is not preferred in ischemic limbs for fear of damaging the already precarious blood supply.* Myodesis may be used in children (Kulkarni 2nd/3909) 'When amputation is performed in children, the bone may overgrow the muscles and protrude under the skin (stump overgrowth). To prevent this myodesis must be preferred at the time of amputation which will stimulate the muscles to grow along with the bone'. * Myodesis may be used in Amputation for Tumors & Trauma Maximum preservation of stump length and the use of reconstructive techniques such as myodesis and myoplasty are ofpaicular impoance.",D

He usually appears sad, although he laughs often enough. He can throw a ball, and he runs well. Which of the following is likely to result in the diagnosis?",Muscle biopsy,Creatine phosphokinase (CPK),Effect of a test dose of endrophonium,Chest x-ray,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating acetylcholine receptor- binding antibodies are found in approximately 90% of cases, less commonly, when the patient demonstrates isolated eye disease. Other nonspecific evidence of autoimmune disease includes elevated ANAs, presence of abnormal immune complexes, and an association with the hypothyroidism related to lymphocytic thyroiditis, also an autoimmune disorder. The earliest signs of myasthenia gravis are ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, followed by dysphagia and facial muscle weakness. The distinguishing hallmark of this disease is rapid fatiguing of the involved muscles. The conduction velocity of the motor nerve is normal in this condition. When the involved muscle is repetitively stimulated for diagnostic purposes, the EMG shows a decremental response, which can be reversed by the administration of cholinesterase inhibitors. In older children this test is accomplished with edrophonium chloride, but it should be avoided in young infants, as cardiac arrhythmias may result (neostigmine would be used instead). Cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary therapeutic agents, and intramuscular neostigmine methylsulfate, oral neostigmine bromide, and oral pyridostigmine are available.

Left colon cancers: often colicky pain, rectal bleeding, bowel obstruction, tenesmus, mass in left iliac fossa, early change in bowel habit, less advanced disease at presentation. A tumor in the left (descending) colon is likely to cause obstruction at an earlier stage, because the left colon has a smaller diameter and the stool is semisolid. Cancer tends to encircle this pa of the colon, causing alternating constipation and frequent bowel movements before obstruction. A tumor in the right (ascending) colon does not cause obstruction until late in the course of the cancer, because the ascending colon has a large diameter and the contents flowing through it are liquid.",B
Number of lobes in liver as per Couinaud's classification: March 2005,3,4,6,8,"Ans. D: 8 The Couinaud classification of liver anatomy divides the liver into eight functionally independent segments. Each segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. In the centre of each segment there is a branch of the poal vein, hepatic aery and bile duct. In the periphery of each segment there is vascular outflow through the hepatic veins. Right hepatic vein divides the right lobe into anterior and posterior segments. Middle hepatic vein divides the liver into right and left lobes (or right and left hemiliver). This plane runs from the inferior vena cava to the gallbladder fossa. Left hepatic vein divides the left lobe into a medial and lateral pa. Poal vein divides the liver into upper and lower segments. The left and right poal veins branch superiorly and inferiorly to project into the center of each segment. Because of this division into self-contained units, each segment can be resected without damaging those remaining. For the liver to remain ble, resections must proceed along the vessels that define the peripheries of these segments. This means, that resection-lines parallel the hepatic veins. The centrally located poal veins, bile ducts, and hepatic aeries are preserved",D

Catheters capable of recording electrical activation in the hea are inseed the femoral vessels and manipulated under x ray guidance. Radiofrequency energy delivered a catheter is used to create small localised areas of scar. In AVN, the slow pathway is targeted with the aim of modifying conduction so that re-entrant tachycardia can no longer be sustained. Both acute and long term success rates for this procedure are high. AV is also amenable to catheter ablation. Focal atrial tachycardia can also be successfully treated with catheter ablation For re-entrant atrial tachycardias, radiofrequency ablation has high success rates and is often used as first line treatment Radiofrequency ablation is the treatment of choice for typical atrial flutter.

It consists of both epithelial and lymphoid elements thus known as adenolymphoma (probably arises from remnants of parotid tissue trapped in lymphnodes within the parotid gland). Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age : 54h to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99'n Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin 's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign.

True about thermal burn injury:,Zone of stasis is the innermost layer,Zone of hyperaemia is the middle layer,Zone of coagulation is the outermost layer,Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage,"Ans is D (Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage) Pathophysiology of Burns Burn causes coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and underlying tissues, with the depth depending on the temperature to which the skin is exposed and the duration of exposure. The area of cutaneous injury has been divided into three zones: zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia Zone of coagulation: The volume injured most severely, in the center of the wound, is the zone of coagulation. This is the area of necrosis where the cells have been disrupted. The tissue is irreversibly damaged at the time of injury. Zone of stasis: Outside the zone of coagulation is the zone of stasis. The zone of stasis is ischemic but potentially salvageable. Depending on the wound environment, can either survive or progress to coagulative necrosis. The zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage and vessel leakage.. Zone of hyperaemia: Beyond the zone of stasis lies the zone of hyperaemia This area is characterized by minimal cell injury but with vasodilatation due to neighboring inflammation-induced mediators. This region contains clearly ble tissue from which the healing process begins and is generally not at risk for fuher necrosis. In practice, attentive wound care and careful fluid resuscitation may salvage the zone of stasis and prevent a superficial injury from becoming full thickness",D

A man comes to emergency with stab injury to left flank. He has stable vitals. What would be the next step in management?,CECT,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage,Laprotomy,Laproscopy,"Ans. is 'a'. i.e. CECT The main decision in an abdominal injury is to decide whether an exploratory laparotomy is necessary or not. Physical examination though may help sometimes, has significant limitations and may be unreliable.The diagnostic approach to penetrating (Gunshot and Stab wounds) and blunt abdominal trauma differs substantially.Gunshot abdominal wounds: Chances of internal injury is very high in gunshot wounds thus little preoperative evaluation is required and laparotomy is mandatory.Stab wounds to abdomen:In contrast to GSWs, SWs are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs.Patients with isolated penetrating abdominal wound if hypotensive, or in shock or showing peritoneal signs go for exploratory laparotomy.Management of stable patients is debatable and controversial. Various methods are used to determine whether laparotomy is necessary or not.* Anterior stab wound- In ant. stab wounds local wound exploration can be performed to determine if there is any penetration of the peritoneal cavity. If the tract terminates without entering the peritoneum, the injury can be managed as a deep laceration and laparotomy is not needed. Otherwise, penetration of the peritoneum is assumed, and significant injury must be excluded by further diagnostic evaluations. Options include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, CT, FAST, and admission with observation.* Flank and back wounds- There is more debate over the management of stab wounds to the flank and back. These injuries are special because of the risks associated with retroperitoneal organ injury-colon, kidneys and ureter. Triple contrast CT (i.e. oral, IV, and rectal contrast) is advised to detect colon and retroperitoneal injuries and the need for laparotomy. Other methods like DPL, laparoscopy are also advised.* Blunt abdominal injury:Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT (CT in selected cases to refine the diagnosis) unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate exploratory laparotomy. US has largely replaced DPL.Management of hemodynamically unstable pt: a hemodynamically unstable pt is evaluated by FAST and if intra-abdominal fluid detected, undergoes laparotomy.",A

What suggests segmental demyelination on NCV,Decreased CAMP amplitudes,Uniform slowing of nerve conduction,Decreased area under CAMP curve,No evidence of distal conduction,"Answer- A. Decreased CAMP amplitudesSegmental Demyelination : Because there is variable slowing or different nerve fibers withing the nerve, conduction velocity will be slowed and distal latencies will be prolonged in segmentally demyelinatiing injuries.CMAP amplitudes may be decreased because of temporal dispersion, not because of axonal damage. Therefore, the CMAP may be longer in duration. However, the area under the CAMP will be normal.",A

IV fluid replacement (volume & rate) in a trauma patient is determined by :,Urine output,Chest condition,CVP,BP,"Lets see each option one by one
Urine output

""Urine output is a quantitative and relatively reliable indicator of organ perfusion. Adequate urine output is 0.5 ml/kg/ h in an adult, lml/kg/h in a child and 2ml/kg/h in an infant less than 1yr. of age.""

Pulse-

""Although tachycardia may be the earliest sign of hypovolemia, individuals in good physical condition, and particularly trained atheletes with a low resting pulse rate, may manifest only a relative tachycardia, pts on blocking medication may not be able to increase their heart rate. In children, bradycardia or relative bradycardia can occur with severe blood loss. Conversely, hypoxia, pain, apprehension and stimulant drugs  produce a tachycardia""

B.P. -

Hypotension is not a reliable early sign of hypovolemia. in healthy pts.
Blood volume must decrease by 30 to 40 percent before hypotension occurs.
Younger pts with good sympathetic tone can maintain systemic blood pressure with severe intravascular deficit untill they are on the verge of cardiac arrest.

CVP

The diagnosis can be made based on bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, a PaO2 /FiO2 ratio of less than 200, and pulmonary wedge pressures of less than 18 mm Hg (low filling pressures exclude the diagnosis of pulmonary edema). Three major physiologic alterations include (1) hypoxemia usually unresponsive to elevations of inspired O2 concentration; (2) decreased pulmonary compliance, as the lungs become progressively stiffer and harder to ventilate; and (3) decreased functional residual capacity. Progressive alveolar collapse occurs owing to leakage of protein-rich fluid into the interstitium and the alveolar spaces with the subsequent radiologic picture of diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally.

"A 40-year-old woman with inflammatory bowel disease has been receiving TPN for over 3 weeks. Workup reveals pelvic abscess. She undergoes exploratory laparotomy, resection of small bowel with anastomosis, and drainage of pelvic abscess. During surgery, TPN is maintained at the original rate of 125 mL/h. In the recovery room, the patient is found to have a urine output of 200 mL/h. CVP is 1, and laboratory results are Na,149;K,3.5;Cl,110;HCO3,18; BUN, 40; and creatinine, 1 mg/dL. Which of the following statements is true regarding this condition?",The patient's urine output is secondary to fluid overload during surgery.,The patient is in high-output renal failure.,Hyperosmolar-nonketotic coma will develop if the condition is not aggressively treated.,Diuresis is a normal response to stress of surgery.,"Hyperosmolar-nonketotic coma is a serious complication seen when an excessive amount of glucose is given, especially in the presence of sepsis, steroids, or inadequate insulin. Furthermore, the combination of surgery and sepsis results in an increased insulin- resistant state. The increased urine output is secondary to osmolar load from blood glucose. Low CVP, hypernatremia, and BUN-to- creatinine ratio over 20 suggest hypovolemia and not fluid overload. Normal creatinine level and BUN-to-creatinine ratio over 20 rules out high-output renal failure. The stress of surgery is characterized by water retention and not diuresis. Management consists of aggressive hydration, discontinuation of TPN, and insulin drip. Insulin drives the potassium intracellularly and potassium must be replaced.",C

Hypothermia (0deg to 4deg C) is a critical component of successful organ cold storage because:,Oxygen is more soluble in cold solutions and provides a continual supply for energy metabolism,There is no way to suppress microbial growth except by cooling and slowing the growth rate,Hypothermia diminishes energy requirements and allows the limited energy reserve to keep the organ alive,It slows metabolism and the enzymic processes that would destroy the cell,"Hypothermia in simple organ cold storage serves one primary function but secondary ones as well. The primary function is to slow metabolism. Metabolic rates decrease about twofold for every 10 degree C drop in temperature. Cooling an organ from 37deg to 0deg to 4deg C drops metabolism about 12- to 13-fold. This is related to the activation energy of enzymatic processes as expressed by Arrhenius and van't Hoff. Thus, catabolism of structural and functional cellular element is retarded for a long period--up to 3 days for some organs. The cold also suppresses microbial growth, but this can be accomplished by other means as well. The cold also allows time for the transplantation operation, and during this time it is impoant to be quick or to keep cooling the organ.",D

(SELECT 1 DIAGNOSIS)",Subdural hematoma,Epidural hematoma,Carotid dissection,Brain contusion,"Subdural hematomas usually arise from tears in the veins bridging from the cerebral cortex to the dura or venous sinuses, often after only minor head injuries. They can become apparent several days after the initial injury. Treatment is with drainage of the hematoma through a burr hole; a formal craniotomy may be required if the fluid reaccumulates. Significant brain contusions due to blunt trauma are usually associated with at least transient loss of consciousness; similarly, epidural hematomas result in a period of unconsciousness, although a ""lucid interval"" may follow during which neurologic findings are minimal.Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the absence of antecedent trauma most commonly arises from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, which typically is found at the bifurcation of the major branches of the circle of Willis. Other less frequent causes include hypertensive hemorrhage, trauma, and bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation. Patients present with the sudden onset of an excruciating headache. Complaints of a stiff neck and photophobia are common. Loss of consciousness may be transient or evolve into frank coma. Cranial nerve palsies are seen as a consequence both of increased intracranial pressure due to hemorrhage and pressure of the aneurysm on adjacent cranial nerves. CT scans followed by cerebral arteriography help to confirm the diagnosis as well as to identify the location of the aneurysm. Treatment consists of surgical ligation of the aneurysm by placing a clip across its neck. Early surgical intervention (within 72 h of SAH) may prevent aneurysmal rebleeding and allow aggressive management of post hemorrhage vasospasm.",A

A: Hyperplastic change in the lining mucosa of esophagusBarrett esophagus is a premalignant condition that involves the distal esophagus and appears to be related to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GORD).There is metaplastic change in the lining mucosa of esophagus.Usually there are no paicular severe symptoms, although they do have the most abnormal pH profiles. Patients with Barrett esophagus are predisposed to the most rapidly increasing cause of cancer.The diagnosis of Barrett esophagus is made at endoscopy when the normal, whitish-appearing squamous epithelium is found to be replaced by a reddish, velvety-appearing intestinal type of columnar epithelium.Barrett esophagus is thought to evolve to cancer through various stages of dysplasia.Initially, no dysplasia is found; subsequently, low-grade dysplasia develops in the mucosa, then high-grade dysplasia, and finally carcinoma. Dysplasia is considered indefinite when histological changes are not definitive for dysplasia. Most of these changes cannot be visualized endoscopically.The hallmark of specialized Barrett's epithelium is the presence of mucus-secreting goblet cells (intestinal metaplasia). Patients are usually monitored by a program of periodic surveillance endoscopy during which biopsy specimens are taken in 4 quadrants every 2 cm throughout the Barrett segment.Treatment is that of the underlying cause of GORD",A

True about epidermoid cysta) Punctum is presentb) Keratin is presentc) Sebaceous material presentd) Autosomal inheritancee) May turn malignant,abc,bcd,abe,acd,"Epidermoid cyst (also k/a sebaceous cyst, epidermal cyst) Epidermoid cysts are most common cutaneous cysts.

Epidermoid cyst results from proliferation of epidermal cells within a circumscribed space of dennis (which had got implanted within the dermis due to a variety of reasons)
Sebaceous cyst is a misnomer as the cysts are not of sebaceous origin and the white, creamy material filled within them is not sebum but is keratin (desquamated epithelial cells)
The walls of these cysts consist of a layer of epidermis oriented with the basal layer superficial and the more mature layers deep (i.e. the epidermis grows into the centre of the cyst). The desquamated cells (keratin) collect in the centre and form the creamy substance of the cyst.
Epidermoid cysts usually are asymptomatic unless they get infected or inflamed and become painful
They appear as firm, round, flesh coloured to yellow or white subcutaneous nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum is an inconsistent finding that may tether the cyst to the overlying epidermis and from which the white creamy material can be expressed.
Rarely malignancies (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell ca) can develop in epidermoid cysts.


Treatment

incision and drainage is recommended for an acutely infected cyst.
after resolution of the abscess the cyst wall must be excised to prevent recurrence.",C

However, in very young patients or those with sepsis, or when significant branch vessels may be compromised by a covered stent, other management techniques can be employed. Use of arterial closure devices can be attempted, especially when the distance from the skin to the artery tract is less than 5 cm and access to the artery is still available.

Which of the following is not true about Myositis ossificans?,Associated with muscle tendon rupture,Inflammation around the ruptured muscle deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals with,Common in supracondylar fracture,Ossification of musculo-periosteal haematoma,"A i.e. Associated with muscle tendon rupture Myositis Ossificans (M.O) / Hetrotropic Ossification It is hetrotropic calcification and ossification in muscle tissue. The name is misnomer as there is no myositis (inflammation of muscle) and rarely ossification in the muscle (because the mineral phase differs from that in bone and no true bone matrix is formed). Etiology Injury (trauma) is an impoant factor and m.o. associated with trauma is better k/a post traumatic ossification it is seen in - Elbow > hipQ are commonly involved joints. - Trauma around elbowQ eg. fracture supracondylar humerus, dislocation or surgery. - Surgical trauma specially total hip replacement, - Massage to the elbow and vigorous passive stretchine to restore movements is aggravating factor. - Repeated micro trauma and overuse injuries. This type usually involve soleus muscle in ballerians. It occurs in muscles which are vulnerable to tear under heavy loads, such as quadriceps, adductors, brachicilisQ, biceps, and deltoid. M. 0. not associated with traumatic injury is termed as Pseudomalignant mysitis ossificans. And it is seen in Neurological disorders eg.G.B syndrome, AIDS encephalopathy, closed head injury, hypoxic brain injury & burns. Pathogenesis - Bone formation in muscle represents metaplasia of fibroblast at the site of injury. - Paial rupture & avulsion of muscle , ligament & joint capsule from bone usually cause periosteal elevation with the formation of subperiosteal hematoma and the wide exposure of cells with osteogenic potential. It inevitably lit subperiosteal ossification. - It has four microscopic zones (Ackerman Zonation) with centre most zone of undifferentiated, highly active (mitotic) cells and the outermost zone of well oriented hone encapsulated by fibrous tissue. - It must be distinguished from extaskeletal osteosarcoma. The latter usually occur in elderly, lacks zonationQ, and the most peripheral regions of osteosarcoma are most cellular & primitive, which is reverse of m.o. - It is distinguished from calcinosis, which is a metabolic disorder, often associated with collagen diseases - scleroderma & dermatomyositis. It is distinguished from ectopic calcification, which occurs in the capsule of joints, commonly the shoulder and is caused by inflammatory reaction around deposits of hydroxy - appetite crystals. And it is seen in CRF, hypo/hyper Clinical feature - Mostly asymptoma tic but may present with tenderness, palpable swelling, pain on range of motion, stiffness, and increased warmth. Imaging - Radiographs initially are normal, but by 10 days to 4 weeks fine calcification (dotted veil/ cotton wool appearance) is seen. - There is peripheral ossification and central lucencyQ of the mass. - The mass is usually seperated from underlying bone by at least a thin lineQ & lesion are usually located in the diaphysis. If the lesion is in continuity with the bone it is not myositis ossificans and the possibility of tumor or infection arises. - Calcification may first be noted on USG (focal hypoechoic mass located with in the muscle). - CT is better than x - ray - Biopsy before 4 weeks is usually in accurate. Treatment of Myositis Ossificans - Treatment is normally by 'watchful inactivity'. It must be emphasised that it is a passive stretching and not active exercise that is responsible for stimulating new growth formation. The worst treatment is to attack an injured and stiffish elbow with vigorous mucle stretching exercises; this is liable to precipitate or aggrevate the condition. So any physical therapy should be discontinuedQ. - Relative rest of the affected extremity is helpfulQ, with motion & activity gradually resumed as the acute phase subsides. In acute phase the treatment consist of limiting motion & icing the extremity while avoiding heat or massage - Low dose irradiation & indomethacin may prevent hetrotopic ossification, but the radiation should be avoided in children. - Surgical excision in toto is not done until a year or 2 after the acute phase of disease, at a time when radiograph reveal that the bone is fully mature and bone scan show either a return to normal uptake or decreasing activity in the lesion.",A

Increasing or spreading abdominal pain
Increasing size of the mass

Ochsner—Sherren regimen comprises hospitalization, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, analgesics and a strict watch on the vitals and general state of the patient.

Which of the structural domains of mammalian regulatory factors may be called intracellular receptors?,Response elements,Antirepressor domains,Transcription-activating domains,Ligand-binding domains,"Mammalian regulatory factors are much more diverse than those of bacteria, possessing several types of structural domains. Activators of transcription, such as steroid hormones, may enter the cell and bind to regulatory factors at specific sites called ligand-binding domains; these intracellular ""receptors"" are analogous to G protein-linked membrane receptors that extend into the extracellular space. Response elements are not regulatory factors but DNA sequences near the transcription site for ceain types of genes (e.g., steroid-responsive and heat shock- responsive genes). Regulatory factors interact with specific DNA sequences through their DNA-binding domains, and with other regulatory factors through transcription-activating domains. Some regulatory factors have antirepressor domains that counteract the inhibitory effects of chromatin proteins (histones and nonhistones).",D

Venoocclusive disease in hepatic vein characterized by:a) Central venous congestionb) Hepatomegalyc) Portal vein obstructiond) Budd chiari syndromee) Hepatic fibrosis,ab,ad,bc,be,"Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) now better known as 'Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome' is one of the most frequently encountered serious complications after bone marrow transplantation.
Other uncommon causes are:
Long-term immunosuppression with azathioprine in renal and liver transplant patients - Sporadic cases may be due to use of herbal teas (pyrrolizidine alkaloids).
The hallmark features of VOD are hyperbilirubinemia, painful hepatomegaly, and fluid retention.
The onset of VOD usually occurs within 3 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, with a peak 12 days posttransplantation. However, the onset of VOD has been reported even later.
According to the modified Seattle criteria, 2 or more of the following must be present prior to 20 days after stem cell transplantation for a diagnosis of VOD:
Bilirubin level of more than 2 mg/dL (34 p.mol/L)
Hepatomegaly and upper right quadrant pain of liver origin
Ascites and/or unexplained weight gain of more than 2% above the reference range
Pathophysiology: The causes of VOD are still unclear, but a combination of pretransplant risk factors and transplant-related conditions are believed to trigger a primarily hepatic sinusoidal injury. This can quickly extend to a hepatocytic and panvasculitic disease.
This process eventually leads to complete venular obliteration, extensive hepatocellular necrosis, and widespread fibrous tissue replacement of normal liver. Because of the initiating pathology it is also called sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.
The disease has significant morbidity and mortality.
Treatment is largely supportive.

VOD and Budd-Chiari syndrome

In VOD hepatic venous outflow obstruction occurs from diffuse involvement of hepatic venules/ vein radicals, whereas in Budd-Chiari syndrome the outflow obstruction is due to involvement of major hepatic veins or the hepatic portion of IVC. In VOD the major hepatic veins are patent.
Tender hepatomegaly with jaundice and ascites is common in both conditions.",D

Fetal blood is returned to the umbilical aeries and the placenta through the,Hypogastric aeries,Ductus venosus,Poal vein,Inferior vena cava,"(Reece, 2/e, pp 54, 119-121.) Fetal blood is returned directly to the placenta through the two hypogastric aeries. The distal poions of the hypogastric aeries atrophy and obliterate within 3 to 4 days after bih; remnants are called umbilical ligaments. Fetal oxygenation is aided by the presence of three vascular shunts: the ductus venosus, foramen ovale, and ductus aeriosus. The ductus venosus shunts oxygenated blood from the umbilical vein into the inferior vena cava. The foramen ovale deflects the more oxygenated blood from the right atrium into the left atrium, thereby bypassing pulmonary circulation. Approximately two- thirds of the blood ejected from the right ventricle is shunted pulmonary circulation through the ductus aeriosus.",A

All of the following statements are true about repair of groin hernias except -,Lichtenstein tension free repair has a low recurrence rate,TEP repair is an extraperitoneal approach to laparoscopic repair of groin hernia,"In Shouldice repair, non-abosorbable mesh is used",The surgery can be done under local anaesthesia in selected cases.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., In shouldice repair, non absorbable mesh is used Shouldice repair is a method of hernia repair in which the inguinal floor is strengthened by just approximation of tissue using non-absorbable sutures. No mesh is used. Management of Groin hernias (mainly inguinal hernia) There are 2 objectives of t/t : 1) Treatment of the hernial sac In Indirect hernias, the sac is dissected free from the cord structures and cremastric fibres. The sac is opened and the herniated contents are reduced. Then the sac is ligated at the internal inguinal ring. Alternatively the hernial sac may be invaginated back into the abdomen without ligation. Direct sacs are usually too broad based for ligation and should not be opened but instead are simply inveed into the peritoneal cavity. 2) Inguinal floor reconstruction -Management of the hernial sac is sufficient for children and young adults, but some method of reconstruction (repair or strengthening) of the inguinal floor is necessary in all adult hernias to prevent recurrance. 3 broad categories of repair are available a) Primary tissue repair b) Anterior tension free mesh repairs c) Preperitoneal repairs - open & the laparoscopic approach a) Primary tissue repair In this method the post wall of inguinal canal is strengthened by just approximation of tissues with sutures. There is no use of any prosthetic material. Primary repairs without mesh were the mainstay of hernia surgery for decades. The advantages are simplicity of the repair and absence of any foreign body in the groin. Disadvantages include higher recurrence rates due to tension on the repair and a slower return to unrestricted physical activity. Consequently, tension free mesh repairs have now become the dominant method of inguinal hernia repair. Commonly performed primary tissue repairs are i) Bassini repair ii) Halsted repair iii) McVay (Cooper ligament) repair iv) Shouldice repair v) Darn repair - Darn repair gets its name from the way a long nylon suture repeatedly passed between the tissues to create a weave that one might consider similar to mesh. b) Anterior tension-free mesh repair - Recognizing that tension in a repair is the principal cause of recurrence, current practices in hernia management employ a synthetic mesh prosthesis to bridge the defect Recurrence rate is quite low with these techniques - Common employed techniques are i) Lichtenstein repair - In Lichtenstein repair a piece of polypropylene mesh is used to reconstruct the inguinal floor. - The mesh is sutured to the abdominal fascia. - Recurrence rate is quite low ii) Patch and plug technique - In this method a plug of mesh is inseed into the hernial defect (i.e. internal ring in Indirect hernia) and sutured in place. Then another piece of mesh is placed over the inguinal floor which may or may not be sutured to the fascia. c) Laparoscopic and Preperitoneal repairs The laparoscopic hernia repair is based on the technique of 'Stoppa', who used an open preperitoneal approach to reduce the hernia and placed a large piece of mesh to cover the entire inguinal floor and myopectineal orifice. Preperitoneal hernia repairs may also be performed without mesh, but its rarely used now. In Laparoscopic hernia repair, the preperitoneal space is reached by either transabdominal laparoscopy (TAPP) or by a totally extraperitoneal repair (TEP) Both techniques are similar in actual repair but differ in the manner by which the preperitoneal space is accessed. i) TAPP (Trans-abdominal pre-peritoneal) - in the TAPP repair, the peritoneal space is entered by conventional laparoscopy and then the preperitoneum overlying the inguinal floor is dissected away as a flap. ii) TEP (totally extraperitoneal repair) - in TEP repair the preperitoneal space is accessed without entering the peritoneal cavity. Choice of Anesthesia Here there is difference of opinion b/w Schwaz Surgery (8/e, p 1368) & Washington Manual of Surgery (4/e, p 511) According to Washington Manual of Surgery - local anesthesia is the preferred anesthetic for elective open repair. - Laparoscopic hernia repair have been carried out under local or regional anesthesia, but is more commonly done under General anesthesia. According to Schwaz Surgery - General anesthesia is the preferred choice for open as well as laparoscopic repair.",C
Anerobic infection is precipitated by,Trauma,Impaired circulation,Tissue necrosis,All,"Ans. d (All). (Ref. Harrison's Principles Medicine, 18th / Ch.31; Table 32-1)# Anaerobic organisms grow well when the oxygen free environment is available.# Impaired circulation due to trauma or some other reason leads to tissue necrosis if the impairment of circulation is severe and traumatized contaminated wound as such is also prone for the same, leading ultimately to anaerobic infection.Also remember:Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) or Vincent's infection is caused by mixed anaerobes. Stress, poor oral hygiene, and tobacco and alcohol use are risk factors. This infection most commonly follows a debilitating illness or affects severely malnourished children. It has been known to complicate leukemia or to develop in individuals with a genetic deficiency of catalase. Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) is a complication of acute tonsillitis caused mainly by a mixed flora containing anaerobes and group A Streptococcus. In submandibular space infection (Ludwig's angina), 80% of cases are caused by infection of the tissues surrounding the second and third molar teeth. This infection results in marked local swelling of tissues, with pain, trismus, and superior and posterior displacement of the tongue. Submandibular swelling of the neck can impair swallowing and cause respiratory obstruction. In some cases, tracheostomy may be life-saving. Cervicofacial actinomycosis is caused by a branching, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, strict/facultative anaerobe that is a part of the normal oral flora. This chronic disease is characterized by abscesses, draining sinus tracts, fistula, bone destruction, and fibrosis. It can easily be mistaken for malignancy or granulomatous disease. Actinomycosisless frequently involves the thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and CNS.",D
A lady who is 9 weeks pregnant comes with a 2.5 cm mass in the upper outer quadrant of left breast. Ultrasound failed to show any abnormality.

Core-needle biopsy with or without ultrasound guidance is a safe and reliable method for obtaining tissue.""Fewer than 25% of the breast nodules developing during pregnancy and lactation will be cancerous. Ultrasonography and needle biopsy are used in the diagnosis of these nodules. Open biopsy may be required. Mammography is rarely indicated because of its decreased sensitivity during pregnancy and lactation; however, the fetus can be shielded if mammography is needed. --Schwartz 9/467""Because of the changes in the breast tissue with pregnancy, imaging modalities may be difficult to interpret. If used with appropriate shielding, mammography carries a limited risk to the fetus. Mammography has a high false-negative rate due to the increased density of the fibroglandular breast tissue, however.: so it has limited usefulness in the evaluation of the pregnant patient. Ultrasonography can safely be performed as an initial evaluation or in conjunction with mammography. Ultrasound is able to distinguish solid from cystic lesions in 97% of patients and is helpful in guiding fine-needle aspiration or biopsy Although MRI does not use ionizing radiation, the two main risks to the fetus from the magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation are heating and cavitation. With other reliable imaging modalities available, MRI is not currently recommended for breast imaging in the pregnant patient.

Which of the following statement about volvulus is False:,More common in psychiatric patients,Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal volvulus,Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus,All,"Ans is 'c'' i.e. Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus Volvulus describes a condition in which there is rotation of a segment of the intestine on an axis formed by its mesentery resulting in paial or complete obstruction of the lumen and may be followed by circulatory impairment of the bowel. Most common site is colon, among which following are involved in descending order - Sigmoid volvulus (- 75%) - Cecal volvulus (< 25%) - Transverse colon - Splenic flexure - Sigmoid volvulus Most common site of volvulus Volvulus can occur in any segment of large bowel that is attached to a long and floppy mesentery that is fixed to the retroperitoneum by a narrow base of origin. The mesenteric anatomy is such that volvulus is most commonly seen in sigmoid colon. Associated predisposing factors are : - age : average age of presentation is 60-70 yrs. - chronic constipation - institutionalized or neurologically impaired or psychiatric patients (their medication may decrease intestinal motility, or they may fail to pass stool regularly, leading to fecal loaded large bowel predisposing to volvulus) - diet high in fibre and vegetables (as in third world countries) Signs and symptoms are those of acute or subacute intestinal obstruction. X-ray picture is dramatic - there is a markedly dilated sigmoid colon with the appearance of a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance. Inferior convergence of the dilated loop points towards left side of pelvis. - contrast enema demonstrates the point of obstruction with the pathognomic 'birds beak' or 'bird of prey' or 'ace of spades' sign. Management of sigmoid volvulus Unless there are obvious signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the initial management is resuscitation followed by endoscopic decompression and detorsion. Decompression/detorsion can be achieved by placement of rectal tube through a proctoscope or the use of a colonoscope. If detorsion / decompression cannot be achieved with either the rectal tube or colonoscope, laprotomy with resections of the sigmoid colon is done. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid volvulus is successful, risk of recurrence is high (approx. 50%). Hence an effective sigmoid colectomy is indicated after the pt. has stabilized. Any evidence of bowel gangrene or perforation contraindicates non-operative decompression and an immediate surgical exploration is done. Cecal volvulus The condition commonly referred to as cecal volvulus is actually a cecocolic volvulus and consists of an axial rotation of the terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. Cecal bascule - is a condition in which the cecum folds in a cephalad direction anteriorly over a fixed ascending colon. This causes intermittent bouts of abdominal pain because the mobile cecum causes intermittent episodes of Isolated cecal obstruction. It is relieved spontaneously as the cecum falls back into its normal position. Cecocolic volvulus is possible because of lack of fixation of the cecum to the retroperitoneum. Associate predisposing factors are: - previous surgery - pregnancy - malrotation - obstructing lesion of the left colon Cecocolic volvulus affects a younger age group (late 50s) than sigmoid volvulus (60s & 70s). X-ray picture - dilated cecum usually occupying the left upper quadrant. - haustral markings can be seen in the distended cecocolic segment and is a distinguishing feature from sigmoid colon in which generally there are no haustra. Management According to Schwaz Surgery - Cecal volvulus, unlike sigmoid volvulus can almost never be detorsed / decompressed endoscopically. As vascular compromise occurs early in the course of cecal volvulus, surgical exploration is necessary when the diagnosis is made. Right hemicolectomy is the procedure of choice. Sabiston surgery writes that - 'Although there have been repos of detorsion of cecocolic volvulus with a colonoscope most cases require operation to correct the volvulus and prevent ischemia."" An aicle published in the journal 'Diseases of Colon and Rectum' - The management of Cecal Volvulus writes""Non-operative decompression of cecal volvulus is rarely achievable""",C

Meconium peritonitis occurs -,Just before birth,Just after birth,Before and after birth,Due to birth trauma,"Meconium Peritonitis 

Meconium is a sterile mixture of epithelial cells, mucin, salts, fats and bile and is formed when the fetus commences to swallow amniotic fluid.
Meconium peritonitis is due to intestinal perforation mostly the result of some form of neonatal intestinal obstruction (eg. meconium ileus in cystic fibrosis patients).
When meconium enters the peritoneal cavity, an exudate is secreted that organizes rapidly, matting of intestinal loops occur, and in many cases in a matter of weeks, the extruded becomes calcified.
Meconium remains sterile until about 3 hrs after birth; thereafter, unless the perforation has become sealed, sterile meconium peritonitis gives place to acute bacterial peritonitis which unless treated promptly is rapidly fatal.
The clinical picture may be that of peritonitis and/or intestinal obstruction.


Meconium peritonitis should always be suspected when a baby is born with a tense abdomen, who is vomiting and in whom there is a failure to discharge meconium.

• A minimal amount of skin edge (i.e. only that which has been contaminated) should be excised around the entrance and exit wounds.
• Foreign matter should be removed from the wound.
• Delayed primary closure should follow within 4-7 days after injury.
• Dead muscle that does not bleed or contract, is mushy in consistency or has an unhealthy colour must be excised. These criteria comprise is the ‘4 Cs’ for muscle excision (Colour, Contractility, Consistency, Capillary bleeding)

Pseudoclaudication is caused by,Femoral Aery stenosis,Popliteal Aery stenosis,Lumbar canal stenosis,Radial Aery stenosis,"Pseudoclaudication is the term used for neurogenic claudication caused due to lumbar canal stenosis. Its symptoms mimic intermittent claudication of PVD. Neurogenic claudication, consists of back and buttock or leg pain induced by walking or standing and relieved by sitting or changing posture. Symptoms in the legs are usually bilateral. Unlike vascular claudication, symptoms are often provoked by standing without walking. Spinal stenosis can be acquired, congenital, or due to a combination of these factors. Congenital causes include achondroplasia, idiopathic. Acquired causes are degenerative diseases (spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, scoliosis), trauma, spine surgery, metabolic or endocrine disorders (epidural lipomatosis, osteoporosis, acromegaly, renal osteodystrophy, hypoparathyroidism), and Paget&;s disease.

"A 46-year-old male with HIV and severe penicillin allergy receiving zidovudine, indinavir, and stavudine presents with fever, nonproductive cough, and severe hypoxia. Chest x-ray reveals diffuse increased interstitial markings and a possible lobar consolidation in the left lower lobe. After appropriate evaluation, the patient receives levofloxacin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, and acyclovir. Initial serum creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL. On day 4, it has risen to 3.8 mg/dL and a normal serum potassium has risen to 7.1 mg/dL. Urinalysis reveals no casts, 10 to 20 WBC/HPF, and rare RBCs. Which drug is the most likely cause of renal failure?",Levofloxacin,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,Acyclovir,Indinavir,"In the elderly or in patients with renal insufficiency, full doses of trimethoprimsulfamethonazole frequently cause drug-induced interstitial nephritis and hyperkalemia (due to inhibition of the sodium- potassium transpo system in the distal nephron). Levofloxacin is a very rare cause of renal dysfunction. In the setting of volume depletion, acyclovir may cause acute renal failure secondary to intratubular obstruction from crystal deposition. Crystals are absent from the urine in this case. Indinavir may crystallize and cause either nephrolithiasis or renal failure due to tubular obstruction.",B
Vasopressor of choice in hypotension produced during sub-arachnoidblock,Ephedrine,Mephenteramine,Adrenaline,Dopamine,"A i.e. Ephedrine Most common complication of spinal anesthesia is hypotensionQ, which can be prevented by preloading with crystalloid. In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1.003 - 1.008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection,Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option.",A

Increased risk of cardio toxicity associated with local anesthetics requires a dose reduction in all of the following except,Pregnancy,Acidosis,Pediatric,Increased cardiac output,"Life threatening cardiovascular toxicity, including left ventricular depression, atrioventricular hea block,ventricular arrhythmia is seen more in patients with deceased liver function, acidosis and in shock. The risk factors for developing LAST (Local Anesthetic systemic toxicity)can be categorized into those that are related to the injected drug, the patient, or the technique. Drug The cardiovascular collapse/CNS (CC/CNS) ratio is ""the ratio of drug dose required to cause catastrophic cardiovascular collapse to the drug dose required to produce seizures."" A low CC/CNS ratio is associated with more cardiotoxic agents, while LAs with a higher CC/CNS ratio have a greater safety margin. This is because the earlier presentation of CNS features may expedite earlier diagnosis (and thus, treatment) of LAST before cardiovascular collapse ensues. Ropivacaine and levobupivacaine, for example, have higher CC/CNS ratios than racemic bupivacaine; therefore, it seems logical to preferentially use these drugs when long-acting LAs are desired. Vigilance is always required, however, as all LA drugs may cause LAST. Patient Age Patients at the extremes of age have consistently been shown to be at the greatest risk of LAST. Pregnancy Renal disease Patients with severe renal disease not only have a hyperdynamic circulation and reduced clearance of LAs, but also have an increased a1-acid glycoprotein concentration. As a result, free plasma concentrations are largely unchanged and dose reduction is often unnecessary, unless the patient is uremic with metabolic acidosis. Cardiac disease Dose reduction is unnecessary in mild-moderate hea failure where tissue perfusion is preserved, but is recommended in severe hea failure. Hepatic dysfunction",D

True statements regarding Paget's disease of the breast include that it,Usually precedes development of Paget's disease of bone,Presents with nipple-areolar eczematous changes,Does not involve axillary lymph nodes because it is a manifestation of intraductal carcinoma only,Accounts for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed breast cancers,"Paget's disease of the breast is unrelated to Paget's bone disease. It represents a small percentage (1-3%) of all breast cancers and is thought to originate in the retro areolar lactiferous ducts. It progresses toward the nipple-areola complex in most patients, where it causes the typical clinical finding of nipple eczema and erosion. Up to 20% of patients with Paget's disease have an associated breast mass, and these patients are more likely to have involvement of axillary nodes. Nipple-areolar disease alone usually represents in situ cancer; these patients have a 10-year survival rate of over 80%. In contrast, if Paget's disease presents with a mass, the mass is likely to be an infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The generally recommended surgical procedure for Paget's disease is currently a modified radical mastectomy.

The nerve fibers which are most sensitive to local anesthetic belong to ----- group,A,B,C,D,"Classification of peripheral nerves is impoant in determining the sequence of local anesthetic blockade. B fibers are the most sensitive. Dilation of cutaneous blood vessels is often the first sign of local anesthetic onset. C fibers and A-d are next-in sensitivity. They result in the inability to feel cool sensations such as an alcohol wipe. Next-in sensitivity are the A-g, A-b, and A-a fibers, which result in the loss of sensation, pressure, proprioception, and finally motor paralysis. Local anesthetic concentration must be adequate to block nerve fibers. It takes approximately twice the concentration of local anesthetic to block motor fibers as it does to block sensory fibers, and sympathetic fibers require the least. The order of blockade onset is B fibers > C fibers = A-d fibers > A-g fibers > A-b fibers > A-a fibers.

Regarding high-voltage electrical burns to an extremity,Injuries are generally more superficial than those of thermal burns,Intravenous fluid replacement is based on the percentage of body surface area burned,Antibiotic prophylaxis is not required,Evaluation for fracture of the other extremities and visceral injury is indicated,"The treatment of electrical injury should be modified from that of thermal burns because tissue damage is much deeper than is apparent at first inspection. The heat generated is propoional to the resistance to the flow of current. Bone, fat, and tendons offer the greatest resistance. Therefore, the tissue deep within the center of an extremity may be injured while more superficial tissues are spared. For this reason, the quantification of fluid requirements cannot be based on the percentage of body surface area involved, as in the Parkland,Brooke, or Baxter formulas, which are used to calculate fluid replacement after thermal burns. Massive fluid replacement is usually essential. A brisk urine output is desirable because of the likelihood of myonecrosis with consequent myoglobinuria and renal damage. As with deep thermal burns, debridement, skin grafting, and amputation of extremities may be required following electrical injury. However, fasciotomy is more frequently required than escharotomy with electrical injury because deep myonecrosis results in increased intracompamental pressures and compromised limb perfusion. In addition, distant fractures may result owing to vigorous muscle contraction during the accident or if subsequent falls occur. Cardiac or respiratory arrest may occur if the pathway of the current includes the hea or brain. An electrical current can also damage the pulmonary alveoli and capillaries and lead to respiratory infections, a major cause of death in these victims. Owing to the deep myonecrosis that often accompanies high-voltage injury, prophylaxis for clostridia with high-dose penicillin may be considered.",D

Ormond's disease is -,Idiopathic lymphadenopathy,Retractile testis,Idiopathic retroperitonial fibrosis,Idiopathic mediastinitis,"• Uncommon inflammatory condition characterized by the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum
• The fibrosis is usually confined to the central and paravertebral spaces between the renal arteries and sacrum and tends to encase the aorta, IVC and ureters.
• The process usually begins at the level of the aortic bifurcation and spreads cephalad upto renal artery generally.
Etiology
• Around 70% cases are primary or idiopathic (Ormond’s disease)
Causes of Secondary (30%)Q Retroperitoneal Fibrosis
• Inflammatory conditions: CATH (Chronic pancreatitis, Actinomycosis, Tuberculosis, Histoplasmosis)
• Drugs: Methylsergide (Most important), methyldopa, hydralazine, entacapone, beta-blockers, bromocriptine, phenacetin, amphetamines (MAHE-BP)
• Malignancies: CA prostate, NHL, CA stomach, sarcoma and carcinoid tumor
• Autoimmune disorders: SLE, PAN and ankylosing spondylitis
• Radiation
Clinical Features
• More common in males of 40-60 years.
• Early symptoms are vague and non-specific (abdominal or flank pain, weight loss, malaise, and hypertension)
• Obstructive uropathy (dysuria, frequency, fever due to secondary infection of hydroneprotic kidney) is the earliest and MC specific symptom.
• Ureters are MC involved, MC site is lower third of ureter.
• Partial or complete obstruction occurs in 75% patients
Diagnosis: In absence of uremia, diagnosis is made by IVP.
• IVP or RGP:
−− Hydronephrosis with dilated tortuous upper ureter,
−− Medial pulling of ureters or pipestem ureters
−− Extrinsic ureteral compression
• CT scan is IOC for retroperitoneal fibrosis.
• MRI is IOC in cases of compromised renal function, because contrast cannot be given.
Treatment
• Primary, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis: Ureteral stenting and immunosuppression (TAPS: Tamoxifen, Azathioprine, Penicillamine, Steroids)
• Secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis: Midline transperitoneal ureterolysis with wrapping the ureter with omental flap or lateral retroperitoneal ureteral transposition.

"A 25 year old lady presents with spontaneous nipple discharge of 3 months duration. On examination the discharge is bloody and from a single duct. The following statements about management of this paicular patient are true, EXCEPT:",USG can be an useful investigation,Radical duct excision is the operation of choice,"Galactogram, though useful, is not essential",Majority of blood stained nipple discharge are due to papillomas or other benign conditions,"Unilateral, spontaneous, serous or serosanguinous discharge from the single duct is usually caused by an intraductal papilloma or rarely, by an intraductal cancer. Mostly the underlying cause is a ductal papilloma or ductal ectasia, but since the chances of malignancies are high, it must be investigated fuher. The risk of malignancy is increased if an underlying mass is present. Also know: Investigation used are: 1. Mammography: can show any underlying suspicious lesion 2. Cytological examination: this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer. 3. Galactography/ductography: The primary indication of the ductography is nipple discharge, paicularly when bloody. Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential, since excision of the bloody ductal system is needed regardless of the diagnosis. In ductography, a contrast medium is injected into the duct and a mammogram taken. This may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Ductal ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures. USG may show underlying mass or ductal ectasia. The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (microdochectomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them to a histopathological diagnosis. Radical duct excision (meaning removal of all lactiferous duct) is not done. Ref: CSDT 12/e, page 299.",B

A pre-natal USG showed bilateral hydronephrosis in a male fetus. A repeat USG scan done few days later showed bilateral hydronephrosis with full bladder with reduced amniotic fluid. Emergency Caesarean Section was conducted. What is the FIRST likely investigation for the newborn?,Ultrasonography,Micturating Cystourethrogram,DMSA Scan,Renal Doppler,"Next Step: Diagnosis by demonstration of posterior urethral valves. Posterior urethral valves, the most common obstructive urethral lesions in infants and newborns, occur only in males and are found at the distal prostatic urethra. Demonstration of urethral valves on a voiding cystourethrogram establishes the diagnosis, as does endoscopic identification of valves. 2 possible answers for this question. a) Micturating Cystourethrogram b) Endoscopic identification of valve (in an emergency) In this question answer is Micturating Cystourethrogram. However, endoscopy is better because of severe obstruction indicated by b/l hydronephrosis and oligohydramnios. It can be clubbed with endoscopic destruction of the valve. Impoant: What does USG do? 1. Ultrasonography can be used to detect hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and bladder distension in children with severe azotemia. 2. It can also detect fetal hydronephrosis, which is typical of urethral valves, as early as 28 weeks of gestation - an enlarged bladder with bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is usually present in PUV. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves, but the approach depends on the degree of obstruction and the general health of the child. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves by endoscopic incision. In a premature infant with a small urethra prohibiting transurethral resection, a temporary cutaneous vesicostomy may be required to provide drainage and improve impaired kidney function.

Levo-bupivacaine is administered by which of the following route:,Nasogastric,Epidural,Intravenous,All,"B i.e. (Epidural) Bupivacaine is a potent cardiotoxic and long acting (duration of action 120-240 min) amide linked local anestheticQ. It is used for infiltration, nerve block, epidural and spinal anaesthesia of long duration. Epidural anaesthesia using bupivaine is very popular. Bupivacaine is drug of choice for labour analgesia. Bupivacaine is prone to prolong QTc interval and induce ventricular tachycardia or cardiac depression. So bupivacaine is contraindicated in IV regional anaesthesia. Maximum tolerable dose is 175 mg without epinephrine and 225mg with epinephrine. Commercial bupivacaine is a racemic mixture of 'R' & 'S' isomer. Levo bupivacine being 'S' isomer has less potential for toxicity and is as effective as racemic one. Bupivacaine is most potent & best agent for isobaric spinal anesthesia but cannot be used as surface (topical) anesthetic agent.Q Bupivacaine is contraindicated in regional IV anesthesia d/t fear of cardiac arrhythmiaQ. It can be used by following routes- IntrathecalQ - EpiduralQ - Peripheral nerve block All local anesthetics (LAs) bind & inhibit cardiac Na channels, but bupivacaine binds more avidly & longer than lignocaine. The bupivacaine R (+) isomer binds cardiac Na channels more avidly than S (-) isomer. This finding lead to development of levobupivacaine & ropivacaine.

Thoracic Outlet Syndrome 

Thoracic outlet syndrome ( TOS ) refers to compression of the subclavian vessels and nerves of the brachial plexus in the region of the thoracic inlet. ( note that even though the actual site of pathology is the thoracic inlet the condition is called thoracic outlet syndrome )
These neurovascular structures of the upper extremity may be compressed by a variety of structures, such as
Bone- cervical rib, abnormal first rib, long transverse process of C7, osteoarthritis
Muscles- scalenus
Trauma- neck hematoma, bone dislocation, clavicular fracture
Fibrous bands- congenital or acquired
Neoplasms- Pancoast's tumor emedicine.com writes


The primary cause is believed to be mechanical or postural. Stress, depression, overuse, and habit all can lead to the forward head, droopy shoulder, and collapsed chest posture that allows the thoracic outlet to narrow and compress the neurovascular structures. Accessory ribs or fibrous bands when present, predispose the site to narrow and compression.

Management

Initial method of management is nonsurgical.

Physical and occupational therapy:

improvements in a postural sitting, standing, and sleeping positions are recommended, along with behavior modification at work.
muscle strengthening and stretching exercises
superficial or deep heat therapy
50 to 90% of patients can be treated with these nonsurgical measures.

Which of the following is not true for ZollingerEllison syndrome: September 2008,Recurrence after operation,Reduced BAO : MAO ratio,Gastrin producing tumour,Diarrhoea may be a presenting feature,"Ans. B: Reduced BAO : MAO ratio Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare condition characterized by peptic ulcers that are refractory to conventional medical therapy. Gastrin-producing tumors or gastrinomas cause excessive gastric acid secretion, leading to ulcers of the upper GI tract, as well as diarrhea and severe abdominal pain. Laboratory studies to confirm the diagnosis of ZES include the following: Measurements of fasting serum gastrin levels - Gastrin levels higher than 100 pg,/mL are highly suggestive of ZES. If the gastric pH level is less than 2.5, a gastrin level of higher than 1000 pg/mL is diagnostic of ZES. If the patient is not receiving acid-suppressing medication and the gastric pH levels are higher than 2, ZES can be ruled out. Secretin stimulation test After blood to measure the basal gastrin level is obtained, 2 IU/kg of secretin is intravenously administered. Blood is obtained at 2.5 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and 30 minutes. An increase of serum gastrin levels to higher than 200 pg/mL is diagnostic of ZES. - It is the most impoant diagnostic test to exclude other conditions with increased acid secretion, hypergastrinemia, or both. - Clinical conditions in which patients present with hypergastrinemia, such as gastric outlet obstruction, pernicious anemia, renal failure, and achlorhydria due to atrophic gastritis, must be excluded with secretin provocative testing. Measurement of basal acid output - Before measurement of the basal acid output (BAO), acid-inhibitory agents must be discontinued: 24 hours for H2 receptor antagonists and 7 days for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). - In the 24 hours prior to the test, the patient receives antacids. - In an unoperated stomach, a BAO of more than 15 mEq/h is diagnostic of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. If the patient underwent gastric resection for acid reduction, a BAO of more than 10 mEq/h is diagnostic for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. If the patient has multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), other laboratory abnormalities may be suggestive of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. - High plasma calcium levels High parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels - High prolactin levels",B

All are true regarding Xenon anesthesia except,Slow induction and recovery,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side-effects,Low blood solubility,"Xenon is a ""noble"" gas that has long been known to have anesthetic propeies. It is an ine element that does not form chemical bonds. It is an odorless, nonexplosive, naturally occurring gas with a MAC of .71 and a blood/gas coefficient of 0.115, giving it very fast onset and emergence parameters. Xenon's anesthetic effects seem to be mediated by NMDA inhibition by competing with glycine at the glycine binding site. Xenon seems to have little effect on cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal systems and has been found to be protective against neuronal ischemia. Cost and limited availability have prevented its widespread use.

Innovation of refrigeration leading to better food preservation has led to decrease incidence of which of the following malignancies?,Esophagus,Colon,Oropharyngeal,Stomach,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Stomach ""This sharp decline (in gastric cancer) during the 20th century remains an unexplained yet staling phenomenon. The leading theories to explain this change concern the advent of refrigeration and infection with Helicobacter pylori."" Int. J. Epidemiol. (2001) 30 (1):181-182 Stomach cancer used to be the most common cause of cancer deaths in the early pa of the century. During the later half of the century a dramatic decline in the cancer incidence without any planned intervention was noted. Two major reasons have been advocated for this: 1. H. pylori infection: decrease incidence of H. pylori due to improved hygine and effective drugs. 2. Refrigeration: Refrigerators improved storage of food, thereby reducing intake of salt-based preserved food (high in nitrites and carcinogenic nitrosamines). Refrigeration also allowed for fresh food and vegetables to be more readily available, which are a valuable source of antioxidants impoant for cancer prevention. Salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite found in preserved food are potentially carcinogenic. Intake of salted food may increase the risk of H pylori infection and act synergistically to promote the development of gastric cancer.",D

For this reason, the Nd:YAG laser is capable of the greatest amount of tissue destruction with a single application. Ref: Schwaz's principle of surgery 9th edition, chapter 14.",C
Trichobezoar is pathological ingestion of: September 2009,Vegetable matter,Hair,Coins,Stones,"Ans. B: Hair Bezoars are collections or concretions of indigestible foreign material in the gastrointestinal tract. The term bezoars derives from the Arabic word Badzehr, which means antidote. Bezoars were used as antidotes and as magical medicinal agents against plague, snake-bite, sexual weakness, leprosy and epilepsy by physicians from 12th to 18th century. It can be trichobezoar or hairball, phytobezoar (food paicles/vegetable matter), trichphytobezoar (mixed), pharmacobezoar, lactobezoar, mycobezoar or pseudobezoar. Generally trichobezoars are in the stomach, but it may descend from the stomach into the intestine as far down as transverse colon termed as Rapunzel syndrome. The common presentation is as mobile and well defined lumps. They may present with malaise, weight loss, vague abdominal pain related to meals, anorexia, halitosis, vomiting, wasting and cachexia. They may cause a number of complications including gastritis, occult blood loss and secondary anemia, ulceration, perforation, obstruction, hemorrhage and intussusception. Diagnosis of trichobezoars rest on the clinical evidence of long standing trichophagy, abdominal mass and radiological investigations or CT scan and abdominal ultrasound but obtaining pieces of matted hair through endoscope is pathognomonic. Surgical removal at laparotomy or laparoscopeically is the treatment of choice. If small, they may be removed endoscopically. Biopsy devices, water jets, bezotomes and LASER devices may be used to fragment larger bezoars and lavaged out of the stomach. Counseling by a psychiatrist has an impoant role in the management to prevent recurrence. In any young girl, presenting with epigastric pain, vomiting and abdominal mass, trichbezoars should be considered as differential diagnosis",B

E.coli is the common organism. Usually phosphate stone. Occurs in bladder only. Primary vesical calculus - occurs in sterile urine. Usually oxalate stone(Jack stone). Usually comes down from kidney through ureter into the bladder and enlarges here. Most vesical calculi are formed de novo within the bladder, but some initially may have formed within the kidneys as a dissociated Randall plaque or on a sloughed papilla and subsequently may have passed into the bladder, where additional deposition of crystals cause the stone to grow. * Most renal stones that are small enough to pass through the ureters are also small enough to pass through a normally functioning bladder and an unobstructed urethra. * In older men with bladder stones composed of uric acid, the stone most likely formed in the bladder.* Stones composed of calcium oxalate are usually initially formed in the kidney.* In adults, MC type of vesical stone (seen in >50% of cases) is composed of uric acid. * Less frequently, bladder calculi are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, ammonium urate, cystine, or magnesium ammonium phosphate (when associated with infection). Endemic Bladder Calculi * In children, stones are composed mainly of ammonium acid urate, calcium oxalate, or an impure mixture of ammonium acid urate and calcium oxalate with calcium phosphate.* The common link among endemic areas relates to feeding infants human breast milk and polished rice.* These foods are low in phosphorus, ultimately leading to high ammonia excretion.* These children also usually have a high intake of oxalate-rich vegetables (increased oxalate crystalluria) and animal protein (low dietary citrate). * Vesical calculi may be single or multiple, especially in the presence of bladder diveicula, and can be small or large enough to occupy the entire bladder. They range from soft to extremely hard, with surfaces ranging from smooth and faceted to jagged and spiculated (""jack"" stones). * Most bladder stones are secondary, more common in older males (>50 years), usually because of bladder outlet obstruction.* MC type: Uric acid (sterile urine) > Struvite stones (Infected urine)* Bladder stones are usually solitary, multiple in 25% patients.Etiology* Bladder outlet obstruction (MC cause)* Neurogenic bladder* Foreign body (Foley's catheter, forgotten DJ stents)* Bladder diveiculaClinical Features* Typical symptoms are intermittent, painful voiding and terminal hematuria with severe pain at the end of micturition.* Pain may be referred to the tip of the penis or to the labia majora.Diagnosis* A large percentage of bladder stones are radiolucent (uric acid).* USG bladder: Identifies the stone with its characteristic shadowing and stone moves with changing body position.Treatment* Small stones: Removed or crushed transurethrally (Cystolitholapexy)* Larger stones: Disintegrated by transurethral electrohydraulic lithotripsy or Cystolithotomy Stones of Genitourinary Tract * MC renal stone: Calcium oxalate* MC primary bladder stone: Ammonium urate* MC bladder stone: Uric acid >Struvite* MC prostate stone: Calcium phosphate Ref : Bailey and Love 25/e p1323",C

All are true about chronic osteomyelitis except ?,Reactive new bone formation,Cloaca is an opening in involucrum,Involucrum is dead bone,Sequestrum is hard and porus,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Involucrum is dead bone Pathology in chronic osteomyelitis Chronic osteomyelitis occurs most commonly in long bones. Bone is destroyed or devitalized in the affected pa. Cavities containing pus and pieces of dead bone (sequestra) are surrounded by vascular tissue, and beyond that by areas of sclerosis due to reaction new bone formation, which may take the form of a distinct bony sheath (involucrum) Often sinus track leads to the skin surface; the sinus tends to heal and present down recurrently, but if a sequestrum is present it never heals permanently. This is because sequestra act as substrate for bacterial adhesion in much the same way as foreign implants, ensuring the persistence of infection until they are removed or discharged through perforations in the involucrum and sinuses that drain to the skin. Sequestrum Sequestrum is apiece of dead bone, surrounded by infected granulation tissue trying to eat the sequestrum away. The sequestrum is hard, rough, porus, light in weight and lighter in colour than normal. Normal pattern of bone is lost.(Note : Sequestrum in syphilis and TB is heavier than normal bone because sclerosis usually precedes the death of the bone). On x-ray, sequestra show up as unnatural dense fragments, in contrast to the surrounding osteopenic bone. Involucrum Involucrum is reactive new bone overlying a sequestrum. There may be some holes in the involucrum for pus to drain out. These holes are called cloaca.",C

All are true about pleomorphic adenoma EXCEPT:,Malignant transformation risk is high,Mixed tumor,Benign tumour,Encapsulated,"ANSWER: (A) Malignant transformation risk is highREF: Robbin s 8th ed chapter 16, Sabiston 18th ed chapter 33See PLATE P-18 A KEY PLATE P-18 KEYSALIVARY GLAND TUMORS(A) PLEOMORPHIC ADENOMAMorphology. Most pleomorphic adenomas present as rounded, well-demarcated masses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatest dimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations (particularly the palate) the capsule is not fully developed, and expansile growth produces protrusions into the surrounding gland, rendering enucleation of the tumor hazardous. The cut surface is gray-white with myxoid and blue translucent areas of chondroid.The dominant histologic feature is the great heterogeneity mentioned. In the typical morphology' epithelial.'' myoepithelial areas (right arrowhead) are punctuated by myxochondroid areas (arrows). The epithelial elements resembling ductal cells or myoepithelial cells are arranged in duct formations, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or sheets of cells. These elements are typically' dispersed within a mesenchyme-like background of loose myxoid tissue containing islands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone. Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ducts lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layer of deeply' chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In other instances there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelial cells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium may also be present. In most cases there is no epithelial dysplasia or evident mitotic activity.(B) WARTHIN'S TUMOR:Most Warthin tumors are round to oval, encapsulated masses, 2 to 5 cm in diameter, usually arising in the superficial parotid gland, where they are readily palpable. Transection reveals a pale gray' surface punctuated by narrow' cystic or deftlike spaces filled with a mudnous or serous secretion.On microscopic examination there is Papillary projections lined by a double layer of neoplastic epithelial cells resting on a dense lymphoid stroma sometimes bearing germinal centers. Outer oncocytic layer of columnar cells having an abundant, finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm (red arrow'). Secretory cells are dispersed in the columnar cell layer, accounting for the secretions within the cystically dilated lumens. Inner oncocytic lay'er of cuboidal to polygonal cells (green arrow) resting on lymphoid stroma (yreilow arrow)(C) MUCOEPIDERMOID CARCINOMA: Mucoepidermoid carcinomas can grow as large as 8 cm in diameter and although they are apparently circumscribed, they lack well-defined capsules and are often infiltrative at the margins. Pale and gray-white on transection, they frequently contain small, mucin-containing cysts. The basic histologic pattern is that of cords, sheets, or cystic configurations three distinct cell lines of squamous/ epidermoid cells (long white arrow), mucous cells (black arrow), or intermediate cells (short white arrow). The hybrid cell types often have squamous features, with small to large mucus-filled vacuoles, best seen when highlighted with mucin stains. The tumor cells may be regular and benign appearing or, alternatively, highly anaplastic and unmistakably malignant. Accordingly, mucoepidermoid carcinomas are subclassified into low, intermediate, or high grade.(D) ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA: In gross appearance, they are generally small, poorly encapsulated, infiltrative, gray-pink lesions. On histologic evaluation, they are composed of multiple basaloid epithelial cells having dark, compact nuclei and scant cytoplasm arranged in cribriform architecture (arrow A) with perineural invasion (arrow B). The spaces between the tumor cells are often filled with a hyaline material thought to represent excess basement membrane. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign, encapsulated mixed tumor of parotid gland. Malignant mixed tumors include both cancers originating from pleomorphic adenomas, termed carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, and de novo malignant mixed tumors. The risk for malignant transformation of benign pleomorphic adenomas is 1.5% within the first 5 years but increases to 9.5% once the benign tumor has been present for more than 15 years.",A

Pt. with chronic pancreatitis gives chain of lakes appearance in ERCP examination. Management is:,Total pancreatectomy,Sphincteroplasty,Side to side pancreatico jejunostomy,Resecting the tail of pancreas and performing a pancreatojejunostomy,"Ans. is 'c' ie. side to side pancreatico jejunostomy Areas of ductal dilatation alternating with areas of ductal stenosis are common finding in alcoholic patients who have severe chronic pancreatitis. This type of duct obstruction cannot be relieved by a sphincteroplasty because of multiple areas of stenosis along the duct. Although total pancreatectomy would be a beneficial approach, moality and morbidity rate with this procedure are extremely high. Thus the procedure of choice in this pt. is side to side pancreaticojejunostomy in which the duct is opened longitudinally through the chain of lakes.

"All are causes of pulmonary hypeension except,",Hyperventilation,Morbid obesity,High altitude,Fenfluramine,"Hyperventilation [Ref Harrison 17th/e p. 1579; 161h/e p. 14041 There are three main causes of pulmonary hypeension:- i) Cardiac diseases ii) Respiratory disease iii) Pulmonary thromboembolic disease Cardiac diseases -Lead to pulmonary hypeension by increasing pulmonary blood flow (e.g., large left to right shunt) or by increasing pulmonary venous pressure (e.g., L V. failure). In Respiratory diseases, - The predominant mechanism for the pulmonary hypeension is an increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow arising from perivascular parenchymal changes coupled with pulmonary vasoconstriction due to hypoxia. * In pulmonary thromboembolic disease, - Clots in pulmonary vessels increase resistance to blood flow causing pulmonary hypeension. Now about other options mentioned in the question. Alveolar hyperventilation Pulmonary hypeension is seen in Alveolar hypoventilation (not hyperventilation). In patients with alveolar hypoventilation the primary pathogenic mechanism responsible for pulmonary hypeension is alveolar hypoxia potentiated by respiratory acidosis. (alveolar hypoxia leads to constriction of pulmonary vessels). Regardless of the etiology, whether pulmonary hypeenstion will occur in patients with alveolar hypoventilation depends on whether there is sufficient alveolar and aerial hypoxia to raise pulmonary aerial pressure considerably. In sleep apnea syndrome seen in obese individuals - Severe aerial hypomexia occurs during sleep due to hypoventilation (apnea). This causes pulmonary hypeension during sleep. After some point of time, the pulmonary hypeension may continue even during the day time. Anorexiants Pulmonary hypeension has been associated with anorexiants. ""A causal relationship has been established between exposure to several anorexigens including aminorex and fenfluramine and development of pulmonary aery hypeension.""",A

(Described ahead in detail). Theoretically all the options can cause 'Tree-in-bud' sign (although Klebsiella has not been mentioned in the list). So the next clue is Bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplant causes a transient state of immunological deficiency leading to a wide variety of oppounistic infections. Among the given options, according to the table and text of Harrison (17/e chapter 'Infections in Transplant Recipients') Pneumocystis and RSV can cause pneumonia after transplant: butPneumocystis is a much more common than RSV.

(Not seen on X-rays) Peripheral, small, centrilobular nodules are connected to linear, branching opacities that have more than one contiguous branching site, thus resembling a budding or, fruiting tree: this is known as tree-in-bud-pattern. It represents dilated and impacted (mucus or pus-filled) centrilobular bronchioles. The presence of tree-in-bud is indicative of small airway disease. It is most commonly associated with endobronchial spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. But it can also be seen in a large number of conditions. Pulmonary infectious disorders involving the small airways are the most common causes of the tree-in-bud sign.

Ketamine is contraindicated in?,Status asthmaticus,Obstetric hemorrhage,Glaucoma,Shock,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Glaucoma Contraindications of Ketamine1. CNS - Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol & etomidate which have cerebroprotective effect - Ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, Intracranial space occupying lesion and for neuro-anesthesia. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the arterial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT.2. Cardiovascular - Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant & vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and heart rate - Cardiac O2 demand is increased - Ketamine is contraindicated in aortic aneurysm, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease. Ketamine also sensitizes the heart to adrenaline - arrhythmias may occur. As ketamine cause sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolemia.3.

Agent causing malignant hypehermia is?,Succinylcholine,1120,Ether,Verapamil,"Succinylcholine REF: Goodman and Gillman p. 152 11th edition ""Succinylcholine is the most common drug used in anesthesia to cause Malignant Hypehermia"" MALIGNANT HYPEHERMIA Malignant hypehermia is a potentially life-threatening event triggered by ceain anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agents. Clinical features: contracture, rigidity, and heat production from skeletal muscle resulting in severe hypehermia, accelerated muscle metabolism, metabolic acidosis, and tachycardia. Mechanism: Uncontrolled release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle is the initiating event. Although the halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics (e.g., halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane) and succinylcholine alone repoedly precipitate the response, most incidents arise from the combination of depolarizing blocking agent and anesthetic. Susceptibility to malignant hypehermia, an autosomal dominant trait Treatment: Intravenous administration of dantrolene (DANTRIUM), which blocks Ca2+release and its sequelae in skeletal muscle. Rapid cooling, inhalation of 100% oxygen, and control of acidosis should be considered adjunct therapy in malignant hypehermia",A

Most of the anaesthetic drugs are detectable by entropy monitoring except:,Isoflurane,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,Sevoflurane,"Entropy monitoringis a method of assessing the effect of ceain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now pa of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in electroencephalogram(EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8Hz to 32Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, hea rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings.",C

Anaesthetic of choice in asthma patients: March 2007,Halothane,Thipentone,Ketamine,Feanyl,"Ans. C: Ketamine Ketamine is classified as an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspaate) receptor antagonist, and at high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to opioid (mu) receptors and sigma receptors. Like other drugs of this class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as ""dissociative anaesthesia"" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anaesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. It is primarily used for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, usually in combination with some sedative drug. Ketamine is usually injected intravenously or intramuscularly, but it is also effective when insufflated, smoked, or taken orally. When used at anaesthetic doses, it will usually stimulate rather than depress the circulatory system, so I/ V anaesthetic of choice for shock. Ketainine produces a dissociative state, characterised by a sense of detachment from one's physical body and the external world which is known as depersonalization and derealization. At sufficiently high doses users may experience what is coined the ""K-hole"", a state of dissociation whose effects are thought to mimic the phenomenology of schizophrenia.",C
"In follow up of BPH, most impoant indication of surgery is:",Prostate size >75gm,Single episode of UTI requiring 3 day antibiotics,Cannot use medication due to hypeension,Bilateral hydronephrosis,"Ans is d i.e. Bilateral hydronephrosis ""Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones.""- Schwaz 8/e p1530About other options:Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwaz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology 17/e p354)UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypeension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypeensive persons.Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the paient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below.Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH1) Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal)2) Recurrent UTI from BPH3) Bladder stones d/t BPH4) Renal insufficiency d/t BPH5) Large bladder diveicula secondary to BPH6) Recurrent gross hematuria from BPHUpper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwaz.Medical therapyAlpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin)Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base.5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) ?5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use).SurgerySurgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed.The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate.Conventional surgical methods:Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method)Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) ?- When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes""too large"" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g areusually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladderdiveiculum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.- Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology.Minimally invasive methods:1.

What is true about branchial cyst?,Present in anterior triangle of neck,Cauterization is done,Arises from 2nd cleft,Present in lower 3rd of neck,"BRANCHIAL CYST

It arises from the remnants of second branchial cleft. Normally, 2nd, 3rd, 4th clefts disappear to form a smooth neck. Persistent 2nd cleft is called as cervical sinus (of His) which eventually gets sequestered to form branchial cyst. 
Epithelial infusion within lymph node may be the other cause as branchial cyst contains lymphoid tissues in their wall. 
Six branchial arches with five pharyngeal pouches (endoderm lining) inside and five pharyngeal clefts (ectoderm lining) outside are present. 

Treatment

Excision under GA. 
Cyst is in relation to carotids, hypoglossal nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, spinal accessory nerve,  posterior belly of digastric and pharyngeal wall. Medially it is close to the posterior pillar of tonsils. During dissection, all these structures should be taken care of. 

Note:

Sclerotherapy with OK-432 (picibanil) has been effective, often done under US guidance. 
In fish, branchial clefts develop into gills.

Mostly the underlying cause is a duct papilloma or duct ectasia, but since the chances of malignancy are high, it must be investigated further. The risk of malignancy increases if an underlying mass is present.
Investigation used are

Mammography - can show any underlying suspicious lesion.
Cytological examination - this may identify malignant cells, but a negative finding does not rule out cancer.
Galactography/Ductography.


The primary indication for ductography is nipple discharge, particularly when bloody.
Ductography though helpful in reaching a diagnosis is not essential since excision of the bloody duct system is indicated regardless of finding.
In this study, a contrast medium is injected into the discharging duct and a mammogram taken. The injected may show an intraductal papilloma as a filling defect surrounded by contrast. Cancers may appear as irregular masses or as multiple intraluminal filling defects, or abrupt obstruction. Duct ectasia or fibrocystic disease may appear as dilated cystic structures.
Ultrasound - may show the presence of an underlying mass or duct ectasia.
The final diagnosis is made by excising the involved duct (Microdochotomy) and any underlying mass if present and subjecting them for a histopathological diagnosis.

It has been used safely in children as young as 6 months of age. Ipecac should not be given to a patient who has ingested a corrosive poison, such as strong acid or alkali, because of the possibility of gastric perforation and fuher necrosis of the esophagus. When vomiting imposes a risk of aspiration, as in the case of an obtunded or comatose patient or in the case of impending seizures precipitated by the ingested drug, syrup of ipecac is contraindicated. Hydrocarbons such as mineral oil have a low viscosity and surface tension; the latter propey accounts for the spreading tendency of the product and the potential for aspiration. Very minute amounts of aspirated hydrocarbon can cause a necrotizing pneumonia. Syrup of ipecac should be used only when the primary toxicity of the hydrocarbon is systemic, as, for example, with carbon tetrachloride or benzene. Administration of activated charcoal alone without prior gut emptying is being used for ceain ingestions.

Carcinoma in which surgery is rarely indicated,Osteosarcoma,Wilm's tumor,Neuroblastoma,Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) (or simply bone cancer) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid. Treatment A complete radical, surgical, en bloc resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma. Although about 90% of patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications, paicularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence may cause the need for fuher surgery or amputation. Mifamuide is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists. Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical oncologist and an ohopedic oncologist experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell necrosis (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery. Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage ohopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-aerial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low. Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best repoed 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-aerial regimen that individualizes therapy based on aeriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65-70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia. Computational analysis on a panel of Osteosarcoma cell lines identified new shared and specific therapeutic targets (proteomic and genetic) in Osteosarcoma, while phenotypes showed an increased role of tumor microenvironments Ref : Internet sources",A

Exception of Meyer-Oveon rule are all except,Non anaesthetics,Non immobilizer,Cut off effect,Hydrophobic site of action,"Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or ""lipoid-based"" anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that ""All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anaesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

Position for orotracheal intubation?,Extension of neck and atlantoccipital joint,Extension of only neck,Flexion of neck only,Flexion of neck and extension of atlantoccipital joint,"Ans. d (Flexion of neck and extension of atlantoccipital joint) (Ref. Head and Neck Surgery - Otolaryngology 3rd/Ch. 58)OROTRACHEAL INTUBATION# Orotracheal intubation is undertaken ideally with the patient in the sniffing position, the patient's neck flexed slightly on the chest, and the head extended slightly on the neck.# A right-handed operator directs a laryngoscope into the right aspect of the mouth with the left hand holding the scope and pushing the tongue to the left.# A Macintosh laryngoscope with a curved blade is directed into the vallecula, and the entire larynx is lifted anteriorly or ventrally to expose the glottis. A Miller laryngoscope with a straight blade is introduced under the epiglottis. It fixes the larynx at the petiole of the epiglottis and lifts the larynx anteriorly to expose the glottis.# Other varieties of laryngoscopes now exist, but the Macintosh and the Miller are the most likely to be found on an emergency cart.# The right hand is used to insert the endotracheal tube, which should not be overly tight in the glottis. In children, an air leak around the tube is desirable.# Slight pressure on the cricoid cartilage by an assistant sometimes helps to visualize the larynx. This maneuver also can help to prevent aspiration of gastric contents by pressing the cricoid cartilage backward against the vertebral column to close the esophagus and help prevent regurgitation. This technique is desirable when a patient has a full stomach.TracheostomyFollowing induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation, the patient is positioned with a combination of head extension and placement of an appropriate sandbag under the shoulders. There should be no rotation of the head. Children's heads should nor be overextended as it is possible to enter the trachea in the fifth or sixth rings under thesecircumstances.REVIEW OF AIRWAY TECHNIQUES (Temporizing/Adjunctive Measures)# Chin lift/jaw thrust to open airway - caveat: no neck extension if suspected C-spine injury# Bag-valve-mask ventilation - probably the most important, yet under-appreciated, skill of airway management. In the ED, when bagging, use a two-hands on the mask technique for a tight seal, and always use an oral airway# Suctioning/removal of foreign bodies# Nasal airway - generally well-tolerated by the temporarily obtunded patient (e.g. post-ictal, post-procedural sedation, intoxicated)# Oral airway - aids in peri-intubation ventilation; not to be used in patient with intact gag reflex# Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) - this device is inserted into the mouth and has a cuff that occludes the hypopharynx. It has a port through which ventilation can then occur. A variation is the Intubating LMA - this allows the insertion of an endotracheal tube via the ventilation port. The LMA is used both as a rescue device in failed intubation, and as a primary airway device# Needle cricothyroidotomy - accomplished by inserting a needle in cricothyroid membrane, and oxygenating the patient using high pressure oxygen source",D

"In a Pt. with head injury, unexplained hypotension warrants evaluation of :",Upper cervical spine,Lower cervical spine,Thoracic spine,All,"B i.e. Lower cervical spine In a patient unconscious from a head injury, or facial trauma a fracture cervical spine should be assumed untill proven otherwiseQ. Lower cervical spine fractures and dislocations are more common in incidence and are more commonly associated with spinal cord damage in comparison to upper cervical spine fractures. (d/t lesser spinal canal diameter) Due to vital functions of the nearby neurovascular structures, injuries to the upper cervical spine carry a high liklihood of death. Craniocervical injuries (occipital condyle fracture) may cause palsy of IX, X, XI and XII cranial nerves. Approximately 20% of patients with cervical trauma are hypotensive upon presentation, and most of them are lower cervical spine fractureQ. The hypotension is neurogenic in origin in about 70% of cases and is related to hypovolemia in 30% Neurogenc shock is due to loss of normal vasoconstrictive sympathetic control of the peripheral vasculature thus causing loss of normal sympathetic response to low blood pressure. In distinction from hemorrhagic shock, in which compensatory tachycardiaQ is usually present neurogenic shock results in hypotension accompanied by bradycardiaQ.

A 56 year old woman has not passed stools for the last 14 days. Xray shows no air fluid levels. Probable diagnosis is ?,Paralytic ileus,Aganglionosis of the colon,Intestinal pseudo-obstruction,Duodenal obstruction,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Intestinal pseudoobstruction The information provided in the question is too less, but we have to come to a diagnosis based on the provided information. Lets see each option one by one. a) Paralytic ileus - multiple air fluid levels are noted, hence ruled out. b) Aganglionosis of the colon or Hirshprung's ds. - presents in infancy or childhood, hence ruled out d) Duodenal obstruction multiple air fluid levels are not noted, but the dominant symptom is recurrent, vomiting, which is not mentioned, hence ruled out. c) Intestinal pseudo-obstruction it's the most likely diagnosis, as air fluid levels are not seen in it. Harrison writes - ""The symptom of chronic pseudoobstruction are chronic or intermittent constipation, crampy abdominal pain, anorexia and bloating. Abdominal xrays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction."" Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points upto 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2.5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus. They are not seen in colonic obstruction and pseudoobstruction. They may be seen in colonic obstruction if the ileocecal valve is incompetent.",C
All of the following effects the height of block in spinal anesthesia except,Age,Height,Sex,Weight,"Explanation The gender of the patient is the factor that least affects the height of the neuraxial block, among the options given. Gender can affect the block height theoretically. The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of ""normal-sized"" adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height.",C

Reflux esophagitis is prevented by -a) Long intraabdominal esophagusb) Increased intraabdominal pressurec) Right crus of diaphragmd) Increased intrathoracic pressure,ab,bc,abc,bcd,"The principle barrier to reflux is the Lower esophageal sphincter. LES comprises the lower 4 cm of esophagus, where resting pressure within the lumen normally exceeds the intragastric pressure. This high intraluminal pressure at LES prevents the GE reflux. The LES is a physiological entity rather than any anatomical structure
Several factors contribute to the high intraluminal pressure of LES 
a) Intrinsic musculature of distal esophagus

these muscle fibres differ from those in other areas of the esophagus in that they are in a state of tonic contraction. They normally relax with initiation of a swallow and then return to a state of tonic contraction.


Sling fibres of the cardia
Crura of the diaphragm
Intraabdominal pressure

- the intraabdominal pressure compresses the intraabdominal segment of esophagus (ie LES) and is probably the most important factor in preventing the reflux.
- CSDT writes - ""Sphincter competance is a function of sphincter pressure, sphincter length and the length exposed to intraabdominal pressure"".
- In cases of sliding hernia the gastroesophageal junction shifts to posterior mediastinum. The LES is then exposed to the low intrathoracic pressure instead of the high intraabdominal pressure. The low intrathoracic pressure is unable to prevent the reflux in sliding hernia.

Other factors apart from LES which prevent the reflux 


The gastroesophageal angle - the oblique entry of esophagus has a valvular effect, in that it closes the esophagus when the gastric fundus distends
The folds of mucosa at the cardia helps in closing the LES when intragastric pressure rises.


The intrathoracic pressure has no role in preventing reflux. It's too low (ranging from -5 to +5 mm of Hg).",C

A 2. 5-cm tumor at the base of the appendix (SELECT 1 PROCEDURE)",Appendectomy,Segmental ileal resection,Cecectomy,Right hemicolectomy,"Carcinoid tumors are most commonly found in the appendix and small bowel, where they may be multiple. They have a tendency to metastasize, which varies with the size of the tumor. Tumors <1 cm uncommonly metastasize. Tumors >2.0 cm are more often found to be metastatic. Metastasis to the liver and beyond may give rise to the carcinoid syndrome. The tumors cause an intense desmoplastic reaction. Spread into the serosal lymphatics does not imply metastatic disease; local resection is potentially curative. When metastatic lesions are found in the liver, they should be resected when technically feasible to limit the symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. When extensive hepatic metastases are found, the disease is not curable. Resection of the appendix and cecum may be performed to prevent an early intestinal obstruction by locally encroaching tumor.",D

Prazosin, Terazosin (a, blockers) & Tamsulosin, Alf blockers) b) 5 a reductase inhibitors - eg. Finasteride, Dutasteride, Triptorelin pamoate a-Adrenergic blockers Since activation of a, receptors in the bladder neck, prostate and prostatic urethra increases their smooth muscle tone, their blockade relaxes these structures, reducing the dynamic obstruction and increasing the urinary flow rate. 5a reductase inhibitor These drugs prevent the conversion of testosterone into more active dihydrotestosterone responsible for androgen action in many tissues including prostate. Their use results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptom. But six months of therapy is required to see the maximum effect on prostate size and symptomatic improvement and symptomatic improvement is seen only in men with enlarged prostate (> 40 cm3) Ref Smith's Urology 17/e. Since the patient in the question needs to relieve him of his symptoms till he gets fit to be operated, an a blocker (Terazocin) would be used. a-blockers afford faster and greater symptomatic relief than finasteride. The bad point about a blocker is that their effect lasts only till drug is given and even with continued therapy, benefits may decline after several years due to disease progression. About Combination therapy Combination of both these class of drugs is used by surgeons to derive combined benefit from both; its use is not justified in this patient as he needs to alleivate his symptoms till he gets operated - the definitive & most effective t/t.",B

Dietery factors associated with colon carcinoma -a) High fiberb) Low fiberc) Smoked fishd) High fat intakee) Japanese are common to develop Ca colon,abc,ade,ace,bde,"A high incidence of colorectal cancer is seen in economically prosperous, upper socioeconomic class. This observation led to attention on environmental factors, particularly diet in the etiology of colon cancer.
Dietary factors associated with colon cancers are: 

Animal fat

diet high in animal fats such as found in red meat (beef pork, lamb) and processed meat (Sausages, hams & bacan etc.) increases the risk of colon cancer.
A diet high in saturated or polyunsaturated fats increases risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet high in oleic acid (olive oil, coconut oil, fish oil) does not increase risk.
consumption of fish (including fresh, canned, salted and smoked fish decrease the risk of colon cancer. This is because of the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 fatty acids found in fishes.
note that consumption of chicken has no effect on colon cancer.

Fibres

though Harrison writes that dietary fibres play no role in colon cancer, all other books i.e. Schwartz, CSDT & Maingot's are of the view that a high fibre diet has protective effect and a low fibre diet increases the risk.


Alcohol - is also a risk factor
Ingestion of calcium, selenium, vitamin A, C & E, carotenoids, and plant phenols decrease the risk of colon cancer.
Insulin resistance

a high calorie diet coupled with physical inactivity leads to excess weight gain and insulin resistance which further causes increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors type I (IGF-I). This growth factor appears to stimulate proliferation of intestinal mucosa",D
"A 25 year old male repos episodic ""spells"" characterized by palpitations, sweating, nervousness, and feelings of anxiety. On examination, the man's blood pressure is 165/95 mm Hg.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's hypeension?",11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency,Conn's syndrome,Pheochromocytoma,Renin-secreting tumor,"A pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from chromaffin cells that secretes excess catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or both). It is one endocrine cause of hypeension, due to peripheral vasoconstriction and/or increased cardiac output. While most patients have higher than normal baseline plasma levels of catecholamines, it is not uncommon for paroxysmal symptomatic episodes to be superimposed upon the basal problem. These ""attacks"" may occur several times a week (or more often) and last for up to 15 minutes. During an attack, respiration can increase, the patient may become aware of a forceful pounding of the hea that progresses to include a throbbing headache, and peripheral vasoconstriction can raise body temperature and lead to reflex sweating. Marked anxiety may also accompany the episode. Diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring increased plasma or urinary catecholamines or their metabolites. 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a congenital disorder than can cause hypeension due to excessive production of the weak mineralocoicoid, deoxycoicosterone, by the inner two zones of the adrenal coex. This results in excessive renal retention of sodium and water and subsequent hypeension. While the hypeension is usually present from bih, a late-onset variant of this disorder has been described in which the symptoms do not present until late childhood or adolescence. Virilization is also present due to excessive secretion of adrenal androgens. Conn's syndrome is another endocrine cause of hypeension. In this case, the increase in blood pressure is due to excessive renal retention of sodium and water resulting from the increased plasma concentration of aldosterone. The paroxysmal symptoms and increased catecholamines present in this patient are not present with primary hyperaldosteronism. Renin-secreting tumors are rare and can be confused with primary hyperaldosteronism. The excessive secretion of renin by the tumor can increase the formation of angiotensin II with subsequent hyperaldosteronism. Sodium and water retention, together with hypokalemia, are present. Increased plasma renin and plasma aldosterone are suggestive of a renin-secreting tumor, whereas primary hyperaldosteronism would present as increased plasma aldosterone, but decreased plasma renin.

Pseudoaerial aneurysm in drug abuser&;s seen in,Radial,Brachial,Femoral,Carotid,"Pseudoaneurysm is a rare condition arising from disruption in aerial wall with blood dissecting into the tissues around the damaged aery creating a perfused sac that communicates with the aerial lumen. Its incidence is on rise due to increase in endovascular procedures, hemodialysis and intravenous drug abuse. Here we repo an young male who was found by a NGO worker, lying on roadside near a Mandir with a pulsatile inguinal swelling and blood oozing out from it. He was taken immediately to emergency depament of LN Hospital. He was a rickshaw puller and known drug addict. The swelling was diagnosed as pseudo-aneurysm of common femoral aery on clinical examination and by Doppler ultrasonogrphy. He was referred to CTVS depament and admitted there for surgery. In the meanwhile, he collapsed in the hospital toilet and died due to hemorrhagic shock consequent upon rupture of pseudo- aneurysm of femoral aery.

All true about hemlichs maneuver except:-,It is used in foreign body aspiration,Abdominal thrust is given,Effective in choking,Can be effective in cardiac arrest patients,"IN CARDIAC ARREST WE DO Cardio Pulmonary Cerebral Resusitation. If a choking victim becomes unresponsive, call for help and immediately sta CPR, beginning with chest compressions. For pediatric CPR, if a single rescuer is present, then chest compression to ventilation is performed in a ratio of 30:2. If there are 2 or more rescuers, then the ratio is 15:2. While giving rescue breaths, the airway is checked for a foreign body. If it is accessible, then the object can be removed. If not, then CPR is continued. Blind finger sweeping may be hazardous as it can push the object fuher down the airway. If the child is responsive, then abdominal thrusts are performed to help relieve airway obstruction. In a choking infant who is responsive, 5 back slaps between the shoulder blades and 5 downward thrusts on the chest are given in order to dislodge the foreign body.",D

Metastasis from follicular carcinoma should be treated by: September 2007,Radioiodine,Surgery,Thyroxine,Observation,"Ans. A: Radioiodine Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated tumor. In fact, FTC resembles the normal microscopic pattern of the thyroid. FTC originates in follicular cells and is the second most common cancer of the thyroid, after papillary carcinoma. Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are considered to be differentiated thyroid cancers; together they make up 95% of thyroid cancer cases. Papillary/follicular carcinoma must be considered a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (mixed form), and Huhle cell carcinoma should be considered a variant of FTC. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, follicular carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, FTC tumors may spread easily to other organs. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years. Patients with FTC are more likely to develop lung and bone metastases than are patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The bone metastases in FTC are osteolytic. Older patients have an increased risk of developing bone and lung metastases. The initial treatment for cancer of the thyroid is surgical. The exact nature of the surgical procedure to be performed depends for the most pa on the extent of the local disease. A total thyroidectomy is performed if the primary tumor is larger than 1 cm in diameter or if there is extrathyroidal involvement or distant metastases. Clinically evident lymphadenopathy should be removed with a neck dissection. If the primary tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter, a unilateral lobectomy might be considered. About 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients must have radioiodine to detect and destroy any metastasis and any residual tissue in the thyroid.",A

"All of the following test are used to test the posterior glenohumeral instability, EXCEPT:",Jerk test,Circumduction test,Sulcus test,Jahnke tes,"Tests for posterior shoulder instability: Jerk test: With the patient sitting and the shoulder abducted to 90 degree and medially rotated, the clinician applies a longitudinal cephalad force to the humerus and move the arm into horizontal flexion. a positive test is indicated if there is a sudden jerk as the arm is moved in to horizontal flexion and it is returned to the sta position. Posterior drawer test: The examiner passively displaces the humeral head in a posterior direction. Pain, clicking, or an increase in humeral translation indicate a positive test. Posterior apprehension test: The patient lies supine, with the shoulder flexed and internally rotated and with the elbow flexed and resting on the trunk. A posterior force is transmitted by the examiner through the subject's elbow. A look of apprehension and resistance to fuher movement constitute a positive result. Push - pull test: The patient is positioned supine with the shoulder placed at a 90 degree of scapular plane abduction. The examiner grasps the subject's wrist with one hand while the other hand is placed anteriorly near the humeral head. The examiner simultaneously pulls upward through the long axis of the forearm while pushing the humeral head posteriorly. A look of apprehension or displacement of the humeral head greater than 50% represent a positive test. Circumduction test: The patient is in standing position. The examiner stands behind the patient grasping the patient's forearm with the hand. The examiner begins circumduction by extending the patients arm while maintaining slight abduction. As the circumduction continues into elevation, the arm is brought over the top and into the flexed and adducted position. As the arm moves into forward flexion and adduction from above. it is vulnerable to posterior subluxation if the patient is unstable posteriorly. if the examiner palpate the posterior aspect of the patient shoulder as the arm moves downward in forward flexion and adduction, the humeral head will be felt to subluxate posteriorly in a positive test. Jahnke test: A Posteriorly directed force applied to the forward flexed shoulder. The shoulder i sthe moved into the coronal plane as an anteriorly directed force is applied to the humeral head. A clunk occur as the humeral head reduces from the subluxed position. Test for inferior shoulder instability Sulcus sign: The patient stands with the arm by the side and shoulder muscles relaxed. The examiner grasps the patient's forearm below the elbow and pulls the arm distally. a positive test suggesting inferior instability of the shoulder is indicated if patient's pain reproduced and/or a sulcus appears distal to the acromion.

Fructose is taken in by humans as sucrose, sucrose-containing syrups, and the free sugar. Fructose is mainly phos-phorylated to fructose-1-phosphate by liver fructokinase. Aldol cleavage by fructose-1-phosphate-specific aldolase, not enolase, yields glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glyceraldehyde is phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triose kinase, and both triose phosphates can enter glycolysis. Excess fructose from commercial foods can exercise adverse effects by raising blood lipids and uric acid. Fructose phosphorylation bypasses phosphofructokinase, a regulatory enzyme of glycolysis and provides excess glycerol metabolites and excess triglyceride lipid biosynthesis. Fructose phosphorylation can also deplete liver cell ATP, lessening its inhibition of adenine nucleotide degradation and increasing production of uric acid. In adipocytes, fructose can be alternatively phosphorylated by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate. However, this reaction is competitively inhibited by appreciable amounts of glucose, as it is in other tissues.",A

Most cases are caused by laryngeal oedema. The most important cause of laryngeal oedema is a tension haematoma.TransientHypocalcemiaCommonly occurs 24 to 48 hours after thyroidectomy but infrequently requires treatment.Markedly symptomatic or serum calcium < 7 mg/dL are given 1-2 ampules (10 to 20 mL) of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 1 to 2 min, followed by temporary' oral calcium carbonate (500 mg orally TDS).More prolonged IV replacement by mixing 6 ampules of 10% calcium gluconate in dextrose 5% in water (D5W), 500 mL, for infusion at 1 mL/kg'hour.PermanentHypocalcemiaPermanent hypoparathyroidism is uncommon after total thyroidectomy. Incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism is < 1%. Present dramatically 2-5 days after operation. Normal parathyroid tissue removed or devascularized at the time of total thyroidectomy must be minced into 1 x 3-mm fragments and autotransplanted into individual muscle pockets in the sternocleidomastoid muscle to maximize the chances that the patient will not develop postoperative hypoparathyroidismRLN injuryUnilateral RLN injury causes hoarseness, and bilateral injury compromises the airway, necessitating tracheostomy. Unilateral or bilateral recurrent nerve paralysis will not cause immediate postoperative respiratory obstruction unless laryngeal oedema is also present but it wall aggravate the obstruction. RLN palsy rate of 1.8% at 1 month declining to 0.5% at 3 months for first-time operations. RLN can be repaired primarily or with a nerve graftSuperior laryngeal nerve injuryVoice changes, huskiness, poor volume voice fatigue, and inability to sing at higher rangesThyroidinsufficiencyTnis results from a change in the autoimmune response, from stimulation to destruction of the thyroid cells.Thyrotoxic crisis (storm)It occurs if a thyrotoxic patient has been inadequately prepared for thyroidectomy and is now extremely rare. Symptomatic & supportive treatment is for dehydration, hyperpyrexia & restlessness.Specific treatment is with carbimazole 10-20 mg 6-hourly, Lugol's iodine 10 drops 8-hourly by mouth or sodium iodide 1 g IV.

Allen's test is used to detect the patency of which of the following ?,Radial aery,Ulnar aery,Both,None.,"Allen's test, also Allen test, is used to test blood supply to the hand, specifically, the patency of the radial and ulnar aeries. It is performed prior to radial aerial blood sampling or cannulation. Allen's test is also performed prior to hea bypass surgery. The radial aery is occasionally used as a conduit for bypass surgery, and its patency lasts longer in comparison to the saphenous veins. Prior to hea bypass surgery, Allen's test is performed to assess the suitability of the radial aery to be used as a conduit. The modified Allen's Test *The hand is elevated and the patient/person is asked to make a fist for about 30 seconds. *Pressure is applied over the ulnar and the radial aeries so as to occlude both of them. *Still elevated, the hand is then opened. It should appear blanched (pallor can be observed at the finger nails). *Ulnar pressure is released and the color should return in 7 seconds. Inference: Ulnar aery supply to the hand is sufficient and it is safe to cannulate/prick the radial If color does not return or returns after 7-10 seconds, the test is considered positive and the ulnar aery supply to the hand is not sufficient. The radial aery therefore cannot be safely pricked/ cannulated.",C

Which of the following can replace N2O as O2 carrier,Argon,Xenon,Helium,None.,"Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects.15,332 For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

Which of the following is not an operation of congenital lymphedema?,Homan's operation,Charle's operation,de Quervain's cross red operation,Sistrunk's operation,"Ans. c (de Quervain's cross red operation) (Ref. Bailey and Love Surgery 25th ed., p. 957)TREATMENT OF LYMPHEDEMA# No drug therapy is effective.# The mainstay of treatment is external compression and meticulous skin care. Mechanical reduction of lymphedema can best be achieved with a program of frequent leg elevation, manual lymphatic drainage massage, low-stretch wrapping techniques, and intermittent pneumatic compression. Sequential pneumatic compression devices are traditionally the first line of treatment. Graduated compression stockings maintain the limb after reduction by pneumatic compression. Good skin care is imperative in order to prevent infection as it is difficult to eradicate because of disordered lymphatic drainage and can be limb-threatening.# Operation may be considered in rare cases of severe functional impairment and recurrent lymphangitis. The primary goals of these operations are to reduce limb bulk, either by ablative techniques (excision of excess tissue) or physiologic techniques (lymphatic reconstruction). Operations fall into two categories: bypass procedures and reduction procedures.Bypass proceduresLimb reduction proceduresIn less than 2 % of patients with primary lymphedema, lymphangiography will demonstrate proximal lymphatic obstruction in the ilio-inguinal region with essentially normal distal lymphatic channels. In theory at least, such patients might benefit from lymphatic bypass.These are indicated when a limb is so swollen that it interferes with mobility and livelihood. These operations are not 'cosmetic' in the sense that they do not create a normally shaped leg and are usually associated with significant scarring.A number of bypass procedures have been described, including:1 Omental pedicle2 The skin bridge (Gillies)3 Anastomosing lymph nodes to veins (Neibulowitz)4 The ileal mucosal patch (Kinmonth)5 Direct lymphovenous anastomosis with the aid of the operating microscope.Although the last two techniques do appear to lead to significant improvement in about 50% of patients, it is not possible to predict which patients will benefit.Four limb reduction operations have been described.Sistrunk: A wedge of skin and subcutaneous tissue is excised and the wound closed primarily. This is most commonly employed to reduce the girth of the thigh.Homan: Skin flaps are elevated and subcutaneous tissue is excised from beneath the flaps, which are then trimmed to size to accommodate the reduced girth of the limb and closed primarily. This is the most satisfactory operation for the calf.Thompson: One denuded skin flap is sutured to the deep fascia and buried beneath the second skin flap (the so-called buried dermal flap). This procedure has become less popular as pilonidal sinus formation is commonChar!es:This leaves a very unsatisfactory cosmetic result and graft failure is not uncommon. However, it does enable the surgeon to reduce greatly the girth of a massively swollen limb.",C

Secondary hyperparathyroidisrn are seen in all except aEUR',Rickets,Osteomalacia,Osteoporosis,Renal failure,"Osteoporosis Secondary hyperparathyroidism :? Secondary hyperparathyroidism is seen when there is some resistance to metabolic actions of parathyroid hormone; so inspite of increase in the level of parathyroid hormone, the serum calcium level is not increased. Renal failure is by far the most common cause of secondary hyper- parathyroidismQ. Chronic renal failure results in phosphate retention and hyper- phosphatemia Hyperphosphatemia in turn induces secondary hyperparathyroi- disco because phosphate regulates PTH secretion. Inspite of the increased PTH, serum calcium remains low or normal because the damaged kidneys are not able to generate the active metabolite of vitamin D, which is 1,25 dihydroxy cholecalci- ferol. Due to renal failure, the enzyme renal hydroxylase is damaged and this prevents the formation 1,25(011)2 cholecalciferol.

Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion. Surgery to release the pulley is done as a day case through a palmar incision under local anaesthetic. Cure rates approach 100%. Splinting for six weeks can decrease inflammation. This is an option for those wishing to avoid injections or surgery. Congenital triggering usually presents in the first year of life. The digit is locked in flexion or extension.

This patient experiences pain 30 minutes after TURP. This is because he is under spinal anesthesia. Perforation may result from the resectoscope going through the bladder wall or from overdistention of the bladder with irrigation fluid. Most bladder perforations are extraperitoneal and are signaled by poor return of the irrigating fluid. Awake patients will typically complain of nausea, diaphoresis, and retropubic or lower abdominal pain. Large extraperitoneal and most intraperitoneal perforations are presenting as sudden unexplained hypotension or hypeension, and with generalized abdominal pain in awake patients. Regardless of the anesthetic technique employed, perforation should be suspected in settings of sudden hypotension or hypeension, paicularly with acute, vagally mediated bradycardia.

True regarding male breast Ca?,Invasive lobular carcinoma is the most common type,Estrogen receptor positive,Paget's ds of nipple is more common in men than women,All,"Ans is B (Estrogen receptor positive), Male Breast cancer Breast cancer in men is a rare disease; less than 1% occurs in men. The average age is about 60 yrs - older than the most common presenting age in women. Gynecomastia is seen preceding or accompanying the breast cancer in about 20% of cases. The risk of male breast cancer is related to an increased lifelong exposure to estrogen (as with female breast cancer) or to reduced androgen. The strongest association is in men with Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) who have a 14- to 50-fold increased risk of developing male breast cancer. Also, men who carry a BRCA1, or paicularly a BRCA2 mutation, have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. The following conditions have been repoed to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men: - chronic liver disorders, such as cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism, schistosomiasis; - a history of mumps orchitis, undescended testes, or testicular injury; and - feminization, genetically or by environmental exposure - radiation exposure All known histopathologic types of breast cancer have been described in men with infiltrating ductal carcinoma being most common (about 70%). A majority of male breast cancers are ER/PR positive and the percentage positive is greater than for female breast cancer. As for women, stage is the predominant prognostic indicator, and most studies repo that stage for stage, men with breast cancer have the same outcome following treatment as women with breast cancer. Overall, men do worse because of the advanced stage of their cancer at the time of diagnosis. Treatment consists of modified radical mastectomy in operable patients. The use of postmastectomy radiation therapy follows the same guidelines as for female breast cancer. Similarly, the use of systemic therapy follows the same guidelines as for women with postmenopausal breast cancer. Tamoxifen is the mainstay for adjuvant systemic therapy in ER-positive male breast cancer.

Who coined term anaesthesia ?,Moon,Holmes,Morgan,Priestly,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reversal of anaesthesia Second gas effect and diffusion hypoxia In initial pa of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli --> Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) --> Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air. Remember Concentration effect and secondary gas effect during induction. Diffusion hypoxia --> during recovering. All these occur with N20 only",A

This lesion needs to be fixed immediately.With continuing negative pressure in the chest, each breath sucks more of the abdominal contents into the chest and increases the likelihood of vascular compromise of the herniated viscera. While the diaphragm is easily fixed from the left chest, this injury should be approached from the abdomen.

"Torsion of testes is may be due to: March 2013 (e, f)",Trauma to testes,Full coverage of the testis with tunica vaginalis,Long mesorchium,All of the above,"Ans. D i.e. All of the above Testicular torsion It is the torsion of the spermatic cord structures and subsequent loss of the blood supply to the ipsilateral testicle. This is a urological emergency; early diagnosis and treatment are vital to saving the testicle and preserving future feility. Testicular torsion is primarily a disease of adolescents and neonates. It is the most common cause of testicular loss in these age groups. Surgical treatment may prevent fuher ischemic damage to the testis. Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord and the blood supply to the testicle. With mature attachments, the tunica vaginalis is attached securely to the posterior lateral aspect of the testicle, and, within it, the spermatic cord is not very mobile. If the attachment of the tunica vaginalis to the testicle is inappropriately high, the spermatic cord can rotate within it, which can lead to intravaginal torsion. This defect is referred to as the bell clapper deformity. This occurs in about 17 % of males and is bilateral in 40%. Intravaginal torsion most commonly occurs in adolescents. It is thought that the increased weight of the testicle after pubey, as well as sudden contraction of the cremasteric muscles (which inses in a spiral fashion into the spermatic cord), is the impetus for acute torsion. By contrast, neonates more often have extravaginal torsion. This occurs because the tunica vaginalis is not yet secured to the gubernaculum and, therefore, the spermatic cord, as well as the tunica vaginalis, undergo torsion as a unit. Extravaginal torsion is not associated with bell clapper deformity. This can occur up to months prior to bih. Of course, neonates can have intravaginal torsion and this should be managed in the same manner as adolescents. Testicular torsion is associated with testicular malignancy, especially in adults According to Prehn's sign, the physical lifting of the testicles relieves the pain of epididymitis but not pain caused by testicular torsion",D

Most episodes of physiological reflux occur during postprandial transient LOS relaxations (TLOSRs). In the early stages of GORD, most pathological reflux occurs as a result of an increased number of TLOSRs rather than a persistent fall in overall sphincter pressure.

Secondary vesical calculus refers to stones formed due to:,Hypercalciuria,Injury,Infection,Migrating from above,"• Most vesical calculi are formed de novo within the bladder, but some initially may have formed within the kidneys as a dissociated Randall plaque or on a sloughed papilla and subsequently may have passed into the bladder, where additional deposition of crystals cause the stone to grow.
• Most renal stones that are small enough to pass through the ureters are also small enough to pass through a normally functioning bladder and an unobstructed urethra.
• In older men with bladder stones composed of uric acid, the stone most likely formed in the bladder.
• Stones composed of calcium oxalate are usually initially formed in the kidney.
• In adults, MC type of vesical stone (seen in >50% of cases) is composed of uric acid.
• Less frequently, bladder calculi are composed of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, ammonium urate, cystine, or magnesium ammonium phosphate (when associated with infection).
Endemic Bladder Calculi
• In children, stones are composed mainly of ammonium acid urate, calcium oxalate, or an impure mixture of ammonium acid urate and calcium oxalate with calcium phosphate.
• The common link among endemic areas relates to feeding infants human breast milk and polished rice.
• These foods are low in phosphorus, ultimately leading to high ammonia excretion.
• These children also usually have a high intake of oxalate-rich vegetables (increased oxalate crystalluria) and animal protein (low dietary citrate).
• Vesical calculi may be single or multiple, especially in the presence of bladder diverticula, and can be small or large enough to occupy the entire bladder. They range from soft to extremely hard, with surfaces ranging from smooth and faceted to jagged and spiculated (“jack” stones).
• Most bladder stones are secondary, more common in older males (>50 years), usually because of bladder outlet obstruction.
• MC type: Uric acid (sterile urine) > Struvite stones (Infected urine)
• Bladder stones are usually solitary, multiple in 25% patients.
Etiology
• Bladder outlet obstruction (MC cause)
• Neurogenic bladder
• Foreign body (Foley’s catheter, forgotten DJ stents)
• Bladder diverticula
Clinical Features
• Typical symptoms are intermittent, painful voiding and terminal hematuria with severe pain at the end of micturition.
• Pain may be referred to the tip of the penis or to the labia majora.
Diagnosis
• A large percentage of bladder stones are radiolucent (uric acid).
• USG bladder: Identifies the stone with its characteristic shadowing and stone moves with changing body position.
Treatment
• Small stones: Removed or crushed transurethrally (Cystolitholapexy)
• Larger stones: Disintegrated by transurethral electrohydraulic lithotripsy or Cystolithotomy
Stones of Genitourinary Tract
• MC renal stone: Calcium oxalate
• MC primary bladder stone: Ammonium urate

The investigations for duodenal ulcer are -a) Hypotonic duodenographyb) Barium mealc) Barium swallowd) Upper GI endoscopye) Abdominal X-ray erect view,acd,abd,abc,ab,"Duodenal ulcers are best diagnosed by upper GI endoscopy but double contrast barium studies also yield good results.


Barium studies done for duodenum ulcers:

-       double contrast barium meal
-       double contrast hypotonic duodenography
Hypotonic duodenography is a special procedure of barium study in which smooth muscle relaxants are used to produce a state of hypotonia in the duodenum during barium examination. In hypotonic state mucosal lesions are better appreciated.

Hypotonic duodenography is indicated if routine studies have resulted in equivocal findings or when there is suspicion of a primary lesion in the duodenum.

Radiological appearance of ulcer on double contrast barium study:

ulcer appears as a sharply defined, constant collection of barium, sometimes with a surrounding zone of edema or radiating folds.
anterior wall ulcers are normally shown best on the prone view; they may have the appearance of a ring shadow on the supine view as a result of the barium dropping out of the centre of the crater.",B

"A day after a left-sided lumpectomy and axillary dissection, a 63-year-old woman is experiencing difficulty elevating her left arm. She cannot fully raise her upper arm from the side of her body. The median border and inferior angle of the left scapula become unusually prominent when she pushes against the wall with both hands. The innervation of which of the following muscles was most likely injured during the surgery?",Deltoid,Latissimus dorsi,Pectoralis major,Serratus anterior,"This patient most likely sustained an injury to the long thoracic nerve (C5-C7), which innervates the serratus anterior muscle. This muscle is located on the lateral poion of the thorax, attaching to the external surface of the lateral pas of the 1st - 8th ribs proximally and the anterior surface of the medial border of the scapula distally. It is responsible for keeping the scapula applied to the thoracic wall, and protracts and rotates the scapula. Other muscles and bones rely on the scapula to be ""fixed"", as they use it as an anchor when producing movements of the humerus. Injury to the long thoracic nerve, which lies on the medial wall of the axilla, can occur during weight lifting, thoracic or axillary surgery, or from a stab wound. The clinical features of a long thoracic nerve injury include a ""winged"" scapula (the protrusion of the scapula as the patient presses against a wall) and an inability to abduct the arm. The deltoid and teres minor muscles are innervated by the axillary nerve (C5-C6), which winds around the humeral neck, and may be injured during the dislocation of the shoulder or a fracture to the neck of the humerus. Injuries to this nerve present with weakness of shoulder abduction, and atrophy of the shoulder. ""Winging"" of the scapula is not a prominent clinical feature of an axillary nerve injury. The latissimus dorsi muscle is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve (C6-C8), and is a large, fan-shaped muscle that extends, adducts, and medially rotates the humerus, and helps raise the body toward the arms during climbing and performing chin-ups. Injury to the nerve that innervates this muscle can occur during surgical operations in the axilla, and makes the patient unable to perform a chin-up or go climbing. The patient's clinical findings in this case are inconsistent with an injury to the thoracodorsal nerve. The pectoralis major muscle, which is innervated by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, is involved in the adduction and medial rotation of the arm. Injury to the nerves that innervate this muscle does not typically result in any disability, however the anterior axillary fold is absent on the affected side.",D
True about ankylosing spondylitis are all except ?,Affects males,3 0-40yrs,90% HLA-B5,Bamboo spine,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 90% HLA-B5 Ankylosing spondylitis (marie-strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. rototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B270-95% of case 9s are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4th/e 593) and ankle (Apley's 9thle 67) are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i.e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A.S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal _ 5 cm) Peripheral joints e.g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Radiological features of ankylosing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are :- Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel.

This recent change in the patient's behavior is an example of what therapeutic principle?,Counter transference,Abreaction,Ego strength,Resistance,"Freud noticed that patients in spite of their suffering and their ove desire to change tended to cling to their symptoms and resisted the analyst's effos to produce insight. He called these powerful internal forces that oppose change resistance. Resistance takes place at any point in the treatment and paicularly when unacceptable impulses or thoughts threaten to come into consciousness or a maladaptive defense mechanism is challenged. Resistance can manifest itself in many different ways, including withholding impoant thoughts from the analyst, falling silent during sessions, forgetting appointments, forgetting to pay the analyst, falling asleep during session, and considering dropping out of treatment. The possible manifestations of resistance are countless and depend on the patient's defense mechanisms and personality. In other words, the patient's intrapsychic defenses manifest as resistance in the context of his or her interpersonal relationship with the analyst. Freud thought that resistance should be uncovered by the analyst but not challenged or interpreted. Modern analysts believe that resistance should be analyzed through the patient's free associations suppoed by the analyst's observations.",D

All are features of Paget's disease except ?,Defect in osteoclasts,Common in female,Can cause deafness,Can cause osteosarcoma,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Common in female Paget disease Paget's disease is characterized by increased bone turnover and enlargement and thickening of the bone, but the internal architecture is abnormal and the bone is usually brittle. Primary defect is in osteoclasts with increased osteoclastic activity. This results secondarily increase in osteoblastic activity (normal osteoclasts and osteoblasts act in a co-ordinated manner). So, characteristic cellular change is a marked increase in osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity. Bone turnover is acclerated, plasma alkaline phosphatase is raised (a sign of osteoblastic activity) and there is increased excretion of hydroxyproline in urine (due to osteoclastic activity). Clinical features of Paget's disease Paget's disease is slightly more common in males and is seen after 40 years of age.

Compensatory mechanisms during acute hemorrhage include,Decreased cerebral and coronary blood flow,Decreased myocardial contractility,Renal and splanchnic vasodilation,Increased respiratory rate,"Acute hemorrhage triggers the potent vasopressor activity of both angiotensin and vasopressin to increase blood flow to the heart and brain via selective vasoconstriction of the skin, kidneys, and splanchnic organs. Adrenergic discharge also results in selective vasoconstriction of skin, renal, and splanchnic vessels. Myocardial contractility and heart rate are increased, with a resultant increased cardiac output. Hyperventilation is the typical response to the metabolic (lactic) acidosis associated with hemorrhagic shock and hypoperfusion. Aldosterone release, with subsequent increased renal sodium resorption, is mediated by angiotensin II and ACTH, which prevents further intravascular depletion.",D

In spinal anaesthesia the needle pierced upto,Subdural space,Extradural space,Epidural space,Subrachnoid space,"Ans. d (Subarachnoid space). (Ref. Harrisons, Medicine, 18th/735)SPINAL ANESTHESIA# The term ""spinal anesthesia"" was coined in 1885 by Leonard Corning.Technique of spinal anesthesia:# In spinal anaesthesia the spinal needle is pierced upto subarachnoid space where the anaesthetic agent is injected to produce the anaesthesia.# The selected level should be below LI in an adult and L3 in a child to avoid needle trauma to the spinal cord. As an anatomic landmark, the L3-L4 interspace is located at the line intersecting the top of the iliac crests. Either a midline or paramedian approach can be used.# The anatomic layers passed through include skin, subcutaneous structures, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, dura mater, and arachnoid membrane.# Once the needle tip is believed to be in the subarachnoid space, the stylet is removed to see if CSF appears at the needle hub. With small diameter needles (26 to 29 gauge) this generally requires 5 to 10 seconds, but may require >1 minute in some patients. Gentle aspiration may speed the appearance of CSF. If CSF does not appear, the needle orifice may be obstructed by a nerve root and rotating the needle 90 degrees may result in CSF flow. Alternatively, the needle orifice may not be completely in the subarachnoid space and advancing an additional 1 to 2 mm may result in brisk CSF flow. This is particularly true of pencil-point needles, which have their orifice on the side of the needle shaft proximal to the needle tip.# Finally, failure to obtain CSF suggests that the needle orifice is not in the subarachnoid space and the needle should be reinserted.# Common complications include hypotension, bradycardia, increased sensitivity to sedative medications, nausea and vomiting (possibly secondary to hypotension), postdural puncture headache, nerve injury, total spinal, and hematoma/abscess formation at the site of puncture.# Total spinal anesthesia results from local anesthetic depression of the cervical spinal cord and brain stem. Signs and symptoms include dysphonia, dyspnea, upper extremity weakness, loss of consciousness, pupillary dilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Eaily recognition is the key to management. Treatment includes securing the airway, mechanical ventilation, volume infusion, and pressor support.# Absolute contraindications include local infection at the puncture site, bacteremia, severe hypovolemia, coagulopathy, severe stenotic valvular disease, infection at the site of the procedure, and intracranial hypertension. Relative contraindications include progressive degenerative (demyelinating) neurologic disease (multiple sclerosis), low back pain, and sepsis.# Intrathecal opioids:- Opioids produce intense visceral analgesia and may prolong sensory blockade without affecting motor or sympathetic function.- Fentanyl and sufentanil have a rapid onset of action and an effective duration greater than 6 hours.- Morphine lasts 6-24 hours.- Side effects include respiratory depression (which may occur late with hydrophilic agents), nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and urinary retention.",D
Figure X ray of new born with inability to pass stools w hat is this study called -,Invertogram,Enteroclysis,Graham cole test,Digital xray,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Invertogram o Imperforate anus or anorectal malformation are divided into two types - low type: where the rectum has descended through the levator-ani sphincter complex and the high type : where it has not.o Low type lesions undergo primary repair in the neonatal period and anal orifice created. Whereas, high type lesions require a protective colostomy in the neonatal period, with a definitive repair later in life,o In this pt. presence of meconium in the urine suggests a high type of ARM and thus would need a double-barrel transverse colostomy.Ano-rectal Malformation ( ARM )o ARMs include a wide spectrum of defects in the development of the lowest portion of the intestinal and urogenital tracts.o ARMs can be classified into 2 types depending the relationship of the rectum to the levator ani sphincter complex.ARMsLow typeHigh typeo Rectum has descended through the sphincter complexo Rectum ends above the sphincter complexo Most pts with imperforate anus have a fistula.Fistula in low lesiono In males - The fistula opens on theperinumo In females - The fistula opens on the perineum or the fourchette (posterior margin of vulva)Fistula in High lesionso In males - There is no apparent cutaneous fistula. There is fistulous communication b/w the rectum and the urinary tract (urethra or bladder).o In females - Occasionally, there is a rectovaginal fistula, but high lesions usually have cloacal anomalies in which the rectum, vagina & urethra all empty into a common channel or cloaca.Clinical clues suggesting low lesiono Presence of meconium at the perineum (d't perineal fistula)o Bucket handle malformation - a prominent skin tag located at the anal dimple below which an instrument can be passed.o Midline Raphe fistula - a subepithelial meconial fistula which looks like a black ribbon, placed in the midline in the perineum.o Anal membrane (through which one can see the meconium)Clinical clues suggesting high lesiono Flat bottom (or flat perineum) - this is lack of a midline gluteal fold and the absence of an anal dimple. It reflects poor muscles in the perineum,o Meconuria (i.e. meconium in the urine)Suggests a fistulous communication b/w the rectum and the urinary tract.Diagnostic investigationo If clinical clues are not able to decide the type of ARM (high or low), a cross-table lateral film with baby in the prone portion, is taken after 24 hrs.If the air column is greater than l cm from the perineum, a colostomy is indicated.Managemento Low type of ARM - simple perineal anoplasty without need for colostomyo High type of ARM - protective colostomy with definitive repair at later stage of life.""

His CVP had been 12 to 14 but is now 6, in the face of diminished blood pressure and oliguria. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of his hypotension?",Pulmonary embolism,Hypervolemia,Positive-pressure ventilation,Gram-negative sepsis,"Determination of CVP can be helpful in the overall hemodynamic assessment of the patient. This pressure can be affected by a variety of factors, including those of cardiac, noncardiac, and aifactual origin. Venous tone, right ventricular compliance, intrathoracic pressure, and blood volume all influence CVP. Vasoconstrictor drugs, positive-pressure ventilation (with and without PEEP), mediastinal compression, and hypervolemia all increase CVP. Acute pulmonary embolism, when clinically significant, elevates CVP by causing right ventricular overload and increased right atrial pressure. Sepsis, on the other hand, decreases CVP through both the release of vasodilatory mediators and the loss of intravascular plasma volume due to increased capillary permeability. Trends in CVP measurement are more reliable than isolated readings. CVP, along with other hemodynamic parameters, can also be useful in differentiating septic shock from other etiologies of shock; shock is inadequate tissue perfusion. Septic shock has two phases: (1) a hypodynamic phase that is characterized by hypovolemia and myocardial depression and (2) a hyperdynamic phase that follows fluid resuscitation and is characterized by a normal to increased cardiac output",D

Aerial Disease, Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition Chapter 243 Table 243-1 ""Raynaud's phenomenon is seen in Rheumatoid ahritis not Juvenile Rheumatoid ahritis"" The term Raynaud's phenomenon applies to a heterogeneous symptom array associated with peripheral vasospasm, more commonly occurring in the upper extremities The majority of patients are young women <40 years of age and is often bilateral. There is no cure for Raynaud'ssyndrome, thus all treatments mainly palliate symptoms and decrease the severity and, perhaps, frequency of attacks. The majority (90%) of patients will respond to avoidance of cold and other stimuli. The remaining 10% of patients with more persistent or severe syndromes can be treated with a variety of vasodilatory drugs. Calcium-channel blockers such as diltiazem and nifedipine are the drugs of choice.

"Trauma to spleen in a stable patient is best diagnosed by: September 2005, March 2008",X-ray abdomen,USG,CT scan,diagnostic peritoneal lavage,"Ans. C: CT scan Plain radiographs demonstrate a wide variety of abnormal findings. The constitution of findings reflects whether the spleen has sustained capsular rupture. Normal findings on chest and abdominal radiographs do not exclude splenic injury. USG/Focused abdominal sonar for trauma (FAST) is commonly used as the bedside investigation of choice for detection of intra-abdominal blood in abdominal trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is especially useful in the hypotensive, unstable patient with multiple injuries as a means of excluding intrabdominal bleeding. DPL has been largely replaced by FAST. It is extremely sensitive to the presence of intra-peritoneal bleeding, being able to pick up just 20m1 of blood (Sensitivity 85-98%) Relative contraindications to DPL include near term pregnancy (DPL should be carried out supra-umbilically in this situation), presence of a coagulopathy, cirrhosis, and multiple prior abdominal operations. A DPL is deemed positive if blood or bowel contents are aspirated from the abdomen. It is also determined to be positive if on analysis of the dialysate, greater than 100,000 RBC/mml or 5000 WBC/ mm3 are found. False positives on DPL may occur from abdominal wall bleeding from a traumatic catheter placement and from pelvic fractures. CT is the modality of choice for evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in stable patient because it is not only sensitive, but also has a high specificity. In addition to being able to identify the presence of intra-abdominal fluid, individual organ damage can be identified. Retroperitoneal trauma may be identified and tril trauma not requiring laparotomy may be diagnosed as such.",C

"All of the following agents can be given for induction of anaesthesia in children, EXCEPT:1",Halothane,Servoflurane,Morphine,Nitrous oxide,"Morphine has pharmacokinetic differences in young individuals, that may predispose them to develop respiratory depression. So this drug should be used with caution in infants less than 6 months of age who are not ventilated. Drugs used in the induction of anesthesia in children are a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. Other drugs which are useful are sevoflurane or halothane. Sevoflurane is considered to be the agent of choice for inhalational induction rather than halothane, because sevoflurane has a wider therapeutic safety window in terms of cardiovascular depression and has no unpleasant smell.

Allen's test used for detecting integrity of palmar arch tests which of the following?,Radial aery,Ulnar aery,Both,None of the above,"Allen's test allows assessment of the extent of connection between the radial and ulnar aeries through the palmar arches. In Allen's test: the examiner compresses both the radial and ulnar aeries at the wrist and then asks the patient to flex and extend the fingers repetitively. After the hand blanches, pressure from the radial aery is released while compression is maintained on the ulnar aery and the examiner observes how long it takes for each of the fingers to regain its pink color. The initial step is repeated with both vessels compressed, and the ulnar aery occlusion is then released while pressure is maintained on the radial aery. Again, examination of the reperfusion of the fingers reveals which digits are primarily supplied through the ulnar aery. Ref: CURRENT Diagnosis & Treatment in Ohopedics, 4e chapter 10",C

False statements about carcinoma esophagus are all of the following except: March 2007,Most common in lower third,"Histologically, adenocarcinoma only",Unrelated to tobacco chewing,It is more common in females,"Ans. A: Most common in lower third There are a number of risk factors for esophageal cancer: Age-Most patients are over 60. Gender-It is more common in men. Heredity-It is more likely in people who have close relatives with cancer. Tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use increase the risk. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its resultant Barrett's esophagus increase esophageal cancer risk due to the chronic irritation of the mucosal lining (adenocarcinoma is more common in this condition, while all other risk factors predispose more for squamous cell carcinoma). Human papillomavirus (HPV) Paicular dietary substances, such as nitrosamine. Plummer-Vinson syndrome (anemia and esophageal webbing) Tylosis and Howel-Evans syndrome (hereditary thickening of the skin of the palms and soles). Radiation therapy for other conditions in the mediastinum. Celiac disease predisposes towards squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma may develop at the achalasia segment due to persistent retention esophagitis as a result of fermentation of food residues. The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 inches long) is commonly divided into three pas for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur distally and squamous cell carcinomas proximally, but the converse may also be the case. Worldwide squamous cell carcinoma is most common whereas adenocarcinomas predominates in the west. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption. Adenocarcinomas are often associated with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopy is the first line investigation for most patients.",A

Which of the following is contraindicated in head injury?,Ketamine,Halothane,N2O,Propofol,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ketamine o Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol&etomidate, which have cerebroprotectiveeffect, therefore ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, intracranial space occupying lesions and for neuroanaesthesia.Ketamineo The primary site of action is in the cortex and subcortical areas; not in the reticular activating system (site of action of barbiturates),o It acts on NMD A receptors.o Short duration of action (10-15 minutes) is due to redistribution from brain and blood to other tissues of the body,o Ketamine is different from most other anaesthetic induction agents in that it has significant analgesic action.o Ketamine increases IOT and cerebral metabolism - contraindicated in head injury.o It causes sympathetic stimulation with elevation of HR, CO & BP - contraindicated in hypertension and ischemic heart disease.o It also raises IOT - contraindicated in glaucoma.o It relieves bronchospasm - intravenous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics (inhalation anaesthetic of choice in asthmatic is halothane).o Injection is not painful (All other inducing agents cause pain on injection),o It is i.v. anaesthetic of choice in child ren (Sevoflurane is inhalation agent of choice).o Because it causes sympathetic stimulation it is intravenous anaesthetic of choice in patients with shock and hypovolumia.o It has no muscle relaxant property rather muscle tone is increased.o Airway reflexes (pharyngeal and laryngeal) are not depressed - intravenous anaesthetic of choice for emergency anaesthesia (no starvation is required).o Ketamine produces emergence reaction during awakening from anaesthesia - vivid dreaming, illusions, extracorporeal experiences, excitment, confusion, fear and euphoria - contraindicated in psychiatric illness like schizophrenia.",A
"A 25-year-old man presents with acute, painless loss of vision in the right eye. The appearance of the optic nerve of the right eye is hyperemic.

In some cases, there can be asymmetry in visual acuity and visual fields. LHON often presents as acute or subacute unilateral vision loss that is followed within several months by vision loss in the fellow eye. The appearance of the optic nerve in LHON is characterized by a triad of circumpapillary telangiectasia, swelling of the nerve fiber layer around the disc, and absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography. LHON should be included in the diagnosis of acute unilateral vision loss from such disorders as optic neuritis and ischemic optic neuropathy.",C
"A 54-year-old man presents with 7 weeks of facial flushing and diarrhea. His symptoms began intermittently but are becoming more constant. A 24-hour urine collection reveals an elevated level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin. An abdominal CT scan shows a 2-cm mesenteric mass in the ileum and likely metastatic tumors in the liver. What is the likely diagnosis?",Serotonin syndrome,Malignant carcinoid syndrome,Cushing syndrome,Phaeochromocytoma,"One of the main secretory products of carcinoid tumors involved in the carcinoid syndrome is serotonin , which is synthesized from tryptophan. Serotonin production is characteristic of gut carcinoid tumors. Serotonin is metabolized to 5-HIAA. Therefore, finding high levels of 5-HIAA in a 24-hour urine collection in a patient with flushing or other symptoms is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Serotonin has numerous biologic effects, including stimulating intestinal secretion with inhibition of absorption, stimulating increases in intestinal motility, and stimulating fibrogenesis. In various studies 56-88% of all carcinoid tumors were associated with serotonin overproduction; however, 12-26% of the patients did not have the carcinoid syndrome. In one study platelet serotonin was elevated in 96% of patients with midgut carcinoids, 43% with foregut tumors, and 0% with hindgut tumors. In 90-100% of patients with the carcinoid syndrome there is evidence of serotonin overproduction. Serotonin is thought to be predominantly responsible for the diarrhea because of its effects on gut motility and intestinal secretion, primarily through 5-HT3 and, to a lesser degree, 5-HT4 receptors.

An alcoholic patient with history diabetic nephropathy and liver failure is posted for open abdomen surgery. The most appropriate muscle relaxant in this patient is:,Cisatracurium,Rocuronium,Vecuronium,Rapacuronium,"Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent. Like atracurium, it undergoes degradation in plasma at physiological pH and temperature by organ-independent Hofmann elimination. The resulting metabolites (a monoquaternary acrylate and laudanosine) have no neuromuscular blocking effects. Because of cisatracurium's greater potency, the amount of laudanosine produced for the same extent and duration of neuromuscular blockade is much less than with atracurium. Nonspecific esterases are not involved in the metabolism of cisatracurium. Metabolism and elimination are independent of renal or liver failure hence can be given in hepatic and renal failure.

Femoral and Popliteal artery aneurysms constitute about 90% of peripheral aneurysms. Femoral 20% and Popliteal 70%.
The majority of these aneurysms are the degenerative type.
More common in men. Popliteal artery aneurysms are almost always seen in men (97%)
More than 50% are bilateral.
Large no. of patients have associated aortic aneurysms.
Like aortic aneurysms, they are silent until critically symptomatic. However, unlike aortic aneurysms, they rarely rupture. 
The presenting manifestations are due to peripheral embolization and thrombosis leading to distal limb ischemia.
Peripheral aneurysms rarely may also produce symptoms by compressing the local vein or nerve.

Imaging:

Duplex color ultrasound is inv of choice to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral aneurysms.

Treatment

Indications for treatment include
acute lower limb ischemia, or
transverse diameter greater 2 cm or
presence of mural thrombus.
Treatment consists of
open surgery with prosthetic interposition grafting for femoral aneurysms and saphenous vein grafting for popliteal aneurysms.

Anesthetic agent which is explosive in the presence of cautery,Nitrous Oxide,Ether,Trilene,Halothane,"Ether (Diethyl ether) It is a highly volatile liquid, produces irritating vapors which are inflammable and explosive. (C2H5 -- O -- C2H5) Ether is a potent anesthetic, produces good analgesia and marked muscle relaxation by reducing ACh output from motor nerve endings. The dose of competitive neuromuscular blockers should be reduced to about 1/3. It is highly soluble in blood. Induction is prolonged and unpleasant with struggling, breath-holding, salivation and marked respiratory secretions (atropine must be given as premedication to prevent the patient from drowning in his own secretions). Recovery is slow; postanaesthetic nausea, vomiting, and retching are marked. Respiration and BP are generally well maintained because of reflex stimulation and a high sympathetic tone. It does not sensitize the hea to Adrenaline and is not hepatotoxic. Ether is not used now in developed countries because of its unpleasant and inflammable propeies. However, it is still used in developing countries, paicularly in peripheral areas because it is--cheap, can be given by open drop method (though congestion of eye, soreness of trachea and ether burns on face can occur) without the need for any equipment, and is relatively safe even in inexperienced hands.

Firefly luciferase is slightly different from GFP, a photoprotein. Luciferase is a generic term for the class of oxidative enzymes used in bioluminescence and is distinct from a photoprotein. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a protein composed of 238 amino acid residues (26.9kDa) that exhibits bright green fluorescence when exposed to blue light. Photoproteins (GPF) don't require any special pigments, enzymes or chemicals to set it off. Once expressed, it simply needs mineral substrates to emit fluorescence. GFP was originally recruited from jellyfish. It has the same purpose as the luciferase enzyme in molecular biology, to mark the expression of select genes. At least in the lab, it GFP also requires to shine blue light (or sometimes UV) for it to emit the green fluorescence. It's such a standard tool now, in mice, plants, flies, fish studies.",B

Which of the following is not a complication of pseudopancreatic cyst: March 2005,Malignancy,Rupture,Hemorrhage into cyst,Infection,"Ans. A: Malignancy Pseudocysts of the pancreas are collections of pancreatic juice surrounded by a wall of fibrous tissue that is not lined by epithelium. Pseudocysts are connected with the pancreatic duct system either as a direct communication or indirectly the pancreatic parenchyma. They are caused by pancreatic ductal disruption following increased pancreatic ductal pressure either due to stenosis, calculi or protein plugs obstructing the main pancreatic ductal system or as a result of pancreatic necrosis following an attack of acute pancreatitis. Complications of pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis are: Rupture into the gastrointestinal tract either results in no symptoms or leads to melaena or haematemesis that usually requires urgent conservative measures. Rupture into the general peritoneal cavity results in features of peritonitis and on occasions an associated haemorrhagic shock. Haemorrhage can greatly complicate the course of a pseudocyst. Interventional radiology can play an invaluable role both in locating the source of bleeding and in embolisation of the bleeding vessel. Infection occurs either spontaneously or after therapeutic or diagnostic manipulations. Biliary complications occur due to a large cyst in the pancreatic head region obstructing the common bile duct and resulting in obstructive jaundice. Poal hypeension can result from compression or obstruction of the splenic vein/ poal vein either by the cyst alone or in conjunction with underlying chronic pancreatitis.",A
Treatment of choice for medullary carcinoma of thyroid is -,Total thyroidectomy,Partial thyroidectomy,1131 ablation,Hemithyroidectomy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Total thyroidectomy Treatment of thyroid malignancies is as follows :- (Note- This is a very important and often repeated topic in PG exams, so if time permits one must turn the pages of Schwartz Sx or any other standard hook for detailed study).Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PCT)o High-risk tumors or bilateral tumorsTotal thyroidectomy (or near total thyroidectomy),o Low riskThe treatment is controversial.Conservative approach advocates hemithyroidectomy (lobectomy + isthmusectomy).More radical approach advocates total thyroidectomy (or near total thyroidectomy).Schwartz Sx and Devita's Oncology are in favour of radical approach.(High and Low risk decided by any one of the many classification systems)o If enlarged lymph nodes are foundModified radical neck dissection is done of the affected side.o When patients are found to have a minimal papillary thyroid carcinoma in a thyroid specimen removed for other reasons, unilateral thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy is usually considered to be adequate treatment, unless the tumor has evidence of angioinvasion, multifocality, or positive margins.Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC)o FNA biopsy is unable to distinguish benign follicular lesions from follicular carcinomas therefore, preoperative diagnosis of cancer is difficult unless distant metastases are present,o Patients diagnosed by FNA biopsy as follicular lesions should undergo thyroid lobectomy + isthmusectomy (because at least 80% of these patients will have benign adenomas).o The resected lobe is subjected to histology (intraoperative frozen - section examination, though usually not helpful should be performed in high risk cases).o If & follicular lesion larger than 4 cm is seen in an older patient - total thyroidectomy is done, because of high risk of cancer (50%) in this setting.o Prophylactic nodal dissection is not needed as nodal involvement is infrequent, but in the unusual patient with nodal metastases, therapeutic neck dissection is recommended.Lets also see what Sabiston 18/e p940 writes about treatment of Follicular lesions:The diagnosis of the carcinoma cannot be determined by preoperative FNA or intraoperative frozen section diagnosis of a follicular lesion.If the lesion is 2 cm or smaller and well contained within one thyroid lobe - thyroid lobectomy and isthmectomy.If the lesion is larger than 2 cm- total thyroidectomy.Medullary Thyroid Cancero Total Thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with MTC because of high incidence of multicentricity, the more aggressive course and RAI therapy usually being not effective,o The central compartment nodes are frequently involved early in the disease process, so that a bilateral central neck node dissection should be routinely performed. In patients with palpable cervical nodes or involved central neck nodes, ipsilateral or bilateral modified radical neck dissection is recommended. Similarly patient with tumors larger than 1 cm should undergo ipsilateral prophylactic modified radical neck dissection, because greater than 60% of these patients have nodal metastases. If ipsilateral nodes are positive, a contralateral node dissection should be performed.o In case of locally recurrent or metastatic disease, tumor debulking is advised, not only to ameliorate symptoms of flushing and diarrhoea, but also to decrease risk of death from recurrent central neck or mediastinal disease,o External beam radiotherapy is controversial, but is recommended for patients with unresectable residual or recurrent tumor. There is no effective chemotherapy regimeno If patients with MTC are found to have pheochromocytoma, this must be operated first.Anaplastic Carcinomao This tumor is one of the most aggressive thyroid malignancies, with few patients surviving six months beyond diagnosis.o All forms of treatment have been disappointing. If mass is resectable then thyroidectomy may lead to small improvement in survial.o Combined radiation and chemotherapy as adjuvant in resectable cases has been associated with prolonged survival. These are nowr also being used in neoadjuvant setting,o Tracheostomy may be needed to alleviate airway obstruction.",A

Which of the following solution is a colloid:September 2007,Normal saline,Albumin,Ringer lactate,dextrose 5%,"Ans. B: AlbuminThere are two types of fluids that are used for intravenous drips; crystalloids and colloids.Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules.Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as albumin; blood itself is a colloid.Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution.Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood (isotonic).Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement.A solution of dextrose 5% in water, sometimes called D5W, is often used instead if the patient is at risk for having low blood sugar or high sodium.",B

Solitary nodules, in general are more neoplastic than the multiple nodules. Nodules in the young patients are more neoplastic in comparison with those in older patients. Nodules in males are more neoplastic than those in females. A history of radiation neck treatment to head and neck region is associated with increased incidence of thyroid malignancy. Functional nodules that take up radioactive iodine in imaging studies ( hot nodules) are significantly more likely to be benign than malignant.

Following spinal subarachnoid block a patient develops hypotension. This can be managed by the following means except –,Lowering the head end,Administration of 1000 ml of Ringers lacate before the block,Vasopressor drug like methoxamine,Use of ionotrope like dopamine,"This is the controversial one. Most of the guides have given option 'a' i.e. lowering the head end as the answer. Their logic is that, if the head end is lowered, the anesthetic drug will move up and will produce severe hypotension and bradycardia.
However, all texts books have mentioned that in the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia, head low position (Trendelenburg position) should be given to increase the venous return.

""Head low position (Trendelenburg position) to increase the venous return. Although the concern of trendelenburg position increases the chances of high spinal anesthesia, but number of studies have proven that the beneficial effects over weigh these problems and secondly head low up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15° does not significantly increase the level of block. So, trendelenburg up to 15° is still the very vital part of management for the treatment of spinal hypotension"".

Preloading the patients with colloids prevent hypotension. Preloading with crystalloid does not prevent hypotension because large volumes of crystalloids quickly redistribute from intravascular to extravascular space.

""In contrast to crystalloid solutions, prophylactic volume loading with colloid solutions (500-100 ml) prior to spinal injection has consistently maintained blood pressure and volume expansion in both surgical and obstretic patients owing to a sustained increase in intravascular volume, maternal cardiac output and uteroplacental blood flow"".

False statement about colloids is:,Expands plasma for 2-4 hours,Isotonic solutions,Replaced in 1:1 ratio for blood loss,None of the above,"Type of fluid In 1861, Thomas Grahm's investigations on diffusion led him to classify substances as crystalloid or colloids. Intravenous fluids are similarly classified based on their ability to pass through capillary walls that separates the intravascular and intestinal fluid compament. Crystalloid fluids Crystalloid fluids are electrolyte solutions with small molecules that can diffuse freely from intravascular to interstitial fluid compaments. The principle component of crystalloid fluids is sodium and chloride, which can freely pass through capillary well thus the predominant effect of crystalloid fluids is to expand the interstial volume and not plasma volume. Example - normal saline, Ringer's lactate Colloid Fluids Colloid fluid is a saline solution with large solute molecules that do not pass readily from plasma to interstial space.",D

Semen had low volume, high viscosity and fructose was present. What will you do next ?",CFTR gene mutation analysis,Karyotype,PSA,Trans rectal ultrasound,"Next line of management is CFTR gene mutation analysis MALE FACTOR INFEILITY For couples of unknown feility status, approximately 15% are unable to achieve a pregnancy within 1 year. The inability to conceive may be due to female factor infeility, male factor infeility or a combination of these two factors and approximately 20% of cases of infeility are caused entirely by the male factor. Aetiology The two main causes of male factor infeility are either primary testicular causes or obstruction at the level of either the vas or the epididymis. A few cases reflect endocrinological abnormalities such as hypogonadism or hyperprolactinaemia. Testicular causes include chromosomal problems (e.g. Klinefelter's syndrome), microdeletions of the Y chromosome, cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, drugs and radiation damage. In most cases however, the cause is unclear. In these cases, there may be reduced numbers of sperm in the ejaculate (oligozoospermia) or a complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia). Obstructive causes include congenital absence of the vasa (often in association with cystic fibrosis), surgical damage to the vasa and epididymitis. Azoospermia is inevitable in these cases. Assessment and investigation Given the interplay between male and female factors, the man should not be investigated in isolation from his female paner. A careful history is the mainstay of the assessment with a careful search for aetiological factors. Physical examination is usually normal, but occasionally the testes may feel small (suggestive of a testicular cause), the vasa may be absent, there may be evidence of endocrine abnormalities(gynaecomastia or abnormal hair distribution) or there may be a varicocoele. The relation of any varicocoele to the infeility is controversial and treatment is not usually indicated. The woman should be also be assessed. It is impoant to remember that female feility declines from the age of 35 years in a way that is not true of men. The age of the woman is therefore impoant and the regularity of menstruation should be confirmed either by temperature testing or by endocrinological testing. The assessment of the man includes semen analysis, which should be tested within 2 hours of the semen being produced. Two or three samples should be tested. The volume of the ejaculate, the numbers of sperm, their motility and the percentage of abnormal or damaged sperm are all predictive of male feility. An endocrine screen should be performed including serum testosterone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1511",A

If the hernia is bulging out of the abdominal wall (a direct hernia), the bulge is pushed back into place. If the hernia is going down the inguinal canal (indirect), the hernia sac is either pushed back or tied off and removed.The weak spot in the muscle wall-where the hernia bulges through-traditionally has been repaired by sewing the edges of healthy muscle tissue together (herniorrhaphy). This is appropriate for smaller hernias that have been present since birth (indirect hernias) and for healthy tissue, where it is possible to use stitches without adding stress on the tissue. But the surgical approach varies depending on the area of muscle wMesh patches of synthetic material (Gore-Tex, Teflon, Dacron, Marlex, or Prolene) are now being widely used to repair hernias (hemioplasty). This is especially true for hernias that recur and for large hernias, patches are sewn over the weakened area in the abdominal wall after the hernia is pushed back into place. The patch decreases the tension on the weakened abdominal wall, reducing the risk that a hernia will recurall to be repaired and the surgeon's preference.Indirect (Oblique) inguinal herniaMost common form of hernia, especially in the young more common on right side (65%)In the groin, an indirect inguinal hernia results when obliteration of the processus vaginalis, the peritoneal extension accompanying the testis in its descent into the scrotum fails to occur.

"A 45 year - male presents with abrupt onset pain, weakness, loss of contour of shoulder and muscle wasting on 5deg day of tetanus toxoid immunization. Likely cause is:",Hysterical,Radial nerve entrapment,Brachial plexus neuritis,Thoracic outlet syndrome,"Brachial plexus neuritis Ref: Basic neurology [By John Gilroy 3/e p594; ""Brachial plexus neuritis is characterized by a sudden paralysis of muscles supplied through the brachial plexus and is often associated with painful dysesthesia of the arm. The condition occurs in known viral infections (herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus), following injections of tetanus toxoid, in putative viral infections; and as an autobnmune disorder following a surgical procedure.""- Basic neurology By John Gilroy 3/e p594 Brachial plexus neuritis usually is characterized by the acute onset of excruciating unilateral shoulder pain, followed by flaccid paralysis of shoulder and parascapular muscles several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly.",C

All of the following are used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis EXCEPT:,Analgesics,IV fluids,Antibiotics,Nasojejunal feeds,"In most patients (85-90%) with acute pancreatitis, the disease is self-limited and subsides spontaneously, usually within three to seven days after treatment is instituted. Conventional measures includes *Analgesics for pain *IV fluids and colloids to maintain normal intravascular volume *No oral alimentation. Once it is clear that a patient will not be able to tolerate oral feeding (a determination that can usually be made within 48-72 hours), enteral nutrition should be considered since it maintains gut barrier integrity, thereby preventing bacterial translocation, is less expensive, and has fewer complications than TPN. The route through which enteral feeding is administered is under debate. Nasogastric access is easier to establish and may be as safe as nasojejunal enteral nutrition. However, enteral nutrition that bypasses the stomach and duodenum stimulates pancreatic secretions less and this rationale theoretically suppos the use of the nasojejunal route. It has not been demonstrated whether either route is superior in altering morbidity and moality. When patients with necrotizing pancreatitis begin oral intake of food, consideration should also be given to the addition of pancreatic enzyme supplementation and proton pump inhibitor therapy to assist with fat digestion and reduce gastric acid. About oral antibiotics harrisson states that: ""There is currently no role for prophylactic antibiotics in either interstitial or necrotizing pancreatitis. Although several early studies suggested a role for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, two recent double-blind, randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a reduction in pancreatic infection with use of antibiotic prophylaxis"". Percutaneous aspiration of necrosis with Gram stain and culture should generally not be performed until at least 7-10 days after establishing a diagnosis of necrotizing pancreatitis and only if there are ongoing signs of possible pancreatic infection such as sustained leukocytosis, fever, or organ failure. Once a diagnosis of infected necrosis is established, appropriate antibiotics should be instituted and surgical debridement should be undeaken",C

Maingot's writes- ""The current standard for endoscopic therapy for esophageal varices is endoscopic banding. This has largely replaced endoscopic sclerotherapy because it has fewer side effects, obliterates varices faster, and, with new technology, can be easily applied.-

Cirrhotic patients with variceal bleeding have a high risk of developing bacterial infections, which are associated with rebleeding and a higher mortality rate. The use of short-term prophylactic antibiotics has been shown both to decrease the rate of bacterial infections and to increase survival.",A

PTC is the most common type of thyroid carcinoma
More common in females with a female : male ratio of 2 : 1.
Mean age at presentation is 30 to 40 years
Most common presentation is a painless nodule in the neck or a cervical lymph node (lateral aberrant thyroid) Spread to the lymph nodes is common but blood-borne metastasis is unusual.
Multiple foci may occur in the same lobe as the primary tumor or, less commonly in both lobes (this may be due to lymphatic spread in the rich intrathyroidal lymph plexus, or due to multicentric growth).
Diagnosis is confirmed by FNA biopsy of the thyroid mass or lymph node.",D

Diagnosis is made after exclusion of more common conditions such as biliary stricture of known cause like previous surgery, trauma etc, primary or secondary sclerosing cholangitis or cholangicarcinomaClinical presentationo The common clinical presentation is that of recurrent RUQ pain, fever and jaundice. Leukocytosis with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are seen.Pathologyo The exact aetiology is not well understood but strongly association with hepatobiliary infestation with Clonorchis sinensis (liver fluke) or ascaris lumbricoides have been implicated. Other associations include poor nutritional or socioeconomic status and ascending cholangitis from gut Escherichia coli florao The fluke acts like a nidus for stone formation and either directly or by causing strictures aids which to their formation.o Periductal inflammatory changes with infiltration of periportal spaces with inflammatory cells leading to periductal fibrosis and stricture which could ultimately leads into focal liver fibrosis or diffuse biliary cirrhosis.Radiographic featureso MRCP is superior to ERCP in depicting intra- and extrahepatic changes.Treatment and prognosiso Interventional radiology plays a role in percutaneous biliary drainage of affected segments, removal of pigment stones, balloon dilation of biliary strictures and repeated percutaneous procedures to clear pigment stones and mud-like biliary debris.Complicationso Biliary cirrhosiso Cholangiocarcinoma (in ~5% of cases)",D

"A patient develops sudden palpitation with HR 150/min, regular. What could be the cause aEUR'",PSVT,Sinus tachycardia,Ventricular tachycardia,Atrial flutter with block,"PSVT [Ref: Harrison 17/e p. 1431, 1427, 1426, 14351 Sinus tachycardia Sinus tachycardia occurs when SA node discharges at a rate faster than 100 beats/minute. Sinus tachycardia represents a normal or appropriate response to a physiological stress such as that occurs with exercise, anxiety or fever. It is impoant to distinguish sinus tachycardia from other SVT's. - Sinus tachycardia will produce a Pwave contour consistent with its origin from the sinus node. - Sinus tachycardia is in absence of complicating conduction disturbance is characterized by normal P-QRS-T complexes which are recorded in rapid succession. Onset of sinus tachycardia is gradual. - Sinus tachycardia is the normal physiological response to exercise and emotions. A sinus tachycardia that persists at rest is usually an expression of some underlying disorder. Atrial flutter In atrial flutter the impulse originates .from a single .focus in the atria. Classical or typical atrial flutter has an atrial rate of about 300 heats/minute. The ventricular response to this rapid atrial activity depends upon the efficacy of A-V conduction. - Occasionally every atrial impulse is conducted to the ventricle i.e., a 1:1 response resulting in very .fast ventricular rate. - More commonly second degree A-V block is present resulting in a relatively slow ventricular rate. The Atrial flutter commonly present in with a ventricular response that tends to be 2:1 or typically 130-150 beats/minute. - This means that every second atrial beat gets through the A-V node. - Because the ration of P to QRS is usually consistent atrial flutter is often regular. So atrial flutter commonly present as fixed 2:1 A-V block with a regular hea rate that is 150-200 b/rm These are spontaneously occurring and sporadic paroxysmal episodes of regular rapid hea rate of 150-250 beats/minute. Theoretically it refers to any tachycardia that is not ventricular in origin. In the widest sense SVT may include abnormal sinus tachycardia, ectopic atrial tachycardia (that is not from sinoatrial node), Atrial .fibrillation1flutter and junctional tachycardial. Often, however, in clinical setting, it is used practically as a synonym for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia develops and ends abruptly and during the episode the hea rate is b/w 150-250 and is regular. - Symptoms in PSVT may sta and stop suddenly often in response to quick movement such as picking up something from the floor. Because physiological sinus tachycardia has a gradual onset and atrial fibrillation is irregular they are excluded from the PSVT category. PSVT are most commonly AV nodal reentrant tachycardia or pa of WPW syndrome. Idioventricular rhvthum In idioventricular tachycardia an ectopic, focus in the ventricle is enhanced and it exceeds or equals the sinus rate. The hea rate in idioventricular rhythm is in the rage of 70- 80b/minute. Sinus tachycardia can be ruled out as it has slow onset. In idioventricular tachycardia the hea rate is usually 70-80 beats/minute. So we are left with I'SVT and Atrial flutter with block. - Atrial flutter has an atrial rate of 250-300 beat/minute and the hea rate is irregular but it is usually associated with fixed 2:1 block so the hea rate drops to 150 b/m and the rate becomes regular. - So both PSVT and Atrial flutter can have regular hea rate of 150 b/m. - Both have sudden onset. There is nothing much to differentiate b/w supraventricular tachycardia and Atrial fibrillation. Supraventicrucular tachycardia seems to be the correct option because it is quite rare .for a normal person to develop atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation usually develops in patients with preexisting cardiac disease. The question does not give any information regarding this, so it can be assumed that he is a normal healthy person. Sudden palpitation in a normal healthy person is most likely due to supraventricular tachycardia.",A
Ideal investigation for fistula-in-ano is: March 2008,Endoanal ultrasound,MRI,Fistulography,CT scan,"Ans. B: MRI A fistula in ano is a tract lined by granulation tissue which connects the anal canal mucosa with the skin around the anus. The fistula continues to discharge and the constant reinfection from the anal canal prevents healing of the fistula. Identification of fistulous tract: Physical examination - Digital Rectal Examination, Proctoscopy, Probe test Injection technique - Dye injection (methylene blue or Indigo carmine), Hydrogen peroxide Fistulography Endoanal ultrasound gives impoant information about sphincter integrity. Endoanal ultrasound, especially with hydrogen peroxide, can also be used to delineate fistulae, although definition of sepsis outside or above the sphincters is limited by the probe's focal range and scarring makes interpretation difficult. MRI is acknowledged to be the gold standard for fistula imaging but it is limited by availability and the cost and is usually reserved for difficult recurrent cases. CT scan and fistulography both have limitations but are useful if extrasphincteric fistula is suspected.",B

"During the course of an operation on an unstable, critically ill patient, the left ureter is lacerated through 50% of its circumference.

In the middle third of the ureter, this will usually consist of ureteroureterostomy using absorbable sutures over a stent. If the injury involves the upper third, ureter pyeloplasty may be necessary. In the lower third, ureteral implantation into the bladder using a tunneling technique is preferred. If time does not permit definitive repair, suction drainage adjacent to the injured segment alone is inadequate; either ligation and nephrostomy or placement of a catheter into the proximal ureter is an acceptable alternative that would allow reconstruction to be performed later. The creation of a watertight seal is difficult and nephrectomy may be required if the injury occurs during a procedure in which a vascular prosthesis is being implanted (e.g., an aortic reconstructive procedure) and contamination of the foreign body by urine must be avoided.",A

Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia is seen in all of the following diseases except aEUR',Antiphosphplipid antibody syndrome,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Microscopic polyangitis,Metallic cardiac valves,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome Metallic cardiac valves do not cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Don't mix microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with fragmentation syndrome. They are two separate entities, according to most standard text in hematology. Fragmentation syndrome Red cells when subjected to mechanical trauma may undergo .fragmentation in circulation. These fragment cells have shapes like triangular cells, helmet cells and are known as schistiocytes and are easily made out in a well made peripheral blood, film. Schistiocytes are the hallmark of diagnosis of this group of hemolytic anemia. Fragmentation of the red cell can occur either in large vessels or small vessels of capillaries and aerioles. Microangiopathic hemolytic Anemia When fragmentation occurs in small vessels of capillaries and aerioles due to the presence of thrombotic lesions, it is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is characterized by hemolytic anemia due to red cell .fragmentation. There is associated small vessel disease of capillaries and aerioles with thrombotic lesions. As the red cells pass through these microthrombi, red cells get attached to them and pa of RBC's get .fragmented by high shear forces.

C/F - decreased consciousness, decreased respiratory rate and decreased hea rate. - Cardiac output also falls propoional to the severity of hypothermia, and a patient who initially lacks any signs of life may make a full recovery with appropriate suppoive therapy. - The main cause of death is cardiac arrhythmia; the myocardium becomes increasingly irritable below a temperature of 33degC and patients are at paicular risk of fibrillation. Because of this, all hypothermia patients require cardiac monitoring and should be rewarmed using 'passive external warm-ing techniques' including blankets, external heat sources and warmed IV fluids. The possibility of confounding causes of unresponsiveness should not be overlooked, and evidence of alcohol, drug use or sepsis should be excluded. - Hypoglycaemia is another cause of reduced responsiveness that also frequently occurs secondary to hypothermia; therefore blood glucose monitoring and IV dextrose should be initiated as standard. - Rx -'Active core rewarming methods' are the reserve of severe hypothermia or hypothermia in high-risk patients (i.e. in conjunction with other injuries) and would not therefore be indicated in this scenario.

PSA is measured in which units,gm/ml,mg/ml,mcg/ml,ng/ml,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., ng/ml Prostate specific antigen* It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen.* It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific)y nevertheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis.# Normal serum level - less than 4 ng/ml# 4-10 ng/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca.# More than 10 ng/ml - approx 75% will have cancer.* Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density are used to detect Prostate cancer.* PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 ng/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 ng/mL per year should be used to advise biopsy.* PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.# Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH.# >0.15 suggest cancer",D

A patient who has a total pancreatectomy might be expected to develop which of the following complications?,Diabetes mellitus,Hypercalcemia,Hyperphosphatemia,Constipation,"The metabolic consequences of total pancreatectomy are manifold. They include weight loss, malabsorption attended by hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, diabetes mellitus, diarrhea, and both iron deficiency and pernicious anemia. In theory, total pancreatectomy should provide good surgical treatment for pancreatic carcinoma; in reality, the severe metabolic problems that result from total removal of the pancreas make partial pancreaticoduodenectomy a frequently preferred treatment for most cases of pancreatic carcinoma that are resectable. Because of the frequently multicentric nature of pancreatic cancers, however, some surgeons would rather perform a total pancreatectomy and accept the more complicated postoperative metabolic management entailed by the loss of pancreatic endocrine function.",A
