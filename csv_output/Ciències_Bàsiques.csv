Growth hormone does not cause ?,Gigantism,Acromegaly,Diabetes mellitus,Hypothyroidism,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., HypothyroidismPhysiological effects of Growth hormone Growth hormone has two major action, i.e., (1) Stimulation of skeletal growth, and (2) Regulation of metabolism. 3) Stimulation of skeletal growthThe effect of GH on skeletal growth is mediated by somatomedins (Insulin-like growth factors : IGF). They are synthesized mainly in the liver. The growth promoting action of somatomedins is helped by their insulin like actions. GH, through somatomedin (IGF-1), stimulates proliferation of chondrocytes and osteocytes resulting in increased deposition of chondroitin sulfate in catilage and increased ossification of the newly formed cailage.GH deficiency in early life causes dwarfism (small height). GH excess in early life leads to gigantism, whereas growth hormone excess in adulthood results in acromegaly.2) Regulation of metabolismProtein metabolism : - GH has predominantly anabolic effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle where it promotes amino acid transpo into cells and increase protein synthesis.Carbohydrate and fat metabolism : - The effects of GH on carbohydrate and fat metabolism are complicated by the fact that GH has anti-insulin effects, whereas somatomedins it produces have insulin like effects:-i) Anti-insulin effects due to direct effect of GH include decreased peripheral utilization of glucose, increased gluconeogenesis, hyperglycemia, and lipolysis. Due to its anti-insulin effects GH excess can cause insulin resistant diabetes mellitus.ii) Insulin like effects due to somatomedins (IGF) include antilipolytic activity, and other insulin like effects.",D

Visceral larva migrans is caused by which of the following organism?,Ascariasis,Toxocara Canis,Schistosomiasis,Clonorchis Buski,"Visceral larva migrans is a syndrome caused by nematodes that are normally parasitic for nonhuman host species. The most common form of visceral larva migrans is toxocariasis due to larvae of the canine ascarids Toxocara canis. T canis: The definitive host is the dog. Eggs of T canis is passed through the feces in the dogs which is accidently ingested by humans through the soil contaminated by dogs feces. These eggs hatch into larvae in the human intestine and spread to different organs especially liver, brain and eyes. The larvae eventually are encapsulated and die. Definitive diagnosis is made by visualizing the larvae in tissue. Presence of hypergammaglobulinemia and eosinophilia suppos the diagnosis. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 56. Nematodes. In W.

A clinical sign indicating the onset of the menopause is:,The onset of menses near age 50,An increase in plasma FSH levels,An excessive presence of corpora lutea,An increased number of cornified cells in the vagina,"Ans. B. An increase in plasma FSH levelsOne of the first clinical measures for menopause is an increase in the serum concentration of FSH (and LH), indicative of the lack of ovarian function. Menses starts at age 12, not age 50, and its onset at this time would not indicate menopause. Excessive corpora lutea would likely indicate multiple ovulations or a failure of luteal regression. Increased vaginal cornification is an indicator of estrogen secretion, which does not occur in menopause. Menstrual cycles become irregular at menopause.",B

It also draws the lateral meniscus posteriorly, thereby protecting this cailage as the distal femoral condyle glides and rolls backward, as the knee is flexed. The Biceps Femoris is a strong flexor of the leg and laterally rotates the knee when it is in a position of flexion. The Gastronemius is a powerful plantar flexor of the foot. The Semimembranosus is involved in extending the thigh and flexing the leg at the knee joint.",C
Which of the following is not regulated through a negative feed back mechanism?,ACTH release,Blood Pressure,Thrombus formation,Growth Hormone formation,"Thrombus formation is an example of positive feedback mechanism. Blood clotting is an example of a valuable use of positive feedback. When a blood vessel is ruptured and a clot begins to form, multiple enzymes called clotting factors are activated within the clot itself. Some of these enzymes act on other unactivated enzymes of the immediately adjacent blood, thus causing more blood clotting. This process continues until the hole in the vessel is plugged and bleeding no longer occurs.

Acetylation of histones results in which of the following modification?,Increased Heterochromatin formation,Increased mRNA production,Activate Deacetylases,Arginine Methylation,"Pretranscriptional control refers to the carefully controlled and selective unwinding of chromatin to facilitate gene expression. It is known that modification of histones is functionally impoant in this process. Enzymatic attachment of an acetyl group to ceain amino acids in histones is critical - Acetylation of histones. The acetylation of histones affects the charge interactions with DNA, resulting in unwinding of DNA at that specific location, and thereby facilitates subsequent steps required to generate nascent mRNA. Conversely, deacetylation of histones can result in rewinding of chromatin and inhibition of gene expression. This modification of histones is carried out by a large family of enzymes termed histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Why is this topic impoant and frequently asked? 1. Cardiovascular biology: E.g. Experimental studies in mice lacking specific HATs or HDACs can profoundly alter processes such as blood vessel development or cardiac hyperophy. Because acetylation and deacetylation are enzymatic processes, they are amenable to pharmacologic manipulation. Indeed, agents such as trichostatin A have been shown to ameliorate cardiac hyperophy in rodents. 2. Chromatin modification: Acetylation is perhaps the most well-studied chromatin modification so far. However others such as lysine/arginine methylation, serine phosphorylation, and ubiquitination are also likely to be impoant areas from both a scientific and therapeutic perspective for the future.

The latent period of muscle twitch is 10ms and the contraction period is 40ms. What is the tetanizing frequency (Hz)?,25,50,100,75,"Tetanizing frequency = 1/Contraction period = 1/40ms = 25Hz Tetanizing Frequency As the contractile mechanism does not have a refractory period, on rapid stimulation of a muscle, each new contraction occurs before the preceeding one is over. As a result, the second contraction is added paially to the first, and thus the total strength of contraction rises progressively with increasing frequency . Such a response is called a tetanus (tetanic contraction). It is a complete tetanus when no relaxation occurs between stimuli. Tetany occurs because enough calcium ions are maintained in the muscle sarcoplasm throughout the period of stimulation. Ref: Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 26th edition Pgno: 107",A

"A 45-year-old man is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of diplopia, weakness of his lower extremities, and gait difficulties. During the interview, the patient reveals that he has been forcing himself to vomit after almost every meal over the last 6 weeks. He denies associated eye pain and discomfo, headache, or dysphagia. He has never experienced such symptoms in the past. Examination of the patient demonstrates slight disorientation, veical nystagmus worse on downgaze, diffuse weakness of the lower extremities, bilateral dysmetria, and hypothermia. Laboratory analyses reveal mild dehydration and hypokalemia. The patient's status has improved after an administration of a vitamin. The physiologically active form of this vitamin acts as a coenzyme for which of the following enzymes?",Glycogen phosphorylase,L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase,Methionine synthase,Pyruvate dehydrogenase,"Thiamine (vitamin B1) is conveed intracellularly to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, which is an essential cofactor in intermediate carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine acts as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which plays a critical role in the production of energy from food, and the pentose-phosphate pathway, which produces an impoant intermediate, ribose-5-phosphate, required for the synthesis of ATP, GTP, DNA, RNA, and NADPH. The brain is paicularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency because it relies exclusively on carbohydrates for immediate energy demands. The selective vulnerability of ceain structures accounts for the specific clinical manifestations of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the physiologically active form of thiamine, is required for the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, regulating entry into the citric acid cycle for metabolites leaving glycolysis. The PDH complex is comprised of 3 separate enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (decarboxylase), dihydrolipoamide transacetylase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Besides TPP, the complex also requires CoA, NAD, FAD, and lipoic acid as coenzymes. The mechanism of TPP action includes formation of a carbanion that can attack the electron-deficient keto carbon of pyruvate. In addition, TPP functions as a coenzyme for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase. Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Methionine synthase activation leads to synthesis of methionine from homocysteine with folic acid as a coenzyme.",D

Upper limb weight is transmitted to axial skeleton by all except?,Coracoacromial ligament,>Claviculoclavicular [interclavicularj ligament,>Costoclavicular ligament,>Acromioclavicular ligament,"Coracoacromial ligament The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from the scapula to the clavicle through the acromioclavicular joint and from the clavicle to the axial skeleton through the sternoclavicular joint. Thus the ligaments maintaining the stability of these two joints transmit the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton. Acromioclavicular joint Acromioclavicular joint is formed by aiculation between the lateral end of the clavicle and the medial margin of the acromial process of the scapula. Ligaments stabilizing the joint are: - Acromioclavicular ligament - Coracoclavicular ligament (this is the major ligament transmitting upper limb weight to the clavicle) Sternoclavicular joint Sternoclavicular joint is the only skeletal aiculation between the upper limb and the axial skeleton. It is a compound joint with 3 elements taking pa in the joint: 1) medial end of the clavicle 2) the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni and 3) first costal cailage The ligaments of the joint are: - the anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments , - the costoclavicular ligaments on each side, _ and the midline interclavicular ligament. The interclavicular ligament passes between the sterna ends of the right and left clavicles, with some of the fibres attached to the upper border of the manubrium sterni. Costoclavicular ligament connects the clavicle to the upper surface of the first rib and its cailage. This ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing factor of the sternoclavicular joint. The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong ligament, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms the coracoacromial arch which prevents upward dislocation of the humerus. It extends between two processes of the scapula and takes no pa in transmission of weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.",A

Rather Ca** binds to calmodulin and resulting complex activates calmodulin dependent myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of myosine light chain on serine at position 19Myosin LC20 phosphorylation is a must and increases myosin ATPase activityQ resultingin binding of myosin to actin and contraction . However, phosphorylation & dephosphorylation of myosin also occur in skeletal muscle but phosphorylation is not necessary for activation of ATPaseDephosphorylation & Latch bridgesMyosin LC is dephosphorylated by myosin light chain phosphatase but it does not necessarily Vt relaxation & final detachmentQ of myosin cross bridges from actin until the intracellular concentration of falls below a critical level.This continued attachment of myosin cross bridges to actin even after dephosphorylation creates latch bridgesLatch bridges do not make significant cycles of attachment & detachmentQ between actin & myosin so do not require much ATPQ and so maintain prolonged contractions without expenditure of much energy.If epinephrine or NE is added, the membrane potential becomes larger, the spikes decrease in frequency & muscle relaxes. Whereas acetylcholine addition 1/t decreased membrane potential, spikes become more frequent, muscle becomes more active with an increase in tonic tension & number of rhythmic contractions.During smooth muscle contraction increase in cytosolic calcium is due to influx through voltage or ligand gated plasma membrane Ca++ channelsQ and release of Ca++ from sarcoplasmic reticulum activated by 1P3 receptor calcium channelsQ",D

Hormones required during puberty -,LSH,Testesterone,Leptin,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above o Puberty is triggered by a release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) from pituitary gland,o These hormones act as signals to the gonads (testes/ovaries) that trigger the production of -Estrogen, progesterone and some testosterone in women.Testosterone in men.o in both males and females, testosterone is responsible for development of pubic hair, accelerated bone growth, body odor and acne during puberty. For boys, testosterone is responsible for the process of virilization, including the enlargement of the penis, increased libido and growth of facial and chest hair,o Estrogen is the major hormone responsible for female puberal development. It causes development of breast and thickening of endometrium.o Progesterone causes proliferation of acini in mammary glands and converts watery cervical secretion to viscid and scanty.o Leptin facilitates release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). thereby helping in pubertal onset,o Other hormones which are involved in puberty are thyroxine and growth hormone.",D
Where does capacitation of sperms occur in the reproductive tract?,Epididymis,Vas deferens,Vagina,Uterus,"After ejaculation into the female, spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Capacitation involves two components : increasing the motility of spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. From the isthmuses the capacitated spermatozoa move rapidly to the tubal ampullas, where feilization takes place. Spermatozoa attain progressive motility in the epidydimis. It involves activation of a unique set of proteins from the CatSper family, which are localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail. Ejaculation of the spermatozoon involves contractions of the vas deferens mediated in pa by P2X receptors, ligand-gated cation channels that respond to ATP.

Which of the following type of hypersensitivity reactions occur in farmer's lung diseas,Type1,Type2,Type3,Type4,"Ref Robbins 8/e p207; 9/e p210 Inflammatory Reactions Elicited by CD4+ T Cells The sequence of events in T cell-mediated inflammatory reactions begins with the first exposure to antigen and is essentially the same as the reactions of cell-mediated immunity (Fig. 4-4). Naive CD4+ T lymphocytes recognize peptide antigens of self or microbial proteins in association with class II MHC molecules on the surface of DCs (or macrophages) that have processed the antigens. If the DCs produce IL-12, the naive T cells differentiate into effector cells of the TH1 type. The cytokine IFN-g, made by NK cells and by the TH1 cells themselves, fuher promotes TH1 dif- ferentiation, providing a powerful positive feedback loop. If the APCs produce IL-1, IL-6, or IL-23 instead of IL-12, the CD4+ cells develop into TH17 effectors. On subsequent exposure to the antigen, the previously generated effector cells are recruited to the site of antigen exposure and are activated by the antigen presented by local APCs. The TH1 cells secrete IFN-g, which is the most potent macrophage- activating cytokine known. Activated macrophages have increased phagocytic and microbicidal activity. Activated macrophages also express more class II MHC molecules and costimulators, leading to augmented antigen presenta- tion capacity, and the cells secrete more IL-12, thus stimu- lating more TH1 responses. Upon activation by antigen, TH17 effector cells secrete IL-17 and several other cytokines, which promote the recruitment of neutrophils (and mono- cytes) and thus induce inflammation. Because the cyto- kines produced by the T cells enhance leukocyte recruitment and activation, these inflammatory reactions become chronic unless the offending agent is eliminated or the cycle is interrupted therapeutically. In fact, inflammation occurs as an early response to microbes and dead cells (Chapter 2), but it is greatly increased and prolonged when T cells are involved. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter.",C

Which of the following support the Spring ligament?,Tibialis posterior,Peroneus longus,Abductor hallucis,All of the above,"Ans. A. Tibialis posterior.The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament) is a ligament on the underside of the foot that connects anterior margin of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus to the plantar surface of the navicular. This ligament not only serves to connect the calcaneus and navicular, but supports the head of the talus. The dorsal surface of the ligament presents a fibrocartilaginous facet, lined by the synovial membrane, and upon this a portion of the head of the talus rests. The spring ligament lies deep to the tibialis posterior tendon separated from it by a gliding layer. It measures approximately 5mm in medial to lateral dimension.# Around the ankle, there are three ligaments in the superficial layer named for their origin and insertion. Two of these run between bony structures. The anterior ligament is the tibionavicular and the posterior is the tibiocalcaneal ligament. The transverse component of the medial ligament complex is the spring ligament. The spring ligament represents one component of a ligament complex passing between the os calcis and the navicular, which is the superoficial calcaneonavicular ligament.# The function of tibialis posterior in maintaining the medial arch of the foot is supported by the spring ligament.# The tendon of the tibialis posterior supports its plantar surface; its medial border is blended with the forepart of the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.# The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament helps to maintain the medial longitudinal arch of the foot and by providing support to the head of the talus bears the major portion of the body weight. It is the main part of the spring ligament complex.Other ligaments of ankle joint:Principle supports of the Medial longitudinal arch of the foot:e# Spring ligament# Plantar fascia: acts as a tie by means of its attachments to the heel and metatarsal heads.# Abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis (spring ties)# Tibialis anterior: elevates arch with Peroneus longus forms a supporting sling.# Tibialis posterior: adducts mid-tarsal joint and reinforces the action of spring ligament# Flexor hallucis longus",A

The gas that is used to measure diffusing capacity of lung is:,Carbon monoxide,Carbon dioxide,Nitrogen,helium,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is used to measure diffusing capacity of the lung. CO is a 'diffusion-limited' gas. CO has high solubility in blood. However, when CO is given by inhalation, it does not remain in aqueous phase. Reason: CO has very high affinity for Hb; it enters red cells and combines with Hb. Due to this, CO content of blood will be high but paial pressure of CO (pCO) will not rise. (Paial pressure is exeed by the gas in solution and not by the gas that combines with Hb). Paial pressure of CO in capillary blood remains close to zero.

Negative waves in jugular venous pulse: March 2010,A wave,V wave,C wave,X wave,"Ans. D: X waveAtrial pressure rises during atrial systole and continues to rise during isovolumetric ventricular contraction when the AV valves bulge into the atria. When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole.The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic positive waves in the record of jugular pressure.The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract, even though the orifices of the great veins are constricted. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave.The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction.The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole.Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration.Careful bedside inspection of the pulsations of the jugular veins may give clinical information of some impoance. For examplein tricuspid insufficiency there is a giant c wave with each ventricular systole.In complete hea block, when the atria and ventricles are beating at different rates, the a waves that are not synchronous with the radial pulse can be made out, and there is a giant a wave (""cannon wave"") whenever the atria contract while the tricuspid valve is closed.",D

The diagram represents the path traversed in the neck by the developing thyroid gland embryo logically. Which point along this path is the commonest site of a Thyro-glossal cyst?,Point I,Point II.,Point III,Point IV,"Ans. C. Point III.Embryology of the Thyroid Glanda. The thyroid gland begins to develop during the third week as an endodermal thickening in the midline of the floor of the pharynx between the tuberculum impar and the copula. Later, this thickening becomes a diverticulum that grows interiorly into the underlying mesenchyme and is called the thyroglossal duct. As development continues, the duct elongates, and its distal end becomes bilobed. Soon, the duct becomes a solid cord of cells, and as a result of epithelial proliferation, the bilobed terminal swellings expand to form the thyroid gland.b. The thyroid gland now migrates interiorly in the neck and passes either anterior to, posterior to, or through the developing body of the hyoid bone. By the seventh week, it reaches its final position in relation to the larynx and trachea. Meanwhile, the solid cord connecting the thyroid gland to the tongue fragments and disappears. The site of origin of the thyroglossal duct on the tongue remains as a pit called the foramen cecum. The thyroid gland may now be divided into a small median isthmus and two large lateral lobes.c. In the earliest stages, the thyroid gland consists of a solid mass of cells. Later, as a result of invasion by surrounding vascular mesenchymal tissue, the mass becomes broken up into plates and cords and finally into small clusters of cells. By the third month, colloid starts to accumulate in the center of each cluster so that follicles are formed. The fibrous capsule and connective tissue develop from the surrounding mesenchyme.d. The ultimobranchial bodies (from the fifth pharyngeal pouch) and neural crest cells are believed to be incorporated into the thyroid gland, where they form the parafollicular cells, which produce calcitonin.e. Agenesis of the Thyroid: - Failure of development of the thyroid gland may occur and is the commonest cause of cretinism.f. Incomplete Descent of the Thyroid: - The descent of the thyroid may be arrested at any point between the base of the tongue and the trachea. Lingual thyroid is the most common form of incomplete descent. The mass of tissue found just beneath the foramen cecum may be sufficiently large to obstruct swallowing in the infant.g. Ectopic Thyroid Tissue: - Ectopic thyroid tissue is occasionally found in the thorax in relation to the trachea or bronchi or even the esophagus. It is assumed that this thyroid tissue arises from entodermal cells displaced during the formation of the laryngotracheal tube or from entodermal cells of the developing esophagush. Persistent Thyroglossal Duct: -Conditions related to a persistence of the thyroglossal duct usually appear in childhood, in adolescence, or in young adults.i. Thyroglossal Cyst: - Cysts may occur at any point along the thyroglossal tract They occur most commonly in the region below the hyoid bone. Such a cyst occupies the midline and develops as a result of persistence of a small amount of epithelium that continues to secrete mucus. As the cyst enlarges, it is prone to infection and so it should be removed surgically. Since remnants of the duct often traverse the body of the hyoid bone, this may have to be excised also to prevent recurrence.j. Thyroglossal Sinus (Fistula): - Occasionally, a thyroglossal cyst ruptures spontaneously, producing a sinus. Usually, this is a result of an infection of a cyst. All remnants of the thyroglossal duct should be removed surgically.",C

Base stacking of DNA leads to:,Linear dichromicity,Hypochromicity,Hyperchromicity,Electrophoresis,"Base stacking: stacking of the nucleotide chromophores in helical structures leads to the phenomenon of 'hypochromicity' (diminished ability of the bases to absorb ultraviolet light). The nucleotides may lay in a such a way that the faces of the ring are appositioned. The stacking is most likely to occur near chain termini where the bases move. It gives rigiditiy to the strand. Stacking of the DNA (and RNA) bases is a strong contributor to the overall stabilization of the double helix. It is detected by circular dichroism and optical rotatary dispersion. Hyperchromicity and hypochromicity: DNA maximally absorbs ultraviolet light at a wavelength of 260nm. Bases are principally responsble for absorption. Stacking of DNA diminishes the capacity of bases to absorb light resulting in hypochromicity. Elimination of stacking by denaturation or heating results in hyperchromicity. The explanation for this increase is that duplex DNA absorbs less ultraviolet light by about 40% than do individual DNA chains.

These nanocrystal probes are thus complementary and in some cases may be superior to existing fluorophores"". - Science 25 September 1998: Vol 281 No. 5385 pp2013-2016After much searching we could get some information on the nanocrystals and nanotechnology which could be easy to understand. Most of the material available was quite complicated and beyond our scope.Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scale. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology in the US.One nanometer is one billionth, or 10-9 of a meter. To give a sense of measurement a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm and the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length.Nanocrystals, also called Quantum dots, are inorganic crystals that exhibit very strong fluorescent emissions. These materials are considered semiconductors and range from one to fifty nanometers in diameter.These semiconductor nanocrystals are remarkably durable.The desired behavior and transmission directly correlates to their size. To change the emitted wavelength, the crystal is grown larger or smaller. Their electronic and optical properties can be controlled by this method. For example to change the emission from one visible wavelength to another simply use a larger or smaller grown crystal.The nanocrystal size controls a widely tunable absorption band resultign in widely tunable emission spectra. This tunability combined with the optical stability of nanocrystals and the great chemical flexibility in the nanocrystal growth have resulted in the widespread nanocrystal applications in use today. They have been a mainstay as fluorescent markers in biological and medical research for years. As such, they are usually incorporated into polystyrene beads, mixed into a solution and then incorporated into the biological system.NanotechnologyNanomedicine is the medical application of nanotechnology.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanomedicine - cite_note-Nanomed1-1 Nanomedicine ranges from the medical applications of nanomaterials, to nanoelectronic biosensors, and even possible future applications of molecular nanotechnology.The biological and medical research communities have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications (e.g., contrast agents for cell imaging and therapeutics for treating cancer).Thus far, the integration of nanomaterials with biology has led to the development of diagnostic devices, contrast agents, analytical tools, physical therapy applications, and drug delivery vehicles.Abraxane, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat breast cancer and non-small- cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel.",D

The role played by major histocompatibility complex 1 and 2,Transduce the signal to T cells following antigen recognition,Mediate immunogenic class switching,Present antigens for recognition by T cells antigen receptor,Enhance the secretion of cytokine,"Ref Robbins 8/e p191 Class I MHC molecules are encoded by three closely linked loci, designated HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C (Fig. 4-3). Each of these molecules is a heterodimer, con- sisting of a polymorphic 44-kDa a chain noncovalently associated with an invariant 12-kDa b2-microglobulin polypeptide (encoded by a separate gene on chromo- some 15). The extracellular poion of the a chain contains a cleft where the polymorphic residues are located and where foreign peptides bind to MHC mol- ecules for presentation to T cells, and a conserved region that binds CD8, ensuring that only CD8+ T cells can respond to peptides displayed by class I molecules. In general, class I MHC molecules bind and display pep- tides derived from proteins synthesized in the cyto- plasm of the cell (e.g., viral antigens). Because class I MHC molecules are present on all nucleated cells, all virus-infected cells can be detected and eliminated by CD8+ CTLs. Class II MHC molecules are encoded by genes in the HLA-D region, which contains at least three subregions: DP, DQ, and DR. Class II MHC molecules are heterodi- mers of noncovalently linked polymorphic a and b sub- units (Fig. 4-3). The extracellular poion of the class II MHC heterodimer contains a cleft for the binding of antigenic peptides and a region that binds CD4. Class II MHC expression is restricted to a few types of cells, mainly APCs (notably, dendritic cells ), macro- phages, and B cells. In general, class II MHC molecules bind to peptides derived from proteins synthesized outside the cell (e.g., those derived from extracellular bacteria) and ingested into the cell. This propey allows CD4+ T cells to recognize the presence of extracellular pathogens and to orchestrate a protective response. * Several other proteins are encoded in the MHC locus, some of which have been called ""class III molecules.""

Which GLUT transporter facilitates Fructose absorption along the apical side of enterocyte?,GLUT 1,GLUT 2,GLUT 4,GLUT 5,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., GLUT 5* Fructose absorption along the apical side of enterocyte is by GLUT 5 transporter. It is an example for facilitated passive diffusion* Fructose absorption along the basolateral side of enterocyte is by GLUT 2 transporter. That is again an example of facilitated passive diffusionGlucose absorption* Glucose absorption along the apical side is by Sodium Glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1)* It is by secondary active transport mechanism* This is primarily why glucose is added to oral rehydration solution.* The purpose of giving oral rehydration solution is to replenish the sodium loss. But we don't just add salt to the solution, we also add glucose. The rationale is that when glucose gets reabsorbed, along with that sodium also gets reabsorbed.* Glucose absorption along the basolateral side is through GLUT 2 transporter* GLUT 2 transporter is an example of facilitated passive diffusion* Galactose absorption also follows the same route. (With the help of SGLT1 along the apical side and GLUT 2 along the basolateral side)Fructose absorption* Fructose absorption along the apical side is by GLUT 5 transporter.* GLUT 5 transporter is an example of facilitated passive diffusion* Fructose absorption along the basolateral side is by GLUT 5 transporter or through GLUT 2 transporter* Thus Fructose absorption along both apical side and basolateral side is by facilitated passive diffusion",D

Following change is noted during exercise:,Blood flow to brain increases with increase in mean systolic blood pressure.,Body temperature increases,Lymphatic flow from muscle decreases,Blood flow to muscles increase after half a minute.,"Circulatory changes increase muscle blood flow while maintaining adequate circulation in the rest of the body. The increase in blood flow is instantaneous (and not half a minute later). Blood flow to brain remains unchanged during exercise. Exercise causes increased blood flow to the exercising muscle with reduction of flow to liver, kidney, GI tract and inactive muscles. Blood flow to the brain remains unchanged. The local mechanisms maintaining a high blood flow in exercising muscle include a. fall in tissue P02, a rise in tissue PCO2, and accumulation of K+, and other vasodilator metabolites.

Which of the following vasopressin receptors MOST likely mediates vasopressin antidiuretic action?,AQP6,Oxytocin receptor,V1a,V2,"The vasopressin receptor family is unique among all classes of peptide receptors, since its members couple to different subsets of G proteins. Vasopressin binds to four distinct types of receptor subtypes V1a, V1b, V2 and the oxytocin receptor. The V2 receptors are located on the basolateral membrane of collecting duct cells. This receptor belongs to the seven-transmembrane domain, G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Stimulation of the V2 receptor by vasopressin leads to the activation of a G protein (Gs), resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase, the production of cAMP, and the stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA stimulates aquaporin 2, a water channel protein, which undergoes vesicular trafficking, inseing into the apical membrane of the duct cells, thereby increasing the water permeability of that membrane. At maximal ADH levels, less than 1% of the filtered water is excreted, with the minimum urine volume of 500 mL/day and osmolality of 1200 mosmol/L. Long term regulation by vasopressin involves the effects of cAMP on the cAMP-response elements in the 5'-flanking region of the AQP2 gene, which increases the abundance of aquaporin 2 protein in the target cells. The human V2 receptor gene, AVPR2, is located in chromosome region Xq28. The genetic form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the coding region of the V2 receptor gene. Note: AQP6 is a water channel protein that is localized exclusively in intracellular membranes in renal epithelia. Vasopressin has low affinity for oxytocin receptors. The oxytocin receptor is a typical class I G protein-coupled receptor, primarily stimulating phospholipase C beta activity. The V1a receptor mediates smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction in splanchnic, coronary, cerebral, peripheral, pulmonary, and intrahepatic vessels), platelet aggregation, hepatic glycogenolysis, and coagulation factor release by vasopressin. It is also proposed that brain V1a vasopressin receptors may mediate the effect of ADH on sho-term memory and learning, antipyresis, cardiovascular responsivity, and brain development. Ref: Reid I.A.

All are true about renal circulation except,Accounts about 25% of the cardiac output,Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is 30mmHg,Renal coical blood flow is more than renal medullary blood flow,Autoregulation of RBF is by myogenic mechanism,"In a resting adult, the kidneys receive 1.2-1.3 L of blood per minute, or just under 25% of the cardiac output. When the mean systemic aerial pressure is 100 mm Hg, the glomerular capillary pressure is about 45 mm Hg. The main function of the renal coex is filtration of large volumes of blood through the glomeruli, hence, renal coical blood flow is relatively great and little oxygen is extracted from the blood. When the kidney is perfused at moderate pressures (90-220 mm Hg in the dog), the renal vascular resistance varies with the pressure so that renal blood flow is relatively constant. Autoregulation occurs by a direct contractile response to stretch of the smooth muscle of the afferent aeriole. NO may also be involved. Maintenance of a relatively constant renal blood flow and GFR is the ability of individual blood vessels to resist stretching during increased aerial pressure, a phenomenon referred to as the myogenic mechanism.",B

All of the following transpo process follow 'saturation kinetics' except:,Facilitated diffusion,Na+ - Cat. exchanger,Simple diffusion,Na+ coupled active transpo,"C i.e. Simple diffusionThe rate of diffusion in simple diffusion keeps on increasing propoionately with the concentration of the diffusing substance and does not follow saturation kinetics.While in other transpo mechanism, the rate of diffusion approaches a maximum, called Vmax, as the concentration of substance increases and then pleateu's off i.e. attains saturation at a paicular level. This is called saturation kinetics mechanismQ.Saturation kinetics will be seen in any transpo process which involves carrier proteins eg. facilitated diffusion and active transpoQ.- The rate at which a substance can be transpoed by these mechanism depends upon the rate at which the carrier protein can undergo conformational change between its active state & inactive state.- So the rate at which molecules can be transpoed by this mechanism can never be greater than the rate at which the carrier protein undergoes conformational change.- This limits the rate of transpo in these process.",C

Regarding oncogenesis,Topoisomerase2 causes break in strands,P53 is the most common oncogene mutation causing malignancy in humans,At G2_M phase there is loss of inhibitors controlling cell cycle,Decrease in telomerase activity causes anti tumor effects,"Topoisomerase2 causes break in strands ; and option C and D is also answer ref Harrison 16/e p453; 454; Robbins 7/e Cell Cycle Inhibitor Proteins Topoisomerases can fix these topological problems and are separated into two types depending on the number of strands cut in one round of action: Both these classes of enzyme utilize a conserved tyrosine. However these enzymes are structurally and mechanistically different. For a video of this process click here. A type I topoisomerase cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is re-ligated. Cutting one strand allows the pa of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix. Such stress is introduced when the DNA strand is ""supercoiled"" or uncoiled to or from higher orders of coiling. A type II topoisomerase cuts both strands of one DNA double helix, passes another unbroken DNA helix through it, and then re-ligates the cut strands. Type II topoisomerases utilize ATP hydrolysis and are subdivided into two subclasses which possess similar structure and mechanisms: Type IIA topoisomerases which include eukaryotic and eukaryal viral Topoisomerase IIa and Topoisomerase IIb, bacterial gyrase, and topoisomerase IV. Type IIB topoisomerases, which include Topoisomerase VI found in archaea",A

A deficiency of substance Folate can result in an anemia. Choose the type of anemia that would occur if the substance were deficient.,Megaloblastic anemia,"Hypochromic, microcytic anemia",Hemolytic anemia,Sickle cell anemia,"a. The 1-carbon groups that FH4 receives are transferred to various compounds (see Figure I below, steps 5 to 8).(1). Purine precursors obtain carbons 2 and 8 from FH4 . Purines are required for DNA and RNA synthesis.(2). dUMP forms dTMP by accepting a 1-carbon group from FH4 (Figure II). This reaction produces the thymine required for DNA synthesis.(a). The methylene group is reduced to a methyl group in this reaction, and FH4 is oxidized to FH2 .(b). FH2 is reduced to FH4 in the NADPH-requiring reaction catalyzed by FH2 reductase.(3). Glycine obtains a 1-carbon group from FH4 to form serine.(4). Vitamin B12 obtains a methyl group from 5-methyl-FH4 . The methyl group is transferred from methyl-B12 to homocysteine to form methionine (see Figure III, reaction 8). This is the only fate of 5-methyl-FH4 .Folate deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia because of decreased production of purines and the pyrimidine thymine. Thus, lack of folate causes decreased DNA synthesis. In contrast with a vitamin B12 deficiency, neurologic problems do not occur in a folate deficiency. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia can result from the lack of iron, or lack of pyridoxal phosphate. Both conditions lead to a reduction in the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, substituting a valine for a glutamic acid.I.

Activation causes the GDP bound to the alpha subunit to be exchanged with GTP from solution and results in activated alpha dissociating from beta-gamma. Active Transducin-alpha then causes cyclic GMP Phosphodiesterase to increase its activity, thereby lowering the concentration of cGMP, an intracellular second-messenger molecule. Decrease in cGMP concentration leads to the closure of cGMP-regulated Na+ and Ca2+ ion channels and a hyperpolarized membrane potential.

True statement about Ribozyme,RNA molecular that acts catalytically to change itself or another RNA molecule,t-RNA,m-RNA,Ribosome,"The substrate for ribozymes is often an RNA molecule, and it may even be pa of the ribozyme itself Ribozymes vary greatly in size. A self-splicing group I intron may have more than 400 nucleotides. The hammerhead ribozyme consists of two RNA strands with only 41 nucleotides in all. As with protein enzymes, the three-dimensional structure of ribozymes is impoant for function. Ribozymes are inactivated by heating above their melting temperature or by addition of denaturing agents or complementary oligonucleotides, which disrupt normal base-pairing patterns. Ribozymes can also be inactivated if essential nucleotides are changed. Example: Hammerhead ribozyme: These segments are called hammerhead ribozymes because their secondary structures are shaped like the head of a hammer. The hammerhead ribozyme is a metalloenzyme; Mg+2 ions are required for activity. The phosphodiester bond at the site of self-cleavage is indicated by an arrow In Tetrahymena, the pre-rRNA molecule contains an intron that is removed by self-splicing (in the presence of guanosine, GMP, GDP or GTP) without the need for involvement of any protein.

Na/K pump which enzyme is used -,ATPase,GTPase,Acetyl CoA,None of these,"Sodium-potassium pump is the most important pump for primary active transport Q in the body.
Na + -K + pump is an electrogenic pump Q that is responsible for maintaining the Na + and K + concentration difference across the cell membrane.
Na + - K + pump extrudes 3 Na + out from the cell and at the same time pump 2K + into the cell Q , i.e., Coupling ratio of Na + K + pump is 3 : 2 Q . Na + and K + transport by Na + - K + pump is primary active transport Q and both Na + and K + are transported against concentration gradient Q
(intracellular fluid has high concentration of K + and ECF has high concentration of Na - ).
Na + K + pump uses energy by hydrolysing ATP; this pump contains ATPase activity Q.

Na + - K + pump is a carrier protein which is a heterodimer 0 made up of two separate globular proteins: a larger one called α-subunit with a molecular weight of 100,000 and a smaller one called β-subunit, with a molecular weight of about 55,000. Both α- and β- subunits span across the membrane with intracellular and extracellular sites. 
Na + and K + transport occurs through a-subunits.

Intracellular portion of a-subunit has three Na + binding sites (three receptor sites for Na + ), an ATP binding site, a phosphorylating site and ATPase activity Q.
Extracellular portion Q has two K + binding sites (two receptor sites for K + ), and an ouabain binding site Q.
The β- subunit has three extracellular glycosylation sites Q, all of which appear to have attached carbohydrate residue.

The Na + - K + pump is an electrogenic pump Q since it produces a net movement of positive charge out of the cell.

Thus, besides maintaining the ionic composition of the intracellular fluid, the Na + - K + pump helps to maintain the electrochemical potential difference across the cell membrane.
However, Na + - K + pump contributes only 4 millivolts to the total resting membrane potential of 90 volts which is almost negligible Q.

Active transport of Na+ and K+ - is one of the major energy-using processes in the body.

On average, it accounts for about 24% of the energy utilized by cell and in neurons, it accounts for 70%. o Activity of Na+ - K+ pump is stimulated by the increased intracellular concentration of Na +,

Urea is formed from which substrate?,Arginine,Orginine,Citruline,Aspaate,"A. Steps of Urea Cycle: 1. Formation of Carbamoyl Phosphate: Condensation of ammonium ion with bicarbonate ion resulting in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by the help of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I present in the liver mitochondria. It requires Mg2+ and a dicarboxylic acid i.e. N-acetyl glutamate. This step requires 2 ATPs. 2. Synthesis of Citrulline: Carbamoyl phosphate formed in the first step combines with ornithine resulting in the synthesis of citrulline aided by the enzyme citrulline synthase or ornithine transcarbamoylase. Citrulline is easily permeable to the mitochondrial membrane and hence it diffuses into the cytosol. 3. Synthesis of Argininosuccinate: In the cytosol, citrulline combines with the amino acid aspaate forming argininosuccinate catalysed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. It requires ATP which is hydrolysed to AMP resulting in utilization of two high energy bonds. Mg2+ acts as cofactor. 4. Cleavage of Argininosuccinate: The enzyme argininosuccinase acts reversibly to cleave argininosuccinate into Arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters the TCA cycle (the linkage between TCA and urea cycle is known as Krebs bi-cycle). 5. Cleavage of Arginine: Arginine is lysed into ornithine and urea under the influence of the enzyme arginase. Hence arginine is known as semi-essential amino acid i.e. though it is synthesized in the body it is not available for protein synthesis. Ornithine is regenerated in this step and the urea cycle completes by the formation of urea. Ornithine and lysine are potent inhibitors of the enzyme arginase. Arginase is also present in testis, renal tubules, mammary gland and skin in minute quantities. The intermediate amino acids formed in the urea cycle i.e. ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate are known as non-protein amino acids. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p370",D

True about receptor potential is?,Due to difference in permability of receptors for different ions,Is propogated,Refractory period of 15-20 sec,Is a graded change,"ANSWER: (D) Is a graded changeREF: Textbook of Medical Physiology by Khurana page 1032-1033, Physiology - Prep Manual for Undergraduates, 4th Edition by Vijaya D Joshi page 562, Ganongs 22nd ed p. 123-125When a stimulus excites the receptor, it changes the potential across the membrane of the receptors. This change in the potential is called receptor or generator potential.The change in membrane potential in a receptor is caused by a change in permeability of membrane of the unmylelinated terminals to Na+. The resultant influx of Na+ causes development of generator or receptor potential. Since the receptor potential may generate the action potential it is also called as generator potential.The larger the receptor potential, the greater the frequency of action potential generated in the afferent neuron. A larger receptor potential can not bring about a larger action potential (because of all or none phenomenon), but it can induce more rapid firing of action potential.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECEPTOR POTENTIAL AND ACTION POTENTIAL:Receptor potentialAction potentialReceptor potential is a graded response i.e. amplitude of receptor potential increases with increase velocity of stimulus application and increase strength of stimulusAction potential obeys all or none law i.e. further increase in stimulus above threshold do not bring any change in amplitudeCan be added together if second stimulus arrives before the first stimulus is overCan not be added togetherHas no refractory periodHas a refractory period of 1 msMostly it is local and can not be propagatedIt can be propagated without loss in the amplitude along the nerve fibreDuration is greater (approximately 5-10 ms)Duration is small (approximately 1-2 ms)",D

"The most common portal of entry for C. tetani, the cause of tetanus, is the",Skin,Gastrointestinal tract,Respiratory tract,Genital tract,"Organisms may be transmitted in a number of ways, such as by air, food, hands, sexual contact, and infected needles. However, for each disease or disease category, there is usually a portal of entry not always unique to the organism. The respiratory tract is a common portal of entry to such airborne organisms as M. tuberculosis. This is why respiratory precautions must be taken when patients are harboring viable M. tuberculosis.The gastrointestinal tract is usually infected from ingestion of contaminated food or water (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter) or by an alteration of the normal microbial flora such as with C. difficile disease. The skin is a tough integument and intact, is resistant to most infectious organisms except those that may break down human skin. Breaches of the skin as by wounds, burns, and the like predispose patients to a variety of infections such as tetanus caused by wound contamination with spores of C. tetani, or direct infection by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Gram-negative rods (such as Serratia or Pseudomonas).The genital tract may become infected either by sexual contact or by alteration of the genital environment as often occurs with yeast infections.

In liver ammonia is formed from which amino acid?,Glycine,Glutamine,Isoleucine,Proline,"ANSWER: (B) GlutamineREF: Harper 29th Ed Page 521, 529, 530, Lehninger Biochemistry 4th ed page 523, 538,539Both Glutamine and Alanine (If provided in the options) should be the answer but since alanine is not in options Glutamine is the best possible answer. If Alanine is also provided in the options separately then also Glutamine is the best answer, since it is found in most tissue however glucose-alanine cycle/ cori cycle is for skeletal muscles only.Two mechanisms are available in humans for the transport of ammonia from the peripheral tissues to the liver for its ultimate conversion to urea.1. The first, found in most tissues, uses glutamine synthetase to combine ammonia with glutamate to form glutamine--a nontoxic transport form of ammonia. The glutamine is transported in the blood to the liver where it is cleaved by glutaminase to produce glutamate and free ammonia.2. The second transport mechanism, used primarily by muscle. involves transamination of pyruvate {the end product of aerobic glycolysis) to form alanine. Alanine is transported by the blood to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvate, again by transamination. In the liver, the pathway of gluconeogenesis can use the pyruvate to synthesize glucose, which can enter the blood and be used by muscle--a pathway called the glucose-alanine cycle or Cori cycle or Lactic acid cycleThe Glucose/ alanine cycle",B

Which is the Primary site of propagation of action potential in a cutaneous sensory nerve?,Axon hillock,Dendritic spine,Axoplasm,Axon terminal,"ANSWER: (A) Axon hillockREF: Guyton 12th Ed. Page 67, Ganong 24th Ed Pg 91GENERATION OF ACTION POTENTIAL IN POST SYNAPTIC REGION:The portion of the cell with the lowrest threshold for the production of a full-fledged action potential is the initial segment, the portion of the axon at and just beyond the axon hillock. This unmyelinated segment is depolarized or hyperpolarized electrotonically by the current sinks and sources under the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic knobs. It is the first part of the neuron to fire, and its discharge is propagated in two directions: down the axon and back into the somaThe nerve cell membrane is polarized at rest with positive charges lined up along the outside of the membrane and negative inside. During the action potential there is a reversal of the polarity for a brief period. A current sink is created which initiates depolarization and a local response and when a firing level Is reached the popagated response results.The spatial distribution of ion channels along the axon plays a key role in the initiation and regulation of the action potential. Voltage gated sodium channels are highly concentrated in the nodes of ranvier and the initial segment in the myelinated neurons. And most of the cutaneous nerve fibres are myelinated. Hence the site of propagation is the axon hillock.",A
"""Nerve terminals release chemicals"" release chemicals"" ? discovered by:",Dale,Withering,Domagk,Loewi,"D i.e. Loewi Otto Loewi discovered that nerve terminals or synapse release chemicals. In his most famous experiment, Loewi took fluid from one frog hea and applied it to another, slowing the second hea and showing that synaptic signaling used chemical messengers. Before Loewi's experiments, it was unclear whether signalling across the synapse was bioelectrical or chemical. Loewi's famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating heas: one with the vagus nerve which controls hea rate attached, the other hea on its own. Both heas were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first hea beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first hea and applied it to the second hea. The application of the liquid made the second hea also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the hea rate. He called the unknown chemical Vagusstoff. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to Acetylcholine",D
True about MELD diagnosis score -,Predicts moality in patients waiting liver transplant,Higher score - Less moality risk,Predicts moality risk for a 60 day period,It is a 4 to 6 scale,"MELD or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease is a chronic liver disease severity scoring system that uses a patient's laboratory values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR) to predict survival. In patients with chronic liver disease, an increasing MELD score is associated with increasing severity of hepatic dysfunction and three-month moality risk. Given its accuracy in predicting sho-term survival among patients with end-stage liver disease, MELD is used by the transplant community in the United States for prioritization of patients awaiting liver transplantation. It was originally developed as a tool to predict moality after transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic shunt (TIPS). The MELD model that is currently used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in prioritizing allocation of deceased donor organs for liver transplantation is calculated according to the following formula: MELD = 3.8 + 11.2 + 9.6 + 6.4 where Ln is the natural logarithm.

Numerous theories have been evoked to explain this phenomenon. The current theory is based on evidence that the brain can reorganize if sensory input is cut off. The ventral posterior thalamic nucleus is one example where this change can occur. In patients who have had their leg amputated, single neuron recordings show that the thalamic region that once received input from the leg and foot now respond to stimulation of the stump (thigh).(Reference: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 176)",D

Injury from a stab wound could result in loss of sensation from the dermatome supplied by this segment. A dermatome is an area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve; L4 dermatome supplies the medial aspect of the leg and foot. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex relates primarily to an S1 deficit. The Achilles tendon reflex is elicited by tapping the calcaneus tendon, which results in plantar flexion. The obturator internus and gluteus medius and minimus are responsible for abduction of the thigh and are innervated by nerves L4, L5, and S1 (with L5 usually dominant). Nerves L5, S1, and S2 are responsible for eversion of the foot (S1 dominant).",A

All are involved in fast axonal transpo. except,Kinesin,Dynein,Lysosomes,Neurofilaments,"Neurofilaments Intracellular transpo is the one of the most impoant function of the eukaryotic cell. Nothing can function without the constant shuttling of intracellular components from place to place. Intracellular transpo is orchestrated by a diverse constellation of molecular motor proteins that bind specific cargoes and convey them in a paicular direction along cytoskeletal polymer tracks. Cytoskeletal polymer tracks are made up of intracellular network of filamentous structures. Essentially all eukaryotic cells contain 3 types of filamentous structures: - actin filaments also k/a microfilaments - microtubules and - intermediate filaments. four classes of intennediate .filaments are found- Keratins, Vimentin- like proteins, Neurofilaments and Lamins. Axons are slender cylindrical processes and can extend for distances in excess of one meter in large animals, yet they are dependent on the cell body for the synthesis of many of their components. Materials destined for the axon are transpoed anterogradely, toward the axon tip, and materials destined to return are transpoed retrogradely, toward the cell body. This bidirectional transpo process, known as axonal transpo, is not fundamentally different from the pathways of macromolecular and membrane traffic that occur in all eukaryotic cells, but it is remarkable for its scale. Proteins and other molecules are transpoed along axons in association with distinct membranous and nonnzembranous cargo structures that move at different rates. Membranous organelles move most rapidly, in the fast components of axonal transpo, whereas cytoskeletal polymers and cytosolic protein complexes move more slowly, in the slow components. Membranous organelles like endocytic vesicles, lysosomes, golgi body derived vescicles are the principal cargoes of fast axonal transpo. The many proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides that move along the axon at fast rates do so by viue of their association with one or more subclasses of organelle or vesicle, either because they are sequestered within its lumen, embedded in its membrane, or bound to its surface. Membranous organelles move along both microtubule and microfilament tracks powered by molecular motor proteins (kinesins, dyneins, and myosins). Microtubules appear to be the principal tracks for long-range movements along the axis of the axon. Plus end-directed kinesin motors propel organelles along microtubules anterogradely, whereas dynein (and possibly also minus end-directed kinesin motors) propel organelles retrogradely. Non membranous cargoes like cytoskeletal polymers (microfilaments, microtubules and neurofilaments) and cytosolic protein complexes move more slowly, in the slow components. It was earlier believed that the fast and slow axonal transpo are due to fundamentally distinct mechanisms of transpo. But recent discoveries have shown that the underlying mechanism for both fast and slow transpo is.the same. They move at different rates due to difference in their duty ratio. The duty ratio is the propoion of time that a cargo structure spends actually moving. Thus the slow overall rate of movement of cytoskeletal filaments suggests that these structures move with a low duty ratio, spending most of their time not moving.

U.S. varies with region In developed countires (Noh America and Europe) - Verocytogenic E coli or Shiga like toxin producing Eschererichia coli is the most common cause (80% of all the cases). In Asia (India) - Shigella dysenteriae is the chief pathogen. The anemia associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome is coomb's negative hemolytic anemia. Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia occurs when the anemia is caused due to autoantibodies produced in the body. In H.U.S. the hemolytic anemia is caused by mechanical damage to R.B.C. when they pass through nucrothrombi (which are formed in capillaries due to platelet aggregation). The red cells while passing through these capillaries get attached to the thrombus and gets fragmented causing hemolysis, Autoantibodies have nothing to do with hemolytic uremic syndrome. So the anemia will not be coomb's positive. Thrombocytopenia in H.U.S. A low platelet count can usually but not always be detected early in the illness, but it may then become normal or even high.

Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe fonn of the disease.

All of the following statements are true regarding polio-virus except:,It is transmitted by feco-oral route,Asymptomatic infections are common in children,There is a single serotype causing infection,Live attenuated vaccine produces herd immunity,"Ans. (c) There is a single serotype causing infection Impoant features of Polio virus Poliovirus, causative agent of polio, is SS positive sense RNA virus having 1, 2 and 3 serotypes. MC serotype - Type 1 MC cause of epidemic - Type 1 (epidemics are also caused by Type 3 while endemics are by Type 2) MC type associated with paralysis - Type 1 Most difficult to eradicate Type -1 Most antigenic - Type 2 MC cause of vaccine induced paralysis - mutated Type - 3 Modes of transmission Main route: Feco-oral route directly or indirectly. Droplet infection: May occur in acute phase of disease. Clinical Spectrum Most vulnerable age is between 6 months and 3 years. M.0 clinical presentation - Inapparent / subclinical infection. Most rare clinical presentation - Paralytic polio. Usual cause of death - respiratory insufficiency. Progressive paralysis, coma or convulsions usually indicate cause other than polio. Prevention Two types of vaccine: Inactivated (salk) injectable polio vaccine. Oral (sabin) live attenuated vaccine: It provides both local immunity (by producing intestinal IgA) and systemic immunity. Vaccine progeny is excreted in feces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts so non immunized persons are immunized by replacing wild strain by vaccine strain. It results in herd immunity even if only about 66% of community is immunized.

A 30-year-old hospitalized patient with an intravenous (IV) catheter developed fever and systemic infection. The source of the infection was bacteria that contaminated the catheter during its insertion. The IV catheter had to be removed because the bacteria grew within the catheter forming a biofilm. Biofilm development depends on the ability of the bacteria to produce which of the following?,Endotoxin,Periplasm,Polysaccharides,Porins,"Pathogenic bacteria such as the gram-negative bacillus Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the gram-positive coccus Staphylococcus aureus colonize the surface of certain surgical appliances such as artificial heart valves and catheters. Multiple layers of the colonizing bacteria surround themselves with a polysaccharide (c) matrix, which protects them from the effect of antibiotics and host immune defenses. The remaining choices do not contribute to biofilm development. Porins (d), proteins that are located within the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, facilitate the transfer of hydrophilic molecules through the membrane. Teichoic acids (e) found within the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria are anionic polymers of polyglycan that provide rigidity to the cell wall. In gram-negative bacteria, the periplasmic space occupies the area between the external surface of the cytoplasmic membrane and the internal surface of the outer membrane. The periplasm (b) contains hydrolytic enzymes, virulence proteins, and components of the sugar transport systems. Endotoxin (LPS), a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is recognized by the host defenses and stimulates macrophages to produce cytokines.",C
Which of the following is a procoagulation protein,Thrombomodulin,Protein C,Protein S,Thrombin,"ref Robbins 7/e p127 , Harrison 17/e p346,9/e p120-121. Prothrombin time (PT) screens for the activity of the pro- teins in the extrinsic pathway (factors VII, X, II, V, and fibrinogen). The PT is performed by adding phospholip- ids and tissue factor to a patient's citrated plasma (sodium citrate chelates calcium and prevents spontane- ous clotting), followed by calcium, and the time to fibrin clot formation (usually 11 to 13 seconds) is recorded. Because factor VII is the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor with the shoest half-life (roughly 7 hours), the PT is used to guide treatment of patients with vitamin K antagonists (e.g., coumadin). * Paial thromboplastin time (PTT) screens for the activity of the proteins in the intrinsic pathway (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen). The PTT is performed by adding a negatively charged activator of factor XII (e.g., ground glass) and phospholipids to a patient's citrated plasma, followed by calcium, and recording the time required for clot formation (usually 28 to 35 seconds). The PTT is sensitive to the anticoagulant effects of heparin and is therefore used to monitor its efficacy. Once thrombin is formed, it not only catalyzes the final steps in the coagulation cascade, but also exes a wide variety of effects on the local vasculature and inflammatory milieu; it even actively paicipates in limiting the extent of the hemostatic process",D

Consequently, the brain decreases its use of glucose, although glucose is still a major fuel for the brain.Ketone bodies are used by the brain after 3 to 5 days of fasting. This is done to spare protein degradation to provide carbons for gluconeogenesis. Approximately 60% of the brain's energy needs will still be dependent on glucose, but the other 40% can be realized from ketone body oxidation. The brain will not oxidize fatty acids because they have trouble crossing the blood-brain barrier, and the brain has very low levels of glycogen.",A

Peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated maximally by,Acidosis,Hypercapnia,Carbondioxide,Cyanide,"Cyanide causes histotoxic hypoxia, and thus, by preventinng the O2 utilization at the tissue level; it acts as the powerful stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors. Even though pO2 levels of blood is normal in case of cyanide poisoning the sensors in carotid and aoic bodies are not able to sense oxygen in blood because of blockade of cellular respiration and hence, they go in for hypoxic state and gets stimulated. Option A: Acidosis (Increased H+ ions) stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors. Option B: Increased pCO2 mainly stimulates central chemoreceptors. Option C: The peripheral chemoreceptors have an enormous bloodflow per unit tissue (2000mL/100g of tissue/min) because of which the O2 needs of the cells can be met by dissolved O2. Therefore, Carbonmonoxide poisoning doesnot stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors because the amount of dissolved O2 is generally normal, even though the combined O2 in the blood is markedly decreased.

Frameshift mutation doesn&;t occur in multiples of,2,3,4,5,"A frameshift mutation is a genetic mutation caused by a deletion or inseion in a DNA sequence that shifts the way the sequence is read. A DNA sequence is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides. DNA (or RNA) nucleotide sequences are read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons, and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stops signal. During translation, the sequence of codons is read in order from the nucleotide sequence to synthesize a chain of amino acids and form a protein. Frameshift mutations arise when the normal sequence of codons is disrupted by the inseion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, provided that the number of nucleotides added or removed is not a multiple of three. For instance, if just one nucleotide is deleted from the sequence, then all of the codons including and after the mutation will have a disrupted reading frame. This can result in the incorporation of many incorrect amino acids into the protein. In contrast, if three nucleotides are inseed or deleted, there will be no shift in the codon reading frame; however, there will be either one extra or one missing amino acid in the final protein. Therefore, frameshift mutations result in abnormal protein products with an incorrect amino acid sequence that can be either longer or shoer than the normal protein. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p384",B

Metachromatic granules are seen in ?,Gardenella vaginali,Corynebacteria,Argobacterim,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above Polvpmetahosphate / volutin granules Some bacteria contain granules composed of polymetaphosphate. They were first described in spirillum volutans, so they were called as Volutin granules. These granules are also known as Babes Ernst granules or polar bodies or metachromatic granules. These granules stain reddish violet with methylene blue or toluidine blue. These granules are strongly basophilic. In the granules, there is stored phosphate in the form of linear chains of inorganic phosphate. These granules represent intracellular phosphate reserve when nucleic acid syntheis does not occur. The phosphate is incorporated into nucleic acid during the synthesis of the latter. When nucleic acid synthesis is prevented by starvation , the granules accumulate in the cytoplasm. So, volutin metachromatic granules are most frequent in cells grown under conditions of nutritional deficiency (starvation) and tend to disappear when the deficient nutrients are supplied.

What is the best characterizes of the sinusoids,Have smaller diameter than lymph capillaries,Are not found in skeletal muscle,Have a continuous endothelial lining,Have a continuous basement membrane,"sinusoids - In some tissues the 'exchange' network is made up of vessels that are somewhat different from capillaries, and are called sinusoids. Sinusoids are found typically in organs that are made up of cords or plates of cells. These include the liver, the adrenal coex, the hypophysis cerebri, and the parathyroid glands. Sinusoids are also present in the spleen, in the bone marrow, and in the carotid body. The wall of a sinusoid consists only of endothelium suppoed by a thin layer of connective tissue. The wall may be incomplete at places, so that blood may come into direct contact with tissue cells. Deficiency in the wall may be in the form of fenestrations (fenestrated sinusoids) or in the form of long slits (discontinuous sinusoids, as in the spleen). At some places the wall of the sinusoid consists of phagocytic cells instead of endothelial cells. Sinusoids have a broader lumen (about 20 um) than capillaries. The lumen may be irregular, Because of this fact blood flow through them is relatively sluggish. REF: Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, seventh edition, pg.no.,218.",B

All drugs prepared from this digitalis leaf are members of the same group and principles of administration are the same, although they vary according to speed of action and potency. Digitalis in its many forms is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States. It can be very effective in treatment of cardiac conditions, but its therapeutic range is narrow; a therapeutic dose is only about one third less than the dose that will induce toxicity. Moreover, physiologic changes due to age, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, metabolic disorders, and ceain hea conditions can predispose a patient to digitalis toxicity. Other drugs can also alter the effects of digitalis and lead to toxicity. Signs of Toxicity. Traditionally, nurses have been taught to count the patient&;s pulse or monitor the apical heabeat for rate and rhythm before administering a digitalis preparation. A decreased pulse rate of 60 per minute or less is an indication that the drug should be temporarily discontinued. While this is the most typical sign of digitalis intoxication, there frequently are earlier symptoms that deserve attention. Some of the more common complaints expressed by patients who are in the early stages of toxicity are nausea, blurred vision, mental depression, disorientation, and malaise.

"Semen analysis of a young man who presented with primary infeility revealed low volume, fructose negative ejaculate with azoospermia. Which of the following is the most useful imaging modality to evaluate the cause of his infeility?",Colour duplex ultrasonography of the scrotum,Transrectal ultrasonography,Retrograde urethrography,Spermatic venography,"Sperms are produced in testes and then stored and mature within the epididymis. Vas deferens carries the sperms from epididymis to the urethra where they open by separate openings into the prostatic urethra. Just before opening each vas deferens is joined by ducts of seminal vesicles. Vas deferens and seminal vesicle ducts join to form the ejaculatory duct. The secretions of seminal vesicles form a large pa of seminal fluid and contain fructose and a coagulating enzyme called the vesiculase. Now coming to the question. Semen analysis forms an impoant pa of infeility assessment. Low ejaculatory volume is caused by retrograde ejaculation into the bladder or obstruction of the vas deferens or the ejaculatory duct Azoospermia may be seen in testicular failure or obstruction of vas deferens Absence of fructose suggests seminal vesicles agenesis or obstruction. A semen that is low in volume with azoospermia and absence of fructose suggests - either obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts or congenital absence of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. The anatomy of the vas deferens & seminal vesicles can be investigated by vasography (where contrast medium is injected into the vas deferens) or TRUS (Trans rectal ultrasonography), however TRUS is superior to vasography and is the investigation of choice. Also know Semen specimen should be obtained following at least 3 days of abstinence and examined within 1 to 2 hrs. At least 2 specimens are examined several weeks apa.

Which passive movement causes pain in deep posterior compament syndrome?,Foot abduction,Dorsiflexion of foot,Plantar flexion of foot,Foot adduction,"Dorsiflexion of foot Compament syndrome (CS) occurs whenever increased tissue pressure in a myofascial compament compromises blood flow to the muscles and nerves within that compament, resulting in tissue and nerve damage. The compaments of the lower leg and the volar forearm are paicularly prone to developing elevated compament pressures.Two types of CS have been identified, acute and chronic.Acute CS typically occurs subsequent to a traumatic event, most commonly fractures. Symptoms worsen acutely, and irreversible nerve injury and muscle necrosis occur within hours.Chronic CS (also known as chronic exeional CS, exeional CS, recurrent CS, or subacute CS) is a recurrent syndrome that occurs with exercise or work.Relevant Anatomy There are 4 osteofascial compaments of leg enclosed by the unyielding deep fascia and separated from each other by the bones of die leg and interosseeous membrane and by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa. Each ofthe compaments is ""sealed"" spaces containing muscles, aeries, and nerves.Anterior or extensor compamento Dorsiflexor muscles of the ankle and footTibialis anterior- Extensor digitorum longus- Extensor hallucis longus- Peroneus teiuso Anterior tibial aery - Commonly injured in lateral tibial plateau fractureso Deep peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the first dorsal web spaceLateral compamento Peroneus (fibularis) brevis and peroneus (fibularis) longus - Plantar flexor and eveor muscles of the foot o Superficial peroneal nerve - Provides sensation to the dorsum of the footDeep posterior compamento Plantar flexor and phalangeal flexor muscles- Tibialis posterior- Flexor digitorum longus (FDL)- Flexor hallucis longus(and Popliteus, which acts on the,knee joint)o Posterior tibial and peroneal aerieso Posterior tibial nerve - Provides sensation to the sole of the footSuperficial posterior compamento Plantar flexor muscles of the foot- Gastrocnemius- Plantaris- Soleuso Sural nerveAcute compament syndromes are medical emergencies that may require immediate surgical treatment. Acute compament syndromes are usually the result of a traumatic incident. The swelling from the contusion causes the increased pressure in the compament. These injuries are most often seen in the emergency room and are not athletic injuries.Chronic CS is seen more often in the athletic community. Diagnosing this injury is one of exclusion. A complete examination should rule out medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fractures, and Achilles tendon injuries.The athlete presents with pain that is present during weight bearing training. Activities such as running, stair climbing, and jumping are the most common offenders.There will be pain on passive stretch of the muscles of the compament.So in the: Deep posterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot and on toeextension (since muscles in the deep post compament are plantar flexors and phalangeal flexors )Anterior compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive plantar flexion of the foot and toe flexion.Lateral compament syndrome- there will be pain on passive foot inversion.Superficial posterior compament syndrome- pain is on passive dorsiflexion of foot.Definitive diagnosis of a chronic CS can be made with an intracompamental pressure test. A catheter is inseed into the offending compament to measure its pressure.Once the diagnosis is confirmed with a positive compament measurement, a treatment course is to be chosen. Conservative treatment is the first option. Rehabilitation should include: low impact cross training, flexibility training, appropriate strength training for weakened muscles, and/or the use of ohotics to correct biomechanical abnormalities.If conservative treatment fails, surgical intervention in the next step.

Focal lesions are present on a computed tomography scan of his brain. No mucocutaneous lesions are found. He has been living under a bridge for the past 2 years. His level of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the infectious agent is high. What is the most likely explanation for how this current infection staed?",Earlier exposure to pigeons,Earlier exposure to dese sand,Reactivation of bradyzoites in cysts from an earlier infection,Recent exposure to cat feces,"Reactivation of toxoplasmosis is most likely the answer, which is due to reactivation of bradyzoites in cysts from an earlier infection. In this case, encephalitis with focal lesions are present. High levels of IgG indicates chronic infection, the current infection is likely a reactivation of an earlier infection; therefore, recent exposures can be eliminated. So, Option 4 is ruled out. Exposure to pigeons suggests Cryptococcosis, which is often a reactivation infection. However, in cryptococcosis antibody levels are rarely monitored, and there is no mention of India ink stain or capsular polysaccharide in the cerebrospinal fluid, which are the major diagnostic methods. So, Option 1 is ruled out. In addition, based on the patient's symptoms, the infection is more likely to be encephalitis rather than meningitis or meningoencephalitis; also, retinochoroiditis is usually not present in cryptococcosis. The retinochoroiditis and lack of mucocutaneous lesions makes infection with Coccidioides less likely. Dese rheumatism (Coccidioides)is the disease caused by exposure to dese sand.

True about nucleosome:,Use only one type of histone protein,Each complex is separated from each other by non histone proteins,Regular repeating structure of DNA & histone proteins,Reflect small nucleus,"C i.e. Regular repeating structure of DNA & histone proteins- Histones are small basic proteins rich in basic aminoacid arginine & histidine with alkaline isoelectric pH. It is a simple proteinQ ie its complete hydrolysis only yields amino acids. They are soluble in water, salt solution & diluteacids but not in ammonia and do not easily coagulate on heating. Histones are synthesized in cytoplasm and migrate to nucleus to form conjugated nucleoprotein (chromatin) with nucleic acid (DNA)Q. Histones act as repressor of template activity of DNA in RNA synthesis. Histones also conjugate with porphyrins. Globin, the protein pa of hemoglobin is an atypical histone and it has predominance of histidine & lysine instead of arginine.- Nucleosome, the fundamental organizational units of chromatin (chromosome), consists of regular repeating ""beads on a string"" arrangement in which histone octamer i.e. (H3 -H4)2 - (H2A - H2B)2 forms the core (bead) around which 146 base pair double stranded DNA is wrapped and 30 bp/54 bp linker DNA and H1 histone protein forms string.- Histone acetylation (by histone acetyl transferase = HAT) causes increased (trancriptionally active) relatively uncondensed euchromatin formation(2. Acetylation or phosphorylation of lysine residue at aminoterminal decreases positive (+) charge of basic histone protein, there by decreasing their association with negatively charged DNA, thus releasing nucleosomes and allowing access to DNA. Histone deacetylation (by histone deacetylase = HDAC) removes acetyl group, restores positive charge and causes increased formation of transcriptionally inactive hetero chromatin (relatively condensed).- Histone is post translationally modified by ribosylation, ubiquitin binding, phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation (RUPAM).",C

Physician warns the patient against the coronary heart disease chances. The physician is evaluating the risk factors which maybe all except:,High blood pressure,Gender,Obesity,Hard water drinking,"Additional factors considered to play a part in coronary heart disease include high blood pressure, smoking, male gender, obesity (particularly abdominal obesity), lack of exercise, and drinking soft as opposed to hard water. Factors associated with elevation of plasma FFA followed by increased output of triacylglycerol and cholesterol into the circulation in VLDL include emotional  stress  and coffee drinking. Premenopausal women appear to be protected against many of these deleterious factors, and this is thought to be related to the beneficial effects of estrogen. There is an association between moderate alcohol consumption and a lower incidence of coronary heart disease. This may be due to elevation of HDL concentrations resulting from increased synthesis of apo A-I and changes in activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein. It has been claimed that red wine is particularly beneficial, perhaps because of its content of antioxidants. Regular exercise lowers plasma LDL but raises HDL. Triacylglycerol concentrations are also reduced, due most likely to increased insulin sensitivity, which enhances the expression of lipoprotein lipase.

IL1 and TNF alpha are endogenous pyrogens that are capable of stimulating fever, promoting local inflammatory reactions and synthesis of acute phase proteins. TNF alpha is the ultimate mediator of inflammation and the systemic effects of infection. It stimulates endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules and chemokines to attract leukocytes to the site of infection, activates neutrophils and macrophages, and promotes apoptosis of ceain cell types. Systemically, TNF alpha acts on the hypothalamus to induce fever, can cause systemic metabolic changes, weight loss and loss of appetite, and enhance production of IL1, IL6, and chemokines and it promotes acute phase protein synthesis by the liver. At high concentrations, it elicits all of the functions leading to a septic shock. Ref: Medical Microbiology,with STUDENT CONSULT Online Access,7: Medical Microbiology By Patrick R.

Lithogenic bile has the following propeies -,| Bile and cholesterol ratio,|Bile and cholesterol ratio,Equal bile and cholesterol ratio,|Cholesterol only,"Bile salts and phospholipids in bile keep cholesterol in solution by the formation of micelles. An excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids allows cholesterol to form crystals and such pile is called Lithogenic or super-saturated bile. Pathogenesis of Cholesterol gallstones There are three elements necessary for the formation of cholesterol gallstones Lithogenic bile Nucleation and Stasis or gallbladder hypomotility all three are necessary for cholesterol stone formation. A) Lithogenic (stone-forming) bile Cholesterol is insoluble in water (water is major constituent of bile, 85-95%). It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterol So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i.e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones. Factors which increase biliary cholesterol obesity high calorie and cholesterol rich diet clofibrate therapy Factors which decrease bile acids primary biliary cirrhosis oral contraceptive pills genetic factors a mutation in CYP7A1 gene which results in deficiency of enzyme cholesterol 7 a-hydroxylase. It results in impaired hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, thus it increases the cholesterol/bile acid ratio. decreased/impaired enterohepatic circulation of bile acids: ileal disease ileal resection cholestyramine, colestipol (bile acid sequestrants) therapy.deoxycholate Factors which decrease biliary lecithin a mutation in MDR3 gene leads to defective phospholipid (lecithin) secretion into bile. B) Nucleation Nucleation refers to the process by which cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals. Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors. Mucin and ceain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins Al and All and ceain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor. C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotility Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely.

Carbamoyl phosphate synthase I is used in -,Purine synthesis,Pyrimidine synthesis,Urea cycle,Uronic acid pathway,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Urea cycle o Carbamyl phosphate synthase I - Urea cycleo Carbamyl phosphate synthase II - Pyrimidine synthesisUrea cvcleo Ammonia is ultimately disposed of by formation of urea by ""Kreb's Henseleit urea cycle"" in the liverr. Urea cycle takes place both in mitochondria and cytosol. First two reactions of urea cycle occur in the mitochondria, and remaining reactions occurs in cytosolr.o Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps.Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphater by condensation of CO2 and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle0. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamater.Ornithine transcarbamoylaser catalyzes the formation of citruliine from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithiner.Arginosuccinate synthase6 catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citruliine and aspartate. This reaction requires 1ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urear (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4 r).Arginosuccinate lyase (arginosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle.Arginaser catalyses the formation of urea from argininer by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine. Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle.o The source of two nitrogen atoms of urea one from ammoniar and one from amino group of aspartate6. Source of carbon is CO2r. Thus out of all amino acids in%rolved in urea cycle aspartate is consumed, while there is no net loss or gain of ornithine, citruliine, arginosuccinate or arginine. There is production of fumarate as by productr.o 3 molecules of ATP are consumed (2 in first reaction and 1 in third reaction).

To differentiate between stress incontinence and detrusor instability investigation done is -,MCU,Retrograde urethroscopy,Cystourethroscopy,Urodynamic study,Genuine stress incontinence is defined as urinary leakage occurring during increased bladder pressure when this is solely due to increased abdominal pressure and not due to increased true detrusor pressure. It is caused by sphincter weakness. Detrusor instability this is phasic increase in detrusor pressure (due to phasic contraction of detrusor muscle) giving rise to sensation of urgency of micturition and urge incontinence. It is found in pts with several types of neurogenic bladder dysfunction such as multiple sclerosis (MS) Parkinson disease or following a stroke or ceain types of spinal injury when it is known as detrusor hyperreflexia.

An increase in which of the following best explains the mechanism by which the cardiac output increases in severe anemia?,Aeriolar diameter,Blood viscosity,Peripheral vascular resistance,Splanchnic blood flow,"In severe anemia, diminished transpo of oxygen in the blood leads to hypoxia in the tissues. The hypoxia causes small aeries and aerioles to dilate, which allows greater-than-normal amounts of blood to return to the hea. In severe anemia, the viscosity of blood may decrease by 50% or more because blood viscosity depends largely on the concentration of red blood cells. This decrease in viscosity lowers the resistance to blood flow in the peripheral tissues (decreases peripheral vascular resistance) allowing even greater amounts of blood to return to the hea. Blood is often shunted away from the splanchnic vascular bed in anemia, which can cause gastrointestinal problems. Ref: Mohrman D.E., Heller L.J. (2010). Answers to Study Questions. In D.E.

Thus in a aa aa-helix intrachain hydrogen bonding is present. The a aa aa-helices can be either right handed or left handed. Left-handed a-helix is less stable than right-handed a helix because of the steric interference between the C = O and the side chains. Only the right-handed a-helix has been found in protein structure. Each amino acid residue advances by 0.15 nm along the helix, and 3.6 amino acid residues are present in one complete turn. The distance between two equivalent points on turn is 0.54 nm and is called a pitch. Small or uncharged amino acid residues such as alanine, leucine, and phenylalanine are often found in a-helix.

Midgut volvulus results in the twisting of the intestines and ultimately obstruction of the small and/or large intestines. Gastroschisis results from an incomplete closure of the lateral folds during the fourth week of development from a defect in the medial plane of the abdominal wall. This results in an epigastric hernia, with viscera that protrude into the amniotic cavity and are covered by amniotic fluid. Failure of recanalization of the ileum is seen with 50% of obstructive lesions of the intestine. This obstruction is caused by stenosis or atresia of the intestines. A remnant of the omphaloenteric duct generally presents as an ileal (Meckel) diverticulum in the proximal portion of the omphaloenteric duct. It normally arises as a fingerlike pouch about 3 to 6 cm long from the antimesenteric border of the ileum and 40 to 50 cm from the ileocecal junction. Nonrotation of the midgut results in the lower portion of the loop returning to the abdomen first, the small intestine sitting on the right side of the abdomen, and the large intestine lying entirely on the left. Most cases are asymptomatic; however, obstruction of the superior mesenteric artery can cause infarction and gangrene of the part of the intestine it supplies.",A

The opponent-process theory states that the cone photoreceptors are linked together to form three opposing color pairs: blue/yellow, red/green, and black/white. The Young-Helmholtz theory postulates that the retina contains three types of cones, each with a different photopigment maximally sensitive to one of the primary colors (red, blue, and green). The sensation of any given color is determined by the relative frequency of impulses from each type of cone. Parvocellular ganglion cells receive color-specific signals from the three types of cones and relay them to the brain the optic nerve. Ref: Waxman S.G. (2010). Chapter 15. The Visual System. In S.G.

Membrane Igs, but not secreted Igs, have an additional tail made of hydrophobic amino acids at the C-terminal end of the Fc region that helps to anchor the Ig molecule in the plasma membrane. Completed Ig molecules are either released from the ER membrane (secretory Ig) or remain embedded in the membrane (membrane Ig) before being transpoed in vacuoles (or vesicles), which bud off the Golgi, to the plasma membrane. Secretory Ig are transferred by simple physical entrapment within the secretory vacuoles, wheras membrane Ig are transferred attached to the membrane. Fusion of the secretory vacuoles with the plasma membrane results in the membrane Ig being inseed in the plasma membrane while the soluble content of the vesicles are disgorged to the exterior of the cell.""- Manual of biological markers of disease By W.

These are referred to as endonucleases.# There exist classes of endonucleases that recognize specific sequences in DNA; the majority of these are the restriction endonucleases, which have in recent years become important tools in molecular genetics and medical sciences.# Some nucleases are capable of hydrolyzing a nucleotide only when it is present at a terminal of a molecule; these are referred to as exonucleases.- Exonucleases act in one direction (3-5 or 5-3) only. In bacteria, a 3-5 exonuclease is an integral part of the DNA replication machinery and there serves to edit--or proofread--the most recently added deoxynucleotide for base- pairing errors.Educational points:# Restriction enzymes cut DNA of any source into short pieces in a sequence-specific manner--in contrast to most other enzymatic, chemical, or physical methods, which break DNA randomly.# Restriction enzymes & DNA ligase are also used to prepare chimeric DNA molecules.",B

The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?,12,24,15,30,"Ans. is 'b' > b' i.e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofNo of ATPsNo of ATPsPathwayStepEnzymeSource ATP formationgained perglucose(new calculation)As per oldcalculationGlycolysis1Hexokinase MinusMinus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase MinusMinus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5 x 2 = 53 x 2 = 6Do61,3-BPGkinase ATPSubstrate level1 x 2 -- 21 x 2 = 2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Pyruvate to?PyruvateNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5x2= 32 x 2= 4Do8Malate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2= 7 10 minus 2= 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 5 * 6Generation in citric acid cycle 20 * 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 32 * 38",B

CO2 diffuses more easily through the respiratory membrane than 02 because it is:,Less dense,More soluble in plasma,Less molecular weight,Less PCO2 in the alveoli,"More soluble in plasma Diffusion of gases through the tissues or respiratory membrane depends on the solubility of the gas in lipids; but since all the gases of respiratory impoance are all highly soluble in lipids the diffusion through the tissues would depend on diffusion of gases in tissue water. The diffusion of gases through fluid depends on multiple factors (1. the solubility of the gas in the fluid, 2. the cross-sectional area of the fluid, 3. the distance through which the gas must diffuse, 4.the molecular weight of the gas, and 5. the temperature of the fluid.] of which the two which are characterstics of the gas itself are - Solubility in fluid & - Molecular weight.

True about ascending limb of loop of Henle ?,Recieves hypeonic saline,Maximum absorption of fluid,Respond to ADH,None of these,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Recieves hypeonic saline Fluid leaving the descending limb of loop of Henle and entering the ascending limb of loop of Henle is very hypeonic. Renal reabsorption and secretion The Glomerular filtrate enters the renal tubules and flows through the successive pas of the tubule (i.e. the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule and finally collecting ducts) before it is excreted as urine. Along its course, the tubular cells may selectively secrete some substances from the blood into the tubular lumen (tubular secretion), or may selectively remove some substances (tubular reabsorption) from the tubular filtrate, or may do both. When the Glomerular filtrate is initially formed, its osmolarity is about the same as that of plasma i.e. 300mOsm/L. Its osmolalilty changes depending on the absorption of water and solutes in the segment. Proximal convoluted tubule The PCT reabsorbs- sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, phosphate, potassium, glucose and amino acids. The PCT secretes- H+, organic acids and bases (such as bile salts, oxalate, urate and catecholamines) The PCT is highly permeable to water. In PCT solutes and water are reabsorbed in equal propoions, thus little change in the osmolarity occurs i.e. the tubular fluid in the PCT is isotonic to the plasma. Loop of Henle: Descending limb The thin descending segment is highly permeable to water and moderately permeable to most solutes, including urea and sodium. No active reabsorption or secretion takes place. The water is reabsorbed as the tubular fluid passes down the descending limb and the filtrate becomes concentrated, in equilibrium with the surrounding interstitial fluid of the renal medulla, which is very hypeonic. Thus fluid leaving Descending limb of loop of Henle is very hypeonic. Loop of Henle: Ascending limb The thick ascending limb reabsorbs - sodium, chloride, and potassium, calcium, bicarbonate, and magnesium. o This segment also secretes- hydrogen ions into the tubular lumen. The thin segment of the ascending limb has a much lower reabsorptive capacity than the thick segment, and the thin descending limb does not reabsorb significant amounts of any of these solutes. The ascending limb, including both the thin and the thick poions, is completely impermeable to water, even in the presence ofADH. Since other solutes are being reabsorbed, the tubular fluid becomes hypotonic. Thus the fluid leaving the ascending limb of loop is hypotonic, with an osmolarity of only about one third the osmolarity of plasma i.e. 100 mOsm/L. Early distal tubule Early distal tubule has propeies similar to those of the thick ascending limb of the loop, that is, it avidly reabsorbs most of the ions, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, but is viually impermeable to water so there is fuher dilution of the tubular fluid. The late distal tubules and coical collecting tubules The late distal tubules and coical collecting tubules are composed of two distinct cell types, the principal cells and the intercalated cells. The principal cells reabsorb sodium from the lumen and secrete potassium ions into the lumen. The intercalated cells reabsorb potassium and bicarbonate ions from the lumen and secrete hydrogenions into the lumen. The reabsorption of water from this tubular segment is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone. Medullary Collecting Duct The medullary collecting ducts actively reabsorb sodium and secrete hydrogen ions and are permeable to urea, which is reabsorbed in these tubular segments. The reabsorption of water in medullary collecting ducts is controlled by the concentration of antidiuretic hormone. In late distal tubule, coical collecting tubules and medullary collection tubules the tubular fluid osmolarity depends on the presence or absence ofADH. In presence of high levels of ADH these tubules are highly permeable to water and significant amounts of water are reabsorbed and the tubular fluid becomes hypeonic, up to 1200 mOsm/L (equal to osmolarity of the surrounding medullary interstitium). In the absence of ADH, these segments are almost impermeable to water; therefore osmolarity decreases even fuher because of continued active reabsorption of ions from these segments-tubular fluid thus becomes hypotonic with osmolarity as low as 50mOsm/L.",A

Merkels cells of Epidermis are derived from,Neural tube,Notochord,Neural crest,Neural pore,"(C) Neural crest # MERKEL CELLS, which are believed to be derived from the neural crest, contain many large (50-100 nm) dense-cored vesicles, presumably containing transmitters, which are concentrated near the junction with the axon. F.S. Merkel referred to these cells as Tastzellen or ""touch cells"" Merkel cells are found in the skin and some parts of the mucosa (stratum germinativum) of all vertebrates. In mammalian skin, they are clear cells found in the stratum basale (at the bottom of sweat duct ridges) of the epidermis approximately 10 pm in diameter. They also occur in epidermal invaginations of the plantar foot surface called rete ridges. Most often, they are associated with sensory nerve endings, when they are known as Merkel nerve endings (Merkel cell-neurite complex). They are associated with slowly adapting (SA1) somatosensory nerve fibers. They are associated with the sense of light touch discrimination of shapes and textures. They can turn malignant and form the skin tumor known as Merkel cell carcinoma.DERIVATIVES OF NEURAL CRESTDerivative of neural crestDeveloping partsNeurons1.

Aromatic enzyme complex is involved in the biosynthesis of,Cholesterol,Adrenal homones,Vitamins D3,Estradiol/estrogens,"Ovarian Hormones They are C18 estrogens, C19 androgens, and C21 progesterone. These are produced by the ovarian follicles. The follicular thecal cells produce C19 androgens. These are conveed to C18 estrogens by granulosa cells, by aromatization of ring A and loss of C19 methyl group. Estradiol is the most impoant estrogen. It is conveed to estrone by liver. It is fuher hydroxylated to estriol, which is inactive. Estradiol is bound to plasma SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin). Estradiol(E2) is the predominant sex hormone present in females; however, it is present in males, at lower levels, as well. Estradiol has not only a critical impact on reproductive and sexual functioning but also affects other organs including the bones. Estradiol enters cells freely and interacts with a cytoplasmic target cell receptor. After the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand, estradiol can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription, which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estradiol binds well to both estrogen receptors, ER-alpha, and ER-beta. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) preferentially act on one of these receptors.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 536-537",D

They are small molecules that are generally less than 1000 kDa. While haptens react with antibodies, they are not immunogenic because they do not activate T cells and cannot bind the MHC. Haptens are significant in disease; penicillin is a hapten and can cause severe life-threatening allergic reaction by destruction of erythrocytes. Catechols in the oils of poison ivy plants are haptens and cause a significant skin inflammatory response.

True about TSS -,Most commonly due to TSST-1,Mensturation is a risk factor,Anti- staph antibodies are contraindicated,all,". Ans. is 'a' i.e. Most commoly due to TSST-1 . Toxic shock syndrome is most commonly caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin type-I (TSST-I), which is a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus. . Option 'b' is tricky one . First read following statement. ""Toxic shock syndrome (T-S.S.) was first recognized as a disease in children in 1978, but disease gained national attention in early 1980 following outbreaks in the USA in menstruating women using highly absorbent vaginal tampons withdrawl of tampon from the market resulted in a rapid decline in the incidence of this disease"". . Do not misinterpret this statement - mensturation as such is not a risk factor, rather mensturating women which use vaginal tampons were at risk and vaginal tampons were responsible for TSS in mensturating women. If mensturation would have been a risk factor, then every women in reproductive age would be at risk for TSS, which is not the case. So, option 'b' is wrong. . Anti- staphylococcal antibodies are used in the treatment of TSS. Treatment of TSS The severity of this disease frequently warrants hospotalization. Admission to the intensive care unit is often necessary for suppoive care (for aggressive fluid management, ventilation, renal replacement therapy and inotropic suppo), paicularly in the case of mutliple organ failure.

Which process involves formation of non essential amino acid from keto acid ?,Deamination,Transamination,Dehydrogenation,Oxidation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Transamination o Transamination interconverts pairs of a-amino acids and a-keto-acids, i.e. one a-amino acid is converted to a keto- acid along with conversion of a keto-acid into an cx-amino-acid.Transaminationo Transamination involves the reversible transfer of a-amino group of a-amino acid to an a-keto acidQ to form a new amino acid and a new keto acid. The enzyme catalyze the reaction is called aminotransferase (transaminase). Most transaminases use a-ketoglutarate (a-keto acid) as a common acceptor of a-amino group of a-amino acids. All transaminases require pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) as a coenzymneQ. Some of the most important transaminases are: -i) Alanine transaminase (ALT) also called glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT): - It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of alanine to a-ketoglutarate resulting in formation of pyruvate and L-glutamate Q.ii) Aspartate transaminase (AST) also called glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) : It catalyzes the transfer of amino group of aspartate to a-ketoefutarate resulting in formation of oxaloacetate and L-glutamate. Qo Most amino acids undergo transamination reaction except lysine, threonine, proline and hydroxvproline.o All the amino groups from amino acids that undergo transamination are collected into one common amino acid, i.e., glutamate. This is important because L-glutamate is the only amino acid that undergoes oxidative deamination at an appreciable rate in mammalian tissue. Thus, formation of ammonia from amino acids occurs mainly via the a-amino nitrogen of glutamate. Transamination is not restricted to a-amino groups.

Repolarization of a nerve is due to: September 2009,Hydrogen ions,Potassium ions,Sodium ions,Calcium ions,"Ans. B: Potassium ionsThe Na+ channels rapidly enter the inactivated state and remain in this state for a few milliseconds before returning to the resting state. In addition, the direction of the electrical gradient for Na+ is reversed during the overshoot because the membrane potential is reversed, and this limits Na+ influx.A third factor producing repolarization is the opening of voltage-gated K+ channels.The net movement of positive charge out of the cell due to K+ efflux at this time helps complete the process of repolarization.The slow return of the K+ channels to the closed state also explains the after-hyperpolarization.",B

A complete fusion results in abnormal development of the uterine tubes because the uterine tubes form from the unfused portions of the cranial parts of the paramesonephric ducts. Hydronephros, swelling of the renal pelvis and calyces with urine, can result from the obstruction of the ureter by a renal stone.

A histological section of the left ventricle of a deceased 28-year-old male shows classic contraction band necrosis of the myocardium. Biological specimens confirm the presence of cocaine and metabolites. Activity of which of the following enzymes was most likely increased in the patient's myocardial cells sholy prior to his death?,Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase,Phosphofructokinase-1,Pyruvate dehydrogenase,Succinate dehydrogenase,"Cocaine causes contraction band necrosis by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, resulting in excessive vasoconstriction of coronary vessels, leading to ischemia and infarction of hea tissue. Under these pathological conditions, myocardial cells switch to anaerobic metabolism and therefore glycolysis becomes the sole source of ATP substrate-level phosphorylations by phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase. Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, and its activity would therefore be increased. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis, which is induced by coisol, epinephrine, and glucagon. It functions in the hepatic synthesis of glucose when energy levels from beta-oxidation of fatty acids are adequate. Pyruvate dehydrogenase produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate and coenzyme A, bridging glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. It requires 5 cofactors, including NAD and FAD, which would no longer be produced by the electron transpo under hypoxic conditions, decreasing its activity. Succinate dehydrogenase is a key enzyme of the Krebs cycle, producing a reduced equivalent of FAD to feed into the electron transpo chain. It is also known as Complex II. The Krebs cycle only functions if oxygen is in appropriate concentrations since it is regulated by the levels of NADH, which is only consumed by the electron transpo chain if there is enough oxygen. The absence of oxygen leads to an accumulation of NADH and a subsequent decrease in the enzyme activities of the Krebs cycle. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 20.

Undamped oscillations are oured by:,Negative feed back,Positive feed back,High gain,Feed Forward control,"Undamped oscillations are oured by a high gain and a long dead time. The high gain makes it likely that the response may overshoot the desired level. The long dead time allows the overshoot to reach a considerable value before the overshoot is corrected by the negative feedback mechanism. Thus, the oscillations continue. A good example of undamped oscillations is Cheyne - Stokes' breathing. SERVOMECHANISM: In some control systems, the set point is not a fixed entity. If the set point changes from time to time, the system is called a servomechanism. The stretch reflex which regulates muscle length is an example of a servo mechanism. The stretch reflex has a variable gain. The initial high gain increases the speed with which most of the response is completed. The low gain later reduces the oscillations in the response.",C

This child most likely has a mutation in which one of the following enzymes?",Liver glycogen phosphorylase,Glycogen synthase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,Muscle glycogen phosphorylase,"The child has the symptoms of von Gierke disease, which is caused by a lack of glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In this disorder, neither liver glycogen nor gluconeogenic precursors (e.g., alanine and glycerol) can be used to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The last step (conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose) is deficient for both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Muscle glycogen cannot be used to maintain blood glucose levels because muscle does not contain glucose-6-phosphatase. A defective liver glycogen phosphorylase (Her disease) will not affect the ability of the liver to raise blood glucose levels by gluconeogenesis. In addition, the lack of liver glycogen phosphorylase does not lead to lactic and uric acid accumulation, although mild fasting hypoglycemia can be observed. Defects in liver glycogen synthase (type 0 glycogen storage disease) will lead to hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia, but not lactate acid or uric acid accumulation.

Conjugation does not involve -,Bacteriophages,HFr,Fr,Plasmids,"Conjugation: it is the process whereby a male or donor bacterium mates or makes physical contact with a female or recipient bacterium and transfer genetic material into it. This has been considered to be the bacterial equivalent of sexual mating in higher organisms but the analogy is irrelevant as following conjugation the female bacterium is, in turn, conveed into a male cell. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E.coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. It takes place between a male cell and a female cell. the maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialized fimbriae which project from the surface of the cell. the plasmid DNA replicates and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recipient attains donor status and can in turn conjugated with other female cells.the maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic. Along with plasmid DNA, a poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recipient the donor DNA then combines with DNA of the rrecipientaffecting genetic recombination. it was E.coli K12 that the role of the plasmid in conjugation was first recognized the plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor. When other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as da one in conjugation.

Lymes disease all are true except aEUR',Borellia bourgdorferi replicates locally and invades locally,Infection progresses inspite of good humoral immunity,Polymorphonuclear lymphocytosis in CSF suggest meningial involvement,IgA intrathecally confirms meningitis,"Polymorphonuclear leucocytosis in C.S.F. suggests meningeal involvement Spread of infection and immune response in lyme disease Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia Burgdorferi. Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector. Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. - Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, hea eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of anti-Borrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the infect on. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi become; a stealth invader i.e., it changes shape. - In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a ""cell surface lipoprotein VIsE"", during the course of infection - The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VISE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system. Lyme meningitis Meningitis (meningeal involvement) is the most common neurological event that occurs in the setting of early lyme dissemination. - In this clinical setting CSF is always abnormal and shows: 1) Pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytosisQ (not polymorphonuclear leukocytosis). 2) Increased protein 3) Glucose content is usually normal, but it .falls below the serum concentration in 20% of patients. Immunoglobulin abnormalities are common in the CSF of patients with lyme meningitis. - Specific IgM, IgG or IgA antibody against B. burgdorferi appears in CSF and indicates intrathecal antibody synthesis.",C

That grows in the yeast phase in tissue and in cultures incubated at 37degC. The mold phase grows in cultures incubated at 22deg to 25degC and as a saprophyte in soil. Like T.B. histoplasma infection is acquired by inhalation. Inhalation of the mold microconidia, which are small enough (2 to 5 m) to reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli, is believed to be the mode of infection. The hallmark of histoplasmosis is infection of the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and other elements of the reticuloendothelial system with intracellular growth in phagocytic macrophages. Progressive pulmonary disease occurs in a form similar to that of pulmonary tuberculosis, including the development of cavities, with sputum production, night sweats, and weight loss.

Sistrunk operation is used for,Thyroglossal cyst,Branchial cyst,Cystic hygroma,Laryngocele,"ThyroglossalDuct Cyst A thyroglossal duct cyst is a midline neck lesion that originates at the base of the tongue at the foramen cecum and descends through the central poion of the hyoid bone. Although thyroglossal duct cysts may occur anywhere from the base of the tongue to the thyroid gland, most are found at or just below the hyoid bone . A thyroid diveiculum develops as a median endodermal thickening at the foramen cecum in the embryonic stage of development. The thyroid diveiculum descends in the neck and remains attached to the base of the tongue by the thyroglossal duct. Also, as the thyroid gland descends to its normal pretracheal position, the ventral cailages of the second and third branchial arches form the hyoid bone--hence the intimate anatomic relationship of the thyroglossal duct remnant with the central poionof the hyoid bone. The thyroglossal duct normally regresses by the time the thyroid gland reaches its final position. When the elements of the duct persist despite complete thyroid descent, a thyroglossal duct cyst may develop. Failure of normal caudal migration of the thyroid gland results in a lingual thyroid, in which no other thyroid tissue is present in the neck. Ultrasound or radionuclide imaging may provide useful information to identify the presence of an ectopic thyroid gland in the neck. The standard operation for thyroglossal duct cysts has remained unchanged since it was described by Sistrunk in 1928, which involves complete excision of the cyst in continuity with its tract, the central poion of the hyoid bone, and the tract interior to the hyoid bone extending to the base of the tongue Failure to remove these tissues entirely will likely result in recur- rence because multiple sinuses have been histologically identified in these locations.

"Congenital toxoplasmosis, all are true, except",Occurs in primarily infected mother during pregnancy,"As gestational age increase, risk of transmission to fetus increases","Infant is usually asymptomatic, if infection is transmitted in 3rd trimester.",None of the above,"Congenital toxoplasmosis is a disease that occurs in fetuses infected with Toxoplasma gondii, a protozoan parasite, which is transmitted from mother to fetus. 
It can cause miscarriage or stillbirth. 
It can also cause serious and progressive visual, hearing, motor, cognitive, and other problems in a child. 
Most infected infants appear healthy at birth.
They often do not develop symptoms until months, years, or even decades later in life.
Infants with severe congenital toxoplasmosis usually have symptoms at birth or develop symptoms within the first six months of life.

Symptoms may include:
Premature birth — as many as half of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis are born prematurely, abnormally low birth weight, eye damage, jaundice, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, diarrhea, vomiting, anemia, difficulty feeding, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver and spleen, macrocephaly, an abnormally large head, microcephaly, an abnormally small head, skin rash, vision problems, hearing loss, motor and developmental delays, hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the skull, intracranial calcifications, evidence of areas of damage to the brain caused by the parasites, seizures, mild to severe mental retardation.

(c) TryptophanRef: Harper's Biochemistry, 30th ed. pg. 308, 557; Harrisons, 19th ed. pg. 435e-2* Hartnup disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by impaired neutral amino acid transport in the apical brush border membrane of the small intestine and the proximal tubule of the kidney.* Patients of hartnup disease present with pellagra like skin eruptions, cerebellar ataxia, and gross aminoaciduria.* Amino acids which are retained within the intestinal lumen due to impaired transport, are converted by bacteria to indolic compounds that can be toxic to the CNS. Amino acid like Tryptophan is converted to indole in the intestine.* Following absorption, indole is converted to 3-hvdroxyindole (i.e, indoxyl, indican) in the liver, where it is conjugated with potassium sulfate or glucuronic acid. Subsequently, it is transported to the kidneys for excretion (i.e, indicanuria).* Other tryptophan degradation products which are excreted in urine are: kynurenine and serotonin.* In these patients Tubular renal transport is also defective, contributing to gross aminoaciduria.",C

Coical representation of body in the cerebrum is:,Horizontal,Veical,Tandem,Oblique,"The primary motor coex (precentral gyrus in the frontal lobe) was mapped to show the various pas of the body and are represented (motor homunculus) with the feet at the top of the gyrus and the face at the bottom. The facial area is represented bilaterally, but the rest of the representation is generally unilateral, with the coical motor area controlling the musculature on the opposite side of the body. The coical representation of each body pa is propoional in size to the skill with which the pa is used in fine, voluntary movement. The areas involved in speech and hand movements are especially large in the coex; use of the pharynx, lips, and tongue to form words and of the fingers and opposable thumbs to manipulate the environment are activities in which humans are especially skilled. The cells in the coical motor areas are arranged in a columnar organization. So it shows a veical representation. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 12.

Muscle attached to coracoid process -,Pectoral is major,Medial head of triceps,Short head of biceps,Long head of triceps,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Short head of biceps o Tip of the coracoid process gives origin to coracobracbialis (medially) and short head of the biceps. The upper surface receives insertion of pectoralis minor. There are 3 muscles that attach to the coracoid process of the scapula- the short head of the biceps, the pectoralis minor, and the coracobrachialis. All 3 can have an affect on the brachial plexus. The least known of the 3 is the coracobrachialis (CB). The CB flexes and adducts the humerus. The musculotaneous nerve, a branch of the brachial plexus, passes right through it. Therefore, if the CB is overly tight, that nerve can become impinged and send pain to the lower arm. Watch for an overworked CB when there is round forward posture and weakness in the scapular stabilizers. In NKT we are looking for muscles that over and underwork, determine their exact relationship, and make the appropriate corrections.",C

Bacterial adherence to epithelium is mediated through,Sex pili,Fimbriae,Flagella,Mesosomes,"Explanation: Fimbriae Certain (Gram-negative bacilli carry very fine, hair-like surface appendages called fimbriae or pili.
They are shorter and thinner than flagella Fimbriae can be seen only under the electron microscope.
Fimbriae function as organs of adhesion, helping the cells to adhere firmly to particles of various kinds Fimbriated bacteria form surface pellicles in liquid media.
Many fimbriated cells (for example Escherichia, Klebsiella) agglutinate red blood cells. Hemagglutination provides a simple method of detecting the presence of such fimbriae.
The hemagglutination is specifically inhibited by D- mannose (mannose sensitive) A special type of fimbria is the sex pili.
They are found on ‘male’ bacteria and help in the attachment of those cells to ‘female’ bacteria.
They do not mediate attachment to epithelium Flagella Flagella are the organs of locomotion.
Flagellum consists of three distinct parts the filament, the hook and the basal Flagella are made up of a protein (flagellin) Flagella are less than 0.02 Jim in thickness and hence beyond the limit of resolution of the light microscope.
They may, in some instances, be seen under dark ground illumination.
They can be visualised by special staining techniques in which their thickness is increased by mordanting, or by electron microscopy Mesosoxnes Mesosomes (chondroid) are vesicular,
convoluted or niultilaniinated structures formed as invaginations of the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm.
They are more prominent in Gram-positive bacteria. They are the principal sites of respiratory enzymes in bacteria and are analogous to the mitochondria of eukaryotes.
Mesosomes are often seen in relation to the nuclear body and the site of synthesis of crosswall septa,
suggesting that they coordinate nuclear and cytoplasmic division during binary fission",B

Concrete thinking is the superficial type of thinking. Abstract attitude (categorical attitude) This is a type of thinking that includes voluntarily shifting one's mindset from a specific aspect of a situation to the general aspect. It involves keeping in mind different simultaneous aspects of a situation while grasping the essentials of the situation. It can involve breaking a situation down into its pas and isolating them voluntarily Planning ahead ideationally; and/or thinking or performing symbolically. A characteristic of many psychiatric disorders is the person's inability to assume the abstract attitude or to shift readily from the concrete to the abstract and back again as demanded by circumstances.

"A 75-year-old male patient who has recent hemiparesis came to the hospital for followup. On physical examination, stroking the plantar surface of foot produced a reflex extension of large toe and fanning of lateral toes. This is due to damage to one of the following structures",Cerebellum,Basal ganglia,Lower motor neuron,Upper motor neuron,"Upper motor neurons typically refer to coicospinal tract neurons that innervate spinal motor neurons, but they can also include brainstem neurons that control spinal motor neurons. Damage to these neurons initially causes muscles to become weak and flaccid but eventually leads to spasticity, hypeonia (increased resistance to passive movement), hyperactive stretch reflexes, and abnormal plantar extensor reflex (positive Babinski sign). The Babinski sign is dorsiflexion of the great toe and fanning of the other toes when the lateral aspect of the sole of the foot is scratched. In adults, the normal response to this stimulation is plantar flexion in all the toes.",D
Which Rectus muscle is not supplied by occulomotor nerve ?,Medial rectus,Lateral rectus,Superior rectus,Inferior rectus,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Right side TestisTestis is the male gonad. It is suspended in the scrotum by spermatic cord.Left testis is slightly (1 cm) lower than the right one.The average testicular dimensions are 5 cm (length), 25 cm (breath), 3cm (anteroposterior diameter or thickness) and 10.5-14 gms (weight).The epididymis is attached to is posterolateral surface.Vas (ductus) deference arises from lower pole of epididymis.Lateral pa of epididymis is separated from testis by an extension of cavity of tunica vaginalis, called sinus of epididymis.There is small oval body attached to upper pole of testis called appendix of testis, a remnant of paramesonephric duct.Testis is covered by three coats (from outside to inside) :- (i) tunica vaginalis (which has a parietal and a visceral layer); (ii) tunica albuginea; and (iii) tunica vasculosa. Outside these three coats, there are layers of scrotum. StructureTestis consists of 200-300 lobules.Each lobules consists of 2-3 seminiferous tubules (where spermatozoa are formed).Seminiferous tubules join at the apex of lobules to form straight tubules, which anastomose with each other to form rete testis.Which emerge from upper pole and enter the epididymis. Each tubule becomes highly coiled to form a lobe of the head of epididymis.All tubules end in a single duct which is coiled on itself to form the body and tail of the epididymis. It is continuous with ductus deference.Aerial supplyTestes are supplied by testticular aery, a branch of abdominal aoa, arises at L2 veebral level. Venous drainageThe veins emerging from the testis and epididymis form the pampiniform plexus.Anterior pa of the plexus is arranged around the testicular aery, middle pa around ductus deferens and its aery, and posterior pa is isolated.The plexus condenses into 4 veins at the superficial inguinal ring and 2 veins at the deep inguinal ring. Ultimately, one vein is formed which drains into inferior vena cava on the right and into left renal vein on the left side.Lymphatic drainageLymphatics from the testis run back with the testicular aery to para-aoic nodes along side the aoa at the level of origin of testicular aeries (L2 veebra).",A

It resembles hemoglobin but binds 1 rather than 4 mol of O 2 per mole. Its dissociation curve is a rectangular hyperbola rather than a sigmoid curve. Because its curve is to the left of the hemoglobin curve, it takes up O 2 from hemoglobin in the blood. It releases O 2 only at low P O2 values, but the P O2 in exercising muscle is close to zero. The myoglobin content is great- est in muscles specialized for sustained contraction.

Ivy technique is a test done to measure the:,Clotting time,Bleeding time,Both,None,"IVY method
The IVY method is the traditional format for this test. While both the IVY and the Duke method require the use of a sphygmomanometer, or blood pressure cuff, the IVY method is more invasive than the Duke method, utilizing an incision on the ventral side of the forearm, whereas the Duke method involves puncture with a lancet or special needle. In the IVY method, the blood pressure cuff is placed on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mmHg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a shallow incision that is 1 millimeter deep on the underside of the forearm.
A standard-sized incision is made around 10 mm long and 1 mm deep. The time from when the incision is made until all bleeding has stopped is measured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 seconds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw off the blood.The test is finished when bleeding has stopped.
 

A prolonged bleeding time may be a result from decreased number of thrombocytes or impaired blood vessels. However, the depth of the puncture or incision may be the source of error.
Normal values fall between 3 – 10 minutes depending on the method used.
A disadvantage of Ivy's method is closure of puncture wound before stoppage of bleeding.",B

False regarding HMP shunt,NADPH is produced,Ribulose 5 phosphate is produced,ATP is produced,Occurs in cytosol,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., ATP is produced HMP shunt does not produce ATP. HMP shunt HMP shunt is a multicyclic process in which 3 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate give rise to 3 molecules of CO2 and 3 molecules of 5-carbon sugars (ribulose-5-phosphate). The latter are rearranged to generate 2 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate (through fructose-6-phosphate) and l molecule glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. HMP shunt does not generate ATP. 3 Glucose-6-phosphate + 6 NADP - 2 glucose-6-phosphate + 1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + 6 NADPH 3CO2 The reaction of HMP shunt are divided into two phases : - i) Phase I (Oxidative irreversible phase) : - During this phase, 3 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate are oxidized with generation of 6 molecules of NADPH, and three molecules of pentose phosphate (ribulose?5-phosphate), with liberation of three molecules of CO2. Metabolites produced during this phase are 6- phosphoglucanolactone, 6-phosphogluconate and ribulose-5-phosphate. ii) Phase II (Non-oxidative reversible phase) : - During this phase, pentose phosphate is conveed to intermediates of glycolysis, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Intermediary metabolites of this phase are xylulose-5-phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, erythrose-4- phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. HMP shunt occurs in the cytosol. It is highly active in liver, adipose tissue, adrenal coex, lens, cornea, lactating (but not the nonlactating) mammary gland, Gonads (testis, ovary) and erythrocytes.

Type 1 glomus cell secrete neurotransmitter because of oxygen sensitive,Na+ channel,Cl channel,Ca+2 channel,K+ channel,"Type I glomus cells have O2 sensitive K+ channels, whose conductance is reduced in propoion to the degree of hypoxia to which they are exposed. This reduces the K+ efflux, depolarizing the cell and causing Ca2+ influx, primarily L-type Ca2+ channels. The Ca2+ influx triggers action potentials and transmitter release, with consequent excitation. of the afferent nerve endings. The smooth muscle of pulmonary aeries contains similar O2-sensitive K+ channels, which mediate the vasoconstriction caused by hypoxia. This is in contrast to systemic aeries, which contain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) dependent K+ channels that permit more K+ efflux with hypoxia and consequently cause vasodilation instead of vasoconstriction.

Which of the following structures is found only in Gram-negative microorganisms?,Cell envelope,Exotoxin,Peptidoglycan,Periplasmic space,"This question requires you to appreciate the key structural difference between gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Most gram-negatives (other than exceptional microorganisms, such as Mycoplasma, that lack a cell wall) have a more complex cell envelope than gram-positive microorganisms. It includes both a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer membrane. Between these two membranes is the periplasmic space, which contains enzymes such as phosphatase and penicillinase, binding proteins for the transpo of various nutrients, and peptidoglycan, as well as a poion of the lipoprotein that firmly anchors the outer that a baby can form with an acute membrane to the peptidoglycan. Gram-positives do not have outer membranes. The cell envelope is incorrect because both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms have this structure, which is defined as all the layers that enclose the cytosol of the bacterium. It is the composition of the envelope that differs between gram-positives and gram-negatives. Exotoxin is not exclusive to gram-negative microorganisms, but is also found in some gram-positives. By contrast, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is found exclusively in gram- negatives. Peptidoglycan is found in the cell walls of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Note that there is a larger amount of peptidoglycan in gram-positive microorganisms. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 2. Cell Structure. In G.F.

Staphylococcus epidermidis, which normally colonizes the skin, is the most common organism causing this disorder; Staphylococcus aureus meningitis occasionally occurs. Bacteroides fragilis is a common cause of anaerobic infections, including sepsis and peritonitis, but it does not commonly cause meningitis.

Defect in Snurps causes ?,Defect in 5' - capping,Defect in addition of poly-A tail,Defect in Splicing,Defect in terminal addition of nucleotide,"m-RNA processingProkaryotic mRNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i.e. prokaryotic primary transcript of mRNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of mRNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hnRNA is extensively modified to form functional mRNA. These modifications are as follows.1) The 5'-capping :- This is the first processing reaction. 51-end of mRNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of mRNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease.2) Addition of poly 'A' tail :- As the name suggests, multiple 'A' (adenylate) residues are added at 3'end.This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA, but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the mRNA (by protecting from 3'-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shoened. Some mRNAs do not have poly-A tail, e.g. mRNAs of histones and some interferons.3) Removal of introns (splicing) :- Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called `exons' and intervening non-coding sequences are called `introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional mRNA is called splicing. Thus mature mRNA does not contain introns.Splicesome Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), some proteins and hnRNA. snRNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein paicles (snRNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is snRNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U4, U5 and U6.Only about 1-5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns).4) Alternate splicing :- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different mRNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hnRNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",C

"A child with stunted growth with a stuffed-belly, and short stature with mental retardation is suffering from the deficiency of which of the following:",Thyroxine,Growth hormone,Rickets,Parathyroid,"Thyroxine Increases Metabolism of Cells.
Thyroxine indirectly affects protein metabolism by increasing metabolism of the cells. If insufficient carbohydrates and fats are available for energy, thyroxine causes rapid degradation of proteins and uses them for energy. Conversely, if adequate quantities of carbohydrates and fats are available and excess amino acids are also available in the extracellular fluid, thyroxine can actually increase the rate of protein synthe­sis. In growing animals or human beings, deficiency of thyroxine causes growth to be greatly inhibited because of lack of protein synthesis. In essence, it is believed that thyroxine  has little specific effect on protein metabolism but does have an important general effect by increasing the rates of both normal anabolic and normal catabolic protein reactions.
Thyroid hormones stimulate metabolic rate, calorigenesis, cardiac function, and normal mentation, and interact synergistically with catecholamines. Thyroid hormones also play critical roles in development, particularly of the nervous system, and growth.
Note: Lack of adequate amount of thyroxine can result in stunted growth with a stuffed-belly, and short stature with mental retardation.

From the germinal layer, small knob like excrescences / gemmules protrude into the lumen of the cyst. These enlarge and become vacuolated and filled with fluid. These are called brood capsules. They are initially attached to the germinal layer by a stalk, but later escapes free into the fluid filled cyst cavity. From the inner wall of brood capsule, protoscolices develop, which represent head of adult worm, complete with invaginated scolex, bearing suckers and hooklets. Each of these are potential tapeworm.

It was characterized as an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism in 1908. It is associated with a deficiency of L-xylulose reductase, necessary for xylitol metabolism.
L-Xylulose is a reducing sugar, so it may give false diagnosis of diabetes, as it is found in high concentrations in urine.
However, glucose metabolism is normal in people with pentosuria and they are not diabetic.
Patients of pentosuria have a low concentration of the sugar d-xyloketose. Using phenyl pentosazone crystals, phloroglucin reaction, and absorption spectrum, pentose can be traced back as the reducing substance in urine, with those that have pentosuria.

25 year old labourer 3 years back presented with penile ulcer not treated. Later he presented with neurological symptoms for which he got treated. Test to monitor response to treatment is ?,VDRL,FTA-ABS,TPI,RPR,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., VDRL . Neurological symptoms in a patient with history of untreated ulcer 3 years back suggests the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. To fuher clear the doubts, all the given options are serological tests for syphilis. So, the examiner is asking about the syphilis for sure. . It has alreadys been explained that for monitoring of response of therapy non specific serological tests (VDRL or RPR) are used as the specific treponemal tests remain positive inspite of treatment. Now question arises, whether to use VDRL or RPR as both the options are there in this question. Following statement will clear your doubts? "" The VDRL ( a standard test) will often indicate cure as measured by negative serologies by 12 months after therapy, whereas the RPR shows only 50% seroconversion i.e. negative serology at one year""....................... Annals on internal medicine Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis. . Titres are not interchangable between different test types. Hence, the same non-treponemal test should be used for follow up. e.g. if one has used VDRL at first follow up, then VDR1 should be used at every follow up. You should also keep in mind that though after adequate treatment of syphilis non treponemal tests (non specific tests) eventually become non-reactive. Sometimes even with sufficient treatment patients have a persistent low level positive nontreponemal test, reffered to as a serofast reaction.",A
Which is not a feature of Skeletal muscle,Spindle shaped fibres,Syncytium,Striations,Hypolemmal nucleus,"Microscopic Features of skeletal muscles - Skeletal muscle is made up essentially of long, cylindrical 'fibres'. The length of the fibres is highly variable, the longest being as much as 30 cm in length. The diameter of the fibres also varies considerably (10-60 um; usually 50-60 um). Each 'fibre' is really a syncytium with hundreds of nuclei along its length (The 'fibre' is formed, during development, by fusion of numerous myoblasts). The nuclei are elongated and lie along the periphery of the fibre, just under the cell membrane (which is called the sarcolemma). The cytoplasm (or sarcoplasm) is filled with numerous longitudinal fibrils that are called myofibrils. The most striking feature of skeletal muscle fibres is the presence of transverse striations in them. REF : Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, seventh edition, pg.no., 108, 109.",A

Iron absorption takes place in which part of intestine-,Duodenum,Ileum,Jejunum,Colon,"Ans. is 'a' i.e.. Duodenum o Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum.Iron absorptiono Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum,o In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron.o Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron,o inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.o After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes.o A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin.o However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine,o Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases,o This regulation is mediated by ""iron metabolism regulatory' hormone"" i.e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption,o When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption,o Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites.Transport and storage of irono Iron is transported is blood in combination with a glycoprotein transferrin.o Iron is transported into cells through attachment of transferrin to specific membrane bound receptors,o Iron is stored as ferritin (major storage form) or haemosiderin.o Ferritin is a complex of iron and apoferritin (iron + apoferritin = ferritin).o Iron is mainly stored in reticuio-endothelial cells monocytes.'macrophages of liver, spleen, bonemarrow,o It is also stored in hepatocvtes (parenchymal cells of liver) and myocytes of skeletal muscles.Note :Iron is stored in ferritin in ferric form.Factors affecting iron absorptionA.

ATP is generated in ETC by,Na+ k+ ATPase,Na+ CI- ATPase,FOF1 ATPase,ADP Kinase,"ATP SYNTHASE (COMPLEX V) It is a protein assembly in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is sometimes referred to as the 5th Complex (Figs 19.14 and 19.15). Proton pumping ATP synthase (otherwise called F1-Fo ATPase) is a multisubunit transmembrane protein. It has two functional units, named as F1 and Fo. It looks like a lollipop since the membrane-embedded Fo component and F1 are connected by a protein stalk. Fo Unit: The ""o"" is pronounced as ""oh""; and not as ""zero"". The ""o"" stands for oligomycin, as Fo is inhibited by oligomycin. Fo unit spans inner mitochondrial membrane. It serves as a proton channel, through which protons enter into mitochondria (Fig.19.14). Fo unit has 4 polypeptide chains and is connected to F1. Fo is water-insoluble whereas F1 is a water-soluble peripheral membrane protein. F1 Unit: It projects into the matrix. It catalyses the ATP synthesis (Fig. 19.14). F1 unit has 9 polypeptide chains, (3 alpha, 3 beta, 1 gamma, 1 sigma, 1 epsilon). The alpha chains have binding sites for ATP and ADP and beta chains have catalytic sites. ATP synthesis requires Mg++ ions. Mechanism of ATP synthesis: Translocation of protons carried out by the Fo catalyses the formation of the phospho-anhydride bond of ATP by F1. Coupling of the dissipation of proton gradient with ATP synthesis (oxidative phosphorylation) is through the interaction of F1 and Fo.Ref: DM Vasudevan Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 232",C

One bacterium receives a gene for restriction endonuclease from another by horizontal transduction. What is the likely outcome?,The proof-reading activity of the bacteria is increased,The bacterium will die as it does not have the protective methylase enzyme,The bacterium will cause digestion of host DNA on infection,The mechanism of repair is excellent,"The DNA methylase offers protection from endonucleolytic attack by the separate restriction enzyme. The descendants of cells that had lost the genes encoding DNA restriction endonucleases appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzymes, and consequently died. Hence, the fate of this bacterium which received a gene for for restriction endonuclease will be the same as given above. Restriction endonuclease: Restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific sites when the bases are not protected (modified, usually, methylation). Bacteria synthesize restriction enzymes as a defense against invading foreign DNAs such as phages and foreign plasmids. Three major types have been recognized. Type I enzymes are single multifunctional proteins of three subunits. Type II enzymes are used most widely for genetic engineering. Type II enzymes have separate endonuclease and methylase proteins. Type III enzymes carry out restriction and modification by two proteins with a shared polypeptide.

On physical examination, numerous ecchymoses are noted on the posterior aspect of his legs and thighs. Careful examination of the man's skin reveals minute hemorrhages around hair follicles and splinter hemorrhages in the nail beds. Laboratory examination is remarkable for a hemoglobin of 10 (normal 14-18 g/dL); no other hematologic abnormalities are noted. Therapy should consist of ?",Administration of factor VIII,Administration of iron,Administration of vitamin B12,Administration of vitamin C,"The patient described suffers from scurvy, due to a deficiency of dietary vitamin C. Absence of vitamin C leads to impaired hydroxylation of proline residues in the nascent procollagen chains, leading to weakness of blood vessel walls. Clinically, the deficiency syndrome is characterized by perifollicular hemorrhages, fragmentation of hairs, purpura, ecchymoses, splinter hemorrhages, and hemorrhages into muscle. In patients with normal dentition, gum changes (swelling, bleeding, loosening of teeth) are also noted. Without supplementation with vitamin C, death may eventually occur. Administration of factor VIII would be indicated for factor VIII deficiency, which would also lead to a prolonged PTT (paial thromboplastin time), which was not noted. Administration of iron would be of benefit in iron-deficiency anemia, but there is no indication of a hypochromic, microcytic anemia in this patient. The anemia of scurvy is typically normochromic and normocytic, due to bleeding. Administration of vitamin B12 would be indicated for a megaloblastic anemia.

The complex process of leukocytes movement through the blood vessels are all except,Rolling,Adhesion,Migration,Phagocytosis,"Ref Robbins 8/e p44;9/e p71 Margination and Rolling. As blood flows from capillaries into postcapillary venules, circulating cells are swept by laminar flow against the vessel wall. Because the smaller red cells tend to move faster than the larger white cells, leukocytes are pushed out of the central axial column and thus have a better oppounity to interact with lining endothelial cells, especially as stasis sets in. This process of leukocyte accumulation at the periphery of vessels is called margination. If the endothelial cells are activated by cytokines and other mediators produced locally, they express adhesion molecules to which the leukocytes attach loosely. These cells bind and detach and thus begin to tumble on the endothelial surface, a process called rolling. Adhesion. The rolling leukocytes are able to sense changes in the endothelium that initiate the next step in the reaction of leukocytes, which is firm adhesion to endothelial sur- faces. This adhesion is mediated by integrins expressed on leukocyte cell surfaces interacting with their ligands on endothelial cells (Fig. 2-5 and Table 2-2). Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric glycoproteins that mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium and of various cells to the extracellular matrix.",D

"A 31-year-old female presents to the department of surgery with a complaint of Bell's palsy, which had appeared a year earlier and had resulted in paralysis of muscles of one side of her face. The chief of plastic surgery recommends a nerve graft, taking a cutaneous nerve from the lower limb to replace the defective facial nerve. The surgery is successful. Six months after the procedure, there is restoration of function of previously paralyzed facial muscles. There is an area of skin on the back of the leg laterally and also on the lateral side of the foot that has no sensation. What nerve was used in the grafting procedure?",Superficial fibular (peroneal),Tibial,Common fibular (peroneal),Sural,"The sural nerve is formed by contributions from the tibial nerve and a branch from the common fibular (peroneal) nerve. It provides sensation for the lower lateral portion of the calf and continues beneath the lateral malleolus as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the foot. It is often used for nerve grafting procedures as well as biopsied for diagnostic purposes. When it is grafted to the ""living end"" of a cut motor or sensory nerve, the severed nerve processes within the ""living"" nerve grow into the sural nerve sheath, using it as a guide to the distal, surgically anastomosed nerve. Thus, axons from a branch of a functional motor nerve can grow to reinnervate paralyzed muscles. In this case, the surgeon would connect portions of the sural nerve to the functional facial nerve, tunnel it to the opposite side of the face, and join it surgically to the branches of the paralyzed nerve, where it would grow through the now-empty nerve sheaths (due to Wallerian degeneration) to the muscles. Growth and reinnervation usually occur at a rate of 1mm/day (or 1inch/month) so the time estimated before reinnervation is based on the distance the regenerating fibers need to traverse. The tibial nerve supplies muscles and sensation to the calf and plantar surface of the foot. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the lateral and anterior compartment muscles and sensation to the dorsum of the foot. The saphenous nerve accompanies the great saphenous vein on the medial side of the leg and foot.",D

Which of the following physiological factor increases the urinary concentrating ability of the kidney?,ECF volume contraction,Increase in RBF,Reduction of medullary hyperosmolarity,Increase in GFR,"When a person is dehydrated, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is somewhat low and levels of ADH are high. The extraction of water in the coical collecting duct removes most of the water from the lumen (and makes it iso-osmotic with the coical interstitium ie, about 300 mOsm/kg). Then, as the remaining but greatly reduced, volume flows through the high osmolality medulla, fuher concentration occurs. The increased urea permeability signaled by ADH greatly assists in generating the medullary osmotic gradient by permitting the recycling of urea. Ref: Eaton D.C., Pooler J.P. (2009). Chapter 6.

True about carotid body receptors ?,Most potent stimulus is high PCO2,Dopamine is neurotransmitter,Low blood flow,Afferent through vagus nerve,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dopamine is neurotransmitter Peripheral chemoreceptors The peripheral chemoreceptors which regulate respiration are located in the carotid body and aoic bodies. These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aoa, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aoic bodies pass through vagus nerve. The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low aerial P02 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high aerial PCO2, and an increase in aerial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. The blood flow to peripheral chemoreceptors, on per unit mass basis, is the highest to any tissue in the body. With a blood flow of 2000 ml/min/100 gm tissue, the carotid and aoic bodies, inspite of their high metabolic rate, hardly remove any oxygen from the blood supplies to them. That is why the aeriovenous oxygen difference is negligible in these bodies. Thus these structures are idealy built to sense change in aerial P02. It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP along with hyperventilation.",B

All are steps of PCR EXCEPT:,Denaturation,Annealing,Extension,Transformation,"ANSWER: (D) TransformationREF: Harper's 28 ed chapter 39The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method of amplifying a target sequence of DNA. PCR provides a sensitive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any desired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence. The DNA sample is first heated to separate the two strands of the template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers, added in vast excess, are allowed to anneal to the DNA; and each strand is copied by a DNA polymerase, starting at the primer sites in the presence of all 4 dXTPs. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers. Repeated cycles of heat denaturation, annealing of the primers to their complementary sequences, and extension of the annealed primers withDNA polymerase result in the exponential amplification of DNA segments of defined length (a doubling at each cycle). Early PCR reactions used an E coli DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat denaturation cycle. Substitution of a heat-stable DNA polymerase from Thermusaquaticus (or the corresponding DNA polymerase from other thermophilic bacteria), an organism that lives and replicates at 70-80degC, obviates this problem and has made possible automation of the reaction, since the polymerase reactions can be run at 70degC. This has also improved the specificity and the yield of DNA.",D

In the intestine some of the primary bile acids are conveed into secondary bile acids, i.e., deoxycholic acid (formed from cholic acid) and lithocholic acid (derived from chenodexoxycholic acid). Glycine and taurine conjugates of these bile acids are called as bile salts. For example, cholic acid is a bile acid, and its glycine conjugate (glycocholic acid) is a bile salt. Bile salts help in digestion and absorption of fat by emulsification and micelles formation. Bile salts act as detergents, i.e., they have surface tension lowering action. Detergent action is due to amphipathic nature of bile salts (Note : Amphipathic molecules are molecules that contain both hydrophobic non-polar as well as hydrophilic-polar ends).

"All of the following parasites causes malabsorption, EXCEPT:",Giardiasis,Ascaris lumbricoides,Strongyloides,Capillaria philippinensis,"Parasites causing malabsorption are Giardia lamblia E.histolytica Strongyloides Cyclospora Capillaria philippinensis Adult Ascaris are large: females are 20-50 cm long, and males are 15-30 cm long. Humans acquire the infection after eggs are ingested; larvae hatch in the duodenum, penetrate through the mucosa, migrate in the circulatory system, lodge in lung capillaries, penetrate the alveoli, and migrate from the bronchioles to the trachea and pharynx; larvae are swallowed and return to the intestine and mature into adults. If present in high numbers, adult worms may cause mechanical obstruction of the bowel and bile and pancreatic ducts. Worms tend to migrate if drugs such as anesthetics or steroids are given, leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis, anal passage of worms, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Larvae migrating through lungs induce an inflammatory response (pneumonitis), especially after second infection, leading to bronchial spasm, mucus production, and Loeffler syndrome (cough, eosinophilia, and pulmonary infiltrates). It does not cause malabsorption.",B
A 2-day-old newborn male is cyanotic after attempts to swallow milk result in collection of the milk in his mouth. After 2 days he develops pneumonia. A tracheoesophageal fistula is suspected. Which of the following structures has failed to develop properly?,Esophagus,Trachea,Tongue,Tracheoesophageal septum,"The tracheoesophageal septum is the down-growth that separates the ventral wall of the foregut (esophagus) from the laryngotracheal tube. The presence of a fistula would result in passage of fluid from the esophagus into the trachea and could cause pneumonia. If the esophagus did not develop correctly, as in esophageal atresia, it would end as a blind tube. This kind of defect, although associated with tracheoesophageal fistula, is not the result of an opening into the trachea, and pneumonia would not result. Abnormal tracheal development can be associated with tracheoesophageal fistula, therefore, but it is not the direct cause of it. Abnormal tongue development does not result in a tracheoesophageal fistula. Abnormal development of the pharynx is not associated with a tracheoesophageal fistula.",D

Most appropriate regarding regulation of coronary circulation is:,Autonomic,Autoregulatory,Hormonal,Sympathetic,"All options are regulator of coronary circulation but the most important one is autoregulation.
Blood flow increases when the metabolism of the myocardium is increased. The caliber of the coronary vessels, and consequently the rate of coronary blood flow, is influenced not only by pressure changes in the aorta but also by chemical and neural factors. The coronary circulation also shows considerable autoregulation.
The close relationship between coronary blood flow and myocardial O2 consumption indicates that one or more of  the products of metabolism cause coronary vasodilation.
The coronary arterioles contain α-adrenergic receptors, which mediate vasoconstriction, and β-adrenergic receptors, which mediate vasodilation. Activity in the noradrenergic nerves to the heart and injections of norepinephrine cause coronary vasodilation. The direct effect of noradrenergic stimulation is constriction rather than dilation of the coronary vessels.

A three years old boy presents with the poor urinary stream. Most likely cause is,Stricture urethra,Neurogenic bladder,Urethral calculus,Posterior urethral valve,"Poor urinary stream in 3 years old boy suggests urinary tract obstruction (usually intravesical) and the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in a male child is posterior urethral valve. Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by voiding cystourethrogram* & endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First, a small polyethene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days. Then fuher management is done according to serum creatinine level. with normal serum creatinine - transurethral ablation of the valve leaflets. * With increased serum creatinine and the worsening of condition - vesicostomy to bypass the obstruction and when normal creatinine levels are achieved, transurethral ablation is done.

Which amino acid induces bends in a helix?,Glycine,Valine,Leucine,Isoleucine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Glycine* Two amino acids are involved in producing folds in collagen : proline and glycine.* In order to form a triple-helix a polypeptide chain (a-chain) must contain glycine as every third residue in the sequence. This is because only the glycine is small enough to be accommodated in the limited space available down the central core of the triple helix. Each turn of polypeptide chain (a-chain) contains three amino acid residues, and glycine (Gly) is present at every third position. Thus glycine constitutes 33% of the total amino acid residues. The repeating amino acid residues, represented as (Gly-X-Y)n, is an absolute requirement for formation of triple helix. X and Y can be any amino acids, but most of the time X is proline (10% of the total amino acid residues) and most of the time Y is hydroxyproline. Other important amino acids found in collagen are lysine and hydroxylysine.* Two amino acids helps in formation of triple-helixi). Proline: Introduces sharp bends in the polypeptide chains (a-chains)ii) Glycine: It plays an indirect role in permitting extremely tight interwinding of the a-chains. The winding is so compact that there is little space available towards the interior, only the smallest amino acid (i.e. glycine) can be accomodated at this place.",A

The most common way in which tuberculosis is acquired is via the,Skin,Gastrointestinal tract,Respiratory tract,Genital tract,"Organisms may be transmitted in a number of ways, such as by air, food, hands, sexual contact, and infected needles. However, for each disease or disease category, there is usually a portal of entry not always unique to the organism. The respiratory tract is a common portal of entry to such airborne organisms as M. tuberculosis. This is why respiratory precautions must be taken when patients are harboring viable M. tuberculosis.The gastrointestinal tract is usually infected from ingestion of contaminated food or water (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter) or by an alteration of the normal microbial flora such as with C. difficile disease. The skin is a tough integument and intact, is resistant to most infectious organisms except those that may break down human skin. Breaches of the skin as by wounds, burns, and the like predispose patients to a variety of infections such as tetanus caused by wound contamination with spores of C. tetani, or direct infection by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Gram-negative rods (such as Serratia or Pseudomonas).The genital tract may become infected either by sexual contact or by alteration of the genital environment as often occurs with yeast infections.

The skin is involved in a majority of patients; a characteristic erythematous or maculopapular eruption over the malar eminences and bridge of the nose (""butterfly pattern"") is observed in approximately half of the cases. Exposure to sunlight (UV light) exacerbates the erythema (so-called photosensitivity), and a similar rash may be present elsewhere on the extremities and trunk, frequently in sun-exposed areas. Histopathologic findings include lique- factive degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, edema at the dermoepidermal junction, and mononuclear infiltrates around blood vessels and skin appendages (Fig. 4-19, A). Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals deposi- tion of immunoglobulin and complement at the dermoepi- dermal junction (Fig. 4-19, B); similar immunoglobulin and complement deposits may also be present in apparently unin- volved skin. Joints. Joint involvement is frequent but usually is not associ- ated with striking anatomic changes or with joint deformity. When present, it consists of swelling and a nonspecific mono- nuclear cell infiltration in the synol membranes. Erosion of the membranes and destruction of aicular cailage, such as in RA, are exceedingly rare. CNS. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement also is very common, with focal neurologic deficits and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms. CNS disease often is ascribed to vascular lesions causing ischemia or multifocal cerebral microinfarcts. Small vessel angiopathy with noninflammatory intimal proliferation is the most frequent pathological lesion; frank vasculitis is uncommon. The angiopathy may result from thrombosis caused by antiphospholipid antibodies. Premature atherosclerosis occurs and may contribute to CNS ischemia. Another postulated mechanism for CNS disease is injury from antineuronal antibodies with conse- quent neurologic dysfunction, but this hypothesis remains unproved. Other Organs. The spleen may be moderately enlarged. Capsular fibrous thickening is common, as is follicular hyper- plasia with numerous plasma cells in the red pulp. Central penicilliary aeries characteristically show thickening and perivascular fibrosis, producing onion-skin lesions. Pericardium and pleura, in paicular, are serosal mem- branes that show a variety of inflammatory changes in SLE ranging (in the acute phase) from serous effusions to fibrinous exudates that may progress to fibrous opacification in the chronic stage. Involvement of the hea is manifested primarily in the form of pericarditis. Myocarditis, in the form of a nonspecific mononuclear cell infiltrate, and valvular lesions, called Libman-Sacks endocarditis, also occur but are less common in the current era of aggressive coicosteroid therapy. This nonbacterial verrucous endocarditis takes the form of irregular, 1- to 3-mm way deposits, seen as distinctive lesions on either surface of the leaflets (i.e., on the surface exposed to the forward flow of the blood or on the underside of the leaflet) (see Chapter 10). An increasing number of patients also show clinical and anatomic manifes- tations of coronary aery disease. The basis of accelerated atherosclerosis is not fully understood, but the process seems to be multifactorial; ceainly, immune complexes can deposit in the coronary vasculature, leading to endothelial damage by that pathway. Moreover, glucocoicoid treatment causes alterations in lipid metabolism, and renal disease (common in SLE) causes hypeension; both of these are risk factors for atherosclerosis (Chapter 9). Many other organs and tissues may be involved. The changes consist essentially of acute vasculitis of the small vessels, foci of mononuclear infiltrations, and fibrinoid deposit Absence of IgG The serum electrophoretic pattern of the patient showed absence of immunoglobulin G and an increase of the IgA and IgM precipitation bands",A

Which brainstem-derived descending tract produces action similar to the lateral coicospinal tract?,Vestibulospinal,Reticulospinal,Spinocerebellar,Rubrospinal,"Descending motor pathways are organized into two major groups:Lateral pathways control both proximal and distal muscles and are responsible for most voluntary movements of arms and legs. They include thelateral coicospinal tract & rubrospinal tractMedial pathways control axial muscles and are responsible for posture, balance, and coarse control of axial and proximal muscles. They include thevestibulospinal tracts, reticulospinal tracts, and anterior coicospinal tractThe coicorubrospinal pathway serves as an accessory route for transmission of relatively discrete signals from the motor coex to the spinal cord. When the coicospinal fibers are destroyed but the coicorubrospinal pathway is intact, discrete movements can still occur, except that the movements for fine control of the fingers and hands are considerably impaired. Wrist movements are still functional, which is not the case when the coicorubrospinal pathway is also blocked.Therefore, the pathway through the red nucleus to the spinal cord is associated with the coicospinal system. Therefore, the coicospinal and rubrospinal tracts together are called the lateral motor system of the cord.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 56 Coical and Brain Stem Control of Motor Function",D
Relaxation volume of lung is documented as ?,Functional residual capacity,Residual volume,Vital capasity,Closing volume,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Functional residual capacity Relaxation volume The relaxation volume is the volume of the relaxed respiratory system, i.e., the volume at which net elastic recoil of he total respiratory system is zero (the elastic recoil of chest wall is equal and opposite to that of lungs). In healthy subjects, this occurs at the end of quiet expiration, i.e., at functional residual capacity. Therefore, in healthy adults at rest FRC is essentially equal to relaxation volume of respiratory system and FRC is usually treated as synonymous with relaxation volume. However, in real sense FRC and relaxation volume are not synonymous terms and, while the two volumes are some times equal, more often they are not, i.e., active or passive mechanisms often operate to make FRC different from relaxation volume. For example, neonates have a more compliant (less stiff) chest wall. The chest wall thus has less elastic recoil to balance that of lung, thus decreasing the relaxation volume of lung. FRC then is often maintained above relaxation volume by active mechanisms like inspiratory muscle activity and slowing of expiration. Another example where FRC and relaxation volume may differ is in obstructive lung disease where FRC is dynamically determined and may be considerably above relaxation volume.",A

Long chain fatty acids penetrate the inner mitochondrial membrane as,Carnitine derivatives,Pyruvate,Acetyl coA derivatives,Acyl CoA,"Long-Chain Fatty Acids Penetrate the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane as Carnitine Derivatives Carnitine (-hydroxy--trimethylammonium butyrate), (CH3)3N+--CH2--CH(OH)--CH2--COO-, is widely distributed and is paicularly abundant in muscle. Long-chain acyl-CoA (or FFA) cannot penetrate the inner membrane of mitochondria. In the presence of carnitine, however, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, conves long-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, which is able to penetrate the inner membrane and gain access to the -oxidation system of enzymes. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase acts as an inner membrane exchange transpoer. Acylcarnitine is transpoed in, coupled with the transpo out of one molecule of carnitine. The acylcarnitine then reacts with CoA, catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II, located on the inside of the inner membrane, reforming acyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, and carnitine is liberated.

Two sisters are diagnosed with hemolytic anemia. Their older brother was previously diagnosed with the same disorder. Two other brothers are asymptomatic. The mother and father are second cousins. Deficiency of which of the following enzymes would be most likely to cause this disorder?,Debranching enzyme,Glucose-6-phosphatase,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,Pyruvate kinase,"In general, you should associate hemolytic anemia with defects in glycolysis or the hexose monophosphate shunt (pentose phosphate pathway). Only two enzymes of those listed in the answer choices specifically involve these pathways and cause hemolytic anemia: pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, so females would not be affected. Pyruvate kinase is a glycolytic enzyme; pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder, affecting males and females approximately equally. If this enzyme is deficient, red cells have trouble producing enough ATP to maintain the Na+/K+ pump on the plasma membrane, secondarily causing swelling and lysis. Debranching enzyme defects produce Cori's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases. Defects in glucose-6-phosphatase produce Von Gierke's disease, one of the glycogen storage diseases.

Carcinoma in situ refers to a neoplastic proliferation of epithelial cells that is confined to ducts and lobules by the basement membrane. Invasive carcinoma (synonymous with ""infiltrating"" carcinoma) has penetrated through the basement membrane and grows within stroma. Here, the cells have the potential to invade into the vasculature and thereby reach regional lymph nodes and distant sites. The terms ductal and lobular are still used to describe subsets of both in situ and invasive carcinomas, but most evidence suggests all breast carcinomas actually arise from cells in the terminal duct lobular unit. Carcinoma in situ was originally classified as DCIS or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) based on the resemblance of the involved spaces to normal ducts or lobules. It is now recognized that these growth patterns are not related to the cell of origin, but rather reflect differences in tumor cell genetics and biology.

Fetal hemoglobin has more affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin because -,"Decreased 2,3 DPG concentration","Low affinity for 2,3 DPG","Increase 2,3 DPG concentration",Reduced pH,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Low affinity for 2,3 DPG o Make it very clear in mind that higher affinity' of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen is due to low affinity of HbF for 2,3- DPG (not due to decreased 2, 3-DPG concentration). HbF does not combines to 2, 3-DPG as avidly as adult hemoglobin.""Fetal hemoglobin is left - shifted because it has a low affinity' for DPG"", --Principles of medical physiology'""It is worth noting that DPG does not combine with fetal hemoglobin. That is perhaps one reason why HbF has greater affin ity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin (HbF) "".-- Understanding of medical physiology""Fetal hemoglobin binds less 2-3 DPG it has consequently a greater affinity for O2"" -- Pediatric physiologyo All other textbooks have mentioned the same thing.o So, high affinity of HbF to O2 is due to low affinity of HbF for 2,3 DPG (and not due to decreased 2,3-DPG concentration).Effect of 2-3 diphosphoglvcerete (2.3 PPG)o Another important factor which influences oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve is 2,3 DPG in RBC. DPG is an optional by-product of the glycolytic pathway. DPG binds with deoxygenated hemoglobin but not with oxygenated hemoglobin. Therefore raised DPG concentration releases oxygen from oxyhemoglobin by shifting the following reversible reaction to the right: -HbO2 + DPG - Hb - DPG + O2o One molecule of DPG binds with one mole of deoxyhemoglobin.o That is why in the presence of raised DPG concentration, less oxygen can combine with hemoglobin at a given PO2. Hence an increase in DPG concentration shifts the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right. Thus 2,3 DPG causes delivery (unloading) of O2 to the tissues.o Factors which increases 2,3 DPG level and therefore lower the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin (right shift of O2 dissociation curve and increased delivery of oxygen to tissues) are : -# Hypoxia# High altitude# Alkalosis# Exercise# Pregnancy# Anemia# Hormones (thyroid, GH, androgen)# Cyanotic congenital heart disease# Chemical agents (Inosine, Pyruvate, PEP, phosphate, dihydroxyacetone)o Factors which decrease 2,3 DPG levels and therefore increase oxygen a ffinity of hemoglobin (left shift of O2 dissociation curve and decreased delivery' of O2 to the tissues) are : - Stored blood, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF).o Fetal hemoglobin has considerably less afinity for 2,3 - DPG than does adult hemoglobin therefore fetal hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin. In human blood, the affinity of fetal hemoglobin for 2,3-DPG is only about 40% that of adult hemoglobin. This makes fetal hemoglobin behave as if 2,3-DPG levels are low. Therefore, the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left. Although fetal red cells do contain 2,3 DPG, the poor binding of 2,3-DPG by fetal hemoglobin is an important factor in facilitating transport of oxygen across the placenta from mother to fetus. On the maternal side of the placenta, the reduction of hemoglobin effectively shifts the curve to the right, increasing oxygen release. On the fetal side, 2,3-DPG does not interfere with the affinity' of fetal hemoglobin for oxygen and thus the uptake of oxygen by fetal erythrocytes.",B

Dengue fever Dengue fever is caused by arboviruses (at least 4 serotypes have been recognized) It is transmitted by Aedes (Aedes aegypti is the main vector). The reservoir of infection is both man and mosquito. The transmission cycle is Man-mosquito-man Dengue fever occurs both epidemically and endemically. Epidemics stas in rainy season and are usually explosive. Aedes mosquito becomes infective by feeding on a patient from the day before onset to the 5th day of illness. Various manifestations of Dengue infection A) Classical dengue fever - Also known as break bone fever Incubation period 2-7 days (3-10 days -4 Park) Onset is sudden with chills and fever. Fever is usually between 39degc and 40degc temperature returns to normal after 5-6 days or subside on about the 3rd day and rise again after 5-8 days after onset (saddle back fever). Rashes appear in 80% of cases during remission or during second febrile phase. The rash lasts for 2 hours to several days and may be followed by desquamation. B) Dengue Hemorrhagic fever (DHF)- It is a severe form of dengue fever caused by infection with more than one dengue virus. The severe illness is thought to be due to double infection with more than one dengue virus. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is believed to result from reinfection with a virus of different serotype ( due to enhancing antibodies) DHF usally occurs after sequential infection with any two of the four serotypes of dengue virus.

The most appropriate treatment is,Radical excision,Microdochectomy,Radical mastectomy,Biopsy to rule out carcinoma,"Discharges from the nipple Discharge can occur from one or more lactiferous ducts. Management depends on the presence of blood in the discharge or discharge from a single duct. Treatment Treatment must firstly be to exclude a carcinoma by occult blood test and cytology. Simple reassurance may then be sufficient but, if the discharge is proving intolerable, an operation to remove the affected duct or ducts can be performed (microdochectomy). MICRODOCHECTOMY It is impoant not to express the blood before the operation as it may then be difficult to identify the duct in theatre. A lacrimal probe or length of stiff nylon suture is inseed into the duct from which the discharge is emerging. A tennis racquet incision can be made to encompass the entire duct or a periareolar incision used and the nipple flap dissected to reach the duct. The duct is then excised. A papilloma is nearly always situated within 4-5cm of the nipple orifice. Ductoscopy (inspection of the internal structure of the duct system) using microendoscopes is technically feasible but generally disappointing.

Essential fatty acid is -,Oleic acid,Stearic acid,Linoleic acid,Cervonic acid,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Linoleic acid o The three polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), namely, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid are called essential fatty acids.o They are called essential fatty acids because human beings require these fatty acids but cannot synthesize them,o Humans lack the enzymes to introduce double bonds at carbon atom beyond C9 in the fatty acid chain,o Hence, human cannot synthesize linolenic acid and linolenic acid having double bonds beyond C9.o Arachidonic acid can be synthesized from linoleic acid. Therefore, in deficiency of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid also becomes essential fatty acids.o Therefore linoleic acid is the most important essential fatty acid as it serves as a basis for the production of other EFA.",C

"In Na+-K+ ATPase, K+ binds onto",Extracellular binding site on b subunit,Intracellular binding site on b subunit,Extracellular binding site on a subunit,Intracellular binding site on a subunit,"The carrier protein is a complex of two separate globular proteins--a larger one called the a subunit, with a molecular weight of about 100,000, and asmaller one called the b subunit, with a molecular weight of about 55,000. The function of the smaller protein is not known (except that it might anchor the protein complex in the lipid membrane), the larger protein has three specific features that are impoant for the functioning of the pump:1. It has three binding sites for sodium ions on the poion of the protein that protrudes to the inside of the cell.2. It has two binding sites for potassium ions on the outside.3. The inside poion of this protein near the sodium binding sites has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity.When two potassium ions bind to the outside of the carrier protein and three sodium ions bind on the inside, the ATPase function of the protein becomes activated. Activation of the ATPase function leads to cleavage of one molecule of ATP, splitting it to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and liberating a high-energy phosphate bond of energy. This liberated energy is then believed to cause a chemical and conformational change in the protein carrier molecule, extruding the three sodium ions to the outside and the two potassium ions to the inside.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 4; Transpo of Substances Through Cell Membranes",C

RE can produce 'sticky' and 'blunt1 ends.# Analysis of RFLP variation is an important tool in genomic mapping, localization of genetic disease, determination of risk for a disease, genetic fingerprinting, and paternity testing.# It is the sequence that makes DNA different, obtained from different sources, and RFLP analysis is a technique that can identify differences in the sequence (when they occur in a restriction site).# The basic technique for detecting RFLPs involves fragmenting a sample of DNA by restriction enzymes, which can recognize and cut DNA wherever a specific short sequence occurs, by a process known as a restriction digest. The resulting DNA fragments are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labelled DNA probe then determines the size of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. An RFLP occurs when the size of a detected fragment varies between individuals. Each fragment size is considered an allele, and can be used in genetic analysis.Table (Harrison 17th/406): Methods Used for the Detection of MutationsMathodPrincipleType of Mutation DetextedCommonly Used TechniquesCytogeneticanalysisUnique visual appearance of various chromosomesNumerical or structural abnormalities in chromosomesFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)Hybridization to chromosomes with fluonescently labeled probesNumerical or structural abnormalities in chromosomesSouthern blotHybridization with genomic probe or cDNA probe after digestion of high molecular DNALarge deletion, insertion, rearrangement, expansions of triplet repeat, amplification MathodPrincipleType of Mutation DetctedCommonly Used TechniquesPolymerase chain reaction (PCR)Amplification of DNAsegmentExpansion of triplet repeats, variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), gene rearrangements, translocations; prepare DNA for other mutation methodsReverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)QReverse transcription, amplification of DNA segment - absence or reduction of mRNA transcriptionAnalyze expressed mRNA (cDNA) sequence; detect loss of expressionDNA sequencingDirect sequencing of PCR productsPoint mutations, small deletions and insertions Sequencing of DNA segments cloned into plasmid vectors Restriction fragment polymorphism [RFLP) QDetection of altered restriction pattern of genomic DNA (Southern blot) or PCR productsPoint mutations, small deletions and inser - tionsQ",A

Intensity of sensory stimulation is directly related to:,Duration of action potential (AP),Frequency of AP,Amplitude of AP,All of the above.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. ""Frequency of Action potential There are two methods by which brain detects the intensity of a sensory stimulus (differentiates between two stimuli of different intensities)by variation in the frequency of the action potentials generated by the stimulus in a given receptor.By variation in the number of receptors activated by the stimulus.Also knowWeber - Fechner law*It states that the magnitude of the sensation felt in proportionate to the log of intensity of the stimulus*.Example - A person holding 30 grams weight in his hand can barely detect a 1 gm rise in weight (a rise than 1 gm would not be detectable). But when he holds 300 gm of weighty he can rarely detect a 10 gm increase in weight (a rise less than 10 gm would not be detectable to him. So a 300 gm wt. and (Say) 307 gm of weights would appear same to him.)This is expressed mathematically asInterpreted signal strength = Log x stimulus intensity + constant",B

A child attending classes in a preschool is noted by his teacher to have several skin lesions on his arms. The lesions are pustular in appearance and some have broken down and are covered with a yellow crust. Which of the following protects the most likely etiologic agent of this child's infection from phagocytosis and provides serologic specificity?,Erythrogenic toxin,Hyaluronic acid,Lipoteichoic acid,M protein,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A Streptococcus (GAS), produces a number of virulence factors. The M protein (d) is the organism's most important antiphagocytic factor, and it conveys serologic specificity-over 100 serotypes are now known. In the early stages of growth, the bacteria have hyaluronic acid (b) capsules. This capsule (similar to human hyaluronic acid structure) is rapidly destroyed by the organism's own hyaluronidase. Also known as spreading factor, hyaluronidase plays a role in GAS cellulitis. Erythrogenic toxin (a) is a superantigen produced by some strain of GAS lysogenized by a bacteriophage carrying the toxin gene; it causes the rash of scarlet fever. A second superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic toxin, causes streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Streptolysin O (e) an oxygen-labile hemolysin is useful for identification of the organism and is antigenic so antistreptolysin antibodies can be used to diagnosis rheumatic fever, a sequelae of GAS infection.

Which is not true about secondary immunoglobulin response is: March 2011,Predominance of IgG,Takes 5 days to appear,Depends on immunologic memory,May be repeated in physiological limits,"Ans. B: Takes 5 days to appear The secondary response is prompt, powerful and prolonged, with a shoer or negligible lag phase and much higher level of antibodies that lasts for long period (Antibody is predominantly IgG) Immune response The first time a harmful antigen is encountered in the body it triggers the primary immune response. Antibody formed in primary immune response is predominantly IgM For many days after an antigen has entered the body there are no antibodies produced in the bloodstream to fight the antigen. This lag period can last for as little as 10 days or as long as 4 weeks. During the lag phase, B-lymphocytes are preparing to become active so they can sta to divide and begin to produce antibodies. Soon antibodies specific for the harmful antigen begin to appear in the bloodstream and increase until they level off and then slowly decrease until the antibodies are barley detectable. Slowly as the primary immune response progresses, the quality of antibodies improves. The antibodies that are more effective in killing the invading antigens become predominant. The secondary immune response occurs after an antigen that has already been encountered reappears. For example, if someone had recovered from the flu and later encounters the same strain of that virus antibodies that were made specifically for that antigen will rise dramatically with almost no lag period. Also after the antigen has been killed the antibodies fall even slower than they did in the primary immune response. The most dominant antibodies are what signals the other immune cells to attack, thus the immune system is said to memory response.",B
Erythropoietin is secreted by -,Pituitary,Lung,Spleen,Kidney,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., KidneyErvthropoitino Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein hormone which stimulate erythrocyte production. Erythropoietin increases the number of erythropoietin sensitive committed stem cells in the bone marrow that are converted to red blood cells precursors and subsequently to mature erythrocytes. In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis.o In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatoevtes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Certain tumors also produce erythropoietin, .e.g., Renal cell carcinoma. Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma.o The most important stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines via b-adrenergic mechanism.o Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production. Progesterone increase the effect of erythropoietin by enhancing the effect of placental lactogen and by antagonizing the effect of estrogen.",D

Which one of the following condition is true of Barret oesophagus,A biopsy will show a histological finding of columnar to squamous metaplasia,It is known precursor of carcinoma of the stomach,The most common location6id proximal third of +e oesophagus,It is a known precursor of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus,"Barrett Esophagus Barrett esophagus is a complication of chronic GERD that is characterized by intestinal metaplasia within the esophageal squamous mucosa. The incidence of Barrett esophagus is rising, and it is estimated to occur in as many as 10% of individuals with symptomatic GERD. Barrett esophagus is most common in white males and typically presents between 40 and 60 years of age. The greatest concern in Barrett esophagus is that it confers an increased risk of esoph- ageal adenocarcinoma. Genomic sequencing of biopsies involved by Barrett esophagus has revealed the presence of mutations that are shared with esophageal adenocarci- noma, in keeping with the idea that Barrett esophagus is a precursor lesion to cancer. Potentially oncogenic mutations are more numerous when biopsies demonstrate dysplasia, which is detected in 0.2% to 2% of persons with Barrett esophagus each year. The presence of dysplasia, a prein- vasive change, is associated with prolonged symptoms, longer segment length, increased patient age, and Caucasian race. Although the vast majority of esophageal adenocar- cinomas are associated with Barrett esophagus, it is impor- tant to remember that most individuals with Barrett esophagus do not develop esophageal tumors.",D

(Ref. Cell & Molecular Biology by DeRobertis, 7th /pg. 348)CHROMOSOMES# The entire genetic information contained in the genes is packaged in the chromosomes. All the somatic cells of an individual organism contain the same number of chromosomes.# Genes are arranged linearly on the chromosomes and their positions on the normal chromosome in relation to other genes on same chromosome are fixed. This position is called locus.# Genes occupying the same locus on a pair of chromosomes are called alleles.Structure of chromosomes:# Chromosomes are long structures with a constriction at point along its length-called centromere.# The ends of the chromosomes are called telomeres. These give stability to the chromosome. In the absence of telomeres, chromosomes become unstable and tend to break until joined to a telomere. An enzyme telomerase maintains the length of the telomeric sequences. Cell aging is controlled by telomerase enzyme. (AI 2003)# It has the structure for the attachment of chromosome to the spindle fibers called the Kinetochore.Depending on the location of the centromere on the chromosome, they are classified as: Type of chromosomeComments1.MetacentricThe centromere is in the centre of the chromosome so that the chromosome has two equal arms.2.Sub-metacentricCentromeres are away from the center so that the arms are unequal in size (one arm shorter than other).3.TelocentricCentromere is at the extreme end of replicating chromosome, so that chromosome consists of only one arm.4.AcrocentricCentromere is almost at the tip (one end) of the chromosome, so that one arm is much longer than other.

A 19-year-old athlete has been vigorously working on the tracks and begins to feel slightly light-headed from hypoglycemia. He drinks a can of soft drinks and is aware of the competition for the glucose to be stored in his liver as glycogen versus used as energy in his muscles. What is the best explanation regarding the fate of the glucose in the soft drink?,The lower Km of hexokinase versus the Km of glucokinase will tilt the glucose toward glycolysis.,"The bolus of glucose the soda will lead to a higher glucose level, inducing storage of the glucose into glycogen in the liver.","The muscle is using high levels of glucose, leading to an increased level of glucose 6-phosphate thus inhibiting glucokinase.",The glucose will be equally used by muscle for metabolism and liver for glycogen storage.,"The Michaelis constant (Km) is a means of characterising an enzyme's affinity for a substrate. The Km in an enzymatic reaction is the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half its maximum speed. Thus, a low Km value means that the enzyme has a high affinity for the substrate (as a ""little"" substrate is enough to run the reaction at half its max speed). Hexokinase has a low Km for glucose, and in the liver is saturated and acting at a constant rate under all normal conditions. Glucokinase has a considerably higher Km (lower affinity) for glucose, so that its activity increases with increases in the concentration of glucose in the hepatic poal vein. It promotes hepatic uptake of large amounts of glucose after a carbohydrate meal. It is absent from the liver of ruminants, which have little glucose entering the poal circulation from the intestines. Hexokinase is inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate and is most active with low levels of glucose 6-phosphate. Glucokinase found in the liver has a high Km for glucose and is very active after a meal. The glucose in the soft drink would likely be used for ATP production. At normal systemic-blood glucose concentrations (4.5-5.5 mmol/L), the liver is a net producer of glucose. However, as the glucose level rises, the output of glucose ceases, and there is a net uptake. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 20. Gluconeogenesis & the Control of Blood Glucose. In D.A.

Difference between total cations and anions is called-,Cation gap,Anion gap,Equivalent concentration,Molar concentration,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Anion gap ""The anion gap is calculated by substracting the serum concentration of anions (Chloride and bicarbonates) from the concentration of cations (Na+ & K+)""Anion gap* The plasma anion gap is the total concentration of anions, excluding HCO3 and Cl, that are present in the plasma. It therefore represents the total plasma concentration of anions like albumin, phosphates, sulfates, and other organic acids.* Since the molar concentration of plasma anions and cations must be equal, the plasma anion gap can be calculated by substracting concentration of HCO3 and Cl from the total concentration of cations.* Since Na+ is the predominant cation in plasma (concentration of K+, Ca+2 and Mg+2 being negligible in comparison), the formula for anion gap can be wirtten as: -Plasma anion gap = Plasma Na+ - (Plasma HCO3 + Plasma Cl)* The normal value of anion gap is 12 +- 2 mEq/L. Plasma albumin accounts for most of the anion gap.* The urine anion gap provides an indirect way of estimating the urinary NH4+. It is given by the formula.Urine anion gap = Urinary Na+ + Urinary K+ - Urinary Cl* It assumes that the major cations in urine are Na+, K+, and NH4 while the major anion is only Cl since urinary HCO3 is zero at pH more than 6.5. Normally, the urinary anion gap is negative and gives the urinary NH4+ concentration. It becomes zero if renal ammonium production is defective and becomes positive in bicarbonaturia.",B

Synthesis of an immunoglobulin in membrane bound or secretory form is determined by -,One turn to two turn joining rule,Class switching,Differential RNA processing,Allelic exclusion,"A virgin B-cell bears IgM (and possibly IgD) in its membrane; following stimulation it begins to secrete IgM into its surrounding environment. The difference between the two forms of IgM is entirely at the C-terminus. The ms (secreted) chain has a hydrophilic peptide additional to the Cm4 domain and the mm (membrane-bound) chain has a hydrophobic peptide replacing the former which anchors the molecule into the membrane. The membrane-bound form of IgM is also incapable of associating with J-chain and forming its normal pentameric structure; membrane IgM, therefore, exists exclusively in monomeric form (H2L2), also known as IgMS or ""sub-unit"" IgM. Difference arises because the ms and mm chains are translated from distinct mRNA molecules that are generated by alternative splicing and/or termination points of transcripts from a single rearranged m gene. Similar differences exist for secreted versus membrane-bound forms of IgG, IgA and IgE heavy chains. The immunoglobulin gene encodes both membrane-associated and secreted proteins through alternative RNA processing reactions. The regulatory mechanisms governing alternative RNA processing involves gene coding for competing cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions and the relative use of the two pathways is differentially regulated between B cells and plasma cells. General cleavage-polyadenylation and RNA splicing reactions are both altered during B cell maturation to affect immunoglobulin expression. Not the others options due to following points... Each B cell is known to express a unique combination of immunoglobulin chains, where each V-J and V-D-J recombination is different. A single productive rearrangement of each type occurs in a given lymphocyte to produce one light and one heavy chain gene. Because each event involves the expression of genes of only one homologous chromosome, the alleles on the other homologous chromosome is not expressed in this same cell. This is called allelic exclusion. Assembly of the light and heavy chains during reaarangement of the variable region of immunoglobulins involves the mechanism indicated by the presence of conserved sequences at the boundaries of all germ line segments that paicipate in joining reactions. Each conserved sequence consist of a palindromic hepatamer called recombination signal sequences (RSS). These act as facilitators of recombination process. These sequences correspond to one or two turns of DNA helix accordingly called one turn or two turn signal sequences Class switching is a process by which on antigenic stimulation, the H chain VDJ unit can join any constant heavy gene segment and express the paicular antibody class.

Which of the following vitamins would MOST likely become deficient in a person who develops a completely carnivorous lifestyle?,Thiamine,Niacin,Cobalamin,Vitamin C,"Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is found in fresh fruits and vegetables. Deficiency of ascorbic acid produces scurvy, the ""sailor's disease."" Ascorbic acid is necessary for the hydroxylation of proline to hydroxyproline in collagen, a process required in the formation and maintenance of connective tissue. The failure of mesenchymal cells to form collagen causes the skeletal, dental, and connective tissue deterioration seen in scurvy. Thiamine, niacin, cobalamin, and pantothenic acid can all be obtained from fish or meat products. The nomenclature of vitamins began by classifying fat-soluble vitamins as A (followed by subsequent letters of the alphabet such as D, E, and K) and water-soluble vitamins as B. Components of the B vitamin fraction were then given subscripts, e.g., thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin , pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), and cobalamin (B12).

"A 67-year-old man with an 18-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents for a routine physical examination. His temperature is 36.9 C (98.5 F), his blood pressure is 158/98 mm Hg and his pulse is 82/minute and regular. On examination, the physician notes a non tender, pulsatile, mass in the mid-abdomen. A plain abdominal x-ray film with the patient in the lateral position reveals spotty calcification of a markedly dilated abdominal aoic walI. Which of the following physiologic observations helps to account for the fact that 75% of the aneurysms of this patient's type are found in the abdomen and only 25% principally involve the thorax?",Diastolic pressure is greater in the abdominal aoa in the supine position,Negative intrathoracic pressure reduces aoic wall tension in the thorax,The average blood flow in the abdominal aoa is greater than that in the thoracic aoa,The average blood pressure in the abdominal aoa is higher than that in the thoracic aoa,"Increased blood pressure is a strong risk factor for atherosclerosis, and humans pay a price for their erect sitting and standing postures. In these postures, the abdominal aoa experiences the weight of a column of blood added to the pressure produced by the hea. In the supine posture, the pressures in the thoracic and abdominal aoa are similar. So, if an average daily pressure is taken, the abdominal aoa tends to have a significantly higher pressure than does the thoracic aoa. Diastolic pressure is actually greater in the thoracic aoa compared to the abdominal aoa in the supine position. However, the systolic blood pressure is greater in the abdominal aoa. A negative intrathoracic pressure would tend to increase transmural pressure across the wall of the thoracic aoa, and thereby increase wall tension and promote the development of aneurysms. Blood flow in the abdominal aoa is less than that in the thoracic aoa, because some blood leaves the aoa through its thoracic branches. Ref: Creager M.A., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 248.

This organism is the tick-transmitted spirochete that causes Lyme disease. The tick, Ixodes dammini, can infect both the white-footed mouse and large mammals such as deer during its life cycle, making them reservoirs. The tick itself is a reservoir, however, since it acquires the disease through transovarial passage of the organism. Together, these factors make Lyme disease an endemic infection with little hope for eradication. Borrelia burgdorferi is not resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants. The spirochete can be successfully treated with penicillins, tetracycline, and ceftriaxone. Borrelia burgdorferi is a delicate spirochete and is not resistant to environmental stresses. Brill-Zinsser disease is the reactivation of epidemic typhus infection caused by Rickettsia prowazekii. It can occur many years after an infection that was not treated with antibiotics.

Affinity for oxygen in case of HbF is more than that of HbA, i.e., it can take more oxygen than HbA at low oxygen pressure due to poor binding of 2,3 DPG by the gamma polypeptide chain.2. Because of this, movement of oxygen from maternal to fetal circulation is facilitated.3. One molecule of DPG is bound per hemoglobin tetramer, in its central cavity, in the T-form, when the space between the H-helices of the beta chains is just wide enough to accommodate it1. Carbon monoxide reversibly binds hemoglobin to one of the oxygen binding sites and conves the molecule into carboxyhemoglobin (CoHb). CoHb binds the three remaining sites to oxygen;2. However, the conformation of the molecule is such that it does not release the bound oxygen. The oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, therefore, remains normal, yet the oxygen cannot be off-loaded in peripheral tissues. For this reason, CoHb has the effect of shifting the oxygen dissociative curve to Left.3. Also, CO has 240 times more affinity for Hb than 02Refer: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry By S Ramakrishnan.

Synthesis of various enzymes that are required in S phase, mainly those needed for DNA replication.> S phase: Ensuing S phase starts when DNA synthesis commences; when it is complete, all of the chromosomes have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) chromatids. Rates of RNA transcription and protein synthesis are very low during this phase. An exception to this is histone production, most of which occurs during the S phase.> G2 phase Significant protein synthesis occurs during this phase, mainly involving the production of microtubules, which are required during the process of mitosis. Inhibition of protein synthesis during G2 phase prevents the cell from undergoing mitosis.> GO phase: ""post-mitotic"" is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells.

Somatic innervation to the pelvic organs is -,Greater splanchnic nerve,Lesser splanchnic nerve,Pudendal nerve,Ilioinguinal nerve,"Ans. C. Pudendal nervea. Pudendal nerve (in the pelvis)The pudendal nerve arises from the ventral divisions of the second, third and fourth sacral ventral rami and is formed just above the superior border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the upper fibres of ischiococcygeus. It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen between piriformis and ischiococcygeus, enters the gluteal region and crosses the sacrospinous ligament close to its attachment to the ischial spine, where it lies medial to the internal pudendal vessels. It accompanies the internal pudendal artery through the lesser sciatic foramen into the pudendal (Alcock's) canal on the lateral wall of the ischio-anal fossa. In the posterior part of the canal it gives rise to the inferior rectal nerve, the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.b. Inferior rectal nerveThe inferior rectal nerve runs through the medial wall of the pudendal canal with the inferior rectal vessels. It crosses the ischio-anal fossa to supply the external anal sphincter, the lining of the lower part of the anal canal, and the circumanal skin. It frequently breaks into terminal branches just before reaching the lateral border of the sphincter. Its cutaneous branches distributed around the anus overlap the cutaneous branches of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and of the scrotal or labial nerves. The inferior rectal nerve occasionally arises directly from the sacral plexus and crosses the sacrospinous ligament or reconnects with the pudendal nerve. In females, the inferior rectal nerve may supply sensory branches to the lower part of the vagina.c. Perineal nerveThe perineal nerve is the inferior and larger terminal branch of the pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal. It runs forwards below the internal pudendal artery and accompanies the perineal artery, dividing into posterior scrotal or labial and muscular branches. The posterior scrotal or labial nerves are usually double and have medial and lateral branches which run over the perineal membrane and pass forwards in the lateral part of the urogenital triangle with the scrotal or labial branches of the perineal artery. They supply the skin of the scrotum or labia majora, overlapping the distribution of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous and inferior rectal nerves. In females, the posterior labial branches also supply sensory fibres to the skin of the lower vagina.Muscular branches arise directly from the pudendal nerve to supply the superficial transverse perinei, bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, deep transverse perinei, sphincter urethrae and the anterior parts of the external anal sphincter and levator ani. In males, a nerve to the bulb of the urethra leaves the nerve to the bulbospongiosus, pierces this muscle to supply the corpus spongiosum penis and ends in the urethral mucosa.d. Dorsal nerve of the penis or clitorisThe dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris runs anteriorly above the internal pudendal artery along the ischiopubic ramus deep to the perineal membrane. It supplies the corpus cavernosum and accompanies the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris between the layers of the suspensory ligament. In males, the dorsal nerve of the penis runs on the dorsum of the penis to end in the glans. In females the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is very small.",C

The wave shows a rise in pressure during inspiration and a fall during expiration. These waves are produced due to change in vagal and sympathetic activity in different phases of respiration. The vasomotor centre is stimulated during inspiration by the irradiation of impulses from the inspiratory centres which causes rise in blood pressure. Also during inspiration, the intrathoracic pressure becomes more negative, therefore venous return increases, which in turn increases cardiac output and BP.Also Know* Traube semilunar space: a crescentic space about 12 cm wide, just above the costal margin.* Traube sign: a double sound or murmur heard in auscultation over arteries in significant aortic regurgitation.",A

vitamin B12 and intrinsic factor binding take place in which pa of intestine?,Stomach,Duodenum,Ileum,Jejunem,"Dietary vitamin B12 is normally bound to proteins in food. Pepsin and gastric acid in the stomach degrade these food proteins and release vitamin B12. The free Vitamin B12 then binds to a salivary glycoprotein called haptocorrin (R-binder). In the alkaline pH of the duodenum, pancreatic proteases to degrade the haptocorrin and Vitamin B12 is released again. It then binds tightly to intrinsic factor (IF), a glycoprotein secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach and this binding takes place in the duodenum. The IF-Vitamin B12 complex reaches the terminal ileum and attaches to a receptor on the enterocyte, from where it is absorbed. Vitamin B12 is transpoed in the blood bound to a carrier protein called transcobalamin II and delivered to the peripheral tissues Reference: Harpers illustrated biochemistry 30th edition",B

A person with normal lung compliance and increased airway resistance. What is the most economical way of breathing?,Rapid and deep,Rapid and shallow,Slow and deep,Slow and shallow,"Airway resistance is approximately 1-1.5 cm H2O/L/s in adults. The reciprocal of resistance is airway conductance. Airway resistance in patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis is increased. Airway resistance in patients with emphysema is also increased because of loss of elastic tissue that normally suppos and keeps open smaller nonrigid airways. During quiet inspiration and expiration there is probably little change in airway resistance because the airways become longer as well as wider. Ref: DePalo V.A., McCool F.D. (2003). Chapter 1.

This is an example of:,Competitive inhibition,Non-competitive inhibition,Both,None,"Competitive Inhibitors: 

In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor (I) binds to the substrate-binding portion of the active site thereby blocking access by the substrate. 
The structures of most classic competitive inhibitors, therefore, tend to resemble the structure of a substrate, and thus are termed substrate analogs. 
Inhibition of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase by malonate illustrates competitive inhibition by a substrate analog.

Key Concept:
Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the same site that the substrate would normally occupy and, therefore, competes with the substrate for that site.

Regarding Golgi tendon organ true is,Senses dynamic length of muscle,Involved in reciprocal innervation,a-motor neuron stimulation,Senses muscle tension,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. senses muscle tensionThe Golgi Tendon organ is an encapsulated sensory receptor through which muscle tendon fibres pass and it is stimulated by increased tension in the connecting muscle. So basically detects muscle tension as reflected by the tension in itself. Whereas muscle spindle (other sensory receptor) detects muscle length and changes in muscle length.Golgi tendon organ - detects muscle tensionMuscle spindle - detects muscle length and changes in muscle length.Muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organ both receptors are important component of intrinsic muscle control.Muscle spindle acts through muscle stretch reflex. Whenever a muscle is stretched suddenly, excitation of the spindles cause reflex contraction of the large skeletal muscle fibres of stretched muscle thus maintain the muscle length & stabilize body positions during tense motor action. Stretch reflex also prevents oscillations & jerkiness of body movements.However when the tension in muscle becomes great enough, contraction suddenly ceases and the muscle relaxes. This relaxation in response to strong stretch is called the inverse stretch reflex, autogenic inhibition or lengthening reaction. The receptor for this reflex is in the Golgi tendon organ. This is a protective mechanism to prevent tearing of the muscle or avulsion of the tendon from its attachment to the bone.Reciprocal innervation is the phenomenon in which relaxation of antagonistic muscles occur when a stretch reflex occurs and Golgi bottle neurons (inhibitory intetneuron) are involved in this phenomenon.a-motor neurons are anterior motor neuron (located in ant. horn of spinal cord) and when stimulated cause contraction of muscle fibres. Golgi tendon organs when stimulated cause a -motor neuron inhibition (Muscle spindle stimulation causes a-motor neuron excitation)",D

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein transport cholesterol from HDL to -,VLDL,IDL,LDL,Chylomicrons,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., VLDLo Cholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).o The HDL particles are referred to as scavengers because their primary role is to remove free (unesterified) cholesterol from the extrahepatic tissues.o HDL particles transport cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to liver (i.e. reverse cholesterol transport) which is then excreted through bile.Reverse cholesterol transporto All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion. This is facilitated by HDL and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-A, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A , activates LCAT.o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liverIndirect pathwayCholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).Direct pathwayHDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR-BI).",A

The Hb-O2 dissociation curve is shifted to left by,Metabolic acidosis,Increased temperature,Increased PCO2,"Decreased 2, 3 DPG","2,3-BPG is very plentiful in red cells. It is formed from 3phosphoglyceraldehyde, which is a product of glycolysis the Embden-Meyerhof pathway (Figure 36-4). It is a highly charged anion that binds to the bchains of deoxyhemoglobin. One mole of deoxyhemoglobin binds 1 mol of 2,3-BPG. In effectHbO2 + 2,3-BPG =Hb - 2,3-BPG + O2In this equilibrium, an increase in the concentration of 2,3BPG shifts the reaction to the right, causing more O2 to be liberated. So decrease in 2,3 BPG shift the reaction to leftMetabolic acidosis (or nonrespiratory acidosis) occurs when strong acids are added to blood. If, for example, a large amount of acid is ingested (eg, aspirin overdose) this decrease in pH cause shift to the rightA rise in temperature shifts the curve to the rightThe pH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases so that when the PCO2 rises, the curve shifts to the rightRef: 23rd Edition of Ganong's Review of Medical Physiology 611,615",D

All of the following is true regarding HIV virus except: March 2010,Belongs to the subgroup lentivirus,Double stranded DNA virus,Characterised by the presence of reverse transcriptase enzyme,Acts on CD4 cells,"Ans. B: Double stranded DNA virus HIV belongs to the lentivirus subgroup of the family retroviridae. HIV is a spherical, enveloped virus. The genome is diploid, composed of two identical single-stranded, positive sense RNA copies. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) like many other viruses, stores its genetic information as RNA rather than as DNA (most other living things use DNA). In association with viral RNA is the reverse transcriptase enzyme which is a characteristic feature of retroviruses. When HIV enters a human cell, it releases its RNA, and an enzyme called reverse transcriptase makes a DNA copy of the HIV RNA. The resulting HIV DNA is integrated into the infected cell's DNA. This process is the reverse of that used by human cells, which make an RNA copy of DNA. Thus, HIV is called a retrovirus, referring to the reversed (backward) process. Other RNA viruses (such as polio, influenza, or measles), unlike retroviruses, do not make DNA copies after they invade cells. They simply make RNA copies of their original RNA. Some types of white blood cells called CD4+ lymphocytes HIV is highly mutable virus, unlike HTLV.",B

In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid stem cellsundergo apoptosis.In adults, about 85% of erythropoietin comes from the kidney (interstitial cells in peritubular capillary bed) and 15% from liver (Perivenous hepatocytes). Small amount is also produced in brain; and uterus and oviducts. Ceain tumors also produce erythropoietin, .e.g., Renal cell carcinoma, Hepatoma and cerebellar hemangioblastoma.The most impoant stimulus for erythropoietin secretion is hypoxia. Other stimulus that can increase its secretion are cobalt salts, androgens, alkalosis due to high altitude, and catecholamines f3-adrenergic mechanism.Pregnancy (due to placental lactogen), testosterone and prolactin increase the activity of erythropoietin. Estrogen inhibits utilization of erythropoietin by marrow cells and also impairs its production. Progesterone increase the effect of erythropoietin by enhancing the effect of placental lactogen and by antagonizing the effect of estrogen.",D
Number of ATPs formed per cycle of TCA -,10,24,8,30,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 10o Every turn of TCA cycle produces -i) 10 A TPs - If starting meterial is considered acetyl CoAii) 12 5 ATPs - It starting material is considered pyruvate.Energetics of TCA cycleso One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycleo Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as followsPathwayStep EnzymeSourceMethod of ATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationGlycolysis1 Hexokinase_ Minus 1Minus1Do3 Phosphofructokinase- Minus 1Minus1Do5 Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5x2 =53x2=6Do6 1,3-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do9 Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1 x 2 =21x2=2Pyruvate to Acetyl CoAPyruvateDehydrogenaseNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6TCA cycle3 Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do4 Alpha keto glutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do5 Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do6 Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5 x 2 =32x2= 4Do8 Malate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway9 minus 2=7 10 minus 2 = 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5= 6Generation in citric acid cycle=20= 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32= 38",A

Nerve of grass is related to?,Facial nerve,Glossopharyngeal nerve,Vagus nerve,Hypoglossal nerve,"In amphibians, the spinomedullary region of the central nervous system is compressed rostrocaudally because of the absence of a neck. In Ranid frogs, the hypoglossal nerve emerges as the ventral ramus of the second spinal nerve. The first spinal nerve, though present in tadpoles, is absent as a separate nerve in adults. To investigate the central nervous system components of the hypoglossal nerve in Rana pipiens, we soaked identified, transected branches of this nerve in horseradish peroxidase, a retrograde and anterograde tracer. We found that the hypoglossal nerve in these frogs originates from two efferent nuclei located in the caudal medulla, a medial and a lateral one. Afferent fibers, primarily from the tongue, are also found in the hypoglossal nerve and travel in the dorsolateral funiculus of the spinal cord, descending to thoracic levels of the cord. Efferents to intrinsic tongue muscles and the genioglossus muscle originate in the medial medullary nucleus. Efferents to the sternohyoid muscle, which travel through the hypoglossal nerve, originate in the lateral medullary nucleus. Since in mammals the sternohyoid muscle is innervated by the first spinal nerve, we have obtained experimental evidence that the hypoglossal nerve in Rana pipiens contains components of this spinal nerve.",B

Much of the body's energy requirements are normally supplied by serum glucose, but in starvation are supplied by both glucose and lipid-derived ketone bodies, including acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Glucose cannot be synthesized from lipids, and is instead made from amino acids such as alanine in the process of gluconeogenesis. Serum alanine drops dramatically in starvation, due to its conversion to glucose. Bicarbonate levels drop as the bicarbonate buffers the hydrogen ions produced by the ketone bodies.

Rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis,HMG CoA reductase,HMG CoA synthase,Mevalonate kinase,Squalene synthetase,"Regulation of Cholesterol SynthesisThe regulatory enzyme is HMG CoA reductase. Long-term regulation involves regulation of transcription of the gene for HMG CoA reductase. When sufficient cholesterol is present in the cell, transcription of the gene for HMG CoA reductase is suppressed, and cellular synthesis of cholesterol is decreased. When cholesterol in diet is low, synthesis is increased Cholesterol regulates the expression of HMG CoA reductase gene and LDLR (LDL receptor) gene. A specific recognition sequence known as the sterol regulatory element (SRE) is present in DNA. SRE binding by sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is essential for the transcription of these genes.

"In muscle, phosphorylase b is inactivated by",cAMP,Ca ions,Glucose,ATP,"In muscle, glycogen phosphorylase is activated by hormones and neural signals such as epinephrine, that stimulate phosphorylase kinase which phosphorylates the Ser-14 residue of the protein. A second messenger of a cyclic AMP (cAMP) increases in concentration due to epinephrine or glucagon, and this increase results in an enzyme cascade. Activation of phosphorylase kinase is due to increased concentrations of Ca2+ or by the phosphorylation by protein kinase A which is cAMP-dependent. The activated kinase, in turn, activates the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme by phosphorylating the Ser-14 residue. In the liver, glucagon is the primary signal which catalyzes this enzyme cascade. Glycogen phosphorylase b is not always inactive in muscle, as it can be activated allosterically by AMP. An increase in AMP concentration, which occurs during strenuous exercise, signals energy demand. AMP activates glycogen phosphorylase b by changing its conformation from a tense to a relaxed form. This relaxed form has similar enzymatic propeies as the phosphorylated enzyme. An increase in ATP concentration opposes this activation by displacing AMP from the nucleotide binding site, indicating sufficient energy stores.",D

It is not a disease but a problem of overuse, typically in boys of 12 to 14 years or girls 10 to 12 years of age. Very active boys and girls, usually during a growth spurt, are subject to the pain and swelling that occur at the site of attachment of the patellar ligament. The ligament can tear, resulting in a long period of healing following treatment. The medial femoral condyle is the area of attachment of the medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus of the knee joint. The posterior intercondylar eminence is the location of origin of the posterior cruciate ligament. The intercondylar eminence is a bony protuberance on the tibial plateau to which the cruciate ligaments and menisci are attached.

Horner syndrome is a lesion of the cervical sympathetic chain and sympathetic chain ganglia and is often a result of a Pancoast tumor, also known as a superior pulmonary sulcus tumor of the apex of the lung. The pupil, eyelid (superior tarsal muscle), and sweat glands are all under sympathetic nervous system control. The arch of the aorta and phrenic nerve are not part of the autonomic nervous system. The vagus nerve does carry parasympathetic fibers to muscles of the trachea, bronchi, digestive tract, and heart but not to any structure in the head and neck (laryngeal supply, and Von Ebner's glands in the tongue). A lesion to the phrenic nerve would result in paralysis of the diaphragm. The cardiopulmonary nerves are splanchnic nerves that are postganglionic and sympathetic. They originate in cervical and upper thoracic ganglia and innervate the thoracic cavity. The cardiopulmonary plexus is the autonomic supply to the heart.",A

"A 25-year-old male presented with severe urethritis. Over the past 2 days, he had developed fever and chills. Gram stain of the urethral discharge revealed the presence of gram-negative diplococci. The fever and chills are most likely due to the release of excessive amounts of which bacterial component?",Capsule,Exotoxin,Lipooligosaccharide (LOS),Opacity protein,"In Neisseria, the equivalent to LPS is Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) (c), which consists of lipid A and core oligosaccharide but lacks the O antigen. By triggering an inflammatory response, LOS causes most of the symptoms during Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. It activates the complement and stimulates the influx of phagocytes leading to the purulent discharge. LOS also contributes to serum resistance, which is an important feature of strains that causes systemic infection. Rapidly growing Neisseria releases outer membrane blebs, which contain LOS. Pili (e) mediate the initial attachment of N. gonorrhoeae to the surface of cervical or urethral epithelial cells. Pili are attached to the cell surface and are not released. The opacity protein (d), which provides N. gonorrhoeae colonies with their opaque appearance, is an outer membrane protein. It mediates binding of N. gonorrhoeae to epithelial cells and plays a role in cell-to-cell signaling. Similar to the pili, the opacity protein is a cell-associated factor. The capsule (a) surrounds pathogenic bacteria and provides them with antiphagocytic properties. However, N. gonorrhoeae is not encapsulated. Exotoxins (b), which are produced by some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, bind to specific receptors on the host cells and either alter the function of the host cell or destroy it.

"Factors affecting the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen are all of the following, EXCEPT:",pH,Temperature,"2,3-DPG",PCO2,"Three impoant conditions affect the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve: pH, the temperature, and the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The decrease in O2 affinity of hemoglobin when pH of blood falls is called the Bohr effect and is closely related to the fact that deoxyhemoglobin binds H+ more actively than does oxyhemoglobin. The pH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when the PCO2 rises. But CO2 does not change directly the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The greater affinity of fetal hemoglobin F than adult hemoglobin A for O2 facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the fetus. The cause of this greater affinity is the poor binding of 2,3-DPG by the g polypeptide chains that replace b chain in fetal hemoglobin. Some abnormal hemoglobins have high O2 affinity causes enough tissue hypoxia to stimulate increased red cell formation, with resulting polycythemia.

The following are major free radical scavengers except:,Superoxide dismutase,Catalase,Glutathione,Glutamine,"Ans. D. Glutamine. (Ref. Harper Biochemistry 28th/ pg. 483; Robbin's 8th/pg. 20, 21; Table 1-3; Fig. 1-20)A series of enzymes acts as free radical-scavenging systems and breaks down H202 include the following:# Superoxide dismutases (SODs) ----- Option A----- are found in many cell types and convert oxygen free radical to H2O2.# Catalase, ---- Option B---- present in peroxisomes, decomposes H2O2 (2H2O2 ? 02 + 2H2O).# Glutathione peroxidase---- Option C---- also protects against injury by catalyzing free radical breakdown(H2O2 + 2GSH? GSSG + 2H2O, or 2OH + 2GSH ? GSSG + 2H2O). The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of the oxidative state of the cell and is an important indicator of the cell's ability to detoxify ROS.REMOVAL OF FREE RADICALS:The principle free radicals (reactive Oxygen species) involved in cell injury are:# Superoxide dismutase (SOD):- in mitochondria- Converts O2 (superoxide) a H2O2.# Catalase- In peroxisomes- Converts H2O2 a H2O + O2.# Glutathione Peroxidase- in mitochondria.- Converts ""OH (hydroxyl radical) a H2O2 a H2O + O2.# Peroxiredoxins- Cause conversion to HNO2.- In cytosol and mitochondria.Antioxidants either block the initiation of free radical formation or inactivate (e.g., scavenge) free radicals. Examples:# Lipid-soluble vitamins E and A as well as Vit C and glutathione in the cytosol.# Iron and copper can catalyze the formation of ROS. The levels of these reactive metals are minimized by binding of the ions to storage and transport proteins (e.g., transferrin, ferritin, lactoferrin, and ceruloplasmin), thereby minimizing the formation of ROS.GENERATION OF FREE RADICALS:Inflammation, radiation, O2 toxicity, chemicals and reperfusion injury results in free radical formation, wherein following are mainly involved:# NADPH oxidase,# Oxidases in peroxisomes# Superoxide dismutase (SOD),# NO synthase and# Generation from H2O by hydrolysis .Free radicals may be generated within cells in several ways# The reduction-oxidation reactions that occur during normal metabolic processes.# Absorption of radiant energy (e.g., ultraviolet light, x-rays).# Rapid bursts of ROS are produced in activated leukocytes during inflammation. This occurs by a precisely controlled reaction in a plasma membrane multiprotein complex that uses NADPH oxidase for the redox reaction (i.e. oxidative burst in phagocytes).# Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals or drugs# Transition metals such as iron and copper# Nitric oxide (NO), an important chemical mediator generated by endothelial cells, macrophages, neurons, and other cell types, can act as a free radical and can also be converted to highly reactive peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-) as well as NO2 and NO3.",D
True about Type 1 diabetes mellitus,Decreased hepatic Glucose output,Increase glucose uptake,Increased lipolysis,Decreased protein catabolism,"* Patients may become hyperglycemic in poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus . The reason being - due to lack of insulin to stimulate uptake and utilization of glucose and also because in the absence of insulin which antagonize the actions of glucagon, there is increase in gluconeogenesis from amino acids in liver. * Lack of insulin (which antagonize the actions of glucagon) results in increased lipolysis in adipose tissue , and the resultant NEFAs become substrates for ketogenesis in the liver. There is defect in the utilization of ketone bodies in muscle because of lack of oxaloacetate . * In uncontrolled diabetes, ketosis is severe enough to cause pronounced acidosis (ketoacidosis). * Coma results from both the acidosis and also the considerably increased osmolality of extracellular fluid (mainly as a result of the hyperglycemia, and diuresis resulting from the excretion of glucose and ketone bodies in the urine).

Hepatic glycogen storage depletes in how much time during starvation -,18hrs,36 hrs,72hrs,48 hrs,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 18 hrs.o The primary role of altered metabolism during fasting is to maintain blood glucose through the synthesis (gluconeogenesis) and utilization of alternate substrates. Fasting-starvation is divided in three broad categories:-Initial stage Lasts upto 2-3 daysIntermediate stage Lasts upto 24 daysAdvanced stage:- begins after 24 days.Initial stage (First stage):- Liver glycogen is the first main provider of energy. But due to limited storage it can not last longe (16-18 hrs.). Further glucose is provided by gluconeogenesis by non-carbohydrate sources (muscle protein breakdown is increased which provides amino acids alanine and glutamine for gluconeogenesis). Utilization of alternate substrates (other than glucose) starts increasing in terminal period of this stage. Free fatty acids and ketone bodies start rising in this stage. Glycogen is completely depleted by the end of this stage. Blood glucose is slightly decreased.o The first priority of metabolism in starvation is to provide sufficient glucose to brain and other tissues that are absolutely dependent on glucose.o Liver glycogen provides glucose only for a short period. Whereas, gluconeogenesis plays an essential role in maintaining blood glucose during both short-term and prolonged starvation,o The substrate for gluconeogenesis are pyruvate, lactate (from RBCs and exercising muscles), glucogenic amino acids released from muscle protein breakdown, and glycerol released from lipolysis.Intermediate stage {Second stage):- Free fatty acids are the major substrates for energy production. They are derived from hydrolysis of fat (triglycerides) in adipose tissue. Ketone bodies serve as additional source of energy. As glycogen source is already depleted, the only source of glucose is increased gluconeogenesis. After sometimes muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy.Advanced stage {Third stage):- When fat stores are almost exhaused, energy requirment is obtained from breakdown of tissue proteins and protein stores once again enter in stage of rapid depletion.o Thus the second priority of metabolism in starvation is to preserve protein. This is accomplished by using fatty acids and ketone bodies in place of glucose as a fuel.",A

All are true about fatty acid synthesis except,Requires NADPH,Requires NADH,Occurs in cytosol,Intermediately linked with glycolysis,"DE NOVO SYNTHESIS OF FATTY ACIDS The process of fatty acid synthesis was studied by Feodor Lynen, who got Nobel prize in 1964. The pathway is referred to as Lynn&;s spiral. It is not a reversal of oxidation. Fatty acids are synthesized mainly by a de novo synthetic pathway operating in the cytoplasm. So it is referred to as extramitochondrial or cytoplasmic fatty acid synthase system. The major fatty acid synthesised de novo is palmitic acid, the 16C saturated fatty acid. The process occurs in liver, adipose tissue, kidney, brain, and mammary glands. Transpo of Acetyl CoA to Cytoplasm The staing material for de novo synthesis is acetyl CoA. It is formed inside the mitochondria from pyruvate. The inner membrane is not freely permeable to acetyl CoA. Hence the acetyl CoA units are delivered to the cytoplasm as citrate Citrate is transpoed from mitochondria by a tricarboxylic acid transpoer. In the cytoplasm, citrate is cleaved to oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. The enzyme is ATP citrate lyase. The oxaloacetate can return to the mitochondria as malate or pyruvate net reaction of de novo synthesis of fatty acid may be summarized as 1 Acetyl CoA + 7Malonyl CoA +14NADPH +14H+ - 1Palmitate + 7CO2 +14NADP+ + 8CoA+ 6H2O Fatty acid synthesis is not an exact reversal of beta-oxidation. Co-enzymes of Fatty Acid Synthesis An impoant point to remember is that the co-enzyme utilised for de novo synthesis is NADPH. The sources of NADPH for fatty acid synthesis are 1. Pentose Phosphate Pathway This is the main source. Tissues having active lipogenesis (liver, adipose tissue, lactating mammary gland) have an active HMP shunt pathway also. 2. Malic Enzyme Malate + NADP+ - Pyruvate + CO2 + NADPH + H+ The reaction also helps to transfer cytoplasmic oxaloacetate to the mitochondria. For every molecule of acetyl CoA delivered to the cytoplasm, one molecule of NADPH is formed and reducing equivalents are generated in cytoplasmRef: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 136-139",B

A hypeensive patient is found to have a paial obstruction of the renal aery due to an atherosclerotic plaque. The resultant decrease in blood flow causes the increased release of an enzyme from which of the following structures?,Afferent aerioles,Arcuate aeries,Juxtaglomerular cells,Kupffer cells,"The juxtaglomerular cells are in the wall of the afferent aeriole, close to the glomerulus. In response to decreased blood pressure, they secrete renin, an enzyme that conves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin conveing enzyme, found in the lungs, conves angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II increases peripheral vascular resistance directly and stimulates aldosterone secretion, resulting in increased reabsorption of sodium and water in the distal convoluted tubules. The afferent aeriole carries blood from the interlobular aeries to the glomerulus. Filtration of blood occurs in the glomerulus, with the filtrate entering Bowman's capsule. The arcuate aeries are branches of the interlobar aeries of the kidney. The arcuate aeries lie in the coicomedullary junction of the kidney and give rise to interlobular aeries, which enter the coex of the kidney and supply the glomeruli. Kupffer cells are found in the liver, along the sinusoids. They are phagocytic cells that are pa of the reticuloendothelial system.",C

The most common non-cardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is:,Decreased blood volume,Acute venous dilation,Obstruction of the large veins,"Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass","Decrease in Cardiac Output Caused by Non-cardiac Peripheral Factors—Decreased Venous Return. Anything that interferes with venous return also can lead to decreased cardiac output. Some of these factors are the following:
1. Decreased blood volume. By far, the most common non-cardiac peripheral factor that leads to decreased cardiac output is decreased blood volume, resulting most often from hemorrhage. It is clear why this condition decreases the cardiac output: Loss of blood decreases the filling of the vascular system to such a low level that there is not enough blood in the peripheral vessels to create peripheral vascular pressures high enough to push the blood back to the heart.
2. Acute venous dilation. On some occasions, the peripheral veins become acutely vasodilated. This results most often when the sympathetic nervous system suddenly becomes inactive. For instance, fainting often results from sudden loss of sympathetic nervous system activity, which causes the peripheral capacitative vessels, especially the veins, to dilate markedly. This decreases the filling pressure of the vascular system because the blood volume can no longer create adequate pressure in the now flaccid peripheral blood vessels. As a result, the blood “pools” in the vessels and does not return to the heart.
3. Obstruction of the large veins. On rare occasions, the large veins leading into the heart become obstructed, so the blood in the peripheral vessels cannot flow back into the heart. Consequently, the cardiac output falls markedly.
4. Decreased tissue mass, especially decreased skeletal muscle mass. With normal aging or with prolonged periods of physical inactivity, there is usually a reduction in the size of the skeletal muscles. This, in turn, decreases the total oxygen consumption and blood flow needs of the muscles, resulting in decrease in skeletal muscle blood flow and cardiac output.
5. Decreased metabolic rate of the tissues. If tissue metabolic rate is reduced, such as occurs in skeletal muscle during prolonged bed rest, the oxygen consumption and nutrition needs of the tissues will also be lower. This decreases blood flow to the tissues, resulting in reduced cardiac output. Other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, may also reduce metabolic rate and therefore tissue blood flow and cardiac output.",A

"Separation of first polar body occurs at the time of:September 2007, March 2012",Feilization,Ovulation,Implantation,Menstruation,"Ans. B: OvulationAsymmetrical cell division (cytokinesis) leads to the production of polar bodies during oogenesis. To conserve nutrients, the majority of cytoplasm is segregated into either the secondary oocyte and, or ovum, during meiosis I or meiosis II, respectively.The remaining daughter cells generated from the meiotic events contain relatively little cytoplasm and are referred to as polar bodies. Eventually, the polar bodies degenerate.There may be one or two polar bodies in the ovum. The first polar body is one of the two products in the first stage of meiosis, just before ovulation and is considered diploid, with 23 duplicated chromosomes. The second polar body is haploid, with 23 unduplicated chromosomes and is produced only when a sperm penetrates the oocyte.",B

"On a return visit after receiving a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia, a 35- year-old woman reports sensations of early satiety and discomfort in the epigastric region after a meal. These symptoms are most likely a result of:",Malfunction of adaptive relaxation in the gastric reservoir,Elevated frequency of contractions in the antral pump,An incompetent lower esophageal sphincter,Premature onset of the interdigestive phase of gastric motility,"Ans. A. Malfunction of adaptive relaxation in the gastric reservoirAs the gastric reservoir fills during a meal, mechanoreceptors signal the CNS. When the limits of adaptive relaxation in the reservoir are reached, signals from the stretch receptors in the reservoir's walls account for the sensations of fullness and satiety. Overdistension is perceived as discomfort. Adaptive relaxation appears to malfunction in the forms of functional dyspepsia characterized by the symptoms described in this question. If adaptive relaxation is compromised (e.g., by an enteric neuropathy), mechanoreceptors are activated at lower distending volumes and the CNS wrongly interprets the signals as if the gastric reservoir were full. None of the other choices would be expected to activate mechanosensory signaling of the state of fullness of the gastric reservoir.",A

"The membrane protein, clathrin is involved in:",Cell motility,Receptor-mediated endocytosis,Exocytosis,Cell shape,"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis occurs at membrane indentations where the protein clathrin accumulates. Clathrin molecules have the shape of triskelions, with three ""legs"" radiating from a central hub. As endocytosis progresses, the clathrin molecules form a geometric array that surrounds the endocytotic vesicle. At the neck of the vesicle, the GTP binding protein dynamin is involved, either directly or indirectly, in pinching off the vesicle. Once the complete vesicle is formed, the clathrin falls off and the three-legged proteins recycle to form another vesicle. The vesicle fuses with and dumps its contents into an early endosome. From the early endosome, a new vesicle can bud off and return to the cell membrane. Alternatively, the early endosome can become a late endosome and fuse with a lysosome in which the contents are digested by the lysosomal proteases. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is responsible for the internalization of many receptors and the ligands bound to them--including, for example, nerve growth factor (NGF) and low-density lipoproteins. It also plays a major role in synaptic function. Also Know: In exocytosis the cytoplasmic sides of two membranes fuse, whereas in endocytosis two non cytoplasmic sides fuse.

Multidrug resistance is transfered among bacteria through plasmids by -,Transduction,Transversion,Conjugation,Transformation,"Conjugation: it is the process where by a male or donor bacterium mates or makes physical contact with a female or recepient bacterium and transfer genetic material into it. This has been considered to be the bacterial equivalent of sexual mating in higher organisms but the analogy is irrelevant as following conjugation the female bacterium is in turn conveed into male cell. Bacterial conjugation was first described by Lederberg and Tatum (1946) in a strain of E.coli called K12 and has been most extensively studied in strain. it takes place between a male cell and a female cell. The maleness or donor status of a cell is determined by the presence in it of a plasmid that coded for specialised fimbriae which project from surface of the cell.. The plasmid DNA replicate and a copy of it passes from the donor to the recepirnt attains donor status and can inturn conjugate with other female cells. The maleness in bacteria is thus a transmissible or infectious characteristic . along with plasmid DNA , poion of the host DNA also are sometimes transferred to the recepient. the donor DNA then combines with DNA of the recepient effecting genetic recombination. It was E.coli K12 that the role of plasmid in conjugation was first recognised. the plasmid responsible was termed the sex facto or feility (F)factor. When other similar similar plasmids were also discovered the term transfer factor came to be used for all such plasmids when conferred on their host cells the ability to act as donor in conjugation.

How will you differentiate this from other gram positive cocci?",Bacitracin sensitivity,Optochin sensitivity,Bile solubility,Positive coagulase,"Bile solubility > 'b' i.e., Optochin sensitivity This question is about the differential diagnosis of streptococcus. Streptococcus can be broadly categorized into three groups. Alpha hemolytic group of streptococci Alpha hemolytic streptococci may be pathogens such as streptococcus pneumonia or a pa of the normal .flora of the upper respiratory tract i.e., Viridans streptococci. Collectively conzmensal streptococci are often called viridians streptococci which refers to their ahemolytic propey. - Viridans is the Latin for ""green"" and most of the viridians streptococci are alpha hemolytic, Not quite logically this term also includes few streptococci (e.g., the salivarius and mutans groups of streptococci that induce neither a nor fi hemolysis). Moreover - In common usage this term excludes streptococcus pneumonia although this species is also ahemylytic. Streptococcus pneumonia is the major cause of community acquired bacterial pneumonia and the most frequent cause of otitis media and bacteremia in infacts and children. - Thus it is impoant to distinguish streptococcus pneumonia from other alpha hemolytic streptococci which are commensuls. Two tests are commonly employed for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from the viridians streptococcus i.e., - Optochin sensitivity test - Bile solubility test Optochin sensitivity test Optochin (or ethylhydrocupreine) is a chemical used for distinguishing streptococcus pneumonia from other a hemolytic streptococci. - Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to optochin i.e., it is lysed by optochin. - Other ahemolytic streptococci are resistant to (not killed by) optochin. Bacterias that are optochin sensitive will be inhibited to grow around optochin disc while the bacteria that are optochin resistant will be unaffected. Bile Solubility test Bile solubility test is used to distinguish streptococcus pneumoniae from other ahemolytic streptococci. - Bile will selectively lyse colonies of streptococcus pneumoniae while other streptococci are immune to bile's activity.",C

Predisposing factor for venous thrombosis,AT 3 deficiency,Protein s deficiency,Protein c deficiency,All,"Ref Harrison 16/e p686 , Robbins 7/e p 132 Hypercoagulability Hypercoagulability contributes infrequently to aerial or intracardiac thrombosis but is an impoant underlying risk factor for venous thrombosis. It is loosely defined as any alteration of the coagulation pathways that predis- poses affected persons to thrombosis, and can be divided into primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) disorders (Table 3-2). Primary (inherited) hypercoagulability most often is caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes: * Approximately 2% to 15% of whites carry a specific factor V mutation (called the Leiden mutation, after the Dutch city where it was first described). The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. Thus, an impoant antithrom- botic counter-regulatory mechanism is lost. Heterozy- gotes carry a 5-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis, with homozygotes having a 50-fold increased risk. * A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1% to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrom- bin transcription and is associated with a nearly three- fold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as anti- thrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life. Congenitally elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to aerial and venous thromboses (and indeed to the development of atherosclerosis)",D

"Golgi tendon apparatus conveys message to CNS, depending upon -",Tension in muscle,Length of muscle,Rapidity of contraction,Blood supply,"Ans. A. Tension in muscleInverse stretch reflex-a. Up to a point, the harder a muscle is stretched, the stronger is the reflex contraction. However, when the tension becomes great enough, contraction suddenly ceases and the muscle relaxes. This relaxation in response to strong stretch is called the inverse stretch reflex.b. The receptor for the inverse stretch reflex is in the Golgi tendon organ. This organ consists of a netlike collection of knobby nerve endings among the fascicles of a tendon. There are 3-25 muscle fibers per tendon organ.c. The fibers from the Golgi tendon organs make up the Ib group of myelinated, rapidly conducting sensory nerve fibers. Stimulation of these Ib fibers leads to the production of IPSPs on the motor neurons that supply the muscle from which the fibers arise.d. The Ib fibers end in the spinal cord on inhibitory interneurons that in turn terminate directly on the motor neurons. They also make excitatory connections with motor neurons supplying antagonists to the muscle.e. Because the Golgi tendon organs, unlike the spindles, are in series with the muscle fibers, they are stimulated by both passive stretch and active contraction of the muscle. The threshold of the Golgi tendon organs is low.f. The degree of stimulation by passive stretch is not great because the more elastic muscle fibers take up much of the stretch, and this is why it takes a strong stretch to produce relaxation.g. However, discharge is regularly produced by contraction of the muscle, and the Golgi tendon organ thus functions as a transducer in a feedback circuit that regulates muscle force in a manner analogous to the spindle feedback circuit that regulates muscle length.h. The importance of the primary endings in the spindles and the Golgi tendon organs in regulating the velocity of the muscle contraction, muscle length, and muscle force is illustrated by the fact that section of the afferent nerves to an arm causes the limb to hang loosely in a semi paralyzed state. The interaction of spindle discharge, tendon organ discharge, and reciprocal innervation determines the rate of discharge of a-motor neurons",A

Intrinsic muscles of the tongue are derived from,"2 ""d branchial cleft",Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme,Occipital somites,Cervical somites,"occipital somites Most of the tongue muscles are derived from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital somites.Embryological Origin of the TongueThe tongue's embryonic orgin is derived from first 4 pharyngeal arches contributing different components.Anterior 2/3"" or body of tongue: is derived from 3 lingual buds- the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar) and 2 lateral lingual swellings developing at each side of the median tongue bud. All arising from the la pharyngeal arch. The lateral tongue buds rapidly increase in size, merge with each other, and overgrow the median tongue bud. The merged distal tongue buds form the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. The median tongue bud forms no recognizable pa of the adult tongue. Since the mucosa covering the ant. 2/3rd of the tongue originates from the first pharyngeal arch; sensory innervation to this area is by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. (Taste sensation to the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve).Post 1/3"" or root of the tongue: is formed from two median elevations;- The copula arising from the 2""d pair of branchial arches, just caudal to the foramen ceacum.- The hypopharyngeal or hypobranchial eminence developing caudal to the copula from the 3rd and dh pair of arches.As the tongue develops the copula is gradually overgrown by the hypopharyngeal eminence and disappears. As a result, the post pa of the tongue develops from the hypopharyngeal eminence( the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches) . Thus the sensory nerve supply to this pa of tongue is from the glossopharyngeal nerve.(taste sensation is also carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve).Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme forms the connective tissue and vasculature of the tongue. Some of the tongue muscles probably develop in situ from mesenchyme, but most develop from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital myotomes. The hypoglossal nerve accompanies the myoblasts during their migration and innervates the tongue muscles.The Nerve Supply of the Tonguea. Motor nerve- All the intrinsic & extrinsic muscles, except the palatoglossus, are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The palatoglossus is supplied by the cranial pa of the accessory nerve through the pharyngeal plexus.b. Sensory nerves:- Anterior 2/3 of tongue - The lingual nerve is the nerve of general sensation and the chorda tympani is the nerve of taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.- Posterior 1/3 of tongue - The glossopharyngeal nerve is the nerve for both general sensation and taste for the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.- The posterior-most pa of the tongue is supplied by the vagus nerve through the internal laryngeal branch.

"In cell with damaged DNA and potential for malignant transformation, the tumor suppressor p53 gene involves",Triggering of the production of p21,Inducing apoptosis,Getting complexed with other transforming proteins,All of the above,"Tumor protein p53, also known as p53, cellular tumor antigen p53 (UniProt name), phosphoprotein p53, tumor suppressor p53, antigen NY-CO-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as TP53 (humans) and Trp53 (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor. As such, p53 has been described as ""the guardian of the genome"" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. Hence TP53 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. (Italics are used to denote the TP53 gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.) The name p53 was given in 1979 describing the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that it is a 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53a) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the full-length protein, the human TP53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. TP53 gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations in the genome",D

Mammography was performed in 45 year old female for screening of breast cancer. The finding is suggestive of,Benign lesion,Malignant lesion,Indeterminate,No opinion can be given,"Mammography Soft tissue radiographs are taken by placing the breast in direct contact with ultrasensitive film and exposing it to low-voltage, high-amperage x-rays. The dose of radiation is approximately 0.1 cGy and, therefore, mammography is a very safe investigation. The sensitivity of this investigation increases with age as the breast becomes less dense. In total, 5% of breast cancers are missed by population-based mammographic screening programmes; even in retrospect, such carcinomas are not apparent. Thus, a normal mammogram does not exclude the presence of carcinoma. Digital mammography is being introduced, which allows manipulation of the images and computer-aided diagnosis.

It is a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The frontal and lacrimal nerves provide cutaneous supply to parts of the orbit and face, but they do not innervate the cornea. The facial nerve is the efferent limb of the corneal reflex and mediates the closing of both eyes in response to irritation of the cornea. The oculomotor nerve mediates the reopening of the eyes by contraction of the levator palpebrae superioris. The optic nerve also innervates the eye for the sense of vision and is the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex.",C

(d) ImmunodeficiencyRef: Harper's Biochemistry, 30th edn. pg. 354-355* Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine- guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), produced by mutations in the HPRT gene located on X chromosome.Clinical Features* One of the first symptoms of the disease is the presence of sand-like crystals of uric acid in the diapers of the affected infant. Overproduction of uric acid may lead to the development of uric acid crystals or stones in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Such crystals deposited in joints later in the disease may produce gout-like arthritis, with swelling and tenderness* Irritability is most often noticed along with the first signs of nervous system impairment. Within the first few years of life, extrapyramidal involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as dystonia, atheotosis and opisthotonus.* Cognitive impairment: Affected persons have behavioral disturbances that emerge between 2-3 years of age. The self-injury begins with biting of the lips and tongue at the age of 3 years.Remember* A less severe related disease is partial HGPRT deficiency is known as Kelley-Seegmiller Syndrome (Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome involves total HGPRT deficiency). Symptoms generally involve less neurological involvement but the disease still causes gout and kidney stones.* The prognosis for individuals with severe LNS is poor. Death is usually due to renal failure or complications from hypotonia (PNEUMONIA), in the first or second decade of life.",D
"All have significant role in digestion of fat, except",Pancreatic Lipase,Colipase,Lingual lipase,Bile-salts,"A lingual lipase is secreted by Ebner's glands on the dorsal surface of the tongue in some species, and the stomach also secretes a lipase. They are of little quantitative significance for lipid digestion other than in the setting of pancreatic insufficiency, however. Most fat digestion, therefore, begins in the duodenum, pancreatic lipase being one of the most impoant enzymes involved. This enzyme hydrolyzes the 1- and 3-bonds of the triglycerides(triacylglycerols) with relative ease but acts on the 2- bonds at a very low rate, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2-monoacylglycerols). It acts on fats that have been emulsified. Its activity is facilitated when an amphipathic helix that covers the active site like a lid is bent back. Colipase, a protein with a molecular weight of about 11,000, is also secreted in the pancreatic juice, and when this molecule binds to the -COOH terminaldomain of the pancreatic lipase, opening of the lid is facilitated. Colipase is secreted in an inactive proform and is activated in the intestinal lumen by trypsin. Another pancreatic lipase that is activated by bile salts has been characterized. This 100,000kDa cholesterol esterase represents about 4% of the total protein in pancreatic juice In adults, pancreatic lipase is 10-60 times more active, but unlike pancreatic lipase, this bile salt-activated lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, esters of fat-soluble vitamins, and phospholipids, as well as triglycerides. A very similar enzyme is found in human milk. Fats are relatively insoluble, which limits their ability to cross the unstirred layer and reach the surface of the mucosal cells. However, they are finely emulsified in the small intestine by the detergent action of bile salts, lecithin, and monoglycerides.When the concentration of bile salts in the intestine is high, as it is after contraction of the gallbladder, lipids and bile salts interact spontaneously to form micelles. Micellar formation fuher solubilizes the lipids and provides a mechanism for their transpo to the enterocytes. Thus, the micelles move down their concentration gradient through the unstirred layer to the brush border of the mucosal cells. The lipids diffuse out of the micelles, and a saturated aqueous solution of the lipids is maintained in contact with the brush border of the mucosal cellsREF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:457",C

Candida albicans can be differentiated from other Candida species on cornmeal agar by its unique ability to form which of the following,Aseptate hyphae,Germ tubes,Chlamydospores,Ahrospores,"Although multiple Candida species may cause disease in humans, C.albicans is the most frequent species identified. Chlamydospores (chlamydoconidia) are round, thick-walled spores formed directly from the differentiation of hyphae in which there is a concentration of protoplasm and nutrient material. They may be intercalary (within the hyphae) or terminal (end of hyphae). Germ tubes appear as hyphal-like extensions of yeast cells, usually without a constriction at the point of origin from the cell. Approximately 75 percent of the yeasts recovered from clinical specimens are C. albicans, and the germ-tube test can usually provide identification within 3 hours.

"A 38-year-old man has been HIV-positive since the age of 26 but has refused antiretroviral prophylaxis. His CD4 cell count, however, is still within normal limits, and the virus is undetectable in the blood. Genetic investigations clarify this apparent puzzle, demonstrating that this subject is homozygous for a mutation affecting a chemokine receptor necessary for HIV entry into the cell. Which of the following receptors is most likely involved?",CCR5,CD4,CD8,Gp120,"HIV infection does not always progress to ove AIDS. In a few founate individuals (called non-progressors), the infection remains asymptomatic, with a stable CD4 cell count and low or undetectable viremia. It is not entirely clear whether these patients will eventually develop AIDS. Some are resistant to HIV infection because they carry two defective copies of the gene encoding the CCR5 coreceptor. There are 15 known coreceptors, of which CCR5 and CXCR4 are the best characterized. CCR5 is a receptor for b-chemokines and serves as a coreceptor for HIV internalization. Approximately one percent of Caucasians in the U.S. is homozygous for such a protective CCR5 variant, and 20% are heterozygotes. HIV infection follows a slower course in heterozygotes. Homozygotes for this protective CCR5 variant are not present among Black and Asian populations. Recently, a variant haplotype of CXCR1 (a leukocyte receptor for fractalkine) has been linked to rapid progression of HIV infection in homozygous individuals. Thus, investigations on HIV coreceptors are beginning to explain the variability in progression and severity of HIV infection among individuals. CD4 (2nd Choice) is an impoant receptor of helper T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans cells. It acts as the primary receptor for HIV binding. Binding to CD4, however, is not sufficient for the entry of HIV into the cells. The viral envelope gp120 protein (4th Choice) first binds CD4. This results in a conformational change in gp120 that allows this protein to bind coreceptors. Such coreceptors are present on lymphocytes and macrophages and normally serve as binding sites for chemokines. Once gp120 binds to CD4 and a coreceptor, a second viral protein, gp41, facilitates fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane, allowing ""injection"" of the viral core into the cell. Neither CD8 (5th Choice) nor the receptor for TNF-a plays a role in HIV binding to cells.",A

"Renal artery lumen is reduced by half, what will be the blood flow?",Reduce by 1/2,Reduce by 1/4,Reduce by 1/16,Come to normal after autoregulation,"Ans: C. Reduce by 1/16Option c is correct because the flow of fluids can be described by Poiseuille's Law.In which flow of liquid is directly proportional to R4, So if lumen is reduced to half then blood flow will get reduce by 1/16.Other points related to blood flow...Poiseuille's Law states that the flow (Q) of fluid is related to a number of factors:The viscosity (n) of the fluidThe pressure gradient across the vessel (P)Length (L) and diameter(r) of the vesselDiameter: Doubling the diameter of tube increases the flow rate by 16 fold (r4). The larger the vessels's diameter greater is the blood flow.Viscosity: Flow is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the fluid.Viscosity of blood increases with increasing hematocrit and decreasing temperaturePressure: Increasing pressure further maximizes flow as described by Poiseuille's equation.The relationship is given by Poiseuille-Hagen formula:F=(PA -PB )x(8p )x(e1 )x(Lr4 )WhereF = FlowPA - PB = Pressure difference between two ends of the tube q = Viscosity r = Radius of tube L = Length of tubeRelationship between arterial blood pressure and blood flow given in graph below:",C

Microorganism motile at 25 degree Celsius but non-motile at 37 degree Celsius and shows actin binding polymerization to escape is:,Listeria monocytogenes,Campylobacter,Yersinia pestis,Streptococcus agalactiae,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Listeria monocytogenes L. monocytogenes is a short, gram positive, non-spore forming rod. The motility test rapidly differentiates listeria from diphtheroids that are members of the normal microbiota of the skin. The organism has several adhesion proteins (Ami, Fbp A, and flagellin proteins) that facilitate bacterial binding to the host cells and that contribute to virulence.It has cell wall surface proteins called internalins A and B that interact with E-cadherin, a receptor on epithelial cells, promoting phagocytosis into the epithelial cells. After phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagolysosome, where the low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin.This enzyme, along with two phospholipases, lyses the membrane of the phagolysosome and allows the listeriae to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. The organism proliferates, and ActA, another listerial surface protein, induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels them to the cell membrane. Pushing against the host cell membrane, they cause formation of elongated protrusions called filopods. These filopods are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, the listeriae are released, and the cycle begins again. L monocytogenes move from cell to cell without being exposed to antibodies, complement, or polymorphonuclear cells.",A
Major metabolism of saturated fatty acids in the mitochondria is called as -,b-oxidation,a-oxidation,o-oxidation,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., b-oxidation o b-oxidation is the principal pathway for catabalism of saturated fatty acids. b-oxidation mainly occurs in mitochondrial matrix (whereas fatty acid synthesis occurs in cytosol).o b-oxidatioon consists of repeated cycles of a series of reactions. With each cycle a two carbon unit (i.e. acetyl CoA molecule) is removed, started at the carboxyl end. Thus complete oxidation of the 16-Carbon fatty acid (e.g. palmitic acid) requires seven such cycles and generates eight molecules of acetyl CoA. In first 6 cycle, 6 acetyl CoA molecules (total 12 carbons) are removed leaving 4- carbon molecules for the last (7th) cycle. In 7th cycle, this 4 carbon molecules is cleaved into 2 acetyl CoA, making the total number of acetyl CoA molecules to eighto It is called b-oxidation because oxidation of fatty acids occurs at the b-carbon atom (3rd carbon and cleavage occurs between 2nd carbon (a-carbon) and 3rd carbon (b-carbon).o The pathway occurs in three stages: (i) Activation of fatty acid in the cytosol; (ii) Transport of activated fatty acid into mitochondria; and (iii) Standard b-oxidation process in mitochondrial matrix.",A

All the options mentioned in this question are inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism. Phenylketonuria, tyrosinemia type 2 and Arigininosuccinic aciduria present during infancy or childhood, whereas Alkaptonuria presents usually at 40 yrs of age. It may go unrecognized until middle life. Mental retardation is usually seen in all the other 3 options. (Mental retardation not seen in Alkaptonuria). Alkaptonuria Triad of: - Homogentisic aciduria - Black pigmentation of cailage and collagenous tissue (ochronosis) - Ochronotic ahritis It is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine catabolism. There is deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase which results in the accumulation of homogentisic acid pigment cailages and collagenous tissues (ochronosis). Large amount of homogentisic acid is excreted in urine which gets oxidised on exposure to air and impas urine a dark colour especially if the pH of urine is alkaline. Alkaptonuria is usually recognised by 30-40 yrs of age when degenerative joint disease and ochronosis (pigmentation) become noticeable. Ochronosis ahritis commonly involves shoulder, hips and knees. The interveebral discs are degenerated, spaces are narrowed and calcification occurs. Ochronosis or pigmentation can involve- hea valves, larynx, tympanic membrane, sclera, ear cailage and skin. Occasionally pigmented renal or prostatic calculi can occur. Homogentisic acid (HGA) is a strong reducing agent and gives positive reaction with Benedict's & Fehling's reagent. A greenish brown precipitate with brownish black supernatant develops with Benedict's reagent and transient blue green colour develops with Fehling's (FeC13) reagent. The diagnosis is confirmed by measurement of HGA concentration in urine by paper and thin layer chromatography. Low protein diet especially low in phenylalanine and tyrosine is advocated in combination with ascorbic acid, but not very effective. Addition of nitisinone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase which catalyzes the formation of homogentisic acid) drastically reduces urinary excretion of homogentisic acid might prevent the long term complication of alkaptonuria.",B

The first lipoprotein to increase in concentration in the blood after ingestion of 400 g of jellybeans (carbohydrate) is,Chylomicrons,VLDL,LDL,HDL,"VLDL is synthesized in the liver, particularly after a high carbohydrate meal. It is formed from triacylglycerols that are packaged with cholesterol, apolipoproteins (particularly, apoB-100), and phospholipids, and it is released into the blood, where it acquires apoC-II and apo E.VLDL is synthesized by the liver from dietary sugar (present in jelly-beans). LDL is the cholesterol-rich particle in the blood. Cells take up LDL by LDL binding to the LDL receptor, and the LDL-LDL receptor complex enters the cell via endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the cholesterol is released from cholesterol esters by a lysosomal enzyme and enters the cytoplasm of the cell for further processing. Chylomicrons are produced from dietary lipids and cholesterol in the intestinal epithelial cells. HDL is involved in reverse cholesterol transport, which requires the LCAT reaction. Fatty acids, because they are so hydrophobic, cannot travel freely in the blood and need to be bound to albumin for transport through the circulatory system.",B

This reaction- known as the Lobry de Bruyn-von Ekenstein transformatiorr-results in the formation of a common intermediate-namely enediol--$or all the three sugars. The enediols are highly reactive, hence sugars in alkaline solution are powerful reducing agent Ref: Biochemistry by U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno : 16,17",A

Substrate for ATP synthase is,AMP,ADP,IMP,GMP,"1. ADP and Pi bind to L binding site 2. LT conversion is by energy-driven conformational change that catalyses the formation of ATP 3. T state reves to O state when ATP is released. 4. L state is regenerated for fuher ADP binding. For the complete rotation of F1 head through the 3 states, 10 protons are translocated. Protons entering the system, cause conformational changes in the F1 paicle. Initially the ADP and Pi are loosely bound to the catalytic site on F1. As the Fo accepts protons, the affinity for ADP is increased (step 1, Fig.19.16). Fuher conformational change induces catalytic activity, and ATP is synthesized (step 2, Fig.19.16). This moves protons to the matrix side. As the ATPs are released, the original conformation of the enzyme is assumed (step 3, Fig.19.16). Then ADP is again bound and the cycle repeats (step 4, Fig.19.16). The energy surplus produced by the proton gradient is stored as chemical energy in ATP. The energy-requiring step is not at the synthesis of ATP, but energy is required for the conformational changes. Regulation of ATP Synthesis The availability of ADP regulates the process. When ATP level is low and ADP level is high, oxidative phosphorylation proceeds at a rapid rate. This is called respiratory control or acceptor control. The major source of NADH and FADH2 is the citric acid cycle, the rate of which is regulated by the energy charge of the cell.Ref: DM Vasudevan Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 233",B
"All of the following enzymes are increased in myocardial infarction, EXCEPT:",LDH,CK,Isocitrate dehydrogenase,Aspaate aminotransferase,"In MI, total LDH activity is increased, while H4 iso-enzymes is increased 5-10 times more. The magnitude of the peak value will be roughly propoional to the size of myocardial infarct. CK value in serum is increased in myocardial infarction. The CK level stas to rise within 3-6 hours of infarction. Therefore CK estimation is very useful to detect early cases. The CK level is not increased in hemolysis or in congestive hea failure and therefore CK has an advantage over LDH. Normal level of AST is 8-20U/L. The level is significantly elevated in Myocardial infarction. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is not elevated in myocardial infarction. Must know: The enzymes routinely elevated in myocardial infarction are: Creatine kinase(CK) Lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) Aspaate aminotransferase(AST) Cardiac troponin I(CTI) and Cardiac troponin T(CTT) Brain Natriuretic peptide(BNP).

False about surfactant is?,Produced by Type II - alveolar epithelial cells.,Contains DPPC and Phosphatidyl glycerol,Is a lipid-surface tension lowering agent,Consists of 3 types of unique proteins in it.,"Ans. D. Consists of 3 types of unique proteins in it.SurfactantThe low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of Di palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P=2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force favouring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.Approximate Composition of Surfactant.ComponentPercentage CompositionDipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine62Phosphatidylglycerol5Other phospholipids10Neutral lipids13Proteins8Carbohydrate2Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Following secretion, the phospholipids of surfactant line up in the alveoli with their hydrophobic fatty acid tails facing the alveolar lumen. Surface tension is inversely proportional to their concentration per unit area. The surfactant molecules move further apart as the alveoli enlarge during inspiration, and surface tension increases, whereas it decreases when they move closer together during expiration. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled.Formation of the phospholipid film is greatly facilitated by the proteins in surfactant. This material contains four unique proteins: surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. SP-A is a large glycoprotein and has a collagen-like domain within its structure. It has multiple functions, including regulation of the feedback uptake of surfactant by the type II alveolar epithelial cells that secrete it. SP-B and SP-C are smaller proteins, which facilitate formation of the monomolecular film of phospholipid. A mutation of the gene for SP-C has been reported to be associated with familial interstitial lung disease. Like SP-A, SP-D is a glycoprotein. Its full function is uncertain. However, SP-A and SP-D are members of the collecting family of proteins that are involved in innate immunity in the conducting airway as well as in the alveoli.",D

In vitro coagulation is initiated by factor:,XII.,XI.,X.,VII.,"The conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin is catalyzed by thrombin. Thrombin is a serine protease that is formed from its circulating precursor, prothrombin, by the action of activated factor X.
Factor X can be activated by reactions in either of two systems, an intrinsic and extrinsic system. The initial reaction in the intrinsic system is conversion of inactive factor XII to active factor XII (XIIa). This activation, which is catalyzed by high molecular weight kininogen and kallikrein can be brought about in vitro by exposing the blood to electro negatively charged wettable surfaces such as glass and collagen fibers. Activation in vivo occurs when blood is exposed to the collagen fibers underlying the endothelium in the blood vessels. Active factor XII than activates factor Xi, and active factor XI activates factor IX.

Number of ATP generated in one TCA cycle ?,2,8,10,11,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 10 In a single TCA cycle 10 molecules of ATP are produced (12 molecules according to older calculations). One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle. Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs. Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :-",C

It is due to aeriolar dilation mediated by axon reflex (may be an indirect effect of histamine). 3) Wheal is local edema and elevation of skin due to increased permeability of capillaries and post capillary venules with consequent extravasation of fluid. Capillary permeability is increased due to histamine and other mediators.",B

"About myocardial oxygen demand, true is",Inverse relation with hea rate,Inverse relation of systemic hypeension,Directly Propoional to ventricle systole duration,Negligible in quiescent hea,"Myocardial O2 demand and consumption is directly propoional to hea rate and systemic aerial pressure. Myocardial efficiency is the least when hea is contracting against a greater afterload or aerial resistance. It is less efficient with increasing hea rate. And, it is most economical with greater stroke volume (with afterload and hea rate kept constant). Even in quiescent hea, myocardium extracts 75-80% O2 delivered to it; it is highest in the body. Myocardial O2 usage is most closely related to the total tension developed by the ventricular muscle. The term tension-time index (TTI) is used to express this parameter. TTI = mean systolic pressure x duration of systole x hea rate",C
Immediate precursor of ketone bodies,Acetyl - CoA,Acetoacetyl - CoA,HMG - CoA,Acyl - CoA,"KETONE BODY FORMATION IN LIVER (KETOGENESIS)Enzymes are mitochondrial:Steps1. Aceto-acetyl-CoA: Aceto-acetyl-CoA is the staing material for ketogenesis. This can arise in two ways:(a) Directly during the course of b-oxidation of fatty acids, or(b) As a result of condensation of two C-2 units, i.e. 'active acetate' (acetyl-CoA) by reversal of thiolase reaction.2. Formation of Acetoacetate: Acetoacetate is the first ketone body to be formed. This can occur in two ways:(a) By deacylation: Acetoacetate can be formed from aceto-acetyl-CoA by simple deacylation catalysed by the enzyme aceto-acetyl-CoA deacylase. The above does not seem to be the major pathway when excessive amount of ketone bodies are formed, the deacylation reaction is not enough to cope up.(b) Second pathway: Formation of acetoacetate intermediate production of ""b-OH-b-methyl glutaryl CoA"" (HMG-CoA). Present opinion ours the HMG-CoA pathway as the major route of ketone body formation.StepsInvolves two steps:* Condensation of aceto-acetyl-CoA with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form b-OH-b methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) catalysed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (mitochondrial enzyme).* HMG-CoA is then acted upon by another enzyme, HMG-CoA Lyase, which is also mitochondrial enzyme, to produce one molecule ""acetoacetate"" and one molecule of acetyl-CoANote* Both the enzymes HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA Lyase are mitochondrial and must be available in mitocondrion for ketogenesis to occur.* Both the enzymes are present in liver cells mitochondria only.* A marked increase in activity of HMG-CoA Lyase has been noted in fasting.* HMG-CoA is a committed step. Cholesterol also can be formed by ""HMG-CoA reductase"".3. Formation of Acetone: As stated earlier, acetone is formed from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxylation (Non-enzymatic). Fig. 25.9: Formation, utilisation, and excretion of ketone bodies4. Formation of b-OH Butyrate: Acetoacetate once formed is conveed to b-OH-butyric acid; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme b-OH-butyrate dehydrogenase, which is present in liver and also found in many other tissues. b-OH-butyrate is quantitatively the predominant ketone body present in blood and urine in KetosisRef: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry 8th Edition Dr (Brig) MN Chatterjea, Rana Shinde page no 425,426",C

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is classified as,Allergic reaction,Type2 hypersensitivity,Immune complex mediated hypersensitivity,Cell mediated hypersensitivity,"Ref Robbins 9/e p117 Once complexes are deposited in the tissue, the third phase, the inflammatory reaction, ensues. During this phase (approximately 10 days after antigen administration), clini- cal features such as fever, uicaria, ahralgias, lymph node enlargement, and proteinuria appear. Wherever immune complexes deposit, characteristic tissue damage occurs. The immune complexes activate the complement system, leading to the release of biologically active frag- ments such as the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), which increase vascular permeability and are chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes (Chapter 2). The complexes also bind to Fcg receptors on neutrophils and monocytes, activating these cells. Attempted phagocytosis of immune complexes by the leukocytes results in the secretion of a variety of additional pro-inflammatory substances, includ- ing prostaglandins, vasodilator peptides, and chemotactic substances, as well as lysosomal enzymes capable of digest- ing basement membrane, collagen, elastin, and cailage, and reactive-oxygen species that damage tissues. Immune complexes can also cause platelet aggregation and activate Hageman factor; both of these reactions augment the inflammatory process and initiate formation of micro- thrombi, which contribute to the tissue injury by producing local ischemia (Fig. 4-11). The resultant pathologic lesion is termed vasculitis if it occurs in blood vessels, glomerulo- nephritis if it occurs in renal glomeruli, ahritis if it occurs in the joints, and so on. Predictably, the antibody classes that induce such lesions are complement-fixing antibodies (i.e., IgG and IgM) and antibodies that bind to phagocyte Fc receptors (IgG). During the active phase of the disease, consumption of complement may result in decreased serum complement levels. The role of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent inflammation in the pathogenesis of the tissue injury is suppoed by the observation that experimental depletion of serum complement levels or knockout of Fc receptors in mice greatly reduces the severity of lesions, as does deple- tion of neutrophils.",C

"A patient is going skiing high in the Rockies and is given acetazolamide to protect against altitude sickness. Unfortunately, the patient is also a type 1 diabetic. He is admitted to the hospital in a worsening ketoacidosis. In which of the following cells has acetazolamide inhibited a reaction that has led to the severity of the metabolic acidosis?",White blood cells,Red blood cells,Lens of the eye,Hepatocyte,"Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is found primarily in red blood cells. The red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase that catalyzes the reaction that forms carbonic acid from CO2 andH2 O. Under high- altitude conditions, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase will lead to a decrease in blood pH, which stabilizes the deoxygenated form of Hb. This is due to an increased loss of bicarbonate in the urine by the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase within the kidney. The change in pH increases oxygen delivery to the tissues and can overcome, in part, the symptoms of altitude sickness.However, in the case of the person with type I diabetes who begins to produce ketone bodies, the body's main compensatory mechanism to overcome the acidosis is blocked. As ketone bodies are formed and protons generated, the H+ will react with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid. Carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzes a reversible reaction, will then convert the carbonic acid to CO2 andH2 O, with the CO2 being exhaled. These reactions soak up excess protons and help to buffer against the acidosis. If, however, carbonic anhydrase has been inhibited by acetazolamide, then the bicarbonate cannot buffer the blood pH, and the acidosis could become more severe. White blood cells, muscle cells, liver cells, and the lens of the eye do not contribute to the buffering of the blood, and inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in those cells would not affect the ability to overcome an acidosis.",B

cAMP acts by,Increasing Na K secretion,Increasing K secretion,Increasing Cl secretion,Increasing Na secretion,"Cyclic AMP is formed from ATP by the action of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and conveed to physiologically inactive 5&;AMP by the action of the enzyme phosphodiesterase. Some of the phosphodiesterase isoforms that break down cAMP are inhibited by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. Consequently, these compounds can augment hormonal and transmitter effects mediated cAMP. Cyclic AMP activates one of the cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A, PKA) that, like protein kinase C, catalyzes the phosphorylation of proteins, changing their conformation and altering their activity. In addition, the active catalytic subunit of PKA moves to the nucleus and phosphorylates the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). This transcription factor then binds to DNA and alters transcription of a number of genes.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology, 23rd edition, Page no: 56",C

Southern blot test is for detection of: September 2005,Antibodies against viral proteins,DNA,RNA,Carbohydrate epitopes,"Ans. B: DNA Southern blot test, a gene analysis method used to identify specific DNA fragments and in the diagnosis of cancers and inherited blood disorders (hemoglobulinopathies). The DNA fragments are analyzed for changes in the order of antibodies (immunoglobulins) or cell receptor genes, movement of chromosomes, increases in potentially cancer-causing genes (oncogenes), and changes (point mutations) in these genes. Nohern blot test is an immunologic technique for the detection of specific messenger RNAs using complementary DNA. (Called also Nohern transfer) Western blotting is a more specific test as it allows one to visualize antibodies directed against each viral protein. For this reason, it is a confirmatory test for a positive HIV ELISA. ELISA measures antibody to whole virus and gives a ""positive,"" ""negative"" or indeterminate test result.

Platelet helps in clot stabilisation by,Release of factor 8,Release of calcium,Release of thrombomodulin,Activation of thrombasthenin,"Ans: b (Release of calcium) Ref Khurana text book of physiologyIf activated factor XIII is given the option you can go for that. Otherwise only correct answer is calcium. Thrombosthenin is involved in clot retraction.Platelet-associated factor XIII provides a means by which to promote clot stabilization and platelet interaction with proteins of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways.Fibrin stabilising factor (factor XIII) which is normally present in the plasma and also released from activated platelets is activated by thrombin to form XIIla but the XIIIa in the prescence of Ca2+ causes formation of covalent crosslinkages between fibrin threads, thus adding tremendous strength to the fibrin meshwork. The fibrin meshwork traps the remaining components of plasma and blood cells to form a solid mass called clotThrombomodulin is a thrombin binding protein produced by all endothelial cells except those in cerebral microcirculation.lt converts thrombin into protein C activator (AIPGME2007)Thrombasthenin is a contractile protein present in platelet involved in clot retraction and not in stabilizationActivated factor XIII will bind to the surface of activated platelets. These platelets then participate in cell-cell or cell-clot interactions, thereby increasing the local concentration of factor XIIIa.The platelet-associated factor Xllla may increase the amount of crosslinking in a fibrin clot, thereby contributing to the aging of the clot and the reduction in the degree of platelet binding. Clot resistance to fibrinolysis is enhanced by platelet factor XEIIa-mediated crosslinking of alpha 2-antiplasmin to fibrin. The binding of factor XIIIa to the platelet surface requires the activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein Ilb-IIIa.Thus, platelet-associated factor Xllla may be used as a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Since half of the factor XIII present in blood is provided by the platelets, it is not surprising that this form of factor XIII plays an important role in hemostasis.",B

Histone acetylation causes,Increased Heterochromatin formation,Increase Euchromatin formation,Methylation of cystine,DNA replication,"Histone acetylation and deacetylation are the processes by which the lysine residues within the N-terminal tail protruding from the histone core of the nucleosome are acetylated and deacetylated as pa of gene regulation. Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential pas of gene regulation. These reactions are typically catalysed by enzymes with ""histone acetyltransferase"" (HAT) or ""histone deacetylase"" (HDAC) activity. Acetylation is the process where an acetyl functional group is transferred from one molecule (in this case, Acetyl-Coenzyme A) to another. Deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule. Acetylated histones, octameric proteins that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent a type of epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing the interaction of the N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.",B
Penile erection is due to:-,Reflex sympathetic action on the aerioles,Parasympathetic impulses causes dilatation of aerioles,Reflex sympathetic activity on venules,Reflex parasympathetic activity on the venules,"Penile erection is associated with sexual arousal caused by sexually related psychic and/or physical stimuli. During sexual arousal, impulses from the genitalia, together with signals emanating from the limbic system, elicit motor impulses in the spinal cord. The sacral parasympathetic fibers convey these impulses from the spinal cord, the cavernous nerve branches of the prostatic plexus, into the penis. These signals cause smooth muscle relaxation of the corpora cavernosa and dilatation of the aerioles. The transmitter responsible for relaxation of smooth muscle of the cavernosa and aerioles is nitric oxide (NO).",B

The following are true for T lymphocytes except -,Constitute 70 to 80% circulating pool of lymphocytes,Release macrophage inhibition factor,Secrete specific antibodies,Release lymphotoxin,"The adaptive immune system consists of 2 types of lymphocytes: T-cells (70-80% of the adaptive immune force) and B cells (10-20% of the adaptive immune force).Antigens (triangular shapes above) are ingested (1), paially digested (2) and then presented to helper T cells by special cells called macrophages (3). This process activates the helper T cell to release hormones (lymphokines) that help B cells develop (4). These hormones, along with recognition of fuher antigens (5), change the B cell into an antibody-producing plasma cell (6). The antibodies (Y shapes above) produced can be one of several types (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD) (7). The antibody ""fits"" the antigen much like a lock fits a key. The antigen is thus rendered harmless. The helper T cells also aid in development of cytotoxic T cells (8), which can kill antigens directly; memory T cells are produced (9) so that re-exposure to the same antigen will provide a more rapid and effective response (10).

APO B48 & APO B100 is synthesized from the same rnRNA; the difference between them is due to:,RNA splicing,Allelic exclusion,Deamination of cytidine to uridine,Upstream repression,"C i.e. Deamination of cytidine to uridine IRef: Vasudevan - Least post translational modification occurs in prokaryotic mRNA, which is generally identical to its primary transcript. Post translational modification of t-RNA includes removal of introns from anticodon loop, trimming of 5' & 3' ends, methylation / reduction / deamination / alkylation / rearranging glycolsidic bond to produced modified bases like methylated bases, dihydrouracil (D) & pseudo uracil (W) bases in nucleus, whereas cleavage and attachment of CCA tailing occur in cytoplasmQ. - In RNA, gene during processing undergoes nucleoside modifications, nucleoside cleavage and terminal addition but not chemical hydrolysisQ. - Post translational modification of mRNA involves 5' capping , 3' polyadenylation (addition of poly 'A' tail at 3' end), splicing (removal of non coding intervening or intron sequences and ligation / joining of coding exons) by Sn RNA/ Sn RNPs / Snurps or self splicing d/t ribozyme activity of self splicing introns with formation of lariat intermediates, RNA editing and secondary methylationQ. Apo B-48 and Apo B-100 are synthesized from same Apo B gene and same ApoB- m-RNA. Apo B 100 is a 100 kDa protein synthesized in liver by full length translation of corresponding mRNA of Apo B gene. Apo - B-100 forms pa of LDL, IDL and VLDL. Apo B-48 is a 48 KDa protein (48% shoer form of Apo B-100) synthesized in intestine by paial translation of same mRNA of Apo B gene. Apo B 48 forms pa of chylomicron & chylomicron remnant. This difference between the sizes of Apo B100 and Apo B48 occurs because post transcriptional processing (editing) of Apo B mRNA , deaminates the cytidine (C) to uracil (U) in intestine at 2153 position. After cyti dine deamination the CAA codon (which codes glutamine in liver) becomes UAA (nonsense or stop codon) in intestine. This results in shoer apo B-48 protein being made in intestine (and incorporated into chylomicron) than is made in the liver full length Apo B-100, incorporated in to VLDL.",C

Substance which binds to substrate other than catalytic enzyme is,Competitive inhibitor,Non-competitive inhibitor,Reversible inhibitor,None of the above,"Non-competitive inhibition models a system where the inhibitor and the substrate may both be bound to the enzyme at any given time. When both the substrate and the inhibitor are bound, the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex cannot form product and can only be conveed back to the enzyme-substrate complex or the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Non-competitive inhibition is distinguished from generally mixed inhibition in that the inhibitor has an equal affinity for the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex.The most common mechanism of non-competitive inhibition involves reversible binding of the inhibitor to an allosteric site, but it is possible for the inhibitor to operate other means including direct binding to the active site. It differs from competitive inhibition in that the binding of the inhibitor does not prevent binding of substrate, and vice versa, it simply prevents product formation for a limited time.This type of inhibition reduces the maximum rate of a chemical reaction without changing the apparent binding affinity of the catalyst for the substrate",B

"As pa of a research experiment, a person undergoes two fine needle muscle biopsies to obtain small amounts of tissue for biochemical analysis. The first is taken at the beginning of the experiment while the subject is at rest. The second is taken at the end of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a stationary bicycle. The activity of the muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes is found to be much higher in the second measurement. Which of the following biochemical changes would be most likely to produce this effect?",Decreased ADP,Decreased intracellular Ca2+,Increased acetyl CoA,Increased pyruvate concentration,"In most biochemical pathways, only one to a few enzymatic reactions are under regulatory control. These often occur either at the beginning of pathways or at pathway branch points. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex controls the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, and decarboxylates pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) with production of NADH and acetyl CoA (the substrate for the citric acid cycle). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in mitochondria is huge, visible as dots by electron microscopy, because it is composed of many copies of at least 5 separate enzymes. Three of these (pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase) perform the actual biochemical reactions. The other two, PDH kinase and phosphatase, add or remove phosphate groups from the PDH complex, respectively. The more active form of PDH is not phosphorylated; the less active form is. In exercise, high ADP and pyruvate concentrations inhibit PDH kinase, while increased Ca2+ stimulates PDH phosphatase. Both effects produce more of the dephosphorylated, more active form of PDH.

"What should be the value of BMI to be considered as ""Lethal"" in men?",12,15,13,14,"(C) 13[?]Body Mass Index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.BMI is the body mass divided by the square of the body height, & is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms & height in meters.BMI is universally expressed in kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters.If pounds & inches are used, a conversion factor of 703(kg/m2)/(lb/in2) must be applied.BMI is used informally, the units are usually omitted.BMI =Masskg /Heightm2 =Masslb /Heigh-tin2 X703BMI provides a simple numeric measure of a person's thickness or thinness, allowing health professionals to discuss weight problems more objectively with their patients.BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition.Current value recommendations are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 24.9kg/m2 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.Athletes (e.g. gymnasts, basketball & soccer players) have a high muscle to fat ratio and may have a BMI thatis misleadingly high relative to their body fat percentage.Although, BMI of 30t is an indication of obesity, it is not a direct measure of adipose tissue fat mass.One of the refractory mechanisms that maintain body mass in Leptin, identified by Jeffrey Friedman in 1994.A blood borne factor; 17,kDa protein made exclusively in adipocytes.Deficiency of Leptin or Mutation in Leptin gene leads to obesity.Deficiency of Leptin receptors leads to Leptin resistant obesityLeptin:Modulates specific neurons in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus that control feeding behaviour - as a long term regulator.Promotes fuel utilization.NUTRITIONAL STATUSThere is no gold standard for diagnosis of malnutritionThere are several quick assessment toolsBody Mass Index (BMI) & Nutritional StatusBMINutritional Status*. >30kg/m2Obese*. >25-30kg/m2Overweight*. 20-25kg/m2Normal*. <18.5kg/m2Moderate malnutrition*. <16kg/m2Severe malnutrition*. <13kg/m2Lethal in males*. <11kg/m2Lethal in femalesUNDERWEIGHTBeing underweight (BMI<19) can be dangerous, especially in age.BMI value considered lethal for men is 13, whereas females withstand and survive even at lower BMI rate up to 11.Factors that cause underweight include genetics, eating disorders, depression, digestive problems, and thyroid conditions.As people get older, it becomes harder to heal if the body doesn't have some fat reserves.Especially in older women, being very thin can be associated with osteoporosis and brittle bones.",C
False about pseudomyxoma peritonei,Recurrence after surgery,Refractory to drugs,Hypehermia intra peritoneal chemotherapy is the treatment option,Most commonly associated with the appendiceal tumor,"Pseudomyxoma peritonei. Pseudomyxoma peritonei describes mucinous ascites arising from a ruptured ovarian or appendiceal adenocarcinoma. In this disease, the peritoneum becomes coated with a mucus-secreting tumor that fills the peritoneal cavity with tenacious semisolid mucus and large, loculated cystic massesThe current treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei involves resection of as much of the tumor as possible(cytoreduction) and intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy (IPHC). Operative management includes omentectomy, stripping of involved peritoneum, resection of involved organs, and appendectomy, if not previously performed. There should be no residual tumor nodules larger than 2 mm in diameter after resection to facilitate penetration of the chemotherapy into any residual disease. IPHC can be per- formed by an open technique, in which the abdomen is left open to ensure adequate chemotherapy distribution throughout the peritoneal cavity, or a closed technique, in which the abdomen is closed after inflow and outflow cannulas are placed. The latter allows easier maintenance of hypehermia Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno: 1080",B

In the intestino-intestinal reflex, overdistention of one segment of the intestine relaxes the smooth muscle in the rest of the intestine.Distension of the stomach by food initiates contractions of the rectum and, frequently, a desire to defecate. The response is called the gastrocolic reflex and may be amplified by an action of gastrin on the colon. Because of the response, defecation after meals is the rule in children. Recto-sphincteric reflex also called as defecation reflex - distention of the rectum initiates the reflex and causes the urge to defecate.",C

Tropical spastic paraparesis is caused by,Human T cell lymphotropic virus,Hepatitis B virus,Human immunodeficiency virus,Epstein Barr virus,"Oncogenic RNA Viruses The study of oncogenic retroviruses in animals has pro- vided spectacular insights into the genetic basis of cancer. However, only one retrovirus, the human T cell lympho- tropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), has been demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1 is associated with a form of T cell leukemia/lymphoma that is endemic in ceain pas of Japan and the Caribbean basin but is found sporadically elsewhere, including the United States. Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1 has tropism for CD4+ T cells, and this subset of T cells is the major target for neoplastic transformation. Human infec- tion requires transmission of infected T cells through sexual intercourse, blood products, or breastfeeding. Leukemia develops only in about 3% to 5% of infected persons after a long latent period of 20 to 50 years. There is little doubt that HTLV-1 infection of T lympho- cytes is necessary for leukemogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms of transformation are not clear. The HTLV-1 genome does not contain a viral oncogene, and in contrast with ceain animal retroviruses, no consistent integration site next to a cellular oncogene has been discovered. Indeed, the long latency period between initial infection and devel- opment of disease suggests a multistep process, during which many oncogenic mutations are accumulated. The genome of HTLV-1 contains, in addition to the usual retroviral genes, a unique region called pX. This region contains several genes, including one called TAX. The TAX protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation. By interacting with several transcription factors, such as NF-kB, the TAX protein can transactivate the expression of genes that encode cytokines, cytokine receptors, and costimulatory molecules. This inappropriate gene expression leads to autocrine signaling loops and increased activation of promitogenic signaling cascades. Fuhermore, TAX can drive progression through the cell cycle by directly binding to and activating cyclins. In addition, TAX can repress the function of several tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including CDKN2A/p16 and TP53. From these and other observa- tions, the following scenario is emerging (Fig. 5-31): The TAX gene turns on several cytokine genes and their recep- tors (e.g., the interleukins IL-2 and IL-2R and IL-15 and IL-15R), setting up an autocrine system that drives T cell proliferation. Of these cytokines, IL-15 seems to be more impoant, but much remains to be defined. Additionally, a parallel paracrine pathway is activated by increased pro- duction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates neighboring macrophages to produce other T cell mitogens. Initially, the T cell prolifera- tion is polyclonal, because the virus infects many cells, but because of TAX-based inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the proliferating T cells are at increased risk for secondary transforming events (mutations), which lead ultimately to the outgrowth of a monoclonal neoplas- tic T cell population.",A

The level of branching of common carotid artery:,Upper border of thyroid cartilage,Lower border of cricoid cartilage,Lower border of thyroid cartilage,Hyoid,"COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES:
There are two common carotid arteries: right and left. They are the chief arteries of the head and neck.
Origin:
The right common carotid artery arises in neck from brachiocephalic trunk (innominate artery) behind the
sternoclavicular joint.
The left common carotid artery arises in thorax (superior mediastinum) directly from the arch of aorta. It ascends to the back of left sternoclavicular joint and enters the neck.
Course, Termination, and Relations:

In the neck, both arteries (right and left) have similar course.

Role of growth hormone in spermatogenesis ?,Late division of spermatocytes,Early division of spermatogonia,Formation of Acrosomes,Stimulation of seoli and Leydig cells,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Early division of spermatogoniaGrowth hormone specifically promotes early divisions of spermatogonia themselves. In the absence of GH, spermatogenesis is severely deficient or absent.Growth hormone is also essential for general metabolic process in testis.Hormones involved in spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis is influenced by many hormones. Hormones required for spermatogenesis are FSH, LH, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormones inhibin and activin.FSH is responsible for initiation of spermatogenesis. It binds with seoli cells and spermatogonia and induces the proliferation of spermatogonia. It stimulates ceoli cells to secrete endrogen binding protein, inhibin, mullerian inhibing substance and estrogen.LH stimulates leydig cells to secrete testosterone.Testosterone is the principles hormone which directly stimulates spermatogenesis. It is responsible for the sequence of remaining stages of spermatogenesis (after initiatin by FSH). It is also responsible for maintenance of spermatogenesis.Estrogen is formed from testosterone (by aromatase) in seoli cells. It is essential for spermeogenesis (last step of spermatogenesis, i.e. formation of spermatozoa from spermatids).Growth hormone is essentialy promotes early division of spermatogonia.Inhibin plays an impoant role in regulation of spermatogenesis by feedback inhibition of FSH secretion.Activin stimulates FSH secretion and stimulates spermatogenesis.",B

It is inherited as medelian autosomal dominantsdeg.- Alleles of ABO gene are located on long arm of chromosome 9 (and of Rh genes on chromosome 1). One of the 3 gene types (A, B, 0) determines blood group.- Individuals can be divided into 4 major blood group types on the basis of antigens (or agglutinogens) present on membrane of RBC. They are called agglutinogens as they are responsible for blood cell agglutination in transfusion reactions. Type A individuals have A antigen, type B have B, type AB have both A & B, and blood group type 0 have neither antigen.A and B antigens are complex oligosaccharides that differ in their terminal sugar moietyQ. H antigen is present in all blood types. H gene coding fucose transferase that adds a terminal fucose, forms H antigen. Individuals with type A express a second transferase that catalyzes placement of a terminal Nacetylgalactosamine on H antigen, whereas type B (individuals) express a second transferase that places a terminal galactose. Individuals with AB blood group have both and with 0 blood have neither transferases (i.e only H antigen persists in 0 group).Plasma antibodies against RBC agglutinogens are called agglutinins. Antigens very similar to A and B are very common in intestinal bacteria and possibly food to which new borns are exposed. These substances initiate the development of Anti A & Anti B antibodies. Therefore, infants rapidly develop antibodies against the antigens not present in their own cells. So type A blood group individual develop anti B, type B develop anti A, type 0 develop both, and type AB individual develop neither.Immediately after bih, the quantity of agglutinins in the plasma is almost zero. An infant begins to produce agglutinins, 2 to 8 months after bih and maximum titre is reached at 8 to 10 yrs. of age. Then it gradually declines throughout the remaining years of life.Anti A and anti B antibodies are isohaemagglutinins (iso antibodies) as they are produced by an individual against antigens produced by members of same species (isoantigens).Antibodies are usually 1gM type and cannot cross placenta. 0 type individual can produce IgG type antibodies.- The basic difference between ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so impoant is that - preformed ABO antibodies are present in persons serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type 0 blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs). This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example Rh negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i.e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismathced). These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.- ""In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most impoant and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individuals who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation"". But the question arises - why are these agglutinins (antibodies against AB antigen) produced in people who do not have the respective agglutinogens (A or B antigens) on their RBCs? The answer is that - Small amounts of group A and B antigens enter the body in food, in bacteria, and in other ways, and these substances initiate the development of the anti-A and anti-B agglutinins",D
Neurogenic shock is characterized by,Hypeension and tachycardia,Hypeension and bradycardia,Hypotension and tachycardia,Hypotension and bradycardia,High spinal cord injury there is failure of sympathetic outflow and adequate vascular tone (neurogenic shock). The cause in sepsis is less clear but is related to the release of bacterial products (endotoxin) and the activation of cellular and humoral components of the immune system. There is maldistribution of blood flow at a microvascular level with aeriovenous shunting and dysfunction of cellular utilization of oxygen.,D
Lipoprotein associated with carrying cholesterol from periphery tissues to liver is -,HDL ',LDL,VLDL,IDL,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., HDL o Lecithine-Cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) esterifes cholesterol in HDL during reverse cholesterol transport,o All nucleated cells in different tissues synthesize cholesterol, but the excretion of cholesterol is mainly by liver in the bile or by enterocytes in gut lumen. So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion2. This is facilitated by HDLQ and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-Ar, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A, activates LCAT.o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liver.Indirect pathwayo Cholesteryl ester is transferred from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).o This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).Direct pathwayo HDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR - BI).",A

Function of Golgi apparatus ?,Protein synthesis,Transcription,Glycosylation,Cholesterol synthesis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., GlycosylationGolgi apparatus (DietyosomelThe golgi apparatus is a stack of six or more membrane-enclosed sacs (cisterns). The cell contains one or more Golgi apparatus, usually near the nucleus. Proteins and polypeptides synthesized in the rough ER are passed on to the golgi apparatus. These secretions (polypeptide) are stored in the golgi apparatus and also concentrated, processed and packed. Fuher, it is in the golgi apparatus that sos out protein for their correct destinations, i.e., where the secretions to he sent.Processing in Golgi apparatus may include addition of the carbohydrate moiety to proteins (glycosylation) to form glycoproteins; sulphation of mucopolysaccharides to form hyaluronic acid & chondroitin sulfate; cleavage of the polypeptide chain to form the active product, for example, proinsulin is cleaved by the Golgi apparatus to form insulin.Each Golgi apparatus is a polarized structure with a cis (convex) side and a trans (concave) side. Membrane vesicles containing newly synthesized protein bud off from the rough ER and fuse with Cis (Convex) side of Golgi apparatus, i.e., Cis end is the receiving end. This protein is then process through Golgi apparatus to reach the trans (concave) side, from which vesicles bud off into the cytoplasm and are finally exocytosed from the cell. So, trans end is secretory end.",C

If lung was allowed to recoil without the chest wall in expiration what would be the lung volume?,Residual volume,FRC,Minimal value,Zero,"Ans. (C) Minimal value(Ref: Ganongs Review of Medical Physiology 25th ed; pg. 629)If the lung elastic recoil (collapsing force) is not opposed by the chest wall recoil (expanding force), the lung will collapse to minimal lung volume (which is lower than residual volume).Chest wall was removed means, lung outside pressure is ATM Pressure (O mm Hg), not the negative intrapleural pressure.So the condition is pneumothorax, like causing collapse of lung.Basic ConceptIf air is introduced into the intrapleural space (pneumothorax), the intrapleural pressure becomes equal to atmospheric pressure. Without the normal negative intrapleural pressure, the lungs will collapse (their natural tendency) and the chest wall will spring outward (its natural tendency).Collapse does not mean Zero volume, because medium size airway collapses before full alveolar collapses lading to small amount of air lung (generally 10% of TLC).Elastic Recoil and ComplianceElastic recoil is defined as the ability of stretched or inflated lung to return to its resting volume (FRC). Elastic recoil of the lung is directly related to lung stiffness, that is, the stiffer the lung, the greater is the elastic recoil (but lower compliance).The lung volume at which elastic recoil of lung and elastic recoil of chest wall are at equilibrium (i.e. equal elastic recoil force but in opposite directions) is represented by FRC. Because the lung and chest walls are recoiling equally but, in opposite directions at FRC, FRC is often referred to as the resting volume of the lungs.A change in the elastic properties of either the lungs or chest wall has a significant effect on FRC. For example, if the elastic recoil of the lung is increased (i.e. lower compliance). A new equilibrium is established between the lungs and chest wall, resulting in a decreased FRC.Conversely, if the elastic recoil of chest wall is increased, FRC is higher than normal. The elastic recoil of the chest wall at low lung volumes is a major determinant of RV in young peoples.The elastic recoil of the chest wall is such that if the chest were unopposed by the recoil of the lung, it would expand to about 70% of TLC. This volume represents the resting position of the chest wall unopposed by the lung.If the chest wall is mechanically expanded beyond its resting position, it recoils inward. At volumes <70% of TLC, the recoil of the chest wall is directed outward and is opposite to the elastic recoil of the lung. The outward elastic recoil of the chest wall is greatest at RV, whereas the inward elastic recoil of the lung is greatest at TLC.",C

The last to receive electrons in electron transport system is:,Coenzyme-Q,FADH2,O2,Cytochrome-C,"Ans. c. O2 (Ref: Harper 28/e p105,108)The last to receive electrons in electron transport system is O2Electron Transport Chain (ETC)/Respiratory ChainEnergy rich molecules like glucose are ultimately metabolized to CO2 and water.The metabolic intermediates of these oxidation reactions donate electrons to NAD/FAD to form energy rich coenzymes NADH/FADH2.These energy rich reduced coenzymes, in turn, donate electrons to a specialized series of electron carriers/donors arranged aft redox potential (EQ)- collectively called ETC.ETC is present in inner mitochondrial membrane and is the final common pathway in aerobic cells by which electrons obtained from different fuels of body flow to oxygen. This requirement of O2 makes the ETC the respiratory chain, which accounts for the greatest portion of body's use for oxygen.Electrons flow through the ETC through a redox span of 1.1 volts from NAD+/NADH to O2/H2OThe components of respiratory chain contain 4 large protein complexes (initial 2 are flavoproteins and last 2 are cytochromes) and 2 mobile electron carriers-coenzyme Q and cytochrome C.The chain reaction of e-transport starts with formation of NADH (by various substrate dehydrogenases removing hydrogen atom as in TCA cycle-isocitrate/a-ketoglutamte/malate-dehydrogenase).

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is",Aspergillosis,Candidiasis,Histoplasmosis,Mucormycosis,"Aspergillus is widespread in nature and produces small conidia that are easily aerosolized. Atopic individuals often develop severe allergic reactions to the conidial antigens. In immunocompromised patients, the conidia may germinate to produce hyphae that invade the lungs and other tissues. Progress of disease can be rapid. A diagnosis of aspergillosis is supported by a tissue biopsy showing invasion by the organism and a positive culture from a normally sterile site. Aspergilli may be airborne in the environment and be laboratory culture contaminants or present in orally obtained samples from patients without apparent clinical illness and at low risk for invasive aspergillosis and such finding should be interpreted with caution. In tissue Aspergillus spp. (most commonly A. fumigatus) have septate hyphae 3 to 6 mm in width that are described as having acute angle branching. In bone marrow transplant patient's infection may occur early after transplant or after several months as in this case. The other infections can occur in a compromised host but would differ from what is shown. Particularly, the septate hyphae and acute angle branching are not consistent with agents of mucormycosis that have wide non-septate hyphae.

GFR is opposed by,Osmotic pressure in peritubular,Osmotic pressure in glomerular,Hydrostatic pressure in peritubular,Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular,"(B] (Osmotic pressure in glomerular): (680-Ganong 24th edition, 538- Jain 5th, 317-18; Guyton 10th)Glomerular Filtration RateIn normal resting man the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) averages 125cc/min. The ultrafiltrate is derived from an average total renal plasma flow (RPF) of 600 cc/min. The ratio of glomerular ultrafiltrate to renal plasma flow is referred to as the filtration fraction (FF):FF=GFR/RPFWhere, the FF represents the fraction of plasma which is filtered across the glomerular capillary bed. Alterations in the FF can have an important effect on proximal tubular reabsorption of fluid. The glomerular filtration rate is several fold that of fluid movement in capillary beds of other tissues, principally because the surface area available for diffusion plus the permeability of the glomerular capillary membrane (Kf) is approximately 100 fold that of other capillary beds.Physical Determinants of Glomerular FiltrationThe net filtration across a capillary bed (including the glomerular capillary membrane wall is governed by the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the capillary wall.Schematic depiction of the physical determinants responsible for the formation of an ultra filtrate of plasma in Bowman's space. The principal driving force for the formation of the glomerular ultrafiltrate is the hydraulic pressure within the glomerular capillary (Pgc)- In contrast, the principle forces opposing filtration include the oncotic pressure ( 1/4 GC) within the glomerular capillary and hydrostatic pressure in Bowmans space (PBS). Net ultrafiltration is further modulated by the hydraulic permeability and surface area of the glomerular capillary (Kf).The glomerular filtration rate can be derived using the following mathematical relationshipGFR = Kf x (PGC-PBS)-(pGC-7pBs)= Kf x (AP-Att)= Kf x Pufwhere; Kf is the membrane porosity * surface area;PGC is the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary network;PBS is the Bowman's space pressure;pGC is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure;tcBS is the Bowman's space oncotic pressure;AP is the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC - PBS);Arc is the transcapillary oncotic pressure (rcGC - rcBS) andPUF is the net ultrafiltration pressureSince the glomerular ultrafiltrate is typically protein free, pi BS is equal to zero, and, thus, the oncotic pressure inBowman's space is usually excluded from the above analysis. Therefore, the major direct determinants of GFR include.* PGC* PBS* Kf* rcGCIn addition to the above direct determinants of GFR, RPF also indirectly modulates GFR.PGC - In general, increases in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure will increase GFR while decreases result in the opposite effect.p- In general, increases in Kf will tend to increase GFR while decreases will tend to decrease GFR.PBS- Normally Bowman's space pressure remains constant because of unimpeded flow of glomerular filtrate.An obstruction to urinary out flow distal to Bowman's space will result in a fall in delta P (and hence GFR) incident to a rise in Bowman's space pressure.pGC- The glomerular capillary oncotic pressure is the principle factor opposing glomerular filtrationThe pressure in the glomerular capillaries is higher than that in other capillary beds because the afferent arterioles are short, straight branches of the interlobular arteries. Further more the vessels ""downstream"" from the glomeruli, the efferent arterioles have a relatively high resistance. The capillary hydrostatic pressure is opposed hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule. It is also opposed by the oncotic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary (pGC - pT) is normally negligible and the gradient is essentially equal to the oncotic pressure of the plasma proteins.Hormones or autocoidsEffect on GFR(i) Norepinephrine, Epinephrine Endothelin,| (ii) Angiotension II -(prevent |)(iii) Endothelial derived nitric oxide prostaglandins (PGE2), Dopamine(iv) High protein intake| (v) Increased blood glucose| Uncontrolled DM|",B

Severe muscular exercise causes,Lactic acidosis,Ketoacidosis,Hypothermia,| CPK levels,"Intense Exercise. When you exercise, your body uses oxygen to break down glucose for energy. During intense exercise, there may not be enough oxygen available to complete the process, so a substance called lactate is made. Your body can conve this lactate to energy without using oxygen. But this lactate or <a href="" acid</a> can build up in your bloodstream faster than you can burn it off. The point when lactic acid stas to build up is called the ""lactate threshold.""Inhibition of Pyruvate MetabolismLeads to Lactic AcidosisArsenite and mercuric ions react with the 'SH groups of lipoic acid and inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, as does a dietary deficiency of thiamin (see Chapter 44), allowing pyruvate to accumulate. Many alcoholics are thiamin deficient (both because of a poor diet and also because alcohol inhibits thiamin absorption), and may develop potentially fatal pyruvic and lactic acidosis. Patients with inherited pyruvate dehydrogenasedeficiency, which can be the result of defects in one or more of the components of the enzyme complex, also present with lactic acidosis, paicularly after a glucose load. Because of the dependence of the brain on glucose as a fuel, these metabolic defects commonly cause neurological disturbances.

"During the asymptomatic latent phase of AIDS, the virus is actively proliferating, and can be found in association with?",B lymphocytes,Follicular dendritic cells in lymph nodes,Ganglion cells,Oligodendrocytes,"Follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centers of lymph nodes are impoant reservoirs of HIV. Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral paicles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc poion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host cell genome, producing a latent infection. These B cells undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation. Ganglion cells, paicularly the satellite cells around the ganglion cells in the dorsal root ganglia, can be infected by varicella-zoster. Herpes type I and II infect neurons that innervate skin and mucous membranes. Oligodendrocytes are directly infected by two viruses, JC virus (a polyomavirus) and measles virus. JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and measles virus produces a latent syndrome called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 58.

Synaptic conduction is mostly ohodromic because,Dendrites cannot be depolarized,"Once repolarized, an area cannot be depolarized",The strenhth of antidromic impulse is less,Chemical mediator is located only in the presynaptic terminal,"Chemical mediator is located only in the presynaptic terminal An axon can conduct the impulse in either direction. When an action potential is initiated in the middle of an axon, 2 impulses traveling in opposite directions are set up by electronic depolarization on either side of the initial current sink. In living animals, impulses normally pass in one direction only Q (from synaptic junctions or receptors along axons to their termination). Such conduction is called ohodromic. Conduction in the opposite direction is called antidromic. Q Since synapses, unlike axons, permit conduction in 1 direction only, any antidromic impulse that they set up fail to pass the first synapse they encounter and die out at that point Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number:675,676,677",D

Which of the following is false regarding glomerular capillaries:,Oncotic pressure is higher in the blood column than that in glomerular capillaries,Constriction of the afferent arteriole produces fall in capillary BP,Concentration of glucose is equal in glomerular capillaries and ultrafiltrate,Hematocrit is raised in the glomerular capillaries,"Ans. A. Oncotic pressure is higher in the blood column than that in glomerular capillariesThe factors governing filtration across the glomerular capillaries are the same as those governing filtration across all other capillaries, that is, the size of the capillary bed, the permeability of the capillaries, and the hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients across the capillary wall. For each nephron:GFR-Kf [(PGC -PT )-(pGC -pT )Kf , the glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, is the product of the glomerular capillary wall hydraulic conductivity (ie, its permeability) and the effective filtration surface area. PGC is the mean hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries, PT the mean hydrostatic pressure in the tubule (Bowman's space), pGC the oncotic pressure of the plasma in the glomerular capillaries, and pT the oncotic pressure of the filtrate in the tubulea. Now the oncotic pressure of the glomerular capillaries is the same as in any other systemic capillary i.e. 25 mm Hgb. Constriction of the afferent arteriole causes a fall in capillary BP resulting in decreased GFRc. Due to filteration of plasma, RBC are more in glomerular capillaries, so the GFR increases Concentration of all freely filtered substances like glucose are equal in glomerular capillaries and ultrafiltrate",A

Which immunoglobulin acts as receptor on B cell?,Ig G,Ig A,Ig M,Ig D,"Ig M REF: Jawetz's, Melnick, & Adelberg's Medical Microbiology, 24TH edition chapter 8. Immunology B-cell Receptor for Antigen: B cells express a form of IgM that is located on the cell surface. Cell surface IgM has the same antigen specificity as the secreted IgM antibody molecule. This is achieved by a differential RNA splicing mechanism. The -chain RNA transcript can include a sequence that encodes about 25 hydrophobic amino acids, which enables the IgM molecule to localize in the cell membrane as a trans membrane receptor. Later in development of the B cell, regulation of RNA processing allows expression of a membrane-bound form of IgD, again with the same antigen-binding specificity.

Final stage of acid production by parietal cell,Adenylate cyclase,H+-K+ ATPase pump,Calcium,Ach,"(B) H+-K+ ATPase pump > Gastric parietal cells are highly specialized for their unusual task of secreting concentrated acid. The cells are packed with mitochondria that supply energy to drive the apical H+,K+-ATPase, or proton pump, that moves H+ ions out of the parietal cell against a concentration gradient of more than a million-fold. At rest, the proton pumps are sequestered within the parietal cell in a series of membrane compartments known as tubulovesicles. When the parietal cell begins to secrete, on the other hand, these vesicles fuse with invaginations of the apical membrane known as canaliculi, thereby substantially amplifying the apical membrane area and positioning the proton pumps to begin acid secretion. The apical membrane also contains potassium channels, which supply the K+ ions to be exchanged for H+, and Cl- channels that supply the counterion for HCI secretio. The secretion of protons is also accompanied by the release of equivalent numbers of bicarbonate ions into the blood-stream, which are later used to neutralize gastric acidity once its function is complete.",B

Which of the following is not a mechanism for resistance to MRSA -,Resistance is chromosomally mediated,Produced mainly by alteration in PBP's,MRSA resistance is absolutely beta lactamase dependent,Intrinsic resistance is known,"In the previous explanation, I have explained the mechanism of antibiotic resistance in general (for all staphylococci species).
Antibiotic resistance specific to MRSA:-

Mechanism of resistance of MRSA 

There are three known mechanisms for which Staphylococcus aureus become resistant to methicillin:-


Presence of penicillin-binding protein (PBP 2a) → Most cases
Modification of normal (intrinsic) penicillin-binding protein
Hyperproduction of beta-lactamase → rare


S. aureus strains have four intrinsic penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) which have a high affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics.
PBP2a is an inducible acquired protein that is produced only by MRSA; it is not an intrinsic PBP.
PBP2a has a very low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics → S.aureus strains containing PBP2a i.e.MRSA are resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics


Production of PBP2a is chromosomally mediated. 
	Now see each option of question:


Resistance to MRSA is chromosomally mediated and involves the production of an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a).
MRSA resistance is not absolutely beta-lactamase dependent. Though altered penicillin-binding protein is involved in most strains, rarely beta-lactamase production is also involved.
Intrinsic resistance is known, that means an alteration in intrinsic PBPs is also one of the mechanisms for resistance in MRSA. (reminding you PBP2a is not an intrinsic PBP, it is an acquired PBP).",C

Following changes are seen during capacitation of a sperms except ?,Increased permeability to calcium,Decreased permeability to calcium,Removal of cholesterol from acrosome,Increased motility,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Decreased permeability to calcium Capacitation of sperm (spermatozoa) Spermatozoa leaving the testis (seminiferous ubules) are not fully mobile. They continue their maturation and acquire their mobility during their passage through epididymis. From epididymis they come to vas deference, distal end of which also receives the secretions of seminal vesicle, and continues as the ejeculatory duct. The ejeculatory duct joins the prostatic urethra. Once ejeculated into the the female, vaginal secretions improve the motility and feilizing ability of sperms. Fuher exposure to secretions of female genital tract (in uterus and/or fallopian tube) fuher improves the mobility and feilizing ability of the sperms. The beneficial effects of stay in the female genital tract are collectively called capacitation, from the isthmus, capacitated sperms move rapidly to the ampullas, where feilization takes place. Following changes occur during capacitation :- i) Uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppress sperm activity in male genital tract. ii) Removal of cholesterol vesicle from acrosome so that acrosomal membrane becomes weak and can release enzyme at the time of feilization. iii) Increase membrane permeability to calcium ion.",B

Decreased production of which of the following hormones leads to amenorrhea in anorexia nervosa?",Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH),Progesterone,Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),Estradiol,"In Anorexia nervosa, the severe reduction in GnRH pulsatility leads to suppression of FSH and LH secretion, possibly to undetectable levels, and results in anovulation and low serum estradiol levels. Given the severe psychologic and metabolic stress experienced by these individuals, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is activated. The circadian rhythm of adrenal secretion is maintained, but both coisol production and plasma coisol levels are persistently elevated secondary to increased pituitary secretion of adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH). Serum leptin levels in these individuals are significantly lower than normal healthy controls and correlate with the percentage of body fat and body weight. A rise in leptin levels in response to dietary treatment is associated with a subsequent rise in gonadotropin levels.""""Inhibition of reproduction function-- Enhanced release of the coicotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and b-endorphin suppresses GnRH release directly and indirectly through the release of glucocoicoids.

Pyridoxine deficiency leads to altered metabolism of?,Phenylalanine,Tryptophan,Methionine,Tyrosine,"ANSWER: (B) TryptophanREF: Harper 27th ed chapter 29Tryptophan is degraded to amphibolic intermediates via the kynurenine-anthranilate pathway. Tryptophan oxygenase (tryptophan pyTrolase) opens the indole ring, incorporates molecular oxygen, and forms N-formylkynurenine. An iron porphyrin metalloprotein that is inducible in liver by adrenal corticosteroids and by tryptophan, tryptophan oxygenase is feedback-inhibited by nicotinic acid derivatives, including NADPH. Hydrolytic removal of the formyl group of N-formylkynurenine, catalyzed by kynurenine formylase, produces kynurenine. Since kynureninase requires pyridoxal phosphate, excretion of xanthurenate in response to a tryptophan load is diagnostic of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency.

"The following types of reaction occur in glycolysis, except",Hydration,Isomerisations,Phosphoryl transfer,Aldol cleavage,"Step 1: Uptake and Phosphorylation of Glucose Glucose is phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate. The reaction is catalysed by the specific enzyme glucokinase in liver cells and by non-specific enzyme hexokinase in liver and extrahepatic tissue. The enzyme splits the ATP into ADP, and the Pi is added to the glucose. Hexokinase is a key glycolytic enzyme. Hexokinase catalyses a regulatory step in glycolysis that is irreversible. Hexokinase, like many other kinases, requires Mg2+ for its activity. Step 2: Isomerization of Glucose-6-Phosphate to Fructose-6-Phosphate Glucose-6-phosphate is isomerised to fructose-6-phosphate by phosphohexose isomerase. This reaction involves an aldose-ketose isomerisastion catalysed by phosphohexose isomerase. There is opening of the glucopyranose ring of glucose-6-phosphate to a linear structure which then changes to the furanose ring structure of fructose-6-phosphate. Step 3: Phosphorylation of F-6-P to Fructose 1,6-Biphosphate Fructose-6-phosphate is fuher phosphorylated to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme is phosphofructokinase-1. It catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate. The reaction is irreversible. One ATP is utilised for phosphorylation. Phosphofructokinase-1 is the key enzyme in glycolysis which regulates breakdown of glucose. Step 4: Cleavage of Fructose 1,6-Biphosphate The 6 carbon fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved into two 3 carbon units; one glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and another molecule of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The enzyme which catalyses the reaction is aldolase. Since the backward reaction is an aldol condensation, the enzyme is called aldolase. The reaction is reversible. Step 5: Interconversion of the Triose Phosphates GAP is on the direct pathway of glycolysis, whereas DHAP is not. Hence Triose-phosphate isomerase conves DHAP into GAP useful for generating ATP. Thus net result Is that glucose is now cleaved into 2 molecules of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. This reaction is rapid and reversible. Step 6: Oxidative phosphorylation of GAP to 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate The first step in the payoff phase is the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It is the energy-yielding reaction. Reactions of this type in which an aldehyde group is oxidised to an acid are accompanied by the liberation of large amounts of potentially useful energy. During this reaction, NAD+ is reduced to NADH. This is a reversible reaction. Step 7: Conversion of 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate to 3-Phosphoglycerate The enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase transfers the high-energy phosphoryl group from the carboxyl group of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. This is a unique example where ATP can be produced at substrate level without paicipating in electron transpo chain. This type of reaction where ATP is formed at substrate level is called as Substrate level phosphorylation. Step 8: Conversion of 3-Phosphoglycerate to 2-Phosphoglycerate 3-phosphoglycerate is isomerized to 2-phosphoglycerate by shifting the phosphate group from 3rd to 2nd carbon atom. The enzyme is phosphoglucomutase. This is a readily reversible reaction. Mg2+ is essential for this reaction. Step 9: Dehydration of 2-Phosphoglycerate to Phosphoenolpyruvate 2-phosphoglycerate is conveed to phosphoenolpyruvate by the enzyme enolase. One water molecule is removed. A high energy phosphate bond is produced. The reaction is reversible. Enolase requires Mg++. Step 10: Conversion of Phosphoenol Pyruvate to Pyruvate Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is dephosphorylated to pyruvate, by pyruvate kinase. First PEP is made into a transient intermediary of enol pyruvate; which is spontaneously isomerized into keto pyruvate, the stable form of pyruvate. One mole of ATP is generated during this reaction. This is again an example of substrate level phosphorylation. The pyruvate kinase is a key glycolytic enzyme. This step is irreversible.

Frame shift mutation does not effect complete amino acid sequence if it occurs in multiple of ?,I,2,3,None,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 3 Frame-shift mutation Frameshift mutationsQ occur due to inseion or deletionQ of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation.If I or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule.If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same. This is because the genetic code is read in form of triplets of nucleotides (i.e. codons).If one or two base pairs from the code are removed or inseed, the genetic code will be misread from that change onwards because genetic code is not punctate. Therefore the amino acid sequence translated from the change onwards will be completely changed.However if the removal/inseion happens in multiple of three, rest of the reading from does not change and hence the amino acid sequence will not change.",C

Carnitine required for which process in fatty acid cycle?,Fatty acid synthesis,Fatty acid oxidation,Fatty acid storage,Ketone body synthesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fatty acid oxidation * As fatty acid is nonpolar, it passively diffuses into a cell across cell membrane. As soon as it has reached cytoplasm, fatty acid has a propensity to passively diffuses back into circulation again for the same reason - it is non polar. Fatty acid has gotten into a cell for a purpose. We can't afford to miss fatty acid. So, Fatty acid has to be trapped in a polar form. That is done by acyl CoA synthetase (three types of this enzyme are available - for short chain, medium chain and long chain), which uses two high energy phosphates (ATP - AMP + PPi) and it converts fatty acid into polar acyl CoA.* Further fate of fatty acid which is in the acyl CoA depends upon the energy status of the cell. If the energy status of the cell is already high, the fatty acid need not be oxidised but has to be stored as triacylglycerol. If the energy status of the cell is low, fatty acid has to be oxidised - for which fatty acid has to get into mitochondria. As polar acyl CoA long chain fatty acids can not cross mitochondria. They need a carrier, Carnitine (SHORT CHAIN AND MEDIUM CHAIN FATTY ACIDS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON CARNITINE TO CROSS MITOCHONDRIA)* So carnitine is a carrier of long chain fatty acids and is involved in fatty acid oxidation.* The enzyme involved in the conversion of long chain fatty acyl co A to Acyl carnitine is Carnitine Acyl T ransferase-I (CAT-I)1. This enzyme is placed in the outer mitochondrial membrane.* After Acyl carnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane, Carnitine acyl transferase II converts acyl carnitine to acyl coA and this acyl coA is oxidised.* Other facts about carnitine:# Carnitine is Beta hydroxyl gamma trimethyl ammonium butyrate.# It is synthesised from lysine and methionine in liver and kidney.# Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of carnitine.'CAT I is the enzyme which commits fatty acid to oxidation. Because, until CATI acts, the fatty acids can either get into fatty acid oxidation or they can be stored as triacylglycerol. Hence CATI is considered as the rate limiting emzyme of fatty acid oxidation",B
Earliest immune response is by -,IgM,IgG,IgA,IgE,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., IgMo The antibody response to an initial antigenic stimulus differes qualitatively and quantitatively from the response to subsequent stimuli with same antigeno Former is called primary response and the latter secondary response :a) Primary response# Primary immne response refers to the first encounter of immune system with an antigen.# The antibody that is elided first is entirely of the IgM type. IgM antibody titre rises to a peak level and then declines almost as fast as it developed.# In a few days IgG appears.

Alpha helix and Beta pleated sheet are examples of-,Primary',Secondary structure,Tertiary',Quaternary' structure,"Ans. is 'b' i.e,,, Secondary structure Structural organization of proteinso Eveiy protein has a unique three dimensional structure, which is referred to as its native conformation and made up of only 20 different amino acids. Protein structure can be classified into four level of organization.1) Primary structuresThe linear sequence of amino acid residues and location of disulphide bridges, if any, in a polypeptide chain constitute its primary structure. In simple words,primary structure of proteins refers to the specific sequence of amino acids. Primary structure is maintained by covalent 'peptide' bond.Secondary structureFor stability of primary structure, hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of NH and oxygen of C = O groups of the polypeptide chain occurs, which give rise to twisting, folding or bending of the primary structure. Thus, regular folding and twisting of the polypeptide chain brought about by hydrogen bonding is called secondary structure. Important types of secondary structure are a-helix,b-pleated sheet and b-hends.Tertiary structureThe peptide chain, with its secondary structure, may be further folded and twisted about itself forming three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide chain, i.e., tertiary structure refers to the overall folding pattern of polypeptide which forms three dimensional shape. Tertiary structure (three dimensional shape) is maintained by weak non-covalent interactions which include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bond (electrostatic bonds or salt bridges) and Van-der wall forces. Covalent linkage (disulphide bond) also plays some (but minor) role.Quaternary structureMany proteins are made up of more than one polypeptide chains (polymers), Each polypeptide chain is known as protomer (or subunit). The subunit are linked with each other by non-covalent bonds. The structure formed by union of subunits is known as quaternary structure, i.e., spatial relation of subunits (peptide chains) with one another is called quaternary structure. Mainly three non-covalent bonds stabilize quaternary structure : Hydrophobic, hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic).# Dimeric proteins contain two polypeptide chains. Homodimers contain two copies of same polypeptide chain, while in a heterodimer the polypeptides differ.",B

Weakness on one side will lead to a drop in the pelvis on the contralateral side of the pelvis while walking (Trendelenburg sign, lurching gait). With bilateral weakness there will be dropping of the pelvis on both sides during walking leading to waddling. This gait is seen in patient with bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury and myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy.Positive Trendelenburg's sign due to Injury to Superior Gluteal Nerve:The Trendelenburg's sign is said to be positive if, when standing on one leg, the pelvis drops on the side opposite to the stance leg. The weakness is present on the side of the stance leg. The body is not able to maintain the center of gravity on the side of the stance leg. Normally, the body shifts the weight to the stance leg, allowing the shift of the center of gravity and consequently stabilizing or balancing the body. However, in unilateral superior gluteal nerve injury, when the patient lifts the opposing leg, the shift is not created and the patient cannot maintain balance leading to instability (Lurching gait). Bilateral superior gluteal nerve injury results in a waddling gait.NOTE: Not to be confused with Trendelenburg's sign.

P 563* The influence of lumen diameter on resistance is dramatic. This is because resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the blood vessel (one-half of the vessels diameter) raised to the fourth power (R=1/r4).* This means, that if an artery or arteriole constricts to one-half of its original radius, the resistance to flow will increase 16 times.

Sixth-order branches can be visualized with resolution superior to that of conventional invasive contrast pulmonary angiography. CTPA is the first-line diagnostic test . It has the advantage of visualising the distribution and extent of the emboli or highlighting an alternative diagnosis, such as consolidation, pneumothorax or aoic dissection. The sensitivity of CT scanning may be increased by simultaneous visualisation of the femoral and popliteal veins, although this is not widely practised. As the contrast media may be nephrotoxic, care should be taken in patients with renal impairment, and CTPA avoided in those with a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media. In these cases, either V/Q scanning or ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V /Q SPECT) may be considered Colour Doppler ultrasound of the leg veins may be used in patients with suspected PE, paicularly if there are clinical signs in a limb, as many will have identifiable proximal thrombus in the leg veins.

The risk of Wilms tumor is increased with at least three recognizable groups of congenital malformations associated with distinct chromosomal loci. Although Wilms tumors arising in this setting account for no more than 10% of cases, these syndromic tumors have provided impoant insight into the biology of this neoplasm. * The first group of patients has the WAGR syndrome, characterized by Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital anoma-lies, and mental retardation. Their lifetime risk of developing Wilms tumor is approximately 33%. Individuals with WAGR syndrome carry constitutional (germline) deletions of 11p13. Studies on these patients led to the identification of the first Wilms tumor-associated gene, WT1, and a contiguously deleted autosomal dominant gene for aniridia, PAX6, both located on chromosome 11p13. Patients with deletions restricted to PAX6, with normal WT1 function, develop sporadic aniridia, but they are not at increased risk for Wilms tumors.9 479-480",C

A deficiency of substance B12 can result in an anemia. Choose the type of anemia that would occur if the substance were deficient.,Megaloblastic anemia,"Hypochromic, microcytic anemia",Hemolytic anemia,Sickle cell anemia,"Functions of vitamin B12 a. Vitamin B12 contains cobalt in a corrin ring that resembles a porphyrin.(1). Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (see Fig below).(a). This reaction is involved in the production of succinyl-CoA from valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and the propionyl-CoA formed by the oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons.(2). Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups from FH4 to homocysteine to form methionine (see Figure below).A vitamin B12 deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia plus demyelination of nerves, because of reduced levels of SAM in the nervous system. These cells are large because the vitamin deficiency interferes with DNA synthesis, and the cells double in size without being able to replicate their DNA. Once the anemia begins, the large blast cells are released by the marrow in an attempt to control the anemia. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia can result from the lack of iron, or lack of pyridoxal phosphate. Both conditions lead to a reduction in the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, substituting a valine for a glutamic acid.The transfer of a 1-carbon unit from serine to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). FH4 is oxidized to FH2 in this reaction. FH2 is reduced to FH4 by dihydrofolate reductase. The rectangles indicate the steps at which the antimetabolites methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil act.

Enzyme specificity,Amount of enzyme causing transformation of 1 H.mol of substrate per minute under standard conditions,"Amount of enzyme required per second, per mole of product formation",Number of sited per substrate,Amount of enzyme binding with various substrates,"Some enzymes are absolutely specific. For example, hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide is catalyzed by urease. Urea is the only substrate for urease. Thiourea, though structurally similar to urea, will not act as the substrate for urease. Similarly, glucose oxidase will oxidize only beta-D-glucose and no other isomeric form. Thus, these enzymes show absolute specificity. Enzyme activity is expressed as micromoles of substrate conveed to product per minute under specified assay conditions.

"After hyperventilating for sometime, holding the breath is dangerous, since:",It can lead to CO2 necrosis,Due to lack of stimulation by CO2 anoxia can go into dangerous levels,Decreased CO2 shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left,Alkalosis can lead to tetany,"In respiratoy alkalosis, there is an increase in extracellular fluid pH and a decrease in H+ concentration. The cause of the alkalosis is a decrease in plasma pCO2, caused by hyperventilation. The reduction in pCO2, then leads to a decrease in the rate of H+ secretion by the renal tubules. The decrease in H+ secretion reduces the amount of H+ in the renal tubular fluid. Consequently, there is not enough H+ to react with all the HCO3- that is filtered. Therefore, the HCO3- that cannot react with H+ is not reabsorbed and is exreted in the urine. This results in a decrease in plasma HCO3- concentration and correction of the alkalosis. Therefore, the compensatory response to a primary reduction in pCO2 in respiratory alkalosis is a reduction in plasma HCO3- concentration, caused by increased renal exretion of HCO3- 
Changes in plasma hydrogen ion concentration can influence the degree of calcium binding to plasma proteins. With acidosis, less calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Conversely, in alkalosis, a greater amount of calcium is bound to the plasma proteins. Therefore, patients with alkalosis are more susceptible to hypocalcemic tetany.",D

The diencephalon has four parts on each side: the thalamus, subthalamus, epithalamus, and hypothalamus.b. The thalamus, by far the largest component, is subdivided into nuclei that have different afferent and efferent connections. Certain thalamic nuclei receive input from the pathways for all the senses except smell; these nuclei project to corresponding sensory areas of the cerebral cortex. Other thalamic nuclei are connected with motor and association areas of the cortex, and yet others participate in memory, sleep, and mental activities.c. The subthalamus is a complex region ventral to the thalamus; it includes a nucleus with motor functions (the subthalamic nucleus) and tracts from the brain stem, cerebellum, and corpus striatum, which terminate in the thalamus.d. The epithalamus, situated dorso medially to the thalamus and adjacent to the roof of the third ventricle, consists of the anterior and posterior paraventricular nuclei, the medial and lateral habenular nuclei, the stria medullaris thalami, posterior commissure and the pineal body.

Any irregularities in their function lead to a range of developmental defects. These growth factors generally act as systemic or locally circulating molecules of extracellular origin that activate cell surface receptors. A defining propey of FGFs is that they bind to heparin and heparan sulfate, thus some of them are found to be sequestered in the extracellular matrix of tissues that contains heparan sulfate proteoglycans and they are released locally upon injury or tissue remodeling Both morphogenic and mitogen",A

"Shift to right of oxygen dissociation curve is caused by all, EXCEPT:",Fall in pH,Rise in temperatures,"Decrease in 2,3 BPG",None of the above,"Three impoant conditions affect the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve: the pH, the temperature, and the concentration of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate (BPG; 2,3-BPG). A rise in temperature or a fall in pH shifts the curve to the right. When the curve is shifted in this direction, a higher PO2 is required for hemoglobin to bind a given amount of O2. Conversely, a fall in temperature or a rise in pH shifts the curve to the left, and a lower PO2 is required to bind a given amount of O2. A convenient index for comparison of such shifts is the P50, the PO2 at which hemoglobin is half saturated with O2. The higher the P50, the lower the affinity of hemoglobin for O2.

HBsAg become undetectable 1-2 months after the onset of jaundice and rarely persists beyond 6 months. In chronic HBV infection, HBsAg remains detectable beyond 6 months. HBc Ag It is not demonstrable in the circulation because it is enclosed within the HBs Ag coat. HBc Ag remain in the hepatocyte, where it can readily be detectable by immunohistochemical staining. HBe Ag HBe Ag appears concurrently with or sholy after HBs Ag. HBe Ag is an indicator of active intrahepatic replication and high infectivity. It is a qualitative marker of HBV replication. HBs Ag carrier mothers who are HBeAg positive almost invariably (> 90%) transmit hepatitis B infection to their offspring, where as HBs Ag carrier mothers with anti HBe rarely (10 to 15%) infect their offspring. HBe testing is indicated primarily during follow up of chronic infection. Anti HBc Ag o Appears within the first 1 to 2 weeks after the appearance of HBs Ag. In acute or recent infection IgM anti HBc is detected. Ig G anti HBc indicates remote infection. Anti HBs Ag o It becomes detectable in blood when HBs Ag disappears.

Following this, vancomycin was staed but the culture remained positive for the same organism even after 2 weeks of therapy. The most likely organism causing infection is",Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococci viridans,Enterococcus faecalis,Coagulase negative Staphylococcus,"Enterococci are present in the intestine, genital tract and saliva. They are frequently isolated from cases of urinary tract infection and wound infection. Also causes endocarditis, infection of the biliary tract, septicemia and intra-abdominal abscess complicating diveiculitis and peritonitis. Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, So it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of the D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

S2 is due to:,Rapid gush of blood in ventricle,Atrial contraction,AV valve closure,Semilunar valve closure,"The Second Heart Sound Is Associated with Closure of the Aortic and Pulmonary Valves. 
The second heart sound results from sudden closure of the semilunar valves (i.e., the aortic and pulmonary valves) at the end of systole. 
When  the  semilunar valves close, they bulge backward toward the ventricles and their elastic stretch recoils the blood back into the arteries, which causes a short period of  reverberation  of  blood  back  and  forth  between  the walls of the arteries and the semilunar valves, as well as between these valves and the ventricular walls. The vibrations occurring in the arterial walls are then transmitted mainly along the  arteries. When the vibrations of the vessels or ventricles come into contact with a “sounding board,” such as the chest wall, they create sound that can be heard.

HSL is an intracellular neutral lipase that is capable of hydrolyzing a variety of esters. The enzyme has a long and a short form. The long form is expressed in steroidogenic tissues such as testis, where it converts cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol for steroid hormone production. The short form is expressed in adipose tissue, among others, where it hydrolyzes stored triglycerides to free fatty acidsHSL is activated when the body needs to mobilize energy stores, and so responds positively to catecholamines, ACTH, and negatively to insulin. Previously, glucagon was thought to activate HSL, however the removal of insulins inhibitory effects ('cutting the brakes"") is the source of activation.There are various types of lipases in the human body:HormoneFunction and locationBile salt dependent lipasePancreas and breast. Aids in digestion of fatPancreatic lipasePancreatic juiceLysosomal lipaseIntracellularly, in the lysosomes.Hepatic lipaseEndothelium of liver and adrenals, convert intermediate-density1, lipoprotein (IDL) to low-density lipoprotein (LDL).LipoproteinlipaseExpressed on endothelial cells in the heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Dual functions of triglyceride hydrolase and ligand,''bridging factor for receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. Hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, such as those found in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), into two free fatty acids and one monoacylglycerol molecule. It is also involved in promoting the cellular uptake of chylomicron remnants, cholesterol-rich lipoproteins, and free fatty acids. Through catalysis, VLDL is converted to IDL and then to LDL. LPL requires Apo-CII as a cofactor.Hormone sensitive lipaseEndothelium of adipose tissue and gonads. HSL functions to hydrolyze the first fatty acid from a triacyiglycerol molecule, freeing a fatty acid and diglyceride. Enzyme is affected by hormones; hence its hormone-sensitive lipase name. It is activated by cAMP by protein kinase. Growth hormone, glucagon, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones increase the activity, while insulin and prostaglandins decrease its activity.Gastric lipaseGastric lipase is an acidic lipase secreted by the gastric chief cells in the fun- dic mucosa in the stomach. Gastric lipase together with lingual lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases. These lipases, unlike alkaline lipases (such as pancreatic lipase), do not require bile acid or colipase for optimal enzymatic activity.",A

True about DNA structure,Purines are adenine and guanine & pyrimidines are uracil and cytosine,Waston and Crick discovered structure in 1973,Deoxyribose - phosphate backbone with bases stacked inside,Mainly consists of left handed helix,"Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) stores information for the synthesis of specific proteins. DNA has deoxyribose as its sugar. DNA consists of a phosphate group, a sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA is a helical, double-stranded macromolecule with bases projecting into the interior of the molecule. These two strands are always complementary in sequence. One strand serves as a template for the formation of the other during DNA replication, a major source of inheritance. This unique feature of DNA provides a mechanism for the continuity of life. The structure of DNA was found by Rosalind Franklin when she used x-ray crystallography to study the genetic material. The x-ray photo she obtained revealed the physical structure of DNA as a helix. DNA has a double helix structure. The outer edges are formed by alternating deoxyribose sugar molecules and phosphate groups, which make up the sugar-phosphate backbone. The two strands run in opposite directions, one going in a 3' to 5' direction and the other going in a 5' to 3' direction. The nitrogenous bases are positioned inside the helix structure like ""rungs on a ladder,"" due to the hydrophobic effect, and stabilized by hydrogen bonding.",C

Carnitine shuttle is involved in -,Fatty acid synthesis,Fatty acid oxidation,Cholesterol synthesis,Bile acid synthesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Fatty acid oxidation* Very short chain, short chain, medium chain and long chain fatty acids get oxidized in mitochondria* Very short chain, short chain and medium chain fatty acids can cross inner mitochondrial membrane by passive diffusion* Long chain fatty acids cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane. Hence they need a carrier. The carrier is carnitine.* Carnitine is b hydroxy g N trimethylaminobutyric acid. It is synthesized from lysine.* In the outer mitochondrial membrane, Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase I allows carnitine to react with acyl CoA to form Acylcarnitine.* Acyl carnitine crosses the inner mitochondrial membrane with the help of a translocase.* Along the inner mitochondrial membrane, Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase II acts on acyl carnitine, attaches CoA to it, converting acyl carnitine to acyl CoA. Carnitine, comes out of mitochondria through the same translocase, which transports acyl carnitine inside the matrix.* Now the acyl CoA is ready to get oxidized in the mitochondrial matrix.* Clinical Significance:# Any defect in carnitine shuttle results in defective (3 oxidation of fatty acids. Cardiac muscle fibres, Red muscle fibres are dependent on fatty acid oxidation. Hence it presents with cardiomyopathy and exercise intolerance. Biochemically they present with non ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia and dicarboxylic aciduria.",B

"Upon contact between the sperm head and the zona pellucida, penetration of the sperm into the egg is allowed because of:",The acrosome reaction,The zona reaction,The perivitelline space,Pro nuclei formation,"Ans. A. The acrosome reactionThe acrosome reaction causes a fusion of the plasma membrane and the acrosomal membrane of the sperm, with subsequent release of proteolytic enzymes that help the sperm enter the ovum. The zona reaction and Pro nuclei formation occur after the sperm has entered the ovum. Sperm enter the perivitelline space after penetration; there is no evidence that this space has any role in penetration. Cumulus expansion assists in movement of the sperm through the mass of granulosa cells for the sperm to get to the surface of the zona pellucida. However, the cumulus cells do not assist in actual penetration of the zona.",A

One of your patients is diagnosed with retinoblastoma. He has a single tumor in one eye. The patient is worried whether his children would suffer from the same condition. What test could be used to determine whether it is a heritable or sporadic tumor?,DNA footprinting,Fluorescence-activated cell soing (FACS),Nohern blotting,PCR,"Foy percent of retinoblastomas are heritable; the child inherits one mutant allele through the germline and a somatic mutation in the other allele occurs, resulting in the loss of function of that gene. This leads to tumor development, often with multiple tumors in both eyes. Penetrance, however, is not complete, since the second mutation is a chance event. Sixty percent of retinoblastomas are sporadic; both alleles are inactivated by somatic mutation. Because this is a rare event, tumors usually are in only one eye and present at a later age. To detect a mutation in the Rb gene and differentiate between heritable and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma, PCR is the most appropriate technique of the choices given. Using the appropriate primers, a deletion can be detected as a change in size of the DNA band amplified. In heritable cases, one chromosome will show the altered length from the deletion or the translocation in any cell in the body. In sporadic retinoblastoma, samples isolated from anywhere other than the tumor should have two normal alleles. DNA footprinting is a protocol used to detect specific protein binding to DNA molecules by comparing the fragmentation patterns of DNA bound with the protein of interest vs. unbound DNA following digestion with DNase I. If the bound protein protects against DNase I digestion, the position of the protein on the DNA can be deduced by the loss of the characteristic fragment. FACS uses antibodies coupled to fluorescent markers to determine cell surface molecules on whole cells. It is very useful for determining the stage of development or activation of cells, but does not give you any insight into the DNA. Nohern blotting, the RNA counterpa to Southern blotting, will determine the size and abundance of mRNA of a specific gene in a given sample of RNA. RNA is not able to be cleaved by restriction enzymes the way the DNA can; however, RNA molecules for different proteins are of different lengths. The sample is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a specific, labeled probe. This will be exposed to film and the bands will appear, revealing the size and the abundance of specific mRNAs.",D

Which of the following is not secreted by the pancreas,Procarboxypeptidase,Trypsinogen,Phospholipase A,Pepsinogen,"Pancreatic juice is secreted most abundantly in response to the presence of chyme in the upper portions of the small intestine, and the characteristics of the pancreatic juice are determined to some extent by the types of food in the chyme. (The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestine-by  the  islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas). The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin.
Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause  release  of  individual  amino  acids. However,  carboxypolypeptidase splits  some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is  pancreatic  amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates  (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides.The main enzymes for fat digestion are
(1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into  fatty  acids  and  monoglycerides; 
(2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters;and 
(3)  phospholipase,  which splits fatty acids  from phospholipids.
When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in the inactive forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen.  Chymotrypsinogen is  activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner.",D

All known effects of cyclic AMP in eukaryotic cells results from,Activation of the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase,Activation of synthetase,Activation of protein kinase,Activation Phosphorylation of G protein,"More than a thousand protein kinases are now known. Some impoant hormone responsive protein kinases are cAMPdependent kinases, epidermal growth factor- dependent tyrosine kinase, insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase. All the known effects of cAMP in eukaryotic cells result from activation of protein kinases, which are serine/threonine kinases.Ceain enzymes are activated by dephosphorylation Hepatic Protein Phosphatase-1 is a typical example where the enzyme itself is inhibited by phosphorylationof its regulatory subunit. When cyclic AMP level falls, the regulatory subunit is dephosphorylated and protein phosphatase becomes active, which in turn hydrolyzesphosphate group from the enzyme. Protein kinases, as well as protein phosphatases, are involved in the action of different hormones. The actions of cAMP in eukaryotic cells are multifaceted and these include:A) Activation of Protein kinase and phosphorylation of effector proteins like enzymes and ion channels. These enzymes may directly phosphorylate enzymes or secondary kinases that phosphorylate other enzymes. For example,PKA phosphorylates hormone-sensitive lipase thus activating it.Phosphorylase Kinase that phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase.When ion channel proteins or transpoers are phosphorylated, the membrane potential is modified, thus regulating the influx of calcium.B) cAMP also has a long-lasting effect on gene expression. The translocation of the active PKA subunits to the nucleus induces phosphorylation of cAMP-regulated gene regulatory proteins or CREBs. These proteins will bind to cAMP-sensitive regulatory elements (CRE) on genes, thus controlling their expression.Ref: DM Vasudevan, Page no: 523",C

Investigation for definitive identification of cryptosporodium: March 2010,ELISA,Immunofluorescence test,Demonstration of oocyte in feces,Fluoroscent staining with auramine,"Ans. B: Immunofluorescence test Diagnosis of cryptosporidium is made by demonstration of oocyst in feces Methods of detection and confirmation of cryptosporodium Wet mount-In bright-field microscopy using differential interference contrast (DIC), oocysts appear as small round structures (4 to 6 im) similar to yeasts. They do not autofluoresce. Modified acid-fast stain-Oocysts (4 to 6 im) often have distinct oocyst walls and stain from light pink to bright red. In paicular, infections that are resolving can have colorless oocyst ""ghosts."" Mature oocysts may have discernible sporozoites (up to 4). Indirect fluorescent antibody assay-This technique offers the highest combination of sensitivity and specificity and is considered the gold standard. However, it does not provide a stained slide that can be archived. It requires special equipment (fluorescence microscope) and commercially available test kits. Methods for detection (but not confirmation) of Cryptosporidium Oocysts may be detected by the following methods, but should be confirmed by the diagnostic techniques listed above. Safranin stain-Oocysts of Cryptosporidium often (but not always) stain a bright reddish-orange color. This method, advocated for Cyclospora, is not widely used for Cryptosporidium because the Cryptosporidium oocysts may not always properly stain. - Trichrome stain-Oocysts may be detected, but should not be confirmed, by this method. This staining method is inadequate for definitive diagnosis because all oocysts will appear unstained. Oocysts appear as small round structures measuring 4 to 6 im.

A 10 year old girl presents with sore throat and fever. She denies any cough or rhinorrhea. A throat culture grows bacitracin-sensitive bacterial colonies. The infecting organism would be protected from the lytic action of detergents by its?,Keratin-like proteins in the spore coat,Lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane,Peptidoglycan layer,Periplasmic space,"This girl has streptococcal pharyngitis. The infecting organism is group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (S. pyogenes); its growth is inhibited by the placement of a bacitracin disk on the throat culture plate. (Beta-hemolysis occurs as the result of the bacterial hemolysin streptolysin S). This is a gram-positive bacterium and therefore possesses a very thick peptidoglycan layer that would protect it from lysis by detergents. (Note that gram-positives also contain teichoic acid.) In contrast, gram-negatives have a thin peptidoglycan layer. Keratin-like proteins in the spore coat and calcium ion chelators (dipicolinic acid) are found in spores formed by species of Bacillus and Clostridium. These protect the spores from the elements: dehydration, heat, chemicals, radiation, etc. Lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane and a periplasmic space are found in gram-negative organisms. The lipopolysaccharide is an endotoxin and the periplasmic space contains beta-lactamase in some species. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 25. Streptococci and Enterococci. In C.G. Ray, K.J.

Function of floccunodular lobe of cerebellum is: March 2008,Co-ordination of movements,Equilibrium,Chemoreception,Planning of movements,"Ans. B: Equilibrium From a functional point of view, the cerebellum is divided into three pas: The nodulus in the vermis and the flanking flocculus in the hemisphere on each side form the flocculonodular lobe, or vestibulocerebellum. This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest pa of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial poions of the hemispheres form the spinocerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the ""motor plan"" from the motor coex. By comparing plan with performance, it smoothes and coordinates movements that are ongoing. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles, whereas the hemispheres project the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles. The lateral poions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebrocerebellum, or neocerebellum. They are the newest from a phylogenetic point of view, reaching their greatest development in humans. They interact with the motor coex in planning and programming movements.",B

What biologist uses to diagnose and treat diseases with disorders with multigenic inheritance?,Gene card,Tag SNPs,Flipped card,Virtual Cell,"Ans. B. Tag SNP(Ref: Robbins 9/epagel79)Linkage and Association StudiesThere are two primary strategies for mapping genes that cause or increase susceptibility to human disease:1. Classic linkage can be performed based on a known genetic model or, when the model is unknown, by studying pairs of affected relatives2. Disease genes can be mapped using allelic association studies (Genome Wide Association Studies, GWAS)Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have elucidated numerous disease-associated loci and are providing novel insights into the allelic architecture of complex traits.These studies have been facilitated by the availability of comprehensive catalogues of human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotypes generated through the HapMap Project.The data generated by the HapMap Project are greatly facilitating GWAS for the characterization of complex disorders. Adjacent SNPs are inherited together as blocks, and these blocks can be identified by genotyping selected marker SNPs, so-called Tag SNPs, thereby reducing cost and workload.",B
"An individual has been on a fad diet for 6 weeks and has begun to develop a number of skin rashes, diarrhea, and forgetfulness. These symptoms could have been less severe if the diet contained a high content of which one of the following?",Tyrosine,Tryptophan,Thiamine,Thymine,"At least eight different carrier proteins transport different groups of amino acids.a. Sodium-amino acid carrier system(1). A number of transport systems involve the uptake by the cell of a sodium ion and an amino acid by the same carrier protein on the luminal surface (examples are systems A, ASC, N, and B).(2). The sodium ion is pumped from the cell into the blood by the Na+-K+ ATPase, whereas the amino acid travels down its concentration gradient into the blood.(a). Thus, the transport of amino acids from the intestinal lumen to the blood is driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (secondary active transport).b. The L-system of amino acid transport is not dependent on sodium for cotransport. The L-system transports branched-chain and aromatic amino acids and will be exploited in a treatment for phenylketonuria (PKU).The individual has developed pellagra caused by a lack of dietary niacin.

It is a ubiquitous enveloped DNA virus. Only one serotype of EBV has been recognized, although molecular methods have reorganized a number of genotypes of EBV.Infectious mononucleosis is an acute disease most commonly seen in younger people. It is characterized by a proliferation of lymphocytes, lymph node enlargement, pharyngitis, fatigue, and fever. Infection in young children is usually either asymptomatic or characteristic of an acute upper respiratory infection. Diagnosis is usually made by a positive heterophil test. Heterophil antibodies are those that occur in one species (human) and react with antigens of a different species. The heterophil test may be insensitive (30 to 60%) in children. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of antibodies to EBV components.EBV causes a variety of other syndromes including Burkitt's lymphoma, the most common childhood cancer in Africa, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly seen in China.Similar mononucleosis-like diseases are caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite. CMV causes fewer than 10% of infectious mononucleosis-like diseases. CMV ""mono"" is primarily characterized by fatigue. Congenital infection with CMV almost always causes serious sequelae, such as retardation and hearing loss.

Which is true about measurement of BP with sphygmomanometer versus intra-aerial pressure measurements?,Less than intravascular pressure,More than intravascular pressure,Equal to intravascular pressure,Depends upon blood flow,"The reason for this is - ""dissipation of pressure"". When BP is measured by sphygmomanometry, the principle is 'balancing of pressure between the cuff and the brachial aery'. Suppose the pressure in the aery is, say, 100 mm Hg. When the pressure just outside the aery is 100 mm Hg, the aery will be occluded completely, or when the pressure outside the aery becomes just less than 100, the aery will open up and the flow will sta in the aery. However, for pressure just outside the aery to be 100, pressure in the cuff has to be about 106 mm Hg; about 6 mm Hg is dissipated in the intervening tissue (muscle, fat) between the cuff and the aery. Thus, if we are looking for a point at which the aery is just occluded (with aerial pressure being 100), the cuff pressure at which it happens is about 106 mm Hg Hence, by sphygmomanometry, the pressure measured is higher as compared to direct intravascular pressure measurement.",B

A young boy presents with failure to thrive. Biochemical analysis of a duodenal aspirate after a meal reveals a deficiency of enteropeptidase (enterokinase). The levels of which of the following digestive enzymes would be affected?,Amylase,Colipase,Lactase,Trypsin,"Enteropeptidase, formerly called enterokinase, activates trypsinogen by limited proteolytic digestion to give trypsin. Trypsin is itself capable of activating trypsinogen, which produces a positive feedback effect. Trypsin also activates chymotrypsinogen (and several other proteolytic enzymes), so deficiency of enteropeptidase results in a severe deficiency of enzymes that digest protein. Amylase aids in the breakdown of starches to oligosaccharides, maltose, and maltotriose. Colipase, along with other lipases, functions to digest fats. Lactase is a brush-border disaccharidase that hydrolyzes the bond between galactose and glucose in lactose. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 25.

Although the trabeculae are normal in number and size, they do not mineralize effectively, and the rim of uncalcified osteoid is much larger than normal. Osteoclast activity is normal in osteomalacia. Increased osteoclast activity is typical of hyperparathyroidism and Paget's disease of bone. There are increased numbers of osteoblasts in osteomalacia, which lay down increased quantities of osteoid in an effo to strengthen the bone. Unfounately, the increased osteoid is not mineralized and the bone remains soft and weak. The bone marrow space is normal in osteomalacia. Marrow fibrosis is more typical of hematopoietic disorders, although hyperparathyroidism may also lead to bone marrow fibrosis. Ref: Molina P.E. (2013). Chapter 5.

Peristaltic reflex of the small intestine is controlled by the following:,Vagus nerve,Enteric nervous system,Sympathetic system,Parasympathetic system,"Peristaltic reflex results from localized chemical or mechanical stimulation of the small intestine results in a contraction on the oral side of the stimulus and relaxation on the anal side. These responses are controlled by the enteric nervous system. Sensory neurons that respond to chemicals (eg, acids) or mechanical stimuli (stroking the mucosa or stretch of the muscle with a bolus of digesta) activate excitatory ascending interneurons, which then innervate excitatory motor neurons. These neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, and the neuropeptide substance P, which activates receptors on circular muscle cells to trigger contraction. The sensory neurons also excite descending interneurons that innervate inhibitory motor neurons. They, in turn, release inhibitory neurotransmitters, VIP, and nitric oxide, which relax circular muscle. Ref: Mills J.C., Stappenbeck T.S., Bunnett N. (2010). Chapter 13. Gastrointestinal Disease.

All are features of unilateral 3rd Cranial nerve nuclear injury except-(not sure of options),B/L incomplete Ptosis,weakness of the ipsilateral superior rectus muscles,weakness of the contralateral superior rectus muscles,Unilateral Ptosis,"Pure unilateral lesions of the oculomotor nucleus are rare. Paresis of isolated muscles innervated by oculomotor branches is almost always due to a lesion of their branches within the orbit or to disease processes that affect the muscle or myoneural junction. Nuclear lesions, however, may cause isolated weakness of one of the muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve, except the superior rectus muscle (crossed innervation noted previously), the levator palpebrae superioris (a single caudal subnucleus innervates the levators bilaterally), the pupillary constrictors (visceral nuclei are spread throughout the oculomotor nucleus), and the medial rectus muscle (three separate subnuclei). Thus, isolated unilateral palsies of the inferior rectus muscle have been associated with lesions of the inferior rectus subnucleus. More characteristic of nuclear involvement is unilateral palsy of the third cranial nerve in conjunction with weaknessf the ipsilateral and contralateral superior rectus muscles and bilateral incomplete ptosis. Occasionally, only the superior rectus muscle contralateral to the lesion is involved . Bilateral palsies of the third cranial nerve but with sparing of the levator muscles of the eyelid may be caused by bilateral nuclear lesions that spare the central caudal levator subnucleus. Conversely, isolated bilateral ptosis and sparing of the extraocular muscles and pupils have been described with lesions that involve the levator subnucleus and spare more rostral oculomotor subnuclei.

Pleural pressure at the end of respiration is ?,Zero,More negative,Positive,Less negative,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., More negativeDuring quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration.Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure)It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3.8 mm Hg (- 5.0 cm watery to -6.0 mm Hg (-8.0 cm water).Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i.e., in the pleural cavity.",B
ECG changes seen in hypocalcemia: March 2010,ST segment depression,Prolongation of ST segment,Inversion of T wave,Prolongation of PR segment,"Ans. B: Prolongation of ST segmentHypocalcemia causes prolongation of the ST segment and consequently of the QT interval, a change that is also produced by phenothiazines and tricyclic antidepressant drugs and by various diseases of the central nervous system. Increases in extracellular Ca2+ concentration enhance myocardial contractility.

Kaposi sarcoma is caused by: March 2013,HHV 6,HHV 7,HHV 8,All of the above,"Ans. C i.e. HHV 8 Kaposi sarcoma (KS) It is a tumor caused by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), also known as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). It was originally described by Moritz Kaposi , a Hungarian dermatologist practicing at the University of Vienna in 1872. It became more widely known as one of the AIDS-defining illnesses in the 1980s. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a systemic disease that can present with cutaneous lesions with or without internal involvement. Four subtypes have been described: - Classic KS, affecting middle aged men of Mediterranean descent; - African endemic KS; KS in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients; and - AIDS-related KS. Classic KS tends to be indolent, presenting with erythematous or violaceous patches on the lower extremities. African endemic KS and AIDS-related KS tend to be more aggressive. The AIDS-related KS lesions often rapidly progress to plaques and nodules affecting the upper trunk, face, and oral mucosa. The diagnosis can be made with a tissue biopsy and, if clinically indicated, internal imaging should be done.",C

The term enteric fever includes typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. As bile is a good culture medium for bacilli, they multiply abundantly in the gallbladder and are discharged continuously into the intestine, where it causes inflammation and necrosis leaving behind the characteristic typhoid ulcers. Ulceration of the bowel leads to two major complications: intestinal perforation and hemorrhage. The typical features are step ladder pyrexia with relative bradycardia and toxemia. A soft palpable spleen is a constant finding. Hepatosplenomegaly is also common. Rose spots that fade on pressure appear on the skin during the second or third week.

Iron absorption is increased in all except,Iron deficiency,Pregnancy,Alkaline pH of stomach,Ferrous iron salts,"Ref Harrison 19 th ed pg 626 The first stage is negative iron balance, in which the demands for (or losses of) iron exceed the body's ability to absorb iron from the diet. This stage results from a number of physiologic mecha- nisms, including blood loss, pregnancy (in which the demands for red cell production by the fetus outstrip the mother's ability to provide iron), rapid growth spus in the adolescent, or inadequate dietary iron intake. Blood loss in excess of 10-20 mL of red cells per day is greater than the amount of iron that the gut can absorb from a normal diet. Under these circumstances, the iron deficit must be made up by mobilization of iron from RE storage sites. During this period, iron stores--reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stain- able iron on bone marrow aspirations--decrease. As long as iron stores are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within nor- mal limits. At this stage, red cell morphology and indices are normal.",C

Half-life of T3,10 hours,2 day,6 days,10 days,"Triiodothyronine, also known as T3, is a thyroid hormone. It affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and hea rate. Production of T3 and its prohormone thyroxine (T4) is activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is released from the pituitary gland.T3 is the true hormone. Its effects on target tissues are roughly four times more potent than those of T4. Of the thyroid hormone that is produced, just about 20% is T3, whereas 80% is produced as T4. Roughly 85% of the circulating T3 is later formed in the liver and pituitary by removal of the iodine atom from the carbon atom number five of the outer ring of T4. In any case, the concentration of T3 in the human blood plasma is about one-foieth that of T4. This is observed in fact because of the sho half-life of T3, which is only 2.5 days. This compares with the half-life of T4, which is about 6.5 days.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology; 24th edition",B

In beta oxidation of palmitic acid if final product is acetoacetate then net gain of ATP is:,21,26,106,129,"Palmitic acid (16 carbons) For Palmitic acid complete oxidation, we require 7 beta oxidation cycles and 8 rounds of kreb cycle from 8 acetyl CoAs 1 beta oxidation cycle produce 4 ATP One kreb cycle from 1 Acetyl CoA produce 10 ATP after ETC. So Total ATP from complete oxidation of Palmitic Acid under normal conditions 7 x4 = 28 (beta oxidation) 8x10=80 (kreb cycle + ETC) Total 108 ATP 2 ATP require for fatty acid activation Net ATP =108-2 = 106 But the question asks about if all acetyl-CoA produced from beta oxidation is conveed to acetoacetate instead of undergoing TCA cycle then what will be ATP yield? If the final product is acetoacetate, then it will not be used in kreb cycle so 80 ATP from Kreb cycle will not be formed. Instead the acetaoacetate will form ketone bodies. Hence only beta oxidation ATP will produce 28 ATPs from 7 cycles. So net ATP will be = 28 - 2 = 26 ATP (2 ATP required for activation of fatty acid)",B

Meissner's corpuscle is for-,Touch,Temperature,Pressure,Proprioception,"Ans. A. TouchCUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS: -Sensory receptors can be specialized dendritic endings of afferent nerve fibers, and they are often associated with non- neural cells that surround them forming a sense organ. Touch and pressure are sensed by four types of mechanoreceptors.a. Meissner corpuscles are dendrites encapsulated in connective tissue and respond to changes in texture and slow vibrations.b. Merkel cells are expanded dendritic endings, and they respond to sustained pressure and touch.c. Ruffini corpuscles are enlarged dendritic endings with elongated capsules, and they respond to sustained pressure.d. Pacinian corpuscles consist of unmyelinated dendritic endings of a sensory nerve fiber, 2 um in diameter, encapsulated by concentric lamellae of connective tissue that give the organ the appearance of a cocktail onion. These receptors respond to deep pressure and fast vibration.e. The sensory nerves from these mechanoreceptors are large myelinated Aa and Ab fibers whose conduction velocities range from ~ 70-120 to ~ 40-75 m/s, respectively.a. Sensory systems encode four elementary attributes of stimuli: modality, location (receptive field), intensity, and duration (timing).b. The human hand has four types of mechanoreceptors; their combined activation produces the sensation of contact with an object. Selective activation of Merkel cells and Ruffini endings causes sensation of steady pressure; selective activation of Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles causes tingling and vibratory sensation.c. Location of a stimulus is encoded by spatial distribution of the population of receptors activated. A receptor fires only when the skin close to its sensory terminals is touched. These receptive fields of mechanoreceptors (shown as red areas on fingertips) differ in size and response to touch. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles provide the most precise localization as they have the smallest receptive fields and are most sensitive to pressure applied by a small probe.d. Stimulus intensity is signaled by firing rates of individual receptors; duration of stimulus is signaled by time course of firing. The spike trains indicate action potentials elicited by pressure from a small probe at the center of each receptive field. Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles adapt rapidly; the others adapt slowly.",A

Size of action potential is decreased as a result of: March 2010,Lower extracellular sodium,Raised extracellular calcium,Lower extracellular calcium,Raised extracellular sodium,"Ans. A: Lower extracellular sodium Decreasing the external Na+ concentration decreases the size of the action potential but has little effect on the resting membrane potential. The lack of much effect on the resting membrane potential would be predicted, since the permeability of the membrane to Na+ at rest is relatively low. Conversely, increasing the external K+ concentration decreases the resting membrane potential. A decrease in extracellular Ca2+ concentration increases the excitability of nerve and muscle cells by decreasing the amount of depolarization necessary to initiate the changes in the Na+ and K+ conductance that produce the action potential. Conversely, an increase in extracellular Ca2+ concentration ""stabilizes the membrane"" by decreasing excitability",A

They also produce vitamin K and biotin, detoxify xenobiotics, increase & maturate immunity, , preventing allergy and growth of pathogenic bacteria. They promote development of normal colonic epithelium and stimulate intestinal epithelial cell differentiation (ie increase not decrease proliferation of epithelial cells)Role of Colonic Microflora (Enteric Bacterial Ecosystem)Large intestine contains a unique biological ecosystem consisting of trillions of commensal (non pathogenic) bacteria that engage in a life long symbiotic relationship with their human host. This colonic ecosystem is established sholy after bih and remains remarkably stable unless disturbed by antibiotics. It is highly unusual relationship as other body compaments are largely sterile. It is involved inFermentation & Digestion of Complex Carbohydrate - Colonic bacteria metabolize meal components that are not digested by host enzymes and make their products available to the body fermentation. It provides advantage to the host in that the colonic bacteria are capable of performing metabolic reactions that do not take place in mammalian cells.- Carbohydrates that humans cannot digest without bacterial help include complex carbohydrate, resistant starches, dietary fibers, mucin (moucous) produced by gut and oligosaccharides / sugars that the body failed to digest /absorb d/t some pathology eg lactose in lactose intoleranceFormation of Sho Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)- Colonic bacteria form SCFAs by femanting carbohydrates (starches, fibers). SCFAs are 2-5 carbon weak acids with 80mmol/L average normal concentration in lumen. About 60% of this is acetate, 25% propionate and 15% butyrate.- SCFAs are absorbed & metabolized to make a significant contribution to total calory intake - butyrate is a critical energy source for colonocytes.- SCFAs exce a trophic effect on colonic epithelium cells. The colonic epithelium turns over rapidly even in health,limiting the genetic damage that might otherwise be caused by exposure to toxins in lumen. However, this also increases the risk of malignancy. The colonic flora ( SCFAs) is involved in promoting development of normal colonic epithelium and in stimulating its differentiated functions. Butyrate regulates the expression of specific gene in colonic epithelial cells and may suppress the development of a malignant phenotype. Expression of SMCT1 (sodium monocarboxylate transpoers 1) eg SLC5A8 may be reduced in colon cancers, thereby reducing butyrate uptake - which may contribute to malignant transformation. So SCFAs increase the growth of intestinal epithelial cells and control their proliferation & differentiation (ie promoting normal development & stimulating differentiation)- SCFAs combat inflammation (prevent inflammatory bowel disease) maintain acid -base equilibrium (absorbed in pa by exchange for H+) and promote absorption of Na+, Mg++, Ca+ and Fe++Metabolism of Exogenous & Endogenous Substances- Gut flora forms secondary bile acids and deconjugate any bile acids that have escaped uptake in terminal ileum- Contribute to formation of intestinal gas.Detoxification- Detoxify xenobiotics (eg drugs) & dietary carcinogen (but may also generate toxic or carcinogenic compounds from dietary substrates.Antimicrobial- Gut flora limits the growth & invasion of pathogenic microorganisms by1) Functioning as a physical barrier to prevent attachment of pathogens.2) Forming microbicidal substances,3) Triggering gene expression in epithelium that counteracts the adverse effects of pathogensPrevent Allergy & Provide Immunity- Gut flora is not essential for life as animals raised in germ free conditions apparently develop normally.

Cardiac output increases by -,Standing from lying down position,Expiration,Increased cardiac contractility,Parasympathetic stimulation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increased cardiac contractility Factors affecting cardiac outputo Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Hence any factor which affects either the stroke volume or the heart rate or both affects the cardiac output.A) Factors affecting stroke volume# Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart during one stroke, depends mainly on three factors : -1) Preload (Degree of ventricular fdling during diastole) : - Cardiac preload is represented by volume of venous blood that distends the ventricle, i.e., venous return determines the preload. An increase in preload, i.e., increase in venous return results in a higher end-diastolic volume (Preload). This results in stretching of myocardial fiber and this increase in length of myofibril increases the strength of cardiac contraction in accordance with the Frank-Star ling law or Starling rs taw of the heart. According to Starling's law, greater the initial length of muscle fiber, greater is the force of contraction. The initial length of muscle fiber (length of fiber at the initiation of contraction/systole) refers to length of the fiber at the end of the diastole, i.e., end-diastolic fiber length. Thus, the factors which improve venous return increase the cardiac output by increasing end-diastolic ventricular volume and length, i.e., preload. Opposite is true for factors which decrease venous return.| Stroke volume| Stroke volumeFactors increasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors increasing venous return or preload)#Increased total blood volume#Increased venous tone#Increased pumping action of skeletal muscle#Increased negative intrathoracic pressure (e.g. inspiration)o Lying down from sitting or standing position# Sympathatic discharge causing decrease in venous capacitance by decreasing venous complianceFactors decreasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors decreasing venous return or preload)o Decreased total blood volumeo Decreased venous toneo Decreased pumping action of skeletal muscleso Less negative or positive intrathoracic pressure (expiration)o Sitting or standing (venous pooling of blood)Contractility of ventricle : - If the contractile strength of ventricle increases, stroke volume increases. Contractility is increased by increase in sympathetic discharge or circulating catecholamines (epinephrine), for example during exercise.After load (resistance offered to ventricular pumping action): - Left ventricle has to pump out blood against aortic resistance. Increased aortic resistance (e.g., high BP) tends to decrease stroke volume. Decreased peripheral resistance increases cardiac output e.g., in exercise, AVfistula or shunt, severe anemia (due to vasodialtion by anemic hypoxia), thyrotoxicosis (due to vasodilation caused by in- creased O2 consumption), and wet beri-beri.B) Factors affecting heart rate# Heart rate is predominantly under neurohumoral influence. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and therefore cardiac output. Thus, sympathetic stimulation increases cardiac output massively by : (i) Increasing stroke volume by increasing contractility, and (ii) Increasing heart rate; but without increasing the end-diastolic volume.",C

Which is not a constituent of juxtaglomerular complex:September 2011,Macula densa,Glomerulus,juxtaglomerular cells,Extraglomerular mesangial cells,"Ans. B: GlomerulusThe JGA is composed of JG cells, macula densa cells and mesangial/Lacis cellsJuxtaglomerular apparatusThere are 3 different types of cells in the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus: Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cells, Macula Densa Cells and Mesangial Cells.Granular Cells/ juxtaglomerular cellsGranular cells are modified pericytes of glomerular aerioles.They are also known as Juxtaglomerular cells.The Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to:- Betal adrenergic stimulation- Decrease in renal perfusion pressure (detected directly by the granular cells)- Decrease in NaC1 absorption in the Macula Densa (often due to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, causing slower filtrate movement through the proximal tubule and thus more time for reabsorption. This results in a lower NaC1 concentration by the time the filtrate reaches the Macula Densa).Macula Densa CellsMacula densa cells are columnar epithelium thickening of the distal tubule.The macula densa senses sodium chloride concentration in the distal tubule of the kidney and secretes a locally active (paracrine) vasopressor which acts on the adjacent afferent aeriole to decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as pa of the tubuloglomerular feedback loop.Specifically, excessive filtration at the glomerulus or inadequate sodium uptake in the proximal tubule / thick ascending loop of Henle brings fluid to the distal convoluted tubule that has an abnormally high concentration of sodium.Na/Cl cotranspoers move sodium into the cells of the macula densa.The macula densa cells do not have enough basolateral Na/K ATPases to excrete this added sodium, so the cell's osmolarity increases.Water flows into the cell to bring the osmolarity back down, causing the cell to swell.When the cell swells, a stretch-activated non-selective anion channel is opened on the basolateral surface.ATP escapes through this channel and is subsequently conveed to adenosine.Adenosine vasoconstricts the afferent aeriole Al receptors and vasodilates (to a lesser degree) efferent aerioles A2 receptors which decreases GFR.Also, adenosine inhibits renin release in JG cells A2 receptors on JG cells using Gi pathway.Also, when macula densa cells detect higher concentrations of Na and Cl they inhibit Nitric Oxide Synthetase (decreasing renin release).Mesangial cells/ Lacis cellsMesangial cells are structural cells in the glomerulus that under normal conditions serve as anchors for the glomerular capillaries.The mesangial cells within the glomerulus communicate with mesangial cells outside the glomerulus (extraglomerular mesangial cells), and it is the latter cells that form pa of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.These cells form a syncytium and are connected with glomerular mesangial cells gap junctions.They contain actin and myosin, allowing them to contract when stimulated by renal sympathetic nerves, which may provide a way for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate the actions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.",B

At which location along the basilar membrane are the highest frequency sounds detected?,Near oval window,"Fahest from the oval window, near the helicotrema",Uniformly along the basilar membrane,At the midpoint of the membrane,"Each wave is relatively weak at the outset but becomes strong when it reaches the poion of the basilar membrane that has a natural resonant frequency equal to the respective sound frequency. At this point, the basilar membrane can vibrate back and foh with such ease that the energy in the wave is dissipated. Consequently, the wave dies at this point and fails to travel the remaining distance along the basilar membrane.Thus, a high-frequency sound wave travels only a sho distance along the basilar membrane before it reaches its resonant point and dies, a medium-frequency sound wave travels about halfway and then dies, and a very low-frequency sound wave travels the entire distance along the membrane.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 53 The Sense of Hearing; Page no: 675",A

Note:Montgomery's glands are modified eccrine glands (described incorrectly by some authors as sebaceous glands) that provide oil and moisture for the skin of the nipple and areola. They open into the areola in small tubercles rather than the nipple. Sweat glands are common in the skin of the breast generally, but are too small to be able to seen by the unaided eye.",B

In acute pulmonary embolism the most frequent ECG finding is,S1Q3T3 pattern,P.pulmonale,Sinus tachycardia,Right Axis detion,"The ECG is often normal but is useful in excluding other impoant differential diagnoses, such as acute myocardial infarction and pericarditis. The most common findings in PE include sinus tachycardia and anterior T-wave inversion but these are non-specific; larger emboli may cause right hea strain revealed by an S1Q3T3 pattern, ST-segment and T-wave changes, or the appearance of right bundle branch block. Aerial blood gases typically show a reduced PaO2 and a normal or low PaCO2, and an increased alveolar-aerial oxygen gradient, but may be normal in a significant minority. A metabolic acidosis may be seen in acute massive PE with cardiovascular collapse. An elevated D-dimer is of limited value, as it may be raised in a variety of other conditions, including myocardial infarction, pneumonia and sepsis. However, low levels, paicularly in the context of a low clinical risk, have a high negative predictive value and fuher investigation is usually unnecessary . The result of the D-dimer assay should be disregarded in high-risk patients, as fuher investigation is mandatory even when normal. The serum troponin I may be elevated, reflecting right hea strain.

Core biopsy of the liver is performed to evaluate the extent of his disease, and demonstrates chronic hepatitis with severe activity and severe fibrosis. The patient is treated with interferon for 6 months, but fails to respond. His condition continues to deteriorate, and he is treated with ohotopic liver transplantation. One year after ohotopic liver transplantation, the man develops rising transaminase and bilirubin levels. In order to minimize chronic rejection injury to hepatic endothelial cells, immunosuppressive therapy should be aimed at downregulating which of the following components of the immune response?",Autoantibody production,Complement protein synthesis,HLA antigen expression,T-lymphocyte activity,"We are presently undergoing a hidden epidemic of hepatitis C infection in this country. While many individuals may have very slowly progressive courses with good health for decades, some develop cirrhosis relatively earlier in their disease process. These individuals are increasingly becoming candidates for liver transplantation, although the number of available livers is far less than the number of people with end-stage hepatitis C infection who might use one. Hepatitis C can recur in the new liver, but often does not become a serious problem. Instead, chronic rejection turns out to more often limit the longevity of the transplant. Chronic rejection of any solid organ entails cellular injury to endothelial cells, resulting in intimal proliferation, fibrosis, and eventually, ischemic injury to the graft. Immunosuppressive therapy is directed at controlling lymphocyte activity and minimizing cellular rejection. Autoantibodies are not involved in organ transplant rejection. The antibodies produced are alloantibodies directed only to the graft, but not to the host. Complement proteins are involved in the humoral component of acute rejection, and complement binding to alloantibodies increases graft damage. Complement protein production, however, is not affected by immunosuppressive therapy. HLA antigen expression is central to recognition of foreign cells in grafted tissue. HLA antigens are expressed constitutively by all normal cells, and immunosuppression does not affect their production.",D

This occurs at following sites.i) Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by : - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypeensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to Coe.ii) Complex II is inhibited by : - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II.iii) Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome C1) is inhibited by : - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British antilewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome CI.iv) Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by : - Carbon monoxide, CN-, H2S and azide (N3). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration.2) Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylationThese compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.

Troponin is attached to the protein tropomyosin and lies within the groove between actin filaments in muscle tissue. In a relaxed muscle, tropomyosin blocks the attachment site for the myosin crossbridge, thus preventing contraction.d. When the muscle cell is stimulated to contract by an action potential, calcium channels open in the sarcoplasmic membrane and release calcium into the sarcoplasm.e. Some of this calcium attaches to troponin, which causes it to change shape, exposing binding sites for myosin (active sites) on the actin filaments. Myosin's binding to actin causes crossbridge formation, and contraction of the muscle begins.a. Troponin activation. Troponin C (red) binds Ca2+, which stabilizes the activated state, where troponin I (yellow) is no longer bound to actin.b. Troponin T (blue) anchors the complex on tropomyosin.c. Troponin is found in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but the specific versions of troponin differ between types of muscle.d. The main difference is that the TnC subunit of troponin in skeletal muscle has four calcium ion-binding sites, whereas in cardiac muscle there are only three.e. Views on the actual amount of calcium that binds to troponin vary from expert to expert and source to source.",B

Capacitance of sperms takes place in:,Seminiferous tubules,Epididymis,Vas deference,Uterus,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Uterus Also see Q no. 157 of Nov 2007; Q no. 1 of May 2004Capacitation is the process of sperm maturation (or activation) that occurs post-ejaculation in the female genital tract\ particularly in the uterine tubes. Without capacitation sperm have a reduced capacity to fertilize the egg.After ejaculation spermatozoa do not have the capacity to fertilize the oocyte. They must undergo 2 processes to acquire this capability:Capacitation and b) Acrosome reactionCapacitation:Capacitation is a period of conditioning of the sperms in the female reproductive tract. It lasts for approx. 7 hours (l to 10 hrs). Some of the changes during capacitation are:The uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppress sperm activity in the male genital ductsWhen spermatozoa are in male genital ducts, they are continually exposed to vesicles from seminiferous tubules containing large amounts of cholesterol. This cholesterol is continually added to the cellular membrane covering the sperm acrosome, toughening this membrane and preventing release of its enzymes. During capacitation the sperms lose this excess cholesterol making the membrane weaker and thus preparing the sperm for 'acrosome reaction'The motile properties of the spermatozoon also change. Whipping movements of the tail together with larger sideways swinging movements of the head take place. This type of motility is designated as hyperactivity.* Acrosome reaction:The acrosome reaction occurs after binding to the zona pellucida, and is induced by zona proteins. This reaction culminates in the release of enzymes from the acrosome, needed for spams to penetrate the zona pellucida into the ovum.",D

"Regarding lung volumes, which of the following is true: March 2009",Functional residual capacity accounts for 75% of total lung capacity,Residual volume keeps alveoli inflated between breaths,Vital capacity increases in elderly,Residual volume is about 500 ml,"Ans. B: Residual volume keeps alveoli inflated between breaths The amount of air that moves into the lungs with each inspiration (or the amount that moves out with each expiration) is called the tidal volume (500 ml). The air inspired with a maximal inspiratory effo in excess of the tidal volume is the inspiratory reserve volume. (3000 ml) The volume expelled by an active expiratory effo after passive expiration is the expiratory reserve volume (1200 ml), and the air left in the lungs after a maximal expiratory effo is the residual volume (1200 ml). The space in the conducting zone of the airways occupied by gas that does not exchange with blood in the pulmonary vessels is the respiratory dead space. The vital capacity (4700 ml), the largest amount of air that can be expired after a maximal inspiratory effo, is frequently measured clinically as an index of pulmonary function. It gives useful information about the strength of the respiratory muscles and other aspects of pulmonary function (ERV+TV+IRV) The fraction of the vital capacity expired during the first second of a forced expiration (FEV1, timed vital capacity) gives additional information; the vital capacity may be normal but the FEV1 reduced in diseases such as asthma, in which airway resistance is increased because of bronchial constriction. The amount of air inspired per minute (pulmonary ventilation, respiratory minute volume) is normally about 6 L (500 mL/ breath x 12 breaths/ min). The maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), or, as it was formerly called, the maximal breathing capacity, is the largest volume of gas that can be moved into and out of the lungs in 1 minute by voluntary effo. The normal MVV is 125-170 L/ min. Inspiratory Capacity (TV + IRV) = 3500 ml Functional Residual Capacity (RV + ERV) = 2400 ml Total Lung capacity (RV + VC) = 5900 ml",B

The apical surface of these cells is exposed to endolymph, which contains potassium ions at a much greater concentration than is found inside the cell. A potential difference of 160 mV (outside positive) exists across the apical membrane, and this results in a net movement of potassium ions into the cell when the stereocilia bundle is deflected and ion transduction channels are opened. The membrane potential of the hair cell moves in the positive direction (toward zero) and this results in depolarization of the cell.",D

Shiga toxin is preduced by-,Enteropathogenic E coli,Enteroinvasive E coli,Enterohemorrhagic E coli,Enterotoxigenic E coli,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Enterohemorrhagic E coiiESCHERICHIA COLIAt least six distinct ""pathotypes"" of intestinal pathogenic E. coli exist:o Enteropathoaenic E. coli [Entcroadherent E. colilIt causes diarrhoea in infants and children usually occuring as institutional out breaks.It does not produce enterotoxin, nor are they invasive. They adhere to the mucosa of small intestine and cause disruption of the brush border microvilli.These strains can be identified by their adhesion to HEP - 2 cells.o Enterotoxigenic E.coliIt causes traveller's diarrhoea [ETEC is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhea).It produces enterotoxins. They can produce heat labile toxin (LT) or heat stable toxin or both.Toxin production alone may not lead to illness. The strain should first be able to adhere to intestinal mucosa. This adhesiveness is medicated by fimbrial or colonisation factor antigen (CFA).o Enteroinvasive E. coliThey themselves resemble shigella and their infection resembles shigellosis (remember : shiga like toxin is elaborated by enterohemorrhagic E. coli).They produce mild diarrhoea to frank dvsentry and occur in adult as well as in children.They have been termed enteroinvasive because they have the capacity to invade intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and penetrate HeLa or HEP - 2 cells in tissue culture.This ability of penetration is plasmid determined which codes for outer membrane antigens called the Hirulence marker antigen"" (VMA). The detection of plasmid can be diagnostic.For laboratory diagnosis of EIEC, the sereny test used to be employed.These strains are non motile, do not ferment lactose or ferment it late with acid without producing any gas.o Enterohemorrhagic E. coli or verotoxigenic E. coliThese strains produce verocytotoxin (VT) or shiga like toxin (SLT)They can cause mild diarrhoea to fatal hemorrhagic colitis.Shiga like toxin belongs to class ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). It inhibits protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function.This toxin also acts on vascular endothelium to promote the synthesis of coagulation factor VIII, vWF - Platelet aggregation.They can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome particularly in young children and the elderly.O 157 : H 7 is the most prominent serotype of EHEC, associated with HUS, but 06,026,055,091,0103,0111,0113 and OX3 have also been associated with this syndrome.The primary target for V.T is vascular endothelium.The typical EHEC is serotype O157 : H7 which does not ferement sorbital unlike majority of E. coli (but Harrison writes that few species of this serotype can ferment sorbital).Some other serotype like O26 : H1 also belongs to this group.Laboratory diagnosis of VIEC diarrhea is established by demonstration of the bacilli or VT in feces directly or in culture.o Enteroaggrecative E. coli}# In developing countries and young children.# Can cause traveller's diarrhea and persistent diarrhea.# In vitro, thev exhibit a ""stacked - brick"" adherence pattern on Hep - 2 cells.o Diffusely adherent E. coli# Enteroaggregative E. coli forms a low molecular weight heat stable enterotoxin EAST -1 (enteroaggregative heat stable enterotoxin -1).",C

Central Chemoreceptors are most sensitive to which of the following changes in blood?,|p CO2,|p CO2,|H +,|p O2,"Central chemoreceptors are stimulated mainly by the |H+ concentration caused by increased pCO2 levels. Since H+ cannot easily cross the blood brain barrier, increase in the blood H+ concentration have little effect in stimulating central chemo receptors. Increase in blood p CO2 causes CO2 to diffuse the blood brain barrier with ease where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This carbonic acid in turn dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate ions. This H+ ions then have a potent stimulatory effect on the central chemo receptors. This question asks about the changes in blood that stimulates the central chemo receptors. So the correct answer is |p CO2 levels as H+ concentration in blood has little effect in stimulating the central chemo receptors. Ref: Textbook Of Medical Physiology By Khurana, Page 458",A

Transformation of one epithelium to other epithelium,Dysplasia,Hyperplasia,Neoplasia,Metaplasia,"Ref Robbins 8/e p10,11; 9/e p37 Metaplasia is a reversible change in which one adult cell type (epithelial or mesenchymal) is replaced by another adult cell type. In this type of cellular adaptation, a cell type sensitive to a paicular stress is replaced by another cell type better able to withstand the adverse environment. Metaplasia is thought to arise by reprogramming of stem cells to differ- entiate along a new pathway rather than a phenotypic change (transdifferentiation) of already differentiated cells. Epithelial metaplasia is exemplified by the squamous change that occurs in the respiratory epithelium of habitual cigarette smokers (Fig. 1-5). The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are focally or widely replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, impoant protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of paiculate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Moreover, the influences that induce metaplastic change, if per- sistent, may predispose to malignant transformation of the epi- thelium. In fact, squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium often coexists with lung cancers composed of malignant squamous cells. It is thought that cigarette smoking initially causes squamous metaplasia, and cancers arise later in some of these altered foci. Since vitamin A is essential for normal epithelial differentiation, its deficiency may also induce squamous metaplasia in the respiratoryepithelium. Metaplasia need not always occur in the direc- tion of columnar to squamous epithelium; in chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the lower esophagus may undergo metaplastic transformation to gastric or intestinal-type columnar epithelium. Metapla- sia may also occur in mesenchymal cells but in these situ- ations it is generally a reaction to some pathologic alteration and not an adaptive response to stress. For example, bone is occasionally formed in soft tissues, paicularly in foci of injury.",D

'A' wave in Electro Retinogram corresponds to activity in,Rods and cones,Pigment epithelium,Ganglion cell layer,Nerve fibre layer,"The electroretinogram (ERG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity generated by neural and non-neuronal cells in the retina in response to a light stimulus. The electrical response is a result of a retinal potential generated by light-induced changes in the flux of trans retinal ions, primarily sodium and potassium. A-wave: initial corneal-negative deflection, derived from the cones and rods of the outer photoreceptor layers. This wave reflects the hyperpolarization of the photoreceptors due to closure of sodium ion channels in the outer segment membrane. Absorption of light triggers the rhodopsin to activate transducin, a G-protein. This leads to the activation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE) eventually leading to a reduction in the level of cGMP within the photoreceptor. This leads to closure of the sodium ion channels resulting in a decrease of inwardly directed sodium ions, or a hyperpolarization of the cell. The a-wave amplitude is measured from baseline to the trough of the A-wave. Ref.textbook of physiology by A K Jain 7th edition page no.1110",A

The non-professional APCs express MHC class I molecules.An antigen-presenting cell (APC) or accessory cell is a cell that displays antigen complexed with major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on their surfaces; this process is known as antigen presentation. T cells may recognize these complexes using their T cell receptors (TCRs). These cells process antigens and present them to T-cells. Professional antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells, present foreign antigens to helper T cells, while other cell types can present antigens originating inside the cell to cytotoxic T cells. In addition to the MHC family of proteins, antigen presentation relies on other specialized signalling molecules on the surfaces of both APCs and T cells.Dendritic cells (DC)Dendritic cells have the broadest range of antigen presentation and are necessary for activation of naive T cells. DCs present antigen to both helper and cytotoxic T cells. They can also perform cross-presentation, a process by which they present exogenous antigen on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T cells. Cross-presentation allows for the activation of these T cells. Dendritic cells also play a role in peripheral tolerance, which contributes to prevention of auto-immune disease.MacrophagesMacrophages can be stimulated by T cell secretion of interferon gamma. After this activation, macrophages are able to express MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, including the B7 complex and can, present phagocytosed peptide fragments to helper T cells. Activation can assist pathogen-infected macrophages in clearing the infection.B cellsB cells can internalize antigen that binds to their B cell receptor and presents it to helper T cells. Unlike T cells, B cells can recognize soluble antigen for which their B cell receptor is specific. They can then process the antigen and present peptides using MHC class II molecules. When a T helper cell with a TCR specific for that peptide binds, the B cell marker CD40 binds to CD40L on the T cell surface. When activated by a T cell, a B cell can undergo antibody isotype switching, affinity maturation, as well as the formation of memory cells.",C

Where do gonococci initially infect,Vagina,Cervix,Uterus,Fallopian tubes,"In women, the initial gonococcal infection involves the urethra and cervix uteri. The vaginal mucosa is not affected in adults because the stratified squamous epithelium is resistant to infection by cocci and also due to the acidic pH of vaginal secretion. The infection spreads to Baholin's, endometrium and fallopian tubes.

A protein with molecular weight of 100 kD is subjected to SDS PAGE electrophoresis. The SDS PAGE electrophoresis pattern shows two widely separated bands of 20kD after addition of Mercaptoethanol. The true statement regarding this will be,The protein has undergone complete lysis,The protein is a monomer of 20kD and 30kD protein,The protein is a dimer of two 20kD proteins,The protein is a tetramer of 20kd and 30kD proteins,"D. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) It has a high molecular sieving effect and so separation is very efficient. In agar gel electrophoresis, serum components are separated into 5 fractions; while in PAGE serum will show more than 20 different bands. The amount of cross linking and thereby the pore size can be controlled. Another common variant is the SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Here proteins are boiled for 1-2 minutes with a denaturing agent, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (Fig. 54.2). The negative charges of SDS will cover the protein molecules, making them strongly negative. Then the separation of molecules will depend mainly on their molecular size. SDS-PAGE is therefore commonly used for molecular weight determination as well as for assessing the purity of proteins.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 600",C

A congenital hydrocele is also caused by a patent segment of a processus vaginalis filled with fluid, but it does not cause an indirect hernia. Ectopic testes occur when the gubernaculum does not migrate correctly during development and the testis does not reach the scrotum, but this does not cause a hernia. Epispadias occurs when the external urethral orifice opens onto the dorsal surface of the penis and is generally associated with exstrophy of the bladder.

"All are true regarding resistance of penicillin in staphylococcus aureus, except ?",Penicillinase production is transmitted by transduction,Methicillin resistance is due to change in PBP,Hospital strains mostly produce type D penicillinase,Penicillinase production is plasmid mediated,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hospital strains mostly produce type D penicillinase Resistance to antibiotics a Penicillin resistance is of three types? 1. Production of beta-lactamase (penicillinase) It inactivates penicillin by splitting 13-lactam ring Its production is controlled by plasmid. Plasmid is transmitted by transduction (mainly) or conjugation. Penicillinase is an inducible enzyme As a result of the widespread dissemination of plasmids containing penicillinase, less than 5% strains of staph. remain susceptible to penicillin. Staphylococci produce four type of penicillinases, A to D. Hospital strains usually forms type 'A' penicillinase. 2. Changes in bacterial surface receptors by lack or inaccessibility of ceain penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) in the organism. Methicillin resistant is mainly due to this mechanism and is independent of /3 - lactamase production. It is due to production of PBP 2a. This change ( in bacterial surface receptors) is normally chromosomal in nature. The resistance gene is mec A gene which is a pa of large mobile genetic element - staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec).

Pentameric structure ?,IgM,IgG,IgA,IgD,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ig M IgM is a pentameric immunoglobulin with five, four - peptide subunits. o The subunits are joined together by J chain. IgM IgM is the earliest immunoglobulin class to be synthesized by the fetus, begining at 20 weeks of age. As it is not transpoed across the placenta, the presence of IgM in the fetus or newborn indicates intrauterine infection and its detection is useful in the diagnosis of congenital infections such as syphilis, rubella and toxoplasmosis. It normally circulates as pentamer. It is the oldest immunoglobulin class. It is the predominant antibody in primary antibody response. It is sho lived, disappearing earlier than IgG.. Hence, its demonstration in serum indicates recent infection. Treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol selectively destroys IgM without affecting IgG. This is a simple method for the differential estimation of IgG and IgM. The isohemagglutinins (blood group anti A, anti B) are usually IgM Being largely confined to the intravascular space, IgM is believed to be responsible for protection against blood invasion by microorganisms. Monomeric IgM is the major antibody receptor on the surface of B lymphocytes for antigen recognition.

Equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated using-,Gibbs-Donnan equation,Nernst equation,Goldman equation,Fick's law,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Nernst equation Nernst equation o When two ionic solutions (ions) A and B of different concentration (CA and CB) of an ion separated by a permeable membrane, the ions tend to diffuse along their concentration gradient. Since ions are charged particles their diffusion can be stopped by an appropriate electrical potential (E) applied across the membrane o The magnitude and polarity of the potential (equilibrium potential) that must be applied to side A of the membrane for stopping the diffusion of ions (EA) is given by Nernst equation, i.e., the equilibrium potential for an ion is calculated by Nernst equation. o For example, if solution A contains an ion with a negative charge in more concentration than the concentration of the same ion in solution B, the ion will diffuse from A to B along the concentration gradient. If an electric gradient is created in opposite direction, the magnitude of the potential that completely counteracts this diffusion (from A to B) is called equilibrium potential. # EMF = +- 61 CA/CB # Where EMF is electromotive force or equilibrium potential in millivolts. o For example, the application of Nernst equation to the concentration of K+ in ICF (150 mEq/L) and in ECF (5 mEq/L) gives a value of - 90 mV. This is called the Nernst potential for K+ (EK).

Which of the following markers is usually the first viral marker detected after hepatitis B infection?,HBeAg,HBsAg,HBcAg,Anti-HBc,"Advances in the serodiagnosis of viral hepatitis have been dramatic, and the findings of specific viral antigens have led to further elucidation of the course of infections. The ""Australia antigen,"" discovered in 1960, was first renamed hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA) and then, finally, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It appears in the blood early after infection, before onset of acute illness, and persists through early convalescence. HBsAg usually disappears within 4 to 6 months after the start of clinical illness except in the case of chronic carriers.Hepatitis B 37 antigen (HBeAg) appears during the early acute phase and disappears before HBsAg is gone, although it may persist in the chronic carrier. Persons who are HBeAg-positive have higher titers of HBV and therefore are at a higher risk of transmitting the disease. HBeAg has a high correlation with DNA polymerase activity.The hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is found within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes and not generally in the peripheral circulation except as an integral component of the Dane particle. The antibody to this antigen, anti-HBc, is present at the beginning of clinical illness. As long as there is ongoing HBV replication, there will be high titers of anti-HBc. During the early convalescent phase of an HBV infection, anti-HBc may be the only detectable serologic marker (window phase) if HBsAg is negative and anti-HBsAg has not appeared.",B

Which of the following organ is not involved in calcium metabolism?,Lung,Liver,Spleen,Skin,"Calcium metabolism refers to the movements and regulation of calcium ions (Ca2+) in and out of various body compaments, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the blood plasma, the extracellular and intracellular fluids, and bone tissue. An impoant aspect of calcium metabolism is plasma calcium homeostasis, the regulation of calcium ions in the blood plasma within narrow limits. In this process, bone tissue acts as a calcium storage center for deposits and withdrawals as needed by the blood, continual bone remodeling.:276-277 Derangement of this mechanism leads to hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia, both of which can have consequences for health. The level of the calcium in humans' plasma is regulated by calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH); calcitonin is released by the thyroid gland when its plasma level is above its set normal point (in order to lower calcium level); PTH is released by the parathyroid glands when calcium level falls below set point Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition page number :577,578,579",C

The three germ cell layers in embryo separate by the process of?,Ovulation,Neurilation,Gastrulation,All of the above,"Ans. C. Gastrulation.(Ref: Langman's Medical Embryology 9th/pg. 65).Longman's Medical Embryology 9th/pg. 65..........""The most characteristic event occurring during the third week of gestation is gastrulation, the process that establishes all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) in the embryo. Gastrulation begins with formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast. Thus, the epiblast, through the process of gastrulation, is the source of all of the germ layers, and cells in these layers will give rise to all of the tissues and organs in the embryo"".GASTRULATION# Definition: Gastrulation is a process that establishes the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.- This process is first indicated by the formation of the primitive streak within the epiblast.- The formation of the primitive streak is one of the first signs of gastrulation.# It is characterized as a furrow in the midline of the embryonic disk at the future caudal end of the embryo. This furrow is formed by the ingression of epiblast cells that will go on to form the definitive endoderm and mesoderm by replacing hypoblast cells.# The epiblast cells then develop into the definitive ectoderm. Gastrulation, or formation of the germ layers, continues in caudal segments while cranial structures are differentiating, causing embryo to develop cephalocaudally.Educational points:# Week 2: Bilaminar germ disc# Week 3: Trilaminar germ disc (Gastrulation, Primitive streak, notochord, mesoderm and its organization, and neural plate begin to form)# Week 4: Four limbs appear.Heart begins to beat.# Week 3-8 (Embryonic Period): Neural tube formed by neuroectoderm,closes by wk 4.0rganogenesis. Extremely susceptible to teratogens.# Week 6: Fetal cardiac activity visible by transvaginal ultrasound.# Week 10: Genitalia have male/female characteristics.Tumors Associated With GastrulationSometimes, remnants of the primitive streak persist in the sacrococcygeal region. These clusters of pluripotent cells proliferate and form tumors, known as sacrococcygeal teratomas, that commonly contain tissues derived from all three germ layers. This is the most common tumor in newborns. These tumors may also arise from primordial germ cells (PGCs) that fail to migrate to the gonadal ridge.",C

Mac-Conkey's Agar medium is:,Enriched medium,Enrichment medium,Differential medium,Synthetic medium,"Key Points:-
Differential or indicator media depends on the biochemical properties of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators, such as neutral red, phenol red, eosin, or methylene blue. The medium changes color when a bacterium grows in them. For example, S. typhi grows as black colonies on Wilson and Blair medium containing sulfite. Lactose fermenting bacteria, such as E. coli produce pink colonies, whereas non-lactose fermenting bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. form pale or colorless colonies on MacConkey agar. Fermentation of lactose in the medium makes it acidic and leads to the formation of pink colonies in the presence of neutral red.

The human plasma lipoprotein containing the highest percentage of triacylglycerol by weight is,VLDL,Chylomicrons,HDL,LDL,"CHYLOMICRONS Synthesis of chylomicrons Chylomicrons are formed in the intestinal mucosal cells, and secreted into the lacteals of lymphatic system (Chapter 11). They are rich in triglyceride (Fig. 12.9). If lipemic serum is kept overnight in the refrigerator, chylomicrons rise as a creamy layer to the top, leaving the subnatant clear. When the chylomicrons are synthesised by the intestinal mucosa, they contain only apo-B-48 and apo-A but apo-C and apo-E are added from HDL in blood during transpo (Fig. 12.10). Metabolism of Chylomicrons i. Main sites of metabolism of chylomicrons are adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The half-life of chylomicrons in blood is about 1 hour. ii. The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is located at the endothelial layer of capillaries of adipose tissue, muscles, and hea; but not in liver. Apo C-II present in the chylomicrons activates the LpL (Table 12.4). The LpL hydrolyses triglycerides present in chylomicrons into fatty acids and glycerol. Muscle or adipose tissue cells take up the liberated fatty acids (Fig. 12.10). iii. Following injection of heparin, the LpL is released from the tissues and lipemia is thus cleared. This is called post-heparin lipolytic activity. Lack of C-II leads to decreased activity of LpL and consequent accumulation of chylomicrons and VLDL in blood. Insulin increases LpL activity. Liver Takes up Chylomicron Remnants As the TAG content is progressively decreased, the chylomicrons shrink in size. These remnants containing apo-B-48 and apo-E are taken up by hepatic cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Apo-E binds the hepatic receptors (Fig. 12.10). Function of Chylomicrons Chylomicrons are the transpo form of dietary triglycerides from intestines to the adipose tissue for storage, and to muscle or hea for their energy needs.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 153",B

Stage of falciparum not seen in peripheral blood smear: March 2011,Schizont,Gametocyte,Ring form,Double ring,"Ans. A: Schizont P. falciparum differs from the other forms of malarial parasites in that developing erythrocytic schizonts aggregate in the capillaries of the brain and other internal organs, so that only young ring forms are found in peripheral blood Life cycle of all Plasmodium species Infection in humans begins with the bite of an infected female Anopheline mosquito. Sporozoites are the infective form of the parasite, present in the salivary glands of the female anopheles mosquito. Sporozoites released from the salivary glands of the mosquito enter the bloodstream during feeding, quickly invading liver cells (hepatocytes). Sporozoites are cleared from the circulation within 30 minutes. During the next 14 days in the case of P. falciparum, the liver-stage parasites differentiate and undergo asexual multiplication resulting in tens of thousands of merozoites which burst from the hepatoctye. Individual merozoites invade red blood cells (erythrocytes) and undergo an additional round of multiplication producing 12-16 merozoites within a schizont. The length of this erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle depends on the parasite species: - Irregular cycle for P. falciparum, - 48 hours for P. vivax, and P. ovale and - 72 hours for P. malariae. The clinical manifestations of malaria, fever and chills, are associated with the synchronous rupture of the infected erythrocyte. The released merozoites go on to invade additional erythrocytes. Not all of the merozoites divide into schizonts, some differentiate into sexual forms, male and female gametocytes. These gametocytes are taken up by a female anophylean mosquito during a blood meal. Within the mosquito midgut, the male gametocyte undergoes a rapid nuclear division, producing 8 flagellated microgametes which feilize the female macrogamete. The resulting ookinete traverses the mosquito gut wall and encysts on the exterior of the gut wall as a oocyst. Soon the oocyst ruptures, releasing hundreds of sporozoites into the mosquito body cavity where they eventually migrate to the mosquito salivary gland. To diagnose malaria and determine which species of Plasmodium is causing the infection, blood film is examined. Each species has distinctive physical characteristics that are apparent under a microscope. In P. falciparum, only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. It is unusual to see mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. The parasitised erythrocytes are not enlarged, and it is common to see cells with more than one parasite within them (multiply parasitised erythrocytes). On occasion, faint comma-shaped red dots called ""Maurer's dots"" are seen on the red cell surface. The comma-shaped dots can also appear as pear-shaped blotches. Plasmodium falciparum causes severe malaria a distinctive propey not shared by any other human malaria, that of sequestration. Within the 48-hour asexual blood stage cycle, the mature forms change the surface propeies of infected red blood cells causing them to stick to blood vessels (a process called cytoadherence). This leads to obstruction of the microcirculation and results in dysfunction of multiple organs, typically the brain in cerebral malaria.",A

The 'y-glutamyl cycle is used by some cells to transpo amino acids across the cell membrane. A membrane-associated enzyme, y-glutamyl transpeptidase forms peptide bonds between the glutamyl moiety of glutathione and the amino acid to be transpoed into the cell. The glutamyl-aniino acid is split off from the cysteinylglycine pa of the molecule as both are brought into the cell. The transpoed amino acid is then split from the glutamyl moiety, depositing the free amino acid on the cytosolic side of the membrane. 5-Oxyproline is produced from the glutamyl moiety, which has to be replaced or resynthesized, as does the glutathione. This process uses 3 adenosine triphosphates (ATPs), but is very active in some tissues, such as the kidney. Glutathione reductase is the enzyme used to protect the red cell from oxidative stress and to reduce methemoglobin. Glutathione peroxidase is the selenium containing enzyme used to scavenge free radicals and peroxides. Glutathione is present in all cells in relatively large amounts, attesting to its impoance in metabolism. Glutathione S-transferase is a liver enzyme used in detoxification reactions.

In a patient with starvation for 72 hrs which of the following would be seen a) Increase glycogenolysisb) Increased ketosis due to breakdown of fatsc) Degradation of proteinsd) Increased gluconeogenesis,a,bcd,bd,acd,"72 hours starvation is the junctional period between early stage (first stage) and intermediate stage (second stage) of fasting. At this time (72 hours of starvation) option b, c and d all are correct. But, the best answer here is d i.e. increased gluconeogenesis. Let us see each option one by one.
Glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours.
Breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and ketogenesis occurs in the later part of the first stage. But fatty acids and ketone bodies are utilized mainly during the second and third stage. Further, lipolysis provides glycerol, which is used for gluconeogenesis.
Protein degradation occurs, but it is to provide alanine for gluconeogenesis.
Gluconeogenesis is maximum on the third day and it is responsible for maintenance of blood glucose in early as well as in late stages of starvation.
Thus, the best answer here is gluconeogenesis.



If we put except in the question, then the answer will become 'a' i.e., glycogenolysis, as glycogen stores are depleted in 16-18 hours.",B
"Rods and cones differ in all, except",Signal transduction,Light sensitivity,Wavelength,Acuity,"Our visual sensation is mediated by two types of photoreceptors, rods, and cones. Both respond to light electrically. Rods are highly light-sensitive but cones are not. Because of this sensitivity difference, rods mediate night vision and cones mediate daylight vision. While a response to a brief light flash is rather slow in rods, it is brief in cones. These rod and cone differences in their light sensitivity and the response time course arise in the differences in the reactions in the enzyme cascade to evoke light responses in these cells. This cascade (phototransduction cascade) in rods is now rather well understood at the molecular level in a quantitative way. In cones, similar cascade has been known to be present. However, details are not known yet because it was difficult to obtain purified cones in an amount large enough to study these issues biochemically.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 192",A

An 18 year old is brought to the emergency room following an automobile accident. Serum enzyme studies demonstrate a thousand-fold elevation of creatine kinase (CK). Which of the following tissues is most likely to be the source of the enzyme?,Bone,Brain,Hea,Skeletal muscle,"Creatine kinase occurs in several different forms, or isoenzymes, in the body. Most tissues contain a mix of creatine kinase isoenzymes, but one species often predominates. The MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase is associated with hea damage; the MM isoenzyme is associated with muscle damage; and the BB isoenzyme is associated with brain damage. Surgery and trauma are commonly implicated as causes of sufficient skeletal muscle trauma to markedly elevated creatine kinase. If isoenzyme studies are done, the CK-MM (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) isoenzyme will be elevated much more markedly than the CK-MB isoenzyme. Bone is not a significant source of CK. Brain can occasionally be a source of creatine kinase (BB isoenzyme), but would not usually be the major source following an automobile accident. Hea damage as in myocardial infarction (unlikely at this age), can elevate creatine kinase, but would not usually be the major source in an automobile accident. If the dilemma arises as to whether an automobile accident was possibly secondary to a myocardial infarction, the ratio of CK-MB to total CK may be helpful in demonstrating a cardiac contribution (CK-MB is characteristic of hea muscle).

Anemia which is associated with pancytopenia is,Hemolytic,Iron deficiency,Megaloblastic,All,"Ref Robbins 9/e p645 The morphologic hallmark of megaloblastic anemia is the presence of megaloblasts, enlarged erythroid precursors that give rise to abnormally large red cells (macrocytes). Granu- locyte precursors are also increased in size. Underlying this cellular gigantism is a defect in DNA synthesis that impairs nuclear maturation and cell division. Because the synthesis of RNA and cytoplasmic elements proceeds at a normal rate and thus outpaces that of the nucleus, the hematopoietic precursors show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. This maturational derangement contributes to the anemia in several ways. Many megaloblasts are so defective in DNA synthesis that they undergo apoptosis in the marrow (inef- fective hematopoiesis). Others mature into red cells but do so after fewer cell divisions, fuher diminishing the output of red cells. Granulocyte and platelet precursors are also affected (although not as severely) and most patients present with pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia).",C

DNA replication occurs in how many phases,Two,Three,Four,Five,"In animal cells, including human cells, the replication of the DNA genome occurs only at a specified time during the lifespan of the cell. This period is referred to as the synthetic or S phase. This is usually temporally separated from the mitotic, or M phase, by nonsynthetic periods referred to as gap 1 (G1 ) and gap 2 (G2 ) phases, occurring before and after the S phase, respectively (Figure 35-20). Among other things, the cell prepares for DNA synthesis in G1, and for mitosis in G2. The cell regulates DNA synthesis by allowing it to occur only once per cell cycle, and only during S-phase, in cells preparing to divide by a mitotic process.Ref: Harpers Illustrated Biochemistry, 30th edition, page no: 388",B

Which of the following type of hypoxia presents with normal aerial O2 concentration?,Anaemic hypoxia,Stagnant hypoxia,Histotoxic hypoxia,Hypoxic hypoxia,"In anaemic hypoxia, a reduction in hemoglobin concentration of the blood is accompanied by a corresponding decline in the O2-carrying capacity of the blood. Although the PaO2 is normal in anemic hypoxia, the absolute quantity of O2 transpoed per unit volume of blood is diminished. As the anemic blood passes through the capillaries and the usual quantity of O2 is removed from it, the PO2 and saturation in the venous blood decline to a greater extent than normal. Must Know: Classification of hypoxia: Hypoxic hypoxia, in which the PO2 of the aerial blood is reduced. Anemic hypoxia, in which the aerial PO2 is normal but the amount of hemoglobin available to carry O2 is reduced. Ischemic or stagnant hypoxia, in which the blood flow to a tissue is so low that adequate O2 is not delivered to it despite a normal PO2 and hemoglobin concentration. Histotoxic hypoxia, in which the amount of O2 delivered to a tissue is adequate but, because of the action of a toxic agent, the tissue cells cannot make use of the O2 supplied to them.

The adult worm attaches to the small intestinal mucosa and releases eggs into the feces. Crustaceans living in contaminated water ingest free-swimming embryos that hatch from the eggs. Ceain species of fish ingest the crustaceans, then humans acquire the infection by ingesting the undercooked or raw fish. Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop because the tapeworm absorbs vitamin B12 from the intestinal lumen and also interferes with ileal B12 absorption. Clonorchis sinensis infections produce obstruction of the biliary tract or pancreatic duct and are associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Echinococcus granulosus larvae infect humans and produce unilocular cystic lesions in the liver. Echinococcus is prevalent in areas in which dogs are used to help raise livestock.

Acclimatization to a high altitude is associated with which of the following changes?,Hyperventilation,Polycythemia,O2 dissociation curve shifts to right,Decreased concentration of systemic capillaries,"Oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve, is the curve relating percentage saturation of the oxygen carrying power of hemoglobin to the PO2. It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the T-R interconversion. In deoxyhemoglobin, globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration which reduces the affinity of the molecule for oxygen. When the first oxygen is bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration which exposes more oxygen binding sites. Thus, binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin to bind other O2 molecules. Ascent to high altitude triggers a substantial rise in 2,3 DPG concentration in red blood cells. Factors causing shift of the curve to right includes: Fall in pH Rise in temperature Increase in 2, 3 BPG pH of the blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when PCO2 rises the curve shifts to right.

Respiratory burst is due to which enzyme,NADH oxidase,Catalase,SOD,Glutathione peroxidase,"Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis (Greek word-Phagein-to eat) is the engulfment of large paicles like viruses, bacteria, cells, or debris by macrophages and granulocytes. They extend pseudopodia and surround the paicles to form phagosomes which later fuse with lysosomes to form Phagolysosomes in which the paicles are digested. Biochemical mechanism is called respiratory burst, in which O2 consumption is increased and lead to formation of superoxide ion O2-. Superoxide anion O2- is conveed to H2O2 and other free radicals OH* and OCl-, etc. which are potent microbial agent. O2- + O2- + 2H+ - H2O2 + O2 The electron transpo chain system responsible for the ""respiratory burst"" is ""NADPH oxidase"". In resting phagocyte it is in an inactive form, consisting of cytochrome b 558 + two polypeptides (heterodimer). The NADPH oxidase system is activated by recruitment in plasma membrane by two more cytoplasmic polypeptides. Thus: 2 Cytoplasmic polypeptides Cytb558 + 2 Polypeptides _______________________ Cytb588 (Inactive NADPH oxidase) + 4 Polypeptides (Active NADPH oxidase) NADPH oxidase is activated upon contact with various ligands like complement fragment C5a, chemotactic peptides, etc. Events resulting in activation of the NADPH oxidase system involve G proteins, activation of phospholipase C and generation of inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (P3). The P3 mediates a transient increase in the level of cytosolic Ca++, which is essential for the induction of the respiratory burst. Killing of bacteria within phagolysosomes appears to depend on the combined action of elevated pH, superoxide ions or other ""free radicals"" like H2O2, OH*, and HOCl (hypochlorous acid) and on the action of ceain bactericidal peptides, called defensins and other proteins, e.g. cathepsin G and ceain cationic proteins present in phagocytic cells. Macrophages are extremely active and may ingest 25 percent of their volume per hour. In such a process, a macrophage may internalize 3 percent of its plasma membrane each minute or the entire membrane every 1/2 hour.

A 38-year-old man in a rural area presents to a physician to follow up an infection. Ocular examination reveals small opaque rings on the lower edge of the iris in the anterior chamber of the eye. Nodular lesions are found on his achilles tendon. Successful therapy should be aimed at increasing which of the following gene products in hepatocyte cell membranes?,Apo B-100,Apo B-100 receptor,Apo E,Apo E receptor,"This man has characteristic signs of familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disorder affecting about 1 in 500 persons. The xanthomas on the Achilles tendon and the arcus lipoides (the opaque rings in the eye) are pathognomonic. Affected individuals have very high LDL cholesterol because of deficient endocytosis of LDL paicles by LDL receptors. These receptors recognize the apo B-100 protein cotranspoed with cholesterol esters in LDL. Treatments aim at increasing genetic expression of LDL receptors (i.e., apo B-100 receptors) to enhance clearance of LDL paicles. Dietary changes, a resin drug, niacin, or an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor could be tried. Apo B-100 is the apoprotein of liver-produced lipoproteins such as VLDL, IDL and LDL. It is therefore not in the hepatic cell membranes, and it might be expected to decrease with decreasing concentrations of circulating LDL. Apo E is an apoprotein found on VLDL, IDL, and chylomicrons, allowing ""scavenging"" by the liver of remnants or of the lipoprotein itself. It is not found in the hepatocyte membrane. Apo E receptor would actually be increased by the treatment with hypocholesterolemic agents. However, the apo E receptor is not involved in the scavenging of LDL paicles.",B

Epigenetic deals with genetic modifications that do not alter the sequence of DNA. All of the following can detect epigenetic modification except:,HPLC,Methylation specific PCR,Bisulphite method,ChIP on Chip,"Ans. a. HPLC (Ref: Robbins 9/e p180, 319-320 8/e p180-181)Methylation specific PCR, Bisulphite method and ChlP on Chip can detect epigenetic modification but not the HPLC.'Epigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA, and the methylation and acetylation of histones. Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation; other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications. One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, white methylated cytosines are protected from modification. An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosines (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA. These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones. Such antibodies can be used to pull down bound DNA sequences, a method termed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These pulled- down sequences can be amplified and analyzed by hybridizing to microarrays ('ChIP on Chip') or sequencing ('ChIP- Seq') to map epigenetically modified genes throughout the genome. - Robbins 8/e p180 Isolation of cells of the immune response* Use the correct number of cells: 1 x 106 x to 10 x 106* Collect biological replicates of cells* Choose an appropriate control for antibody specificity (knockout or RNAi knockdown)Fragmentation by sonication or MNase treatment* Shear chromatin to a size range of ~ 150-300 bp* Sonicate chromatin extracts for non-histone proteinsSonication conditions should be determined empirically for each cell typeTreat chromatin extracts with MNase for analysis of histone modificationsDo not overdigest chromatinChIP analysis of histone modifications, transcription factors or epigenetic regulators* Select antibody: monoclonal versus polyclonal* Choose reference control (Input or IgG)* Perform ChIP with established protocols* Purify DNALibrary construction* Do end repair and adapter ligation* Perform PCR using primers compatible with sequencing platformAvoid overamplifying DNA Sequencing* Determine sequencing depth on the basis of the prevalence of binding throughout the genome: more sequencing tags may be needed for diffuse signals (such as H3K27me3)* Perform single-end or paired-end sequencingEpigenetic AlterationsEpigenetics is defined as the study of heritable chemical modification of DNA or chromatin that does not alter the DNA sequence itself.Examples of such modification include the methylation of DNA. and the methylation and acetylation of histonesQ.Since traditional Sanger sequencing alone cannot detect DNA methylation, other techniques have been developed to uncover these chemical modifications.One common approach is to treat genomic DNA with sodium bisulfite, a chemical that converts unmethylated cytosines to uracil, while methylated cytosines are protected from modificationQ.An assay termed methylation-specific PCR uses two PCR primer sets to analyze single DNA loci: one to detect a DNA sequence with unmethylated cytosines (which are converted to uracils after bisulfite treatment) and the other to detect DNA sequences with methylated cytosinesQ (which remain cytosines after bisulfite treatment).Additional techniques are evolving that provide a genome-wide snapshot of epigenetically altered DNA.These techniques are based on the ability to detect histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation (which, like DNA methylation, are important regulators of gene expression) by using antibodies against specifically modified histones.

What is the best method for confirming amyloidosis,Colonoscopy,Sigmoidoscopy,Rectal biopsy,Tongue biopsy,"Ref Robbins 9/e p262 Amyloidosis may be an unsuspected finding at autopsy in a patient who has no apparent related clinical manifesta- tions, or it may be responsible for serious clinical dysfunc- tion and even death. The clinical course depends on the paicular sites or organs affected and the severity of the involvement. Nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, and weight loss are the most common presenting manifestations. Later in the course, amyloidosis tends to manifest in one of several ways: by renal disease, hepato- megaly, splenomegaly, or cardiac abnormalities. Renal involvement giving rise to severe proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) (Chapter 13) often is the major cause of symp- toms in reactive systemic amyloidosis. Progression of the renal disease may lead to renal failure, which is an impor- tant cause of death in amyloidosis. The hepatosplenomeg- aly rarely causes significant clinical dysfunction, but it may be the presenting finding. Cardiac amyloidosis may mani- fest as conduction disturbances or as restrictive cardiomy- opathy (Chapter 10). Cardiac arrhythmias are an impoant cause of death in cardiac amyloidosis. In one large series, 40% of the patients with AL amyloid died of cardiac disease. The diagnosis of amyloidosis may be suspected from the clinical signs and symptoms and from some of the findings mentioned; however, more specific tests must often be done for definitive diagnosis. Biopsy and subsequent Congo red staining is the most impoant tool in the diag- nosis of amyloidosis. In general, biopsy is taken from the organ suspected to be involved. For example, renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method. In suspected cases of AL amyloi- dosis, serum and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow examination in such cases usually shows plasma- cytosis, even if skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are not present. Proteomic analysis of affected tissue is now being widely used for detection of small amounts of amyloid (from fat aspirates) and for definitive identification of the type of amylo",C

Due to this, lactic acid accumulates in the body which interferes with the uric acid excretion through renal tubulesThe lack of feedback control by PRPP glutamylamidotransferase by purine nucleotides also leads to their elevated synthesisXanthine oxidase is an impoant enzyme that conves hypoxanthine to xanthine, and xanthine to uric acid.",D

These fibers terminate in the medulla, ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus of the thalamus, and then project to the somatosensory cortex within the brain.* Thus, a lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) or solitario-thalamic tract results in loss of taste from the ipsi-lesional, the same side as the lesion, half of the tongue.",D
A patient is found to have a rare disease in which the secretory function of the alpha-cells of the pancreas is impaired. Direct stimulation of which of the following pathways in liver will be impaired?,Citric acid cycle,Glycogenesis,Gluconeogenesis,Glycolysis,"Gluconeogenesis is the process of synthesizing glucose or glycogen from noncarbohydrate precursors. The major substrates are the glucogenic amino acids, lactate, glycerol, and propionate. Liver and kidney are the major gluconeogenic tissues; the kidney may contribute up to 40% of total glucose synthesis in the fasting state and more in starvation. Glucagon is a hormone produced and secreted by the alpha-cells of the pancreas in response to decreases in blood glucose. Glucagon and epinephrine, hormones that are responsive to a decrease in blood glucose, inhibit glycolysis and stimulate gluconeogenesis in the liver by increasing the concentration of cAMP.

"Which of the following organisms, when isolated in the blood, requires the synergistic activity of penicillin and an aminoglycoside for appropriate therapy",Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,Bacteroides fragilis,"Enterococci are present in the intestine, genital tract and saliva. They are frequently isolated from cases of urinary tract infection and wound infection. Also causes endocarditis, infection of the biliary tract, septicemia and intra-abdominal abscess complicating diveiculitis and peritonitis. Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, so it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin. Recently vancomycin-resistant Enterococci have begun to emerge. The phenotypes are Van A, B, C, D and E. The mechanism is an alteration of D-alanyl-D-alanine chain in the cell wall.

The open oven door is a tip-off that carbon monoxide was involved. Carbon monoxide has a very high affinity for hemoglobin, and binds, nearly irreversibly, to it in such a manner that oxygen cannot bind, drastically decreasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Carbon monoxide also causes the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to shift to the left, making oxygen more difficult to unload. Traditionally, patients with carbon monoxide poisoning have been described as having ""cherry red"" blood and, consequently, skin, but this change is somewhat unreliable in real life.

Most common cause of mitral stenosis is,Rheumatic hea disease,Infective endocarditis,Diabetes mellitus,Congenital,"Refer robbins 9/e 554 Rheumatic hea disease (RHD) is damage to one or more hea valves that remains after an episode of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is resolved. It is caused by an episode or recurrent episodes of ARF, where the hea has become inflamed. The hea valves can remain stretched and/or scarred, and normal blood flow through damaged valves is interrupted. Blood may flow backward through stretched valves that do not close properly, or may be blocked due to scarred valves not opening properly. When the hea is damaged in this way, the hea valves are unable to function adequately, and hea surgery may be required. Untreated, RHD causes hea failure and those affected are at risk of arrhythmias, stroke, endocarditis and complications of pregnancy. These conditions cause progressive disability, reduce quality of life and can cause premature death in young adults. Hea surgery can manage some of these problems and prolong life but does not cure RHD.",A

Regarding clostridium perfringens gas gangrene false is ?,Clostridium perfringens is the most common cause of gas gangrene,Naegler reaction positive,Most impoant toxin is hyaluronidase,Food poisoning strain of clostridium perfringens produces heat resistant spores,"Most common toxin is hyaluronidase Clostridium are gram positive spore forming rods. - The spores enable these organisms to survive in adverse conditions e.g. in soil and dust and on skin. - Most species are obligate anaerobes i.e. their spores do not germinate and growth does not normally proceed unless a suitably low redox potential (Eb) exists. Clostridium perfringens Clostridium perfringens cause two impoant diseases:? Gas gangrene ""Clostridium perfringens is the commonest cause of gas gangrene"". The disease is characterized by rapidly spreading edema, myositis and necrosis of tissues, gas production and profound toxemia. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins and other substance which have a role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. ""a Toxin a phospholipase lecithinase"" is generally considered to he the most impoant toxin in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. -It is produced by all types of clostridium perfringens and most abundantly by type ""A"" strains. - It is the most impoant toxin biologically and is responsible .for profound toxemia of the gas gangrene. - It is a ""phospholipase"". Other factors which also have a role in virulence:- Hyaluronida.ve It breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of the infection along the tissue planes Collagenases and other proteinases They break down tissues and viually liquefy muscles. Clostridium food poisoning:- Clostridium perfringens is an impoant cause of food poisoning. The .food poisoning is caused due to ingestion of spores. The spores of the clostridium perfringens strains that cause food poisoning are heat resistant. -The unique feature of spores produced by food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens is that they are heat resistant that can survive boiling for several hours. Remember - Only those strains of clostridia which are associated with food poisoning produce heat resistant spores Where as - The classic strains of this species do not have heat resistant spores. These spores are inactivated within few minutes by boiling. Typical, food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens occur as carrier state. These strains also occur in animals thus meat is often contaminated with heat resistant spores. The vehicle of infection is usually a precooked meat food that has been allowed to stand at a temperature. The heat resistance of the spores ensures their survival in cooking. - During the cooling period they germinate in the anaerobic environment produced by the cooked meat and multiply. - Anyone who eats this meat will consume the equivalent of cooked meat broth culture of the organisms. - Large numbers of clostridia are thus consumed which may pass unharmed by the gastric acid due to high protein in the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin. - After an incubation period of 8-24 hours abdominal pain diarrhoea set in. Naegeler reaction ft is used to detect alpha toxin which is a phospholipase (lecithinase C) - Lecithinase or phospholipase in the presence of Ca++ and Mg' ions splits lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol.

Ovulation occurs: September 2005,14 days after menstruation,14 days prior to next menstruation,On 14th day of the cycle,None of the above,"Ans. B: 14 days prior to next menstruation The process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, LH and FSH. In the follicular (pre-ovulatory) phase of the menstrual cycle, the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion, this is stimulated by the secretion of FSH. After this is done, a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle, and the ovum will leave the follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the luteal (postovulatory) phase, the ovum will travel through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If feilized by a sperm, it may perform implantation there 6-12 days later. In humans, the few days near ovulation constitute the feile phase. The average time of ovulation is the foueenth day of an average length (twenty-eight day) menstrual cycle. It is normal for the day of ovulation to vary from the average, with ovulation anywhere between the tenth and nineteenth day being common, but commonly occurs 14 days before the next cycle. Cycle length alone is not a reliable indicator of the day of ovulation.",B

It receives virtually all its input from the cerebral motor cortex and adjacent premotor and somatosensory cortices of the cerebrum.It transmits its output information in the upward direction back to the brain, functioning in a feedback manner with the cerebral cortical sensorimotor system to plan sequential voluntary body and limb movements, planning these as much as tenths of a second in advance of the actual movements. This is called development of ""motor imagery"" of movements to be performed.Vestibulocerebellum--Its Function in Association with the Brain Stem and Spinal Cord to Control Equilibrium andPostural Movements# The vestibulocerebellum originated phylogenetically at about the same time that the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear developed. Furthermore, loss of the flocculonodular lobes and adjacent portions of the vermis of the cerebellum, which constitute the vestibulocerebellum, causes extreme disturbance of equilibrium and postural movements.# The vestibulocerebellum is especially important in controlling balance between agonist and antagonist muscle con- tractions of the spine, hips, and shoulders during rapid changes in body positions as required by the vestibular apparatus.# It is then the function of the vestibulocerebellum to calculate in advance from these rates and directions where the different parts will be during the next few milliseconds. The results of these calculations are the key to the brain's progression to the next sequential movement.",A

Role of molecular oxygen in ETC -,Transfer of reducing equivalent to CoQ,Transfer of reducing equivalent from cytosol to mitochondria,To act as last electron acceptor,Generation of ATP,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., To act as last electron acceptor Structural organizations of components of ETCo Components of respiratory chain do not function as discrete carriers of reducing equivalent but are organized into four complexes each of which acts as a specific oxidoreductase. Coenzyme Q and cytochrome C are not parts of any complex and are not fixed in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The other components are fixed in the membrane. These components are arranged in order of increasing redox potential. Therefore, reducing equivalents (electrons) flow in one direction, I - II - III - IV, only because redox couple with low redox potential is better electron donor where as the one with high redox potential is electron acceptor. Thus, reducing equivalents (electrons) flow through the chain from the components of more negative redox potential to the components of more positive redox potential.Complex I (NADH - CoQ reductase) catalyzes the transfer of electron from NADH to coenzyme Q (CoQ).Complex II (Succinate - CoQ reductase or succinate dehydrogenase) transfers electrons from succinate to coenzyme Q.Complex III (CoQ - cytochrome C reductase), transfers electron from CoQ to cytochrome C.Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) transfers electrons from cytochrome C to O,.o Molecular is the last electron acceptor in ETC.o The flow of reducing equivalents (electrons) is in following sequence. Most of the substrate transfer their reducing equivalents to NAD to form NADH, reaction is catalyzed by dehydrogenases. Reduced NADH is oxidized by NADH dehydrogenase (NADH-CoQ reductase), an enzyme which contains FMN as a coenzyme and also a Fe-S protein. NADH transfers reducing equivalents to FMN which, intum, transfers reducing equivalents to FeS. FeS transfers reducing equivalents to coenzyme Q (CoQ). Further transfer is in sequence of Cyt b - Fe-S - Cvt C 1, - Cytc --> Cyt a - Cyt a3 - O2o Succinate transfer its reducing equivalents to FADH2 which transfer them to Fe-S.

Which of these is not a method for introducing genes into a cell?,Transfection,Electroporation,FISH,Recombination,"Methods for introducing genes into a cell include, transfection (chemical based), electroporation (physical), infection (viral mediated) and recombination techniques. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescence-tagged probes to detect specific DNA sequences in tissue samples. It is not used for introducing genes into the cells. Methods for genetic manipulation: Transfection is the most commonly used method for introducing transgenes into human embryonic stem (hES) cells. This system is based on the use of carrier molecules that bind to foreign nucleic acids and introduce them into the cells through the plasma membrane. Electroporation is a method that employs the administration of sho electrical impulses that create transient pores in the cell membrane, allowing foreign DNA to enter into the cells. Infection is gene manipulation by viral infection which can produce a very high percentage of modified cells. Advantage over other systems are, high efficiency of DNA transfer (almost 100% efficiency) and single copy integrations. Recombination occurs by physical exchange of DNA. An endogenous gene can be replaced by a transfected gene using homologous recombination. Recombination is the result of crossing-over that occurs at chiasmata and involves two of the four chromatids.

False regarding HMP shunt -,NADPH is produced,Ribulose 5 phosphate is produced,ATP is produced,Occurs in cytosol,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., ATP is produced o HMP shunt does not produce ATP.HMP shunto HMP shunt is a multicyclic process in which 3 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate give rise to 3 molecules of CO2 and 3 molecules of 5-carbon sugars (ribulose-5-phosphate). The latter are rearranged to generate 2 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate (through fructose-6-phosphate) and 1 molecule glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. HMP shunt does not generate ATP.3 Glucose-6-phosphate + 6 NADP - 2 glucose-6-phosphate + 1 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + 6 NADPH +3CO2o The reaction of HMP shunt are divided into two phases : -Phase I (Oxidative irreversible phase) : - During this phase, 3 molecules of glucose-6-phosphate are oxidized with generation of 6 molecules of NADPH, and three molecules of pentose phosphate (ribulose- 5-phosphate), with liberation of three molecules of CO2. Metabolites produced during this phase are 6- phosphoglucanolactone, 6-phosphogiuconate and ribulose-5-phosphate.Phase II (Non-oxidative reversible phase): - During this phase, pentose phosphate is converted to inter- mediates of glycolysis, i.e., glucose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

Not a metabolic product of urea cycle-,Citrulline,Ornithine,Alanine,Arginine,"Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps.

1) Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by condensation of CO2 and ammonia.
Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate-limiting enzyme of the urea cycle. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate.
2) Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine.
3) Argininosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate.
This reaction requires 1ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi.
The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4).
4) Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase) catalyzes the cleavage of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate.
Fumarate enters in TCA cycle. 
5) Arginase catalyzes the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine.
Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle.",C

Watercan perineum is caused by,Escherichia coli,Enterococcus fecalis,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Treponema pallidium,"Gonorrhea is a venereal disease that has been known since ancient times. The disease is acquired by sexual contact. Caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The first step in infection is adhesion of gonococci to the urethra or other mucosal surfaces. Pili are involved in this adhesion. Adhesion is rapid and firm so that micturition after exposure offers no protection against infection. The cocci penetrate through the intercellular spaces and reach the subepithelial connective tissue by the third day of infection. The incubation period is 2-8 days. In men, the disease stas as an acute urethritis with a mucopurulent discharge containing gonococci in large numbers. The infection extends along the urethra to prostrate, seminal vesicles and epididymis. The infection may spread to the periurethral tissues, causing abscess and multiple discharging sinuses: Watercan perineum.

Which complex of ETC is not associated with liberation of energy -,Complex 1,ComplexII,Complex III,ComplexIV,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Complex II o During the transfer of electrons through the ETC, energy is produced. This energy is coupled to the formation of ATP molecules by phosphorylation of ADP by an enzyme F0F1, ATPase. The phosphorylation of ADP into ATP is coupled with oxidation of reducing equivalents, therefore the process is called oxidative phosphorylation,o There are three ATP synthesizing sites of electron transport chain : (i) Site I is between NAD and CoQ. i.e., Complex I; (ii) Site II is between CoQ and cytochrome C, i.e., Complex III; and (iii) Site III is between cytochrome C and oxygen, i.e., complex IV. These sites provide energy required to make ATP from ADP by an enzyme F0F1 ATPase.o The energy liberated of site I (complex I) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule, at site II (complex III) is used to synthesize 1 ATP molecule and at site III (Complex IV) is used to synthesize Vi ATP molecule. Thus, when 1 NADH molecule enters the respiratory chain, it produce 2.5 molecules of ATP. When 1 molecule of FADH2 enters the respiratory chain only 1.5 molecules of ATP are produced as site 1 of energy liberation is bypassed.Note : Previously it was assumed the NADH produces 3 ATPs and FAD generates 2 ATPs. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1.5 ATPs.",B

"A 40-year-old male is well controlled on warfarin for a factor V Leiden deficiency and recurrent deep vein thrombosis. He presents today with a community-acquired pneumonia and is placed on erythromycin. Three days later, he develops bleeding and his INR is 8.0 (indicating an increased time for blood clotting to occur, where INR is international normalized ratio). Which of the following best explains why this bleeding occurred?",The erythromycin inhibited cytochrome P450,The erythromycin stimulated cytochrome P450,The causative agent of the pneumonia inhibited vitamin K utilization,The causative agent of the pneumonia stimulated vitamin K utilization,"Warfarin is metabolized by a specific subset of induced P450 isozymes. The P450 system is used by cells to modify the xenobiotic (in this case the warfarin) such that it can be more easily excreted. Erythromycin, along with other macrolide antibiotics, inhibits the P450 oxidizing system, which in this case would lead to a higher blood level of warfarin and, therefore, the balance of clotting and bleeding is shifted toward excessive bleeding. A stimulation of P450 production by erythromycin would lead to a lower level of warfarin (because of increased metabolism and loss of warfarin by P450) and the potential for excessive clotting. This effect of P450 is a common drug-drug interaction. The causative agents of community- acquired pneumonia do not affect vitamin K absorption in the small intestine, or distribution throughout the body. Erythromycin does not affect mitochondrial transcription, although it may affect mitochondrial translation. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis, however, will not alter the inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity, and the increased levels of warfarin present, which may lead to increased bleeding.",A

Which of the following is involved in transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus,Clathrin,Caveolae,Flotillin,Impoins,"Transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus requires transpo factors like karyopherins called Impoins, Clathrin, Caveolae and Flotillin are all involved in Endocytosis (transpo of molecules from the surface of a cell into the cytoplasm). Impoins are involved in transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus. Impoins: Cytoplasm to Nucleus: RAN cycle. Transpo of large molecules from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus requires association with transpo factors like karyopherins called Impoins. The entry and exit of large molecules from the cell nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) Cargo NLS: Protein that must be impoed to the nucleus from the cytoplasm carry nuclear localization signals (NLS). A NLS is a sequence of aminoacids that acts as a tag. The initial step in translocation through the pore involves binding of Cargo-NLS complex to impoins. The ability of both impoins and expoins to transpo their cargo is regulated by the small Ras related GTPase, RaN. Although no consumption of high-energy phosphatase is needed for translocation through the pore, the energy potential for impo comes from the high nuclear Ran-GTP concentration. Expo is coupled directly to the RamGAP/RanBP1 induced GTP hydrolysis in the cytoplasm. By the addition of cytoplasmic Ran-GTP, the Ran gradient is inveed, nuclear translocation of expo substrates can occur. Such a model is akin to transpo mechanisms of ions through membranes where electrochemical gradients are used to pump ions against their concentration gradient. Clathrin, Caveolae and Flotillin are all involved in Endocytosis (Transpo of Molecules from the surface of a cell into the cytoplasm) (Not from cytoplasm to the Nucleus) Endocytosis involves the capture of material from the surface of a cell and transpo of that material into the cytoplasm.

A 4 year old child develops an infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. How does infection with this organism cause blindness?,Cataract formation,Hemorrhage into the anterior chamber,Hemorrhage into the posterior chamber,Scarring of the cornea,"Chlamydia trachomatis (serotypes A, B, and C) causes a conjunctival and corneal infection that is spread in developing countries by eye-seeking flies. The lesions begin with formation of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva. With disease progression, there is tissue necrosis, granulation tissue deposition, and scar formation, leading to lacrimal duct obstruction and distoion of the eyelids. With the loss of an adequate tear system, the cornea becomes vulnerable to dehydration and opacification. Also, the vigorous inflammatory response can directly involve the cornea, with resulting opacity. In developed countries, chlamydial eye infections are often transmitted venereally rather than by flies, and may cause conjunctivitis in the newborn and in sexually active young adults.

"Respiration stops in the last stage of expiration, in forced expiration b/c of:",Respiratory muscle fatigue,Collapse of alveoli,Dynamic compression of airways,Breaking effect of inspiratory muscles.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Dynamic compression of airways. When a forceful expiratory effort is made following changes are seen-In the beginning, when the lung is fully expanded, air flow rate is very high but as the lung volume shrinks (due to continuance of expiration), air flow rate reduces continually.A time, thus comes when despite a maximal expiratory effort, virtually no more air is driven out of the lungs. This volume of lung, at which no air flow from the lung occurs despite effort, is called the closing volume.ReasonA negative intrapleural pressure is required to keep the bronchioles stretched open.As the lung deflates, the intrapleural pressure (Ppl) rises from negative value to 'zero' - this creates a situation when the walls of the bronchioles are no more stretched - bronchodilation ceases - bronchial narrowing - increased air flow resistance - drop of rate of airflow.When the lung volume has sufficiently shrunken, the finest bronchioles are virtually closed - closing volume.",C

The acid-base disorder here is ________",Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,"The acid-base disorder here is a mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. It should not be confused with metabolic acidosis with uncompensated respiratory alkalosis. This can be understand by the following calculation: Step 1: The pH in this patient is 7.1 (pH < 7.35) which indicates acidosis Step 2: HCO3- is 12mmol/L (Normal HCO3- : 22-30 mmol/L). In metabolic acidosis, HCO3- levels decrease. Hence, this is a case of metabolic acidosis. Step 3: As per Winter&;s formula , the expected respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis can be calculated using, pCO2= (1.5*) + 8 +/- 2 = 26+/- 2 = 24-28 mmHg. The pCO2 in this patient is 18 mmHg, which implies there is an overcompensation of pCO2. This overcompensation can happen only if there is an additional component of respiratory alkalosis contributing to reduce pCO2. Hence, this patient has a mixed disorder- metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis Ref: Harrison&;s Principles Of Internal Medicine 20th edition Pgno: 315",A

Basement membrane degeration is mediated by,Metalloproteinases,Oxidases,Elastases,Hydroxylases,"They are zinc-dependent endopeptidases; other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacin. The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily. Collectively they are capable of degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins. They cleave cell surface receptors, release the apoptotic ligands (such as the FAS ligand), and inactivate chemokines/cytokines. MMPs also play a major role on cell proliferation, migration (adhesion/ dispersion), differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and host defense. The MMPs play an impoant role in tissue remodeling associated with morphogenesis, angiogenesis, tissue repair, cirrhosis, ahritis, and metastasis. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are thought to be impoant in cancer metastasis. MMP-1 is involved in rheumatoid ahritis, osteoahritis and aoic aneurysm. Excess MMPs degrade the structural proteins of the aoic wall. The MMPs are inhibited by specific endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which comprise a family of four protease inhibitors: TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4.Ref: DM Vasudevan, page no: 548",A

Yoke muscle pair,Rt IR + Rt SR,Rt LR + Rt MR,Rt LR + Lt MR,Lt LR + Lt MR,"Yoke muscles are the primary muscles in each eye that accomplish a given version (eg, for right gaze, the right lateral rectus and left medial rectus muscles). Each extraocular muscle has a yoke muscle in the opposite eye to accomplish versions into each gaze position. By the Herring law, yoke muscles receive equal and simultaneous innervation. The magnitude of innervation is determined by the fixating eye, which means that the angle of detion between eyes (strabismus) may vary depending on which eye is fixating. The primary detion is misalignment, with the normal eye fixating. If the paretic eye fixates, the ensuing secondary detion is typically larger than the primary detion. Ref - medscape.com",C

Disorder shown in the Illustration is related to:,Mismatch repair,Base excision repair,Nucleotide excision repair,SOS repair,"Ans. C. Nucleotide Excision RepairDisorder shown: Xeroderma pigmentosuma. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder of DNA repair in which the ability to repair damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light is deficient.b. In extreme cases, all exposure to sunlight must be forbidden, no matter how small; as such, individuals with the disease are often colloquially referred to as ""Moon child"".c. Multiple basal cell carcinomas (basaliomas) and other skin malignancies frequently occur at a young age in those with XP; metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the two most common causes of death in XP victims.d. This disease is present in both genders and in all races, with an incidence of 1:250,000 in the United States. XP is roughly six times more common in Japanese people than in other groups.e. Normally, damage to DNA in epidermal cells occurs during exposure to UV light. The absorption of the high-energy light leads to the formation of pyrimidine dimers, namely cyclo butane-pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-6-4- pyrimidone photoproducts.f. In a healthy, normal human being, the damage is first excised by endonucleases. DNA polymerase then repairs the missing sequence, and ligase ""seals"" the transaction. This process is known as nucleotide excision repair.",C

"All of the following statements about angiotensin II are TRUE, EXCEPT:",Autoregulation of GFR,Release aldosrerone,Secreted from endothelium,Constriction of afferent aeriole,"Angiotensinogen is the circulating protein substrate from which renin cleaves angiotensin I. It is synthesized in the liver within a few seconds to minutes after formation of angiotensin I, two additional amino acid are split from the angiotensin I to from the 8-amino acid peptide angiotensin II. This conversation occurs almost entirely in the lungs while the blood flows through the small vessels of lungs, catalyzed by an enzyme called angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) that is present in the endothelium of the lungs vessels. FUNCTION: Angiotensin II is an extremely powerful vasoconstrictor. Vasoconstrictor occurs intensely in the aerioles and much less so in the veins. It decrease excretion of both slowly salt and water by the kidneys. This slowly increases the extracellular fluid volume, which then increase the aerial pressure during subsequent hours and days. It exes impoant actions at vascular smooth muscle, adrenal coex, kidney, hea and brain. Act directly on the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal coex to stimulate aldosterone biosynthesis. At higher concentrations, angiotensin II also stimulates glucocoicoid biosynthesis. Angiotensin II act on the kidney to cause renal vasoconstriction, contraction of mesangial cells with a resultant decrease in GFR increase proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and inhibit the secretion of renin. In addition to its central effects on blood pressure, angiotensin II acts on the central nervous system to stimulate drinking (dipsogenic effect ) and increase the secretion of vasopressin and adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH).

The refractory power of eye is normally 59 diopters. Two-thirds of this is contributed by,Anterior surfaceofthe lens,Posterior surface of the lens,Anterior surface of the cornea,Aqueous humor and vitreous humor combined,"If all the refractive surfaces of the eye are algebraically added together and then considered to be one single lens, the optics of the normal eye may be simplified and represented schematically as a ""reduced eye."" This representation is useful in simple calculations. In the reduced eye, a single refractive surface is considered to exist, with its central point 17 millimeters in front of the retina and a total refractive power of 59 diopters when the lens is accommodated for distant vision. About two-thirds of the 59 diopters of refractive power of the eye is provided by the anterior surface of the cornea (not by the eye lens). The principal reason for this phenomenon is that the refractive index of the cornea is markedly different from that of air, (The refractive index of air is 1.00), whereas the refractive index of the eye lens is not greatly different from the indices of the aqueous humor and vitreous humor.Ref: Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology, 13th edition",C

Onion skin fibrosis of the common bile duct is,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosisg cholangitis,Extrahepatic biliary fibrosis,Congenital hepatic fibrosis,"Refer Robbins page no Pg 860 MORPHOLOGY Morphologic changes differ between the large ducts (intrahe- patic and extrahepatic) and the smaller intrahepatic ducts. Large duct inflammation is similar to that seen in ulcerative colitis: acute, neutrophilic infiltration of the epithelium superim- posed on a chronic inflammatory background. Inflamed areas develop strictures because edema and inflammation narrows the lumen or because of subsequent scarring. The smaller ducts, however, often have little inflammation and show a strik- ing circumferential ""onion skin"" fibrosis around an increas- ingly atrophic duct lumen (Fig. 18-39), eventually leading to obliteration by a ""tombstone"" scar. Because the likelihood of sampling smaller duct lesions on a random needle biopsy is miniscule, diagnosis depends on radiologic imaging of the extrahepatic and larger intrahepatic ducts.

Action of a-subunit of G protein is:,Breakdown of GTP to GDP,Conversion of GDP to GTP,Internalization of receptors,Binding of agonist,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Breakdown of GTP to GDP This question is an indirect repetition from May 08 (q no. 22 of biochemistry). a-subunit of G protein has inherent GTPase activity which converts GTP into GDP.G proteinsG proteins are so-called because they bind the guanine nucleotidesGDP and GTP.

At least 21 different kinds of Ga molecules are found in mammalian cells.GbGgHow They WorkIn the inactive state G protein has GDP bound to its Ga subunit.When a hormone or other ligand binds to the associated G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), the GDP is exchanged for GTPGTP activates Ga causing it to dissociate from GbGg (which remain linked as a dimer).Activated Ga in turn activates an effector molecule (adenylyl cyclase- an enzyme in the inner face of the plasma membrane which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into the ""second messenger"" cyclic AMP).HormoneGDP The beta and gamma subunit do not separate from each other, and GbGg dimer also activates a variety of effectors.* The actions of the Ga-GTP complex are short lived because the a-subunit has an inherent GTPase activity, resulting in the rapid hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This leads to reassociation of the Ga unit with the GbGg dimer. This inactivates the G protein.",A

Not true about bile salts,Contain amino acid,Acts by increasing surface tension,They are amphipathic,Responsible for emulsification of fat,"Bile is made up of the bile acids, bile pigments, and other substances dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte solution that resembles pancreatic juice. About 500 mL issecreted per day. Some of the components of the bile are reabsorbed in the intestine and then excreted again by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The glucuronides of the bile pigments, bilirubin, and biliverdin, are responsible for the golden yellow color of bile. bile acids secreted into the bile are conjugated to glycineor taurine, a derivative of cysteine. The bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol. The two principal (primary) bile acids formed in the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. In the colon, bacteria conve cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid to lithocholic acid. In addition, small quantities of ursodeoxycholic acid are formed from chenodeoxycholic acid. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a tautomer of chenodeoxycholic acid at the 7-position. Because they are formed by bacterial action, deoxycholic, lithocholic, and ursodeoxycholic acids are called secondary bile acids. The bile salts have a number of impoant actions: theyreduce surface tension and, in conjunction with phospholipids and monoglycerides, are responsible for the emulsification of fat preparatory to its digestion and absorption in the small intestine. They are amphipathic, that is, they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains; one surface of the molecule is hydrophilic because the polar peptide bond and the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are on that surface, whereas the other surface is hydrophobic. Therefore, the bile salts tend to form cylindrical disks called micelles. Their hydrophilic poions face out and their hydrophobic poions face in. Above a ceain concentration, called the critical micelle concentration, all bile salts added to a solution form micelles. Lipids collect in the micelles, with cholesterol in the hydrophobic center and amphipathic phospholipids and monoglycerides lined up with their hydrophilic heads on the outside and their hydrophobic tails in the center. The micelles play an impoant role in keeping lipids in solution and transpoing them to the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, where they are absorbed. Ninety to 95% of the bile salts are absorbed from the small intestine. Once they are deconjugated, they can be absorbed by nonionic diffusion, but most are absorbed in their conjugated forms from the terminal ileum (Figure 26-18) by an extremely efficient Na+ -bile salt cotranspo system powered by basolateral Na+-K+ATPase. The remaining 5-10% of thebile salts enter the colon and are conveed to the salts of deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. Lithocholate is relatively insoluble and is mostly excreted in the stools; only 1% is absorbed. However, deoxycholate is absorbed. The absorbed bile salts are transpoed back to the liver in the poal vein and excreted in the bile (enterohepatic circulation).REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:438,439,440",B

Best medium to grow anaerobic bacteria exclusively is: March 2007,Blood agar,Robeson's cooked meat medium,Thioglycollate medium,Sabouraud Dextrose agar,"Ans. B: Robeson's cooked meat medium An anaerobic bacteria culture is a method used to grow anaerobes from a clinical specimen. Robeson's cooked meat medium is probably the most widely used fluid medium for the culture of anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only in the absence of oxygen. Obligate anaerobes are destroyed when exposed to the atmosphere for as briefly as 10 minutes. Facultative anaerobes are those organisms that will grow with or without oxygen. Many anaerobes have characteristic microscopic morphology. For example, Bacteroides spp. are gram-negative rods that are pleomorphic (variable in size and shape) and exhibit irregular bipolar staining. Fusobacterium spp. are often pale gram-negative spindle-shaped rods having pointed ends. Clostridium spp. are large gram-positive rods that form spores. Blood agar is a solid culture medium consisting of agar, peptones and blood. It is an example of an enriched, non selective general purpose medium since it suppos the growth of most aerobic and aerobic bacteria.

What is TRUE regarding Barrett&;s esophagus -,Seen in females,Responds to conservative management,Premalignant condition,Squamous metaplasia is seen,"Barrett&;s esophagus is more common in men than in women (3 : 1 ratio) Barrett&;s esophagus can be reversed but only with antireflux surgery (response to medications is not good). A fundoplication may promote regression of the columnar epithelium. Many studies have shown that regression occurs in 15-50% of patients when the length of the Barrett segment is less than 3 cm."" The common belief that Barrett&;s epithelium cannot be reversed is likely false. DeMeester and associates repoed that, after antireflux surgery, loss of IM (intestinal metaplasia) in patients with visible BE was rare, but occurred in73% of patients with inapparent IM of the cardia. This suggests that the metaplastic process may indeed be reversible if reflux is eliminated early in its process, that cardiac mucosa is dynamic, and that, as opposed to IM extending several centimeters into the esophagus, IM of the cardia is more likely to regress following antireflux surgery. More about the tit of Barret&;s oesophagus First, the natural course of Barrett&;s oesophagus. - Barrett&;s esophagus develops during healing of erosive esophagitis with continued acid reflux and the Barrett&;s esophagus progresses through a dysplastic stage before developing into adenocarcinoma. The stages are - Erosive esophagitis - Metaplasia (Barrett&;s esophagus) - Low grade dysplasia - high grade dysplaisa - Adenocarcinoma Treatment of Barrett&;s esophagus is same as for reflux esophagitis - Conservative (antacids, H2 blocking agents, elevation of the head of bed, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol etc.) and Anti-reflux surgery (Nissen&;s fundoplication is anti-reflux procedure of choice) As there is substantial increased risk of cancer with Barrett&;s esophagus, a regular follow-up with endoscopy and biopsy is done. This allows detection of cancer at an early stage with improved long-term survival after resection In the absence of dysplasia - Surveillance endoscopy every 12-24 months. In the presence of low-grade dysplasia - Patients with low grade dysplasia should be treated for 12 weeks with high-dose acid suppression therapy and then biopsy repeated. (the rationale for this approach is to decrease the mucosal inflammation by blocking acid secretion, allowing the pathologist a more accurate reading),If the repeated biopsy show metaplasia or high-grade dysplasia, the patient should be managed accordingly. If repeated low-grade dysplasia is seen- surveillance endoscopy is done every 6-12 months. If high grade dysplasia is detected (the diagnosis must be confirmed by two experienced pathologist) - esophagectomy with removal of all columnar lined epithelium or if resection is not done, then the patient should be strictly followed at 3 monthly interval. If cancer is detected resection is done. Rationale for esophagectomy in high grade dysplasia is based on the following considerations- (a) cancer is already present in about 30 to 50% of patients operated for high grade dysplasia. (b) cancer develops in about 50% fo patients during follow up.) Ref : CSDT 13/e p438 ; Schwaz 9/e p841",C

Which of the following is known as the guardian of the genome?,VEGFR-2,p53,Mdm2,4ATM,"Due to its critical impoance in maintaining genetic stability p53 is called the ""gatekeeper"" or ""guardian"" of the genome. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a key regulator, of the cellular response to geno-toxic damage, and thus plays a pivotal role in preventing cancer formation. Once DNA damage has been incurred, p53 can elicit several different responses to either correct the errors or destroy the damaged cell. 3 Impoant actions: 1. p53 can induce G1 cell cycle arrest, which stops the cell from dividing and allows time to repair the damage before the DNA is replicated. 2. p53 can activate DNA repair proteins to drive the repair of damaged DNA. 3. As a last reso, p53 can induce damaged cells to undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis), thereby eliminating damaged and potentially dangerous cells at risk for neoplastic transformation.

Reduced glutathione removes H2O2 in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that contains the selenium analog of cysteine (selenocysteine) at the active site. The reaction is impoant since accumulation of H2O2 may decrease the lifespan of the erythrocyte by causing oxidative damage to the cell membrane, leading to hemolysis. Ref: Bender D.A., Mayes P.A.

The first urge to void occurs when the bladder contains _____ ml of urine,image_question,image_question,image_question,image_question,"The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 ml, and marked sense of fullness at about 400 ml. Cystometrogram The curve shows An initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in the volume are produced (Ia); A long, nearly flat segment as fuher increments are produced (Ib) A sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered (II) The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. P= 2T/R In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ fill but does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full.

Vibrations are felt by ?,Meissner's corpuscle,Merkel's disc,Pacinian corpuscle,Ruffini's end organ,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Pacinian corpuscle Tactile (touch) receptors These are general exteroreceptors for epicritic senses. These are divided into superficial and deep receptors. Superficial receptors are present in the epidermis or papillary layer of dermis. In glabrous (nonhairy) skin these receptors are Merkel's disc (slowly adapting) and Meissner 's corpuscle (rapidly adapting). In hairy skin there are hair follicle receptors. Deep receptors are present in deeper dermis or in the subcutaneous tissues. The deep receptors are same in both hair and nonhairy skin and include Ruffini's end organ (slowly adapting) and Pacinian corpuscle (Rapidly adapting). Touch, pressure and vibration are different forms of same sensation. Pressure is felt when the force applied on the skin is sufficient to reach the deep receptors, whereas touch is felt when the force is insufficent to reach the deep receptors, therefore detected by superficial receptors (Merkel's disc, meissner's corpuscle). Vibrations are rhythmic variations in pressure (i.e. rhymic variations of force that reaches the deep receptors). Whether a tactile receptor senses pressure or vibration depends on whether the receptor is slowly adapting or slowly adaping :? i) Slowly adapting (Ruffini's end organ) :- Are meant to detect sustained pressure; they are useless for vibrations. ii) Rapidly adapting (Pacinian corpuscle) :- Stop discharge in response to sustained pressure; they are useful only when the pressure fluctuates rapidly, i.e. during vibrations. The higher the rate of adaptation of a receptor, the greater is the vibration frequency it can detect. Thus, tactile (touch) sensation can be divided into :? A) Superficial (generally considered as touch) :- Detected by Meissner 's corpuscle (detect texture of surface, i.e. rough or smooth) and Merkel's disc (detect two point discrimination). B) Deep i) Pressure (Deep touch) :- Detected by Ruffini's end organ. ii) Vibrations :- Detected by Pacinian corpuscle",C

Diastolic hea failure is impairment in the filling of the left ventricle. Which of the following is LEAST likely to occur?,Improvement of the patient's condition with administration of calcium channel blocker,Decreased compliance of the hea Increased left atrial pressure,Increased left atrial pressure,Improvement of patient's condition with administration of a positive inotropic agent,"Diastolic dysfunction is an impairment in the filling of the left ventricle (""stiff ventricle"") caused by decreased compliance at a normal left atrial pressure. Systolic hea failure, which is an impairment in contractility, has a better response to positive inotropic agents. Most patients have a combination of both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.In diastolic hea failure, filling of the left ventricle is slow or incomplete (i.e., decreased compliance) unless left atrial pressures increase to maintain the ejection fraction at the expense of increasing pulmonary and systemic venous congestion. Clinical findings include dyspnea, which is the most common symptom, resulting from interstitial and pulmonary edema. Pathophysiologically, there is left atrial hypeension and pulmonary venous hypeension, leading to pulmonary congestion. Therapy is aimed at slowing the hea rate, which promotes filling of the left ventricle at low pressures. -Adrenergic blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have a better survival rate than those with systolic dysfunction, because the ejection fraction is normal to slightly decreased, albeit at the expense of increased left atrial pressures.Systolic dysfunction is an impairment in contractility of the left ventricle or a defect in the ability ofmyofibrils to shoen against a load. The left ventricle loses its ability to eject blood into the aoa, so the ejection fraction (i.e., stroke volume/left ventricular end-diastolic volume) is decreased (usually < 40%); the normal ejection fraction is 80/120, or 66%, with a range of 55% to 75%. The ejection fraction is measured by echocardiography or radionuclide ventriculography. Signs of isolated systolic dysfunction include fatigue, prerenal azotemia, cool skin, and mental obtundation. The left ventricular chamber eventually dilates and patients develop fatigue, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided hea failure. Examples of systolic dysfunction include post-myocardial infarction, ischemic injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction), and congestive cardiomyopathy. Therapy is aimed at improving the performance of the left ventricle with the administration of positive inotropic agents and peripheral vasodilators to decrease peripheral resistance.",D

The primary action on Nitric oxide (NO) in the gastrointestinal tract is,Vasodilatation,Vasoconstriction,Gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxation,Gastrointestinal slow smooth muscle contraction,"Peristalsis is a reflex response that is initiated when the gut wall is stretched by the contents of the lumen, and it occurs in all pas of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. The stretch initiates a circular contraction behind the stimulus and an area of relaxation in front of it. The wave of contraction then moves in an oral-to-caudal direction, propelling the contents of the lumen forward at rates that vary from 2 to 25 cm/s. Peristaltic activity can be increased or decreased by the autonomic input to the gut, but its occurrence is independent of the extrinsic innervation. Indeed, progression of the contents is not blocked by removal and resuture ofa segment of intestine in its original position and is blocked only if the segment is reversed before it is sewn back into place. Peristalsis is an excellent example of the integrated activity of the enteric nervous system. It appears that local stretch releases serotonin, which activates sensory neurons that activate the myenteric plexus. Cholinergic neurons passing in a retrograde direction in this plexus activate neurons that release substance P and acetylcholine, causing smooth muscle contraction. At the same time, cholinergic neurons passing in an anterograde direction activate neurons that secrete NO, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), producing the relaxation ahead of the stimulus.</P>REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:469,470",C

Thus, stenosis of the radial aery results in a decreased blood flow in the princeps pollicis aery. Superficial palmar aerial arch is formed primarily by the ulnar aery, which passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum. Extensor compament of the forearm receives blood from the posterior interosseous aery, which arises from the common interosseous branch of the ulnar aery.",D

"An infant had a high-grade fever and respiratory distress at the time of presentation to the emergency room. The sample collected for blood culture was subsequently positive showing growth of a haemolytic colonies. On Gram staining, these were gram-positive cocci. In the screening test for identification, the suspected pathogen is likely to be susceptible to the following agent",Bacitracin,Novobiocin,Optochin,Oxacillin,"The pathogen is likely to be streptococcus pneumoniae, which is alpha hemolytic ( greenish discoloration due to incomplete hemolysis ) and gram-positive. Streptococcus pneumoniae is optochin sensitive. Optochin sensitivity: the sensitivity of Streptococcus pneumoniae to optochin is useful in differentiating it from other streptococci. When a disc impregnated with optochin is applied on a plate of blood agar inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae, a wide zone of inhibition appears on incubation.

Most probable malignancy that develops in a case of long-standing goitre is -,Follicular Ca,Anaplastic Ca,Papillary Ca,Medullary Ca,"""An increased incidence of cancer (usually follicular) has been repoed from endemic areas. Dominant or rapidly growing nodules in longstanding goitres should always be subjected to aspiration cytology."" About Follicular Carcinoma (FTC) FTC is the second most common thyroid malignancies, more common in iodine-deficient areas. More common in women (Female: Male ratio of 3:1) Mean age of presentation is later than papillary Ca (- 50 yrs) Multiple foci are rarely seen and lymph node involvement is much less common than in papillary carcinoma. Bloodborne metastasis is common with spread to bone, lungs, liver and elsewhere. In less than 1% of cases, follicular cancers may be hyperfunctioning (warm nodule on scintiscan), leading to a symptom of thyrotoxicosis. Histopathology - Follicular carcinomas are usually solitary lesions, the majority of which are encapsulated. - Microscopically most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles containing colloid (quite like normal thyroid). In other cases, follicular differentiation may be less apparent, and there may be nests or sheets of cells without colloid. - the nuclei lack the typical features of papillary Ca.
