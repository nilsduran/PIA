Diapedisis is,Immigration of leucocytes through basement membrane,Immigration of leucocytes through the vessel wall,Aggregation of platelet at the site of inflammation,Autodigest of the cell,"Ref ref Robbins 9/e p76 * After transient vasoconstriction (lasting only for seconds), aeriolar vasodilation occurs, resulting in locally increased blood flow and engorgement of the down-stream capillary beds (Fig. 2-2). This vascular expansion is the cause of the redness (erythema) and warmth characteristic of acute inflammation, and men- tioned previously as two of the cardinal signs of inflammation. * The microvasculature becomes more permeable, and protein-rich fluid moves into the extravascular tissues. This causes the red cells in the flowing blood to become more concentrated, thereby increasing blood viscosity and slowing the circulation.

Which of the following is an oncogenic RNA virus,Hepatitis B virus,Human papilloma viruses,Epstein Barr virus,Hepatitis C virus,"Ref Robbins 8/e p315,9/e p328 Hepatitis C virus is only oncogenic RNA virus in the options.otherd mentioned are oncogenic DNA viruses Hepatitis C Virus Epidemiology and Transmission. HCV also is a major cause of liver disease. The worldwide carrier rate is esti- mated at 175 million persons (a 3% prevalence rate, ranging widely from 0.1% to 12%, depending on the country). Per- sistent chronic infection exists in 3 to 4 million persons in the United States, where the number of newly acquired HCV infections per year dropped from 180,000 in the mid- 1980s to about 19,000 in 2006. This welcome change resulted from the marked reduction in transfusion-associated hepa- titis C (as a result of screening procedures) and a decline of infections in intravenous drug abusers (related to prac- tices motivated by fear of human immunodeficiency virus infection). However, the death rate from HCV will con- tinue to climb for 20 to 25 years, because of the decades- long lag time between acute infection and liver failure. The major route of transmission is through blood inoculation, with intravenous drug use accounting for at least 60% of cases in the United States. Transmission by blood products is now for- tunately rare, accounting for only 4% of all acute HCV infections. Occupational exposure among health care workers accounts for another 4% of cases. The rates of sexual transmission and veical transmission are low. Infections of unknown origin account for 9% to 27% of cases. HCV infection has a much higher rate than HBV of pro- gression to chronic disease and eventual cirrhosis (Fig. 15-13). In fact, hepatitis C is the condition that most frequently necessitates liver transplantation in the United States. Viral Structure and Genome. HCV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Flavi- viridae. It contains highly conserved 5'- and 3'-terminal regions that flank a single open reading frame of nearly 9500 nucleotides that encode structural and nonstructural proteins. HCV is subclassified into six genotypes, based on the genetic sequence. Moreover, because of the poor fidel- ity of RNA replication, an infected person may carry many HCV variants, called quasispecies. The relationships between quasispecies and disease progression are being investi- gated, but it seems that high multiplicity of quasispecies is associated with worse prognosis. In addition, this variabil- ity seriously hampers effos to develop an HCV vaccine.",D
The level of branching of common carotid artery:,Upper border of thyroid cartilage,Lower border of cricoid cartilage,Lower border of thyroid cartilage,Hyoid,"COMMON CAROTID ARTERIES:
There are two common carotid arteries: right and left. They are the chief arteries of the head and neck.
Origin:
The right common carotid artery arises in neck from brachiocephalic trunk (innominate artery) behind the
sternoclavicular joint.
The left common carotid artery arises in thorax (superior mediastinum) directly from the arch of aorta. It ascends to the back of left sternoclavicular joint and enters the neck.
Course, Termination, and Relations:

In the neck, both arteries (right and left) have similar course.
Each artery runs upwards from sternoclavicular joint to the upper border of the lamina of thyroid cartilage (opposite the disc between the 3rd and 4th cervical vertebrae), where it terminates by dividing into internal and external carotid arteries.

As the total volume of the cell mass is not increased and the zona pellucida remains intact, the morula after spending about 3 days in the uterine tube enters the uterine cavity through the narrow uterine ostium (1 mm) on the 4th day in the 16-64 cell stage.",B
Fate of notochord is:,Annulus fibrosis,Nucleus pulposus,Veebral foramen,Spinous process,"Early in development, the embryonic mesoderm becomes differentiated into three distinct regions: paraxial mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm, and lateral mesoderm.The paraxial mesoderm gets divided into somites which gets differentiated into a ventromedial pa (the sclerotome) and a dorsolateral pa (the dermatomyotome).The dermatomyotome now fuher differentiates into the myotome and the dermatome.The mesenchymal cells of the sclerotome rapidly divide and migrate medially during the fouh week of development and surround the notochord.The caudal half of each sclerotome now fuses with the cephalic half of the immediately succeeding sclerotome to form the mesenchymal veebral body.Each veebral body is thus an intersegmental structure.The notochord degenerates completely in the region of the veebral body, but in the interveebral region, it enlarges to form the nucleus pulposus of the interveebral discs.The surrounding fibrocailage, the anulus fibrosus, of the interveebral disc is derived from sclerotomic mesenchyme situated between adjacent veebral bodies.",B

Total parathyroid gland in our body are?,1,2,3,4,"ANSWER: (D) 4REF: Gray's Anatomy 40th ed Ch: 32Parathyroid glands:The parathyroid glands are small, yellowish-brown, ovoid or lentiform structures, usually lying between the posterior lobar borders of the thyroid gland and its capsule.They are commonly 6 mm long, 3-4 mm across, and 1-2 mm from back to front, each weighing about 50 mg.Usually there are two on each side, superior and inferior.Variations:There may be only three or many minute parathyroid islands scattered in connective tissue near the usual sites.Normally the inferior parathyroids migrate only to the inferior thyroid poles, but they may descend with the thymus into the thorax or not descend at all, remaining above their normal level near the carotid bifurcation. To help identification, the anastomotic connection between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries along the posterior border of the thyroid gland usually passes very close to the parathyroids.The inferior pair are more variably situated , and may be within the fascial thyroid sheath, below the inferior thyroid arteries and near the inferior lobar poles; or outside the sheath, immediately above an inferior thyroid artery; or in the thyroid gland near its inferior poleThe superior parathyroids are usually dorsal, the inferior parathyroids ventral, to the recurrent laryngeal nerves.Vasculature: The parathyroid glands have a rich blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior vessels.Approximately one-third of human parathyroid glands have two or more parathyroid arteries. Lymph vessels are numerous and associated with those of the thyroid and thymus glands.Nerve supply: The nerve supply is sympathetic, either direct from the superior or middle cervical ganglia or via a plexus in the fascia on the posterior lobar aspects. Parathyroid activity is controlled by variations in blood calcium level: it is inhibited by a rise and stimulated by a fall. The nerves are believed to be vasomotor but not secretomotorHistology : Contains two types of cellsActive cells or chief cells which produce parathormone. Chief cells differ ultrastructurally according to their level of activity: active chief cells have large Golgi complexes with numerous vesicles and small membrane-bound granules. Glycogen granules are most abundant in inactive cells, which appear histologically as 'clear' cells. In normal human parathyroid glands, inactive chief cells outnumber active cells in a ratio of 3-5:1Second cell type, the oxyphil (eosinophil) cell, appears just before puber ty and increases in number with age. Oxyphil cells are larger than chief cells and contain more cytoplasm, ivhich stains deeply with eosin. Their nuclei are smaller and more darkly staining than those of chief cells, and their cytoplasm is unusually rich in mitochondria. The functional significance of oxyphil cells and their relationship to chief cells are uncertain",D

Clinically, it is an unpredictable, remit- ting and relapsing disease of acute or insidious onset that may involve viually any organ in the body; however, it affects principally the skin, kidneys, serosal membranes, joints, and hea. Immunologically, the disease is associ- ated with an enormous array of autoantibodies, classically including antinuclear antibodies (ANAs). The clinical pre- sentation of SLE is so variable, with so many overlapping features with those of other autoimmune diseases (RA, polymyositis, and others), that it has been necessary to develop diagnostic criteria for SLE (Table 4-9).

This lamina subsequently gives rise to a number of dental buds. Soon the deep surface of the buds invaginates, resulting in the cap stage of tooth development. Enamel is produced by ameioblasts which are derived from oral ectoderm. Although Ameioblasts appears earlier than Odontoblasts, its product enamel appears later than dentine.Mesenchyme: The ectoderm evokes a series of reaction in surrounding mesoderm to produce dental papilla. The surface cells of dental papilla becomes columnar Odontoblasts which produces dentine. Mesoderm of the dental papilla persists as pulp of the tooth surrounded by dentine. Cementum is produced in the mesoderm outside the dentine of the root, a process comparable to membranous ossification.",B

The sympathetic supply of the fallopian tube and ovary is from,T6 - T8,T8 - T10,T10 - T12,L2 - L4,"The nerve supply to ovaries runs the suspensory ligament of the ovary with the vasculature, to enter the ovary at the hilum.The ovaries receive sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibres from the ovarian and uterine (pelvic) plexuses, respectively. The ovarian plexus, derived from the renal, aoic and hypogastric plexuses, accompanies the ovarian aery. It contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Sympathetic nerves (T10, T11) are afferent for pain as well as efferent or vasomotor. Parasympathetic nerves (S2, 53, 54) are vasodilators . The uterine tubes are supplied by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves running along the uterine and ovarian aeries.The sympathetic neraes from T10 to L2 segments are derived from the hypogastric plexuses. They contain both visceral afferent and efferent fibres. The latter are vasomotor and perhaps stimulate tubal peristalsis. However, peristalsis is mainly under hormonal control.Parasympathetic neraes are derived from the vagus for the lateral half of the tube and from the pelvic splanchnic nerves from 52, 53, 54 segments of spinal cord for the medial half. They inhibii peristalsis and produce vasodilatation ref - BDC 6e vol2 pg384,386",C

It is the inv. of choice to exclude torsion from the epididymo-orchitis. Tc99m peechnate scan - it demonstrates decreased blood flow Management Immediate surgical exploration is indicated if testicular torsion is suspected because if treated within the first 4 to 6 hrs of onset of symptoms, the chances of testicular salvage is high. During surgical exploration the testis is detorsed to restore blood flow to the testicle. If ble, orchipexy of the affected and the contralateral testis is done. If the affected testicle is nonble, orchiectomy of the affected testicle and orchipexy of the contralateral testis is done.

Nucleus pulposis is derived from:,Neural crest,Notochord,Sclerotome,None of the above,"The nucleus pulposus is the sole remnant of the embryonic notochord, the initial longitudinal skeletal axis of the body. The developing bodies and interveebral discs of the veebral column replace the notochord. NOTOCHORD: The notochordal plate becomes the centrally placed notochord, which acts as a foundation around which the veebral column develops. It extends throughout the entire length of the future veebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the mid-brain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. The notochord then undergoes involution and becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervetebral disks. Remnants of the notochord: are located in the nucleus pulposus, clivus, nasopharyngeal notochordal bursa, and sacrum.The most common anomaly due to incomplete resorption of notochord is butterfly veebra. Nucleus pulposis: The nucleus pulposus is 70-90% water although the exact propoion varies with age. Proteoglycans are the next major component, and they constitute about 65% of the dry weight of the nucleus. Type II collagen is seen interspersed in the proteoglycan medium.It functions to distribute hydaulic pressure in all directons of the disc. It is present in the middle of the veebral disc.

MIC-2 mutation associated with,Osteosarcoma,Ewings sarcoma,Alveolar soft tissue sarcoma,Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance,"Reference Robbins page no 613Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor characterized by primitive round cells without obvious differentiation. Recently, Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) have been unified into a single category: the Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) based on shared clinical, morphologic, biochemical and molecular features (discussed later). Although PNET demonstrates more neu- roectodermal differentiation than Ewing sarcoma, the dis- tinction is not clinically significant. Ewing sarcoma family tumors account for approxi- mately 6% to 10% of primary malignant bone tumors and follow osteosarcoma as the second most common group of bone sarcomas in children. Of all bone sarcomas, ESFT have the youngest average age at presentation, since approximately 80% are younger than 20 years. Boys are affected slightly more frequently than girls, and there is a striking predilection for whites; blacks and Asians are rarely afflicted. ESFT usually arise in the diaphysis of long tubular bones, especially the femur and the flat bones of the pelvis. They present as painful enlarging masses,",B

"During pronation of foot, the axes of which two joints become parallel",Talocrural and subtalar,Talonavicular and calcaneocuboid,Talonayieular and subtalar,Midtarsal and tarsometatarsal,"An impoant function of the foot is propulsion of weight during stance phase . This function is made possible by the MT joint locking and unlocking. During heel strike, the foot needs to be flexible in order to adjust to the surface and the MT joint unlocks to provide this flexibility. Later in the gait cycle, the foot then needs to act as a rigid lever to propel the weight of the body forward which is made possible by MT joint locking. During pronation/eversion of the foot, the axis of the TN and CC joints are parallel to each other, making it easier for them to independently move and unlock the MT joint. The axes cross each other during supination/inversion which locks the MT joint making it difficult to move. Blackwood et al concluded that there is increased forefoot movement when the calcaneus is eveed. This is consistent with the MT joint locking mechanism. Ref - <a href=""",B

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is classified as,Allergic reaction,Type2 hypersensitivity,Immune complex mediated hypersensitivity,Cell mediated hypersensitivity,"Ref Robbins 9/e p117 Once complexes are deposited in the tissue, the third phase, the inflammatory reaction, ensues. During this phase (approximately 10 days after antigen administration), clini- cal features such as fever, uicaria, ahralgias, lymph node enlargement, and proteinuria appear. Wherever immune complexes deposit, characteristic tissue damage occurs. The immune complexes activate the complement system, leading to the release of biologically active frag- ments such as the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), which increase vascular permeability and are chemotactic for neutrophils and monocytes (Chapter 2). The complexes also bind to Fcg receptors on neutrophils and monocytes, activating these cells. Attempted phagocytosis of immune complexes by the leukocytes results in the secretion of a variety of additional pro-inflammatory substances, includ- ing prostaglandins, vasodilator peptides, and chemotactic substances, as well as lysosomal enzymes capable of digest- ing basement membrane, collagen, elastin, and cailage, and reactive-oxygen species that damage tissues. Immune complexes can also cause platelet aggregation and activate Hageman factor; both of these reactions augment the inflammatory process and initiate formation of micro- thrombi, which contribute to the tissue injury by producing local ischemia (Fig. 4-11). The resultant pathologic lesion is termed vasculitis if it occurs in blood vessels, glomerulo- nephritis if it occurs in renal glomeruli, ahritis if it occurs in the joints, and so on. Predictably, the antibody classes that induce such lesions are complement-fixing antibodies (i.e., IgG and IgM) and antibodies that bind to phagocyte Fc receptors (IgG). During the active phase of the disease, consumption of complement may result in decreased serum complement levels. The role of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent inflammation in the pathogenesis of the tissue injury is suppoed by the observation that experimental depletion of serum complement levels or knockout of Fc receptors in mice greatly reduces the severity of lesions, as does deple- tion of neutrophils.",C

When these postganglionic cholinergic axons grow peripherally after parotid surgery, they establish synapses upon the cholinergic sweat glands, which are innervated normally only by sympathetic fibers. As the peripheral nerves make new connections, aberrant connections can be formed between the auriculotemporal nerve and other glands (not usually innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve). This results in flushing and sweating in response to the thought, smell, or taste of food, instead of the previous, normal salivary secretion by the parotid gland.",C

The stria of Gennari is a histological feature of,Motor speech area,Auditory area,Visual area,Prefrontal area,"Variations in Coical Structure -The structure of the cerebral coex shows considerable variation from region to region, both in terms of thickness and in the prominence of the various laminae described above. Finer variations form the basis of the subdivisions into Brodmann's areas. Other workers divide the coex into five broad varieties. These are as follows. In the agranular coex the external and internal granular laminae are inconspicuous. This type of coex is seen most typically in the precentral gyrus (area 4) and is, therefore, believed to be typical of 'motor' areas. It is also seen in some other areas. In the granular coex the granular layers are highly developed while the pyramidal and ganglionic layers are poorly developed or absent. In the visual area the external band of Baillarger is prominent and forms a white line that can be seen with the naked eye when the region is freshly cut across. This stria of Gennari gives the name striate coex to the visual coex. Between the two extremes represented by the agranular and granular varieties of coex, three intermediate types are described as follows. Frontal coex Parietal coex and Polar coex. The frontal type is nearest to the agranular coex, the pyramidal cells being prominent, while the polar type is nearest to the granular coex.

The ?? in the following diagram is an important bony landmark used to differentiate between inguinal and femoral hernias. It is? (See Figure),Pubic symphysis,Ilio-pectinate line,Pubic tubercle,Iliopubic eminence.,"Ans. C. Pubic tuberclePhysical Examinationa. Physical examination is the best way to determine the presence or absence of an inguinal hernia. The diagnosis may be obvious by simple inspection when a visible bulge is present. The differential diagnosis must be considered in questionable cases (Table 36-4). Nonvisible hernias require digital examination of the inguinal canal. This is best done in both the lying and standing position. The examiner should place the tip of the index finger at the most dependent part of the scrotum and direct it into the external inguinal ring. The patient is then asked to strain. The ritual of having the patient cough is discouraged as it results in the over diagnosis of a hernia because of the difficulty of differentiating a normal expansile bulge of muscle from a true hernia, especially in asthenic individuals.b. Numerous authors have shown that the accuracy with which direct and indirect inguinal hernias can be distinguished clinically before surgery is low. 28,29,30 However, classic teaching is that an indirect hernia will push against the fingertip, whereas a direct hernia will push against the pulp of the finger. In addition, applying pressure over the mid- inguinal point (midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle, and just above the inguinal ligament) with the fingertip will control an indirect hernia and prevent it from protruding when the patient strains. A direct hernia will not be affected with this maneuver.c. A femoral hernia presents as a swelling below the inguinal ligament and just lateral to the pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias are over diagnosed because of the presence of a prominent femoral fat pad, a so-called femoral pseudohernia. Thin patients commonly have prominent bilateral bulges below the inguinal ligament medial to the femoral vessels. They are asymptomatic and disappear spontaneously when the patient assumes a supine position. Surgery is not indicated.",C

The stomach can be divided into four lymphatic territories . The drainage of these areas is as follows.
Upper part of left 1/3rd drains into the pancreaticosplenic nodes lying along the splenic artery, i.e. on the back of the stomach. Lymph vessels from these nodes travel along the splenic artery to reach the coeliac nodes.
Right 2/3rd drains into the left gastric nodes lying along the artery of the same name. These nodes also drain the abdominal part of the oesophagus. Lymph from these nodes drains into the coeliac nodes.
Lower part of left 1/3rd drains into the right gastroepiploic nodes that lie along the artery of the same name. Lymph vessels arising in these nodes drain into the first and second parts of the duodenum. From here the lymph is drained further into the hepatic nodes that lie along the hepatic artery; and finally into the coeliac nodes.
Lymph from i.e. pyloric part drains in different directions into the pyloric, hepatic, and left gastric nodes, and passes from all these nodes to the coeliac nodes.
Note that lymph from all areas of the stomach ultimately reaches the coeliac nodes. From here it passes through the intestinal lymph trunk to reach the cisterna chyli.",C

Nucleus pulposis is derived from ?,Neural crest,Notochord,Sclerotome,None of the above,"The nucleus pulposus is the sole remnant of the embryonic notochord, the initial longitudinal skeletal axis of the body. The developing bodies and interveebral discs of the veebral column replace the notochord. NOTOCHORD: The notochordal plate becomes the centrally placed notochord, which acts as a foundation around which the veebral column develops. It extends throughout the entire length of the future veebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the mid-brain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. The notochord then undergoes involution and becomes the nucleus pulposus of the interveebral disks. Remnants of the notochord: are located in the nucleus pulposus, clivus, nasopharyngeal notochordal bursa, and sacrum.The most common anomaly due to incomplete resorption of notochord is butterfly veebra. Nucleus pulposis: The nucleus pulposus is 70-90% water although the exact propoion varies with age. Proteoglycans are the next major component, and they constitute about 65% of the dry weight of the nucleus. Type II collagen is seen interspersed in the proteoglycan medium.It functions to distribute hydaulic pressure in all directons of the disc. It is present in the middle of the veebral disc.

Characteristic of acute inflammation is,Vasodilation and increase permeability,Vasoconstriction,Platelet aggregation,Infiltration by neutrophil,"Ref Robbins 8/e p 45 ,9/e p74 The acute inflammatory response rapidly delivers leuko- cytes and plasma proteins to sites of injury. Once there, leukocytes clear the invaders and begin the process of digesting and getting rid of necrotic tissues. Acute inflammation has two major components (Fig. 2-2): * Vascular changes: alterations in vessel caliber resulting in increased blood flow (vasodilation) and changes in the vessel wall that permit plasma proteins to leave the cir- culation (increased vascular permeability). In addition, endothelial cells are activated, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes and migration of the leukocytes through the vessel wall. * Cellular events: emigration of the leukocytes from the circulation and accumulation in the focus of injury (cel- lular recruitment), followed by activation of the leuko- cytes, enabling them to eliminate the offending agent. The principal leukocytes in acute inflammation are neu- trophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). Stimuli for Acute Inflammation Acute inflammatory reactions may be triggered by a variety of stimuli: * Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) are among the most common and medically impoant causes of inflammation. * Trauma (blunt and penetrating) and various physical and chemical agents (e.g., thermal injury, such as burns or frostbite; irradiation; toxicity from ceain environ- mental chemicals) injure host cells and elicit inflamma- tory reactions. * Tissue necrosis (from any cause), including ischemia (as in a myocardial infarct) and physical and chemical injury * Foreign bodies (splinters, di, sutures, crystal deposits * Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity reactions) against environmental substances or against ""self"" tissues. Because the stimuli for these inflammatory responses often cannot be eliminated or avoided, such reactions tend to persist, with features of chronic inflam- mation. The term ""immune-mediated inflammatory disease"" is sometimes used to refer to this group of disorders. Although each of these stimuli may induce reactions with some distinctive characteristics, in general, all inflamma- tory reactions have the same basic features. In this section, we describe first how inflammatory stimuli are recognized by the host, then the typical reac- tions of acute inflammation and its morphologic features, and finally the chemical mediators responsible for these reactions.",A

Which of the following muscles make up the injured structure?","Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres major, deltoid","Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres major, subscapularis","Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, deltoid","Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis","The above history describes a rotator cuff tear. Patients classically have difficulty doing overhead activities. On physical examination, she has weakness with abduction and external rotation of her shoulder. The supraspinatus is responsible for abduction and the infraspinatus is responsible for external rotation of the shoulder. These muscles, along with the teres minor and subscapularis, make up the rotator cuff. Brachial plexus injuries commonly present with some type of numbness or tingling in the upper extremity. Glenohumeral ahritis is unlikely because she has a full passive range of motion, and shoulder ahritis is commonly associated with a decreased range of motion. Also this history is relatively sho term. Proximal humerus fracture and shoulder dislocation are unlikely because this process has been present for 3 months. These injuries need more acute treatment. Also she has a full passive range of motion, which is not common with fractures or dislocations. Ref: McMahon P.J., Kaplan L.D. (2006). Chapter 4. Spos Medicine. In H.B.

Microglia (and other neuroglia including astrocytes) are distributed in large non-overlapping regions throughout the CNS. Microglia are key cells in overall brain maintenance--they are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged or unnecessary neurons and synapses, and infectious agents. Since these processes must be efficient to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglia are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS. This sensitivity is achieved in pa by the presence of unique K+ channels that respond to even small changes in extracellular potassium. Ref - Wikipedia.org",A

This is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including spectrin, ankyrin, Band 3, or Protein 4.2. Because the cell skeleton has a defect, the blood cell contracts to a sphere, which is its most surface tension efficient and least flexible configuration.

Which of the following is involved in auditory pathway?,Inferior colliculus,Lateral geniculate body,Inferior olivary nucleus,Medial lemniscus,"Ans: Inferior colliculusRef: Gray's Anatomy, The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice, Susan Standring, 41st edition, 2016, Page 325 and 326The inferior colliculus is part of the ascending auditory pathway and is the principal site of termination of the lateral lemniscus.Inferior Colliculus:StructureIt has a central, ovoid, main nucleus, which is lateral to the periaqueductal grey matter.It is surrounded by a lamina of nerve fibres, many from the lateral lemniscus, which terminate in it.The central nucleus has dorsomedial and ventrolateral zones, which are covered by a dorsal cortex.Cortex has four cytoarchitectonic layers:Layer I contains small neurones with flattened radial dendritic fields.Layer II, medium-sized neurones with ovoid dendritic fields aligned parallel with the collicular surface,Layer III, medium-sized neurones with spherical dendritic fields,Layer IV, large neurones with variably shaped dendritic fields.ConnectionsMost efferent fibres from the inferior colliculus travel via the inferior brachium to the ipsilateral medial geniculate nucleus.Lemniscal fibres relay only in the central nucleus, and some pass without relay to the medial geniculate nucleus.Ventral division of the medial geniculate nucleus receives a topographic projection from the central nucleus.Dorsal division receives a similar projection from the dorsal cortex.Some colliculogeniculate fibres do not relay in the geniculate nucleus but continue, with those that do, via the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.A descending projection from the auditory cortex reaches the inferior colliculus via the medial geniculate nucleus.This descending path may produce effects at levels from the medial geniculate nucleus downwards, and it probably links with efferent cochlear fibres, through the superior olivary and cochlear nuclei.Superior Colliculus:StructureThe superior colliculus is laminated structure.It is divided into seven layers (Zonal, Superficial grey, Optic, Intermediate grey, Deep grey, Deep white and Periventricular strata).The zonal layer consists chiefly of myelinated and non-myelinated fibres from the occipital cortex (areas 17, 18 and 19) which arrive as the external corticotectal tract.The superficial grey layer (stratum cinereum) forms a crescentic lamina over the deeper layers and contains many small multipolar interneurons.The optic layer consists partly of fibres from the optic tract.This arrangement provides a retinotopic map of the contralateral visual field, in which the fovea is represented anterolaterally. Retinal axons terminate in clusters from specific retinotectal neurons and as collaterals of retinogeniculate fibres. Efferent fibres to the retina are said to start in this layer.The intermediate grey and white layers collectively constitute the main receptive zone.ConnectionsThe main afferent input is the medial corticotectal path from layer Vneurones of the ipsilateral occipital cortex (area 18), and from other neocortical areas that are concerned with ocular movements.Afferent fibres are also received from the contralateral spinal cord (via spinotectal fibres), the inferior colliculus, and the locus coeruleus and raphe nuclei (from noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurones).The deep grey and deep white layers adjacent to the periaqueductal grey matter are collectively called the parabigeminal nucleus. They form collicular efferents.The superior colliculus receives afferents from many sources including the retina, spinal cord, inferior colliculus and occipital and temporal cortices.Collicular efferents pass to the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, pretectum, parabigeminal nucleus, the inferior, medial and lateral pulvinar, and to numerous sites in the brainstem and spinal cord.Fibres passing from the pulvinar are relayed to primary and secondary visual cortices and form an extrageniculate retinocortical pathway for visual orientation and attention.The tectospinal and tectobulbar tracts start from neurones in the superior colliculi.Inferior collicular projections to the brainstem and spinal cord appear to traverse the superior colliculi before they descend. In this way they connect with the origins of the tectospinal and tectotegmental tracts. These projections are relatively small and probably mediate reflex turning of the head and eyes in response to sounds.",A

MCH restriction to antigen presentation is not done for,Killing of viruses by cytotoxic cells,Killing of bacteria by helper cells,T cells activation in autoimmunity,Graft rejection,"Ref Robbins 9/e p231-233 Immune Recognition of Allografts Rejection of allografts is a response mainly to MHC molecules, which are so polymorphic that most individuals in an outbred population differ in at least some of the MHC molecules they express (except, of course, for identical twins). There are two main mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes and responds to the MHC mol- ecules on the graft (Fig. 4-23): * Direct recognition. Host T cells directly recognize the allo- geneic (foreign) MHC molecules that are expressed on graft cells. Direct recognition of foreign MHC seems to violate the rule of MHC restriction, which states that in every individual, all of the T cells are educated to recog- nize foreign antigens displayed by only that individual's MHC molecules. It is postulated that allogeneic MHC molecules (with any bound peptides) structurally mimic self MHC and foreign peptide, and so direct recognition of the allogeneic MHC is essentially an immunologic cross-reaction. Because DCs in the graft express high levels of MHC as well as costimulatory molecules, they are believed to be the major culprits contributing to direct recognition. The most impoant consequence of direct recognition is the activation of host CD8+ T cells that recognize class I MHC (HLA-A, -B) molecules in the graft. These T cells differentiate into CTLs, which kill the cells in the graft. Host CD4+ helper T cells may be trig- gered into proliferation and cytokine production by rec- ognition of donor class II MHC (HLA-D Indirect recognition. In this pathway, host CD4+ T cells recognize donor MHC molecules after these molecules are picked up, processed, and presented by the host's own APCs. This sequence is similar to the physiologic processing and presentation of other foreign (e.g., microbial) antigens. The activated CD4+ T cells then recognize APCs displaying graft antigens and secrete cytokines that induce inflammation and damage the graft. The indirect pathway is also involved in the pro- duction of antibodies against graft alloantigens; if these antigens are proteins, they are picked up by host B cells, and peptides are presented to helper T cells, which then stimulate antibody responses.",D

Meconium peritonitis occurs,Before bih,After bih,Before and after bih,Due to trauma during bih,"Meconium Peritonitis Meconium is a sterile mixture of epithelial cells, mucin, salts, fats and bile and is formed when the fetus commences to swallow amniotic fluid. Meconium peritonitis is due to intestinal perforation mostly the result of some form of neonatal intestinal obstruction (eg. meconium ileus in cystic fibrosis patients). When meconium enters the peritoneal cavity, an exudate is secreted that organizes rapidly, matting of intestinal loops occur, and in many cases in a matter of weeks, the extruded becomes calcified. Meconium remains sterile until about 3 hrs after bih; thereafter, unless the perforation has become sealed, sterile meconium peritonitis gives place to acute bacterial peritonitis which unless treated promptly is rapidly fatal. The clinical picture may be that of peritonitis and/or intestinal obstruction. Meconium peritonitis should always be suspected when a baby is born with a tense abdomen, who is vomiting and in whom there is a failure to discharge meconium. Treatment Prognosis is poor but recovery may follow prompt operation. Treatment consists of elimination of intestinal obstruction, closure of perforation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity.

Which type of amyloidosis is caused by mutations of the transthyretin protein,Familial Mediterranean fever,Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy,Dialysis associated amyloidosis,Prion protein associated amyloidosis,"Ref Robbins 8/e p253;9/e p259 Familial (Hereditary) Amyloidosis A variety of familial forms of amyloidosis have been described; most are rare and occur in limited geographic areas. The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).",B

Secretomotor supply of parotid comes from:,Greater Petrosal nerve,Auriculotemporal nerve,Maxillary nerve,Chorda Tympani,"The parotid gland is supplied by the parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory fibres:

Parasympathetic (secretomotor) supply: It  is  provided through auriculotemporal nerve.  The preganglionic fibres arise from the inferior salivatory nucleus in the medulla and pass successively through glossopharyngeal nerve, tympanic branch of glossopharyngeal (Jacobson’s nerve), tympanic plexus and lesser petrosal nerve to relay into otic ganglion. Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of the ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion.
Sympathetic supply: It is derived from sympathetic plexus around external carotid artery formed by postganglionic fibres derived from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. The preganglionic sympathetic fibres arise from the lateral horn of T1 spinal segment. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion.
Sensory supply: It is derived from:

(b)  Auriculotemporal nerve.
Great auricular nerve (C2 and C3). The C2 fibres are sensory to the parotid fascia.
Key Concept:Postganglionic fibres arise from the cells of otic ganglion and pass through the auriculotemporal nerve to supply the parotid gland. The stimulation of parasympathetic supply produces watery secretion. The sympathetic fibres are vasomotor and their stimulation produces thick sticky secretion.

Free radicals are generated by all except,FC and C3b,Receptor mediated endocytosis,Respiratory burst,Pseudopod extension,"Ref Robbins 9/e p78 Accumulation of Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals (Oxidative Stress) Free radicals are chemical species with a single unpaired electron in an outer orbital. Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+ , H2O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction",D

The part of peritoneal cavity that is most dependent in supine position?,Right subphrenic space,Lesser sac,Supramesocolic space,Right subhepatic space,"Ans. d. (Right subhepatic space) (Ref. BDC 3rd/Vol. Ill)Morison's pouch (Right subhepatic space), in a patient lying supine in bed, is the b part of peritoneal cavity. It is the deepest space of the four and the most common site of a subphrenic abscess, which usually arises from appendicitis, cholecystitis, a perforated duodenal ulcer or following upper abdominal surgery.Otherwise, Abscesses are most commonly found in pelvis, right subhepatic space and right subphrenic space.THE PERITONEAL CAVITY# The peritoneal cavity is the largest cavity in the body, the surface area of its lining membrane (2 m2 in an adult) being nearly equal to that of the skin.# It is the space between the parietal and visceral layers (continuous with one another) and is lubricated by serous fluid. It can be divided into the greater sac and smaller lesser sac, which lies behind the stomach.# The greater sac of the peritoneum is divided into- (a) the subphrenic spaces,- (b) the pelvis, and- (c) the peritoneal cavity proper.# The peritoneal cavity proper is redivided by the transverse colon and transverse mesocolon into -- supracolic and- infracolic compartment.# When the supracolic compartment overflows, as is often the case when a peptic ulcer perforates, it does so over the colon into the infracolic compartment, or by way of the right paracolic gutter to the right iliac fossa, and thence to the pelvis.# Whereas the left is open to the pelvis medially, the right is bounded by the ascending mesocolon, which is continuous with the small-bowel mesentery. This boundary means that pathology within this space tends to follow the superior aspect of the small-bowel mesentery as it attempts to reach the pelvis, finally reaching the medial aspect of the caecum. Similarly, pathology within the left infracolic space will involve the superior aspect of the sigmoid mesocolon before being liberated into the pelvis (to reach the lateral paravesical spaces and pouch of Douglas). Negative intrathoracic pressure tends to drive pelvic fluid up the paracolic gutters.# However, although pelvic pathology may freely communicate with the right supracolic spaces (the right subphrenic and subhepatic spaces, and lesser sac) via the right paracolic gutter, the left gutter is partially bounded by the phrenicocolic ligament. This simple concept explains why metastases from ovarian carcinoma frequently involve the liver surface more often than the spleen.# When a visceral perforation occurs the free fluid which spills into the peritoneal cavity runs downwards, largely directed by the normal peritoneal attachments. For e.g., spillage from a perforated duodenal ulcer may run down the right paracolic gutter.",D

The saphenous nerve is a sensory nerve only; it supplies the skin on the medial side of the leg. The patient's symptoms, as well as the type of procedure done, both point toward an injury to the saphenous nerve. The femoral nerve does not travel in the adductor canal -- it ends by branching superior to the adductor canal, in the femoral triangle. If this nerve was injured, the quadriceps would be impaired, and the patient would have difficulty extending at the knee.

Which of the following is a derivative of the ectoderm of the trilaminar embryo?,Bone,Germ cells,Muscle,Spinal cord,"The neural plate, a thickened area of ectoderm, gives rise to the nervous system. The first step is the development of a groove in the neural plate. On either side of this groove are the raised neural folds. These neural folds then begin to fuse in the midline at approximately the midpoint of the neural plate. Fusion proceeds in a rostral and caudal direction; once completed, there still remains an open area of the ""tube"" at both the rostral and caudal ends. These openings are referred to as the rostral and the caudal neuropore. The rostral neuropore closes around day 26 and the caudal neuropore closes on approximately day 28. With the closure of the caudal neuropore, closure of the neural tube is completed. It has been convincingly shown that folic acid plays an impoant role in the closure of the neural tube. By giving women of childbearing age folic acid supplements, the rate of neural tube defects can be reduced dramatically. Yet, based on the embryology of the neural tube (with closure of the tube roughly by day 28), it is obvious that in order for folic acid supplementation to work, it should be staed pregestationally. Unfounately, most women do not seek prenatal care until after the neural tube has undergone its period of closure. Bone, muscle, and spleen are all derivatives of the mesoderm. This mesoderm is formed at the end of the second week post-feilization, when some cells of the primitive streak migrate laterally between the endodermal and the ectodermal layer. Germ cells are derived from the endodermal layer of the trilaminar embryo. They migrate as primordial sex cells from the endoderm of the yolk sac to the urogenital ridge.",D

Lithogenic bile has the following propeies -,| Bile and cholesterol ratio,|Bile and cholesterol ratio,Equal bile and cholesterol ratio,|Cholesterol only,"Bile salts and phospholipids in bile keep cholesterol in solution by the formation of micelles. An excess of cholesterol relative to bile salts and phospholipids allows cholesterol to form crystals and such pile is called Lithogenic or super-saturated bile. Pathogenesis of Cholesterol gallstones There are three elements necessary for the formation of cholesterol gallstones Lithogenic bile Nucleation and Stasis or gallbladder hypomotility all three are necessary for cholesterol stone formation. A) Lithogenic (stone-forming) bile Cholesterol is insoluble in water (water is major constituent of bile, 85-95%). It is made soluble by bile acids and phospholipid - lecithin which form micelles with cholesterol So any mechanism which increases the cholesterol in bile or decreases the bile acids (salts) or lecithin makes the bile supersaturated or lithogenic. If to such a bile, the other two elements i.e. nucleation and stasis are provided, the cholesterol in solution precipitates to form cholesterol crystals which grow to form cholesterol stones. Factors which increase biliary cholesterol obesity high calorie and cholesterol rich diet clofibrate therapy Factors which decrease bile acids primary biliary cirrhosis oral contraceptive pills genetic factors a mutation in CYP7A1 gene which results in deficiency of enzyme cholesterol 7 a-hydroxylase. It results in impaired hepatic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, thus it increases the cholesterol/bile acid ratio. decreased/impaired enterohepatic circulation of bile acids: ileal disease ileal resection cholestyramine, colestipol (bile acid sequestrants) therapy.deoxycholate Factors which decrease biliary lecithin a mutation in MDR3 gene leads to defective phospholipid (lecithin) secretion into bile. B) Nucleation Nucleation refers to the process by which cholesterol monohydrate crystals form and agglomerate to become macroscopic crystals. Formation of cholesterol stones requires either an excess of pronucleating factors or a deficiency of antinucleating factors. Mucin and ceain non-mucin glycoproteins (and infection according to Bailey & Love) appear to be pronucleating factors, while apolipoproteins Al and All and ceain other glycoproteins appear to be antinucleating factor. C) Stasis or gall bladder hypomotility Stones would not be able to form if the gall bladder emptied all supersaturated or crystal containing bile completely.

Because the extrinsic extensors of the hand are not opposed by the intrinsic flexors of the hand, the metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextends and is unable to extend the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. The proximal and distal interphalangeal joints continue to flex because the extrinsic flexors are not opposed by the intrinsic extensors of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints.

It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum. Cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst. Cyst is not lined by mucosa. It is filled with clear lymph or chyle. A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extreme rare cases, multiple cyst may be seen. Cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular. A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of gut. Enterogenous cyst Believed to be derived either from a diveiculum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine. An enterogenous cyst has thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated. The content is mucinous The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply therefore enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related poion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

Worst prognosis memingioma is,Syncitial,Fibroblastic,Anplastic,Atypical,"Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas are uncommon tumors with a poorer prognosis than benign meningiomas. We reviewed the current literature and attempted to integrate and summarize available information to determine a logical approach to these tumors. Both tumors are rare and are often integrated with benign meningiomas when treatments are evaluated. In addition, because there has not been one histopathological classification scheme for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas in the past, there are numerous inconsistencies in the literature. Malignant progression with accumulation of mutations in a benign meningioma can result in an atypical and/or anaplastic meningioma. Both tumors are difficult to manage and have high recurrence and poor survival rates. The extent of tumor resection and histological grade are the key determinants for recurrence. In addition, metastases are unusual, but they do occur. We also review the evidence available that has resulted in the current World Health Organization classification. Radiation therapy can be used as an adjunctive treatment after both total and subtotal resection. In addition, the role of stereotactic radiosurgery is increasing, along with a possible role for brachytherapy. There are no effective chemotherapeutic agents available. A treatment algorithm is suggested. Refer Robbins page no 1315",C

True about Schwann cells ?,Pa of central nervous system,Present only in myelinated nerve fibres,Form myelin sheath,Derived from surface ectoderm,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Form myelin sheath Shwann cellsIn peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells provide structural suppo to all nerve fibres. Schawann cells form a sheath around the axon and form the outermost layer of a nerve fiber, called neurilemma, also known as sheath of Schwann or neurolemma. Schwann cells is surrounded by a basal lamina (or external lamina).In some fibres, Schwann cells additionally form myelin sheath; these fibres are called myelinated nerve fibres. Those nerve fibres in which myelin sheath is not formed, that is Schwann cells only provide structural suppo, are non-myelinated nerve fibres.Schwann cells deposit concentric layers of myelin around the axon to form myelin sheath. In myelinated fibres, one Schwann cell covers only a sho segment of the axon. The small pa of the axon present in between two adjacent Schwann cells (the pa that is devoid of myelin sheath) is called node of Ranvier.Myelin is a mixture of lipoproteins and acts as an insulator. Since myelin acts as an insulator, impulses are generated only at the nodes of Ranvier and this helps in faster conduction of the impulses. This is called saltatory conduction.Schwann cells are derived from neuroectoderm.",C

Single Umbilical aery is associated with other congenital anomalies and observation of a two-vessel cord with a single umbilical aery in a new born should prompt one to look carefully for additional anomalies. Umbilical aeries: The umbilical aeries are paired branches of the internal iliac aeries. These pass through the connective stalk (umbilical cord) and become continuous with the chorionic vessels of the developing placenta. These vessels carry deoxygenated blood. Fate(after bih) : The proximal poion of the umbilical aery persist as the internal iliac and superior vesical aeries. The distal pas are obliterated to form the median umbilical ligaments.

Familial amylodotic polyneuropathy is due to amyloidosis of nerves caused by deposition of,Amyloid associated protein,Mutant calcitonin,Mutant transthyretin,Normal transthyretin,"Ref Robbins 9/e p259 Familial (Hereditary) Amyloidosis A variety of familial forms of amyloidosis have been described; most are rare and occur in limited geographic areas. The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever ccompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, includ- ing peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This dis- order is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflamma- tion that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2). Patients have gain-of-function mutations in pyrin that result in constitutive overproduction of the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and persistent inflammation. In contrast with familial Mediterranean fever, a group of autosomal dominant familial disorders is characterized by deposition of amyloid predominantly in the peripheral and autonomic nerves. These familial amyloidotic poly- neuropathies have been described in kindreds in different pas of the world--for example, in Pougal, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. As mentioned previously, the fibrils in these familial polyneuropathies are made up of mutant forms of transthyretin (ATTRs).",C

Upper limb weight is transmitted to axial skeleton by all except?,Coracoacromial ligament,>Claviculoclavicular [interclavicularj ligament,>Costoclavicular ligament,>Acromioclavicular ligament,"Coracoacromial ligament The weight of the upper limb is transmitted from the scapula to the clavicle through the acromioclavicular joint and from the clavicle to the axial skeleton through the sternoclavicular joint. Thus the ligaments maintaining the stability of these two joints transmit the weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton. Acromioclavicular joint Acromioclavicular joint is formed by aiculation between the lateral end of the clavicle and the medial margin of the acromial process of the scapula. Ligaments stabilizing the joint are: - Acromioclavicular ligament - Coracoclavicular ligament (this is the major ligament transmitting upper limb weight to the clavicle) Sternoclavicular joint Sternoclavicular joint is the only skeletal aiculation between the upper limb and the axial skeleton. It is a compound joint with 3 elements taking pa in the joint: 1) medial end of the clavicle 2) the clavicular notch of the manubrium sterni and 3) first costal cailage The ligaments of the joint are: - the anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments , - the costoclavicular ligaments on each side, _ and the midline interclavicular ligament. The interclavicular ligament passes between the sterna ends of the right and left clavicles, with some of the fibres attached to the upper border of the manubrium sterni. Costoclavicular ligament connects the clavicle to the upper surface of the first rib and its cailage. This ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing factor of the sternoclavicular joint. The Coracoacromial Ligament is a strong ligament, extending between the coracoid process and the acromion. This ligament, together with the coracoid process and the acromion, forms the coracoacromial arch which prevents upward dislocation of the humerus. It extends between two processes of the scapula and takes no pa in transmission of weight of the upper limb to the axial skeleton.",A

"Patient presents with recurrent duodenal ulcer of 2.5 cm size,the procedure of choice -",Truncal vagotomy and antrectomy,Truncal vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,Highly selective vagotomy,Laparoscopic vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,"This question is basically irrelevant in the first place itself as recurrences are very uncommon in the present era and if occur can be very effectively treated with antibiotics and anti-secretory drugs. Here in this question, it's not mentioned whether the recurrence is after an acid-reducing operation or simply after medications. Lets first take the case of recurrence after a previous acid reducing surgery (this is most probably what the examiner means by recurrent ulcer as this topic is described in quite a detail in Maingot's) Recurrence after a prior acid reducing surgery: The management of patients with recurrent ulcer disease after acid-reducing operations consists of antibiotics directed at H. pylori + treatment with an antisecretory medication + limitation of NSAID use, smoking cessation, and limitation of alcohol intake. Ulcer disease refractory to such treatment is unusual. If the ulcer persists for more than 3 months despite eradication of H. pylori and maintenance antisecretory therapy or the ulcer is associated with perforation, bleeding, or obstruction, the operation is indicated. The choice of operation for recurrent postoperative ulcer depends on the indication for initial operation & the operation performed previously. Since these ulcers have recurred despite prior peptic ulcer disease surgery and maximal medical therapy, surgery should be appropriately aggressive. Truncal vagotomy with antrectomy is the operation of choice. This is the procedure with the least recurrence rate. Recurrence after prior treatment by medications: If at all surgery is needed an operation with least morbidity is advised i.e. Highly selective vagotomy. Recurrent gastric ulcer: Non-healing gastric ulcers despite antibiotics and antisecretory drugs should be viewed with suspicion for malignancy (Duodenal ulcers have no risk of malignancy) and thus distal gastrectomy is the recommended operation. Other surgical options are wedge resection with HSV. (Note HSV is of no use in Type I and Type IV ulcers as these are associated with acid hyposecretion) Ref - Internet",A

Pseudomyxoma peritonei describes mucinous ascites arising from a ruptured ovarian or appendiceal adenocarcinoma. In this disease, the peritoneum becomes coated with a mucus-secreting tumor that fills the peritoneal cavity with tenacious semisolid mucus and large, loculated cystic massesThe current treatment of patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei involves resection of as much of the tumor as possible(cytoreduction) and intraperitoneal heated chemotherapy (IPHC). Operative management includes omentectomy, stripping of involved peritoneum, resection of involved organs, and appendectomy, if not previously performed. There should be no residual tumor nodules larger than 2 mm in diameter after resection to facilitate penetration of the chemotherapy into any residual disease.

It may occur preexisting vascular redundancy (analogous to engineered redundancy), as in the circle of willis in the brain, or it may occur new branches formed between adjacent blood vessels (neovascularisation), as in the eye after a retinal embolism. Its formation may be provoked by pathological conditions such as high vascular resistance or ischemia . An example of the usefulness of collateral circulation is a systemic thromboembolism in cats. This is when a thrombotic embolus lodges above the external iliac aery (common iliac aery), blocking the external and internal iliac aeries and effectively shutting off all blood supply to the hind leg. Even though the main vessels to the leg are blocked, enough blood can get to the tissues in the leg the collateral circulation to keep them alive. Ref - sciencedirect.com",A

Physical examination reveals an unusually flat stomach when the newborn is lying down; auscultation demonstrates no breath sounds on the left side of the thorax. What is the diagnosis?",Physiological umbilical herniation,Esophageal hiatal hernia,Tetralogy of Fallot,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,"Clinical history indicate towards congenital diaphragmatic hernia because physical examination reveals an unusually flat stomach when the newborn is lying down; auscultation demonstrates no breath sounds on the left side of the thorax Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm. An absent or paially formed diaphragm results in an abnormal opening (hernia) that allows the stomach and intestines to move into the chest cavity and crowd the hea and lungs. This crowding can lead to underdevelopment of the lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia), potentially resulting in life-threatening breathing difficulties that are apparent from bih. Loss of breath and cyanosis result from pulmonary hypoplasia associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Placing the baby in an upright position will reduce the hernia somewhat and ease the pressure on the lungs, thereby increasing the baby's comfo. The baby's stomach is flat (instead of the plump belly of a normal newborn) because the abdominal viscera have herniated into the thorax. Auscultation reveals no breath sounds on the left side because of pulmonary hypoplasia. TOF also presents with cyanosis but pt. improves in squatting position not in upright position.

"A 41-year-old man entered the emergency department with abdominal trauma after his motorcycle was struck by a hit-and-run automobile driver. One week following emergent surgery the patient was released from the hospital. Two months postoperatively the patient complained of abdominal pain. A CT scan examination demonstrated an internal hernia in which the hepatic flexure of the colon had herniated through the epiploic (omental) foramen (of Winslow). Gastrointestinal veins appeared to be markedly dilated, including the veins forming anastomoses between the portal and caval systems (veins of Retzius). Which of the following structures is most likely compressed?",Portal vein,Inferior vena cava,Hepatic artery,Common bile duct,"The portal vein is compressed in its passage through the hepatoduodenal ligament, the anterior border of the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow). The veins of Retzius are located along the sides of the abdominal walls and communicate between tributaries of retroperitoneal parts of the gastrointestinal tract and veins of the body wall. In portal hypertension the portal blood cannot pass freely through the liver, and the portal-caval tributaries and their anastomoses become dilated. The inferior epigastric veins anastomose with the paraumbilical veins, which is the first branch off the hepatic portal vein. These would be the first affected in portal hypertension. The inferior vena cava is the main route of blood return to the right atrium and is posterior to the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow); it would not likely be compressed due to herniation through the foramen. Compression of the proper hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament would not result in dilation of veins of Retzius but could conceivably diminish blood supply to the gallbladder and liver. Common bile duct compression would result in jaundice and increased serum bilirubin. The cystic duct joins with the hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Compression of this would lead to an inflamed gallbladder (cholecystitis).",A

Trochlear nucleus in the midbrain, send fibers to innervate the contralateral superior oblique muscle. Superior oblique muscle causes inward rotation (intoion) of the eyeball. Additionally, it also causes depression and abduction of eyeball. It is the chief muscle to cause depression of the adducted eye and is assisted by inferior rectus for the movement.. Trochlear nerve is rarely paralyzed alone. It results in veical diplopia (double vision) on looking down, e.g. when going down stairs. This happens because the superior oblique normally assists the inferior rectus in pulling the eye downward, especially when the eye is in a medial (adducted) position.",D

Due to paralysis of the adductor pollicis, he does so by strongly contracting the flexor pollicis Langus and thus flexing the terminal phalanx of thumb (A normal person would keep his thumb extended).- The metacarpophalangeal joints become hyperextended because of the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles, which normally flex these joints. As the first and second lumbricals are not paralyzed, being supplied by the median nerve, the hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joints is most prominent in the fouh and fifth fingers. The interphalangeal joints are flexed, owing again to the paralysis of the lumbricals and interossei muscles which normally extend these joints.

Which passive movement causes pain in deep posterior compament syndrome ?,Foot abduction,Dorsi flexion of foot,Plantar flexion of foot,Foot adduction,"Passive stretching of the muscles produce pain in compament syndrome and hence, dorsiflexion of foot (a) causes pain. Posterior compament of leg is concerned with plantar flexion of foot, and is supplied by the tibial nerve and posterior tibial vessels. Compament syndrome is caused by increased pressure in an enclosed space that leads to compromise of circulation and function of tissues in that space. a. There is elevation of interstitial pressure in closed fascial compament that results in microvascular compromise. b. As duration & magnitude of interstitial pressure increase, myoneural function is impaired & necrosis of soft tissues eventually develops. Pain with passive stretching is the most sensitive early sign of compament syndrome. a. Patient will usually hold injured pa in a position of plantar-flexion to maximally relax the fascia/muscles and reduce pain. b. For e.g., Clawing of the toes is a common sequela of post-traumatic compament syndrome within the deep posterior compament following a distal third tibia fracture.

Most common site of biopsy in amyloidosis,Liver,Spleen,Kidney,Lung,"Ref Robbins 9/e p261 Kidney. Amyloidosis of the kidney is the most common and most serious feature of the disease. Grossly, the kidney may appear unchanged, or it may be abnormally large, pale, gray, and firm; in long-standing cases, the kidney may be reduced in size. Microscopically, the amyloid deposits are found principally in the glomeruli, but they also are present in the interstitial peritubular tissue as well as in the walls of the blood vessels. The glomerulus first develops focal deposits within the mesangial matrix and diffuse or nodular thickenings of the basement membranes of the capillary loops. With progression, the deposition encroaches on the capillary lumina and eventually leads to total obliteration of the vas- cular tuft (Fig. 4-34, A). The interstitial peritubular deposits frequently are associated with the appearance of amorphous pink casts within the tubular lumens, presumably of a pro- teinaceous nature. Amyloid deposits may develop in the walls of blood vessels of all sizes, often causing marked vascular narrowing. renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis.

 Sensory and motor
 Passes through foramen ovale into infratemporal fossa 

 ● Auriculotemporal Nerve arises from two roots that encircle the middle meningeal artery. 
 It carries postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic general visceral efferent (GVE) fibers to the parotid gland and sensory general somatic afferent (GSA) fibers to the temporomandibular joint and the skin of the auricle and the scalp.
 ● Lingual Nerve descends deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle, where it is joined by the chorda tympani. 
 It lies anterior to the inferior alveolar nerve on the medial pterygoid muscle, deep to the ramus of the mandible. It carries general sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It also carries the postganglionic fibres from the submandibular ganglion to supply the submandibular and sublingual salivary gland. The preganglionic fibres are brought by the chorda tympani nerve.
●  Otic ganglion is functionally related to the glossopharyngeal nerve, which carries the pre-ganglionic fibres to the ganglion. It is anatomically (topographically) related to the mandibular nerve (branch of trigeminal), which carries post ganglionic fibres to parotid salivary gland.

Right brachiocephalic vein is formed by right anterior cardinal vein (part which lies between right 7th cervical intersegmental vein and brachiocephalic anastomosis).3. Left brachiocephalic vein is formed by brachiocephalic anastomosis (between two anterior cardinal veins).4. Subclavian veins are formed by 7th cervical intersegmental vein.5. Internal jugular veins are formed by anterior cardinal veins (part which lies cranial to their junction with 7 cervical intersegmental vein).6. External jugular veins arise as secondary channel (not derived from anterior cardinal veins).7. Left superior intercostal vein is formed by regressed part of left anterior cardinal vein (caudal to transverse anastomosis) and cranial part of posterior cardinal vein.8. Verteral veins are developed by longitudinal anastomosis between C1 to C7 intersegmental veins and intercostal veins.o Derivatives of posterior cardinal veins, subcardinal veins and supracardinal veins are :1. Inferior vena cava is derived from :-a) Hepatic segment of IVC is derived from (i) right hepatocardiac channel, and (ii) anastomotic channel between subcardinal vein and right hepatocardiac channel.b) Renal segment of IVC is derived from right subcardinal vein.

Other modes of injury of the common peroneal nerve may be compression caused by a tight plaster on leg and sometimes due to lathi injury on lateral side of the knee. Common peroneal nerve is divided into deep peroneal nerve and superficial peroneal nerve. Deep peroneal nerve supply muscles of anterior compament of leg which include tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, peroneus teius and extensor hallucis longus whereas superficial peroneal nerve supply muscles of lateral compament of the leg i.e peroneus longus and peroneus brevis. In the common peroneal nerve injury the muscles of the anterior and lateral compament of the leg get paralysed results in weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot. As there is weakness of the dorsiflexion and eversion of the foot, the opposite muscles, the plantar flexion of the ankle joint and inversion of subtalar and transverse tarsal joint, cause the foot to be plantar flexed. So the planter flexion and inversion are normal. The patient has a high stepping gait. All the reflexes are intact (ankle jerk is lost in sciatic nerve lesions) Sensory loss is present over anterior and lateral side of the leg, dorsum of the foot and toes including medial side of the big toe. Sole of the foot derives its sensory innervation from medial calcaneal branch of tibial nerve and branches from medial and lateral plantar nerves so there is no loss of sensations in the foot.",C

Which muscle is attached to the disc of the temporomandibular joint?,Buccinator,Lateral pterygoid,Masseter,Temporalis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Lateral pterygoid Temporomandibular joint* It is a synovial, bicondylar joint between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of temporal bone above and the head of mandible below. The joint is completely divided into two compartments (upper and lower) by a fibro cortilaginous articular disc. Ligaments of TM joints are fibrous capsule, Lateral temporomandibular ligament, and stylomandibular ligament.* The articular disc is a fibrocartilaginous disc which divides joint cavity into an upper and a lower compartment. The upper compartment permits gliding movement and the lower compartment permits rotatory as well as gliding movements. The articular disc represents the degenerated premitive insertion of lateral pterygoid: Central portion of articular disc is least vascular. Articular disc acts as shock absorber, prevents friction between articular surfaces and also has proprioceptive function. Articular disc also increases the area of contact and hence helps in distribution of weight across the joint.* There are following movements in TM joints1) Protrusion (protraction of chin) Lateral and medial pterygoid of both sides acting together, assisted by superficial fibers of masseter. But most important muscle for protrusion is lateral pterygoid2) Retraction (Retraction of chin) Posterior fibers of temporalis assisted by deep fibers of masseter. But most important muscle for protrusion is latral pterygoid.3) Elevation (Closing of mouth) Masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid, of both sides.4) Depression (opening of mouth) Both lateral pterygoids assisted by digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid.5) Side to side (lateral) movementLateral and medial pterygoid of one side acting alternately with each other.* Dislocation of mandible occurs when mouth is opened too widely by excessive contraction of lateral pterygoid. Head of the mandible slips anteriorly into infratemporal fossa.* TM joints is supplied by auriculotemporal nerve and masseteric nerve.",B

Which of the following is the most characteristic feature of ARDS,Diffuse alveolar damage,Hypoxemia and hypoxia,Surfactant deficiency,Hypocapnia,"In ARDS, the presence of alveolar and interstitial fluid and the loss of surfactant can lead to a marked reduction of lung compliance. Without an increase in end-expiratory pressure, significant alveolar collapse can occur at end-expiration, with consequent impairment of oxygenation. Aetiology and pathogenesis Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a diffuse neutrophilic alveolitis caused by a range of conditions and characterised by bilateral radiographic infiltrates and hypoxaemia . Activated neutrophils are sequestered into the lungs and capillary permeability is increased, with damage to cells within the alveoli. The pathophysiology is pa of the inflammatory spectrum described in 'Sepsis' above, and the triggers are similar: infective and non-infective inflammatory processes. These processes result in exudation and accumulation of protein-rich cellular fluid within alveoli and the formation of characteristic 'hyaline membranes'. Local release of cytokines and chemokines by activated macrophages and neutrophils results in progressive recruitment of inflammatory cells. Secondary effects include loss of surfactant and impaired surfactant production. The net effect is alveolar collapse and reduced lung compliance, most marked in dependent regions of the lung (mainly dorsal in supine patients). The affected airspaces become fluid-filled and can no longer contribute to ventilation, resulting in hypoxaemia (due to increased pulmonary shunt) and hypercapnia (due to inadequate ventilation in some areas of the lung): that is, ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

Which of the following is the most common cause of delayed UT obstructive symptom after TURP,Stricture of navicular fossa,Stricture of membranous urethra,Stricture of bulb of urethra,Bladder neck stenosis,"Transurethral prostate surgery TURP remains the most commonly performed procedure for the surgical correction of BOO. Strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of the verumontanum. Cutting is performed by a high-frequency diathermy current, which is applied across a loop mounted on the hand-held trigger of the resectoscope. Coagulation of bleeding points can be accurately achieved. The 'chips' of prostate are then removed from the bladder using an Ellik evacuator. Resection proceeds at 1g/minute in experienced hands. The duration of resection for monopolar TURP is limited to 1 hour due to the risk of resorption of water if 1% glycine is used as an irrigant. The advent of bipolar TURP where normal saline is used as an irri- gant permits resection of larger prostates. Following TURP, careful haemostasis is performed, and a three-way, self-re- taining catheter irrigated with isotonic saline is introduced into the bladder to prevent any fuher bleeding from form- ing blood clots. Irrigation is continued until the outflow is pale pink, and the catheter is usually removed on the sec- ond or third postoperative day. In men with small prostates or bladder neck dyssynergia or stenosis, it is better to divide the bladder neck and prostatic urethra with a collings knife. Laser can be used to evaporate (e.g. Green light laser) or enucleate the prostate (e.g. HOLEP). The advantage of green light laser is that vaporisation is haemostatic and this procedure can be performed even while patients are antico- agulated. HOLEP involves the use of a laser to coagulate any of the small vessels crossing the relatively avascular plane between the peripheral and transitional zones of the prostate while the tip of the cystoscope is used, much like the surgeons finger at Millin's prostatectomy, to enucleate the transition zone adenoma. The enucleated adenoma is pushed into the bladder, where it is morcellated and extracted the cysto- scope. Damage to the external sphincter is avoided provided one uses the verumontanum as a guide to the most distal point of the resection/vaporisation/enucleation.",D

All of the following serological tests would be helpful in diagnosis of chronic brucellosis except,Standard agglutination test,Mercaptoethanol test,Complement fixation test,ELISA detecting IgG,"As isolation is difficult, serological tests are of paramount impoance in the diagnosis of brucellosis.several tests have been developed such as standard agglutination test, complement fixation, and ELISA. SAT detects antibodies against antigens of smooth LPS. In acute infection, IgM antibodies appear early followed by IgG and IgA antibodies. The SAT does not differentiate between immunoglobulin isotypes. As the disease progresses IgM levels decline and avidity and subclass distribution of IgG and IgA change. Thus SAT becomes negative in chronic brucellosis. The complement fixation test is more useful in chronic cases as it detects the IgG antibody also. ELISA is sensitive and specific and detects IgM and IgG antibodies separately. It is therefore useful for differentiation between acute and chronic infection.

A three years old boy presents with the poor urinary stream. Most likely cause is,Stricture urethra,Neurogenic bladder,Urethral calculus,Posterior urethral valve,"Poor urinary stream in 3 years old boy suggests urinary tract obstruction (usually intravesical) and the most common cause of obstructive uropathy in a male child is posterior urethral valve. Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by voiding cystourethrogram* & endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First, a small polyethene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days. Then fuher management is done according to serum creatinine level. with normal serum creatinine - transurethral ablation of the valve leaflets. * With increased serum creatinine and the worsening of condition - vesicostomy to bypass the obstruction and when normal creatinine levels are achieved, transurethral ablation is done.

Example of type 2 hypersensitivity is,Blood transfusion reaction,Ahur reaction,Hay fever,Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,"Ref Robbins 9/e p206 Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) Antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity disorders are caused by antibodies directed against target antigens on the surface of cells or other tissue components. The antigens may be normal molecules intrinsic to cell membranes or in the extracellular matrix, or they may be adsorbed exoge- nous antigens (e.g., a drug metabolite). Antibody-mediated abnormalities are the underlying cause of many human diseases; examples of these are listed in Table 4-3. In all of these disorders, the tissue damage or functional abnormali- ties result from a limited number of mechanisms. Mechanisms of Antibody-Mediated Diseases Antibodies cause disease by targeting cells for phagocyto- sis, by activating the complement system, and by interfer- ing with normal cellular functions (Fig. 4-10). The antibodies that are responsible typically are high-affinity antibodies capable of activating complement and binding to the Fc receptors of phagocytes. * Opsonization and phagocytosis. When circulating cells, such as erythrocytes or platelets, are coated (opsonized) with autoantibodies, with or without complement pro- teins, the cells become targets for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. 4-10, A). These phagocytes express receptors for the Fc tails of IgG anti- bodies and for breakdown products of the C3 comple- ment protein, and use these receptors to bind and ingest opsonized paicles. Opsonized cells are usually elimi- nated in the spleen, and this is why splenectomy is of Table 4-3 Examples of Antibody-Mediated Diseases (Type II Hypersensitivity) clinical benefit in autoimmune thrombocytopenia and some forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. * Inflammation. Antibodies bound to cellular or tissue anti- gens activate the complement system by the ""classical"" pathway (Fig. 4-10, B). Products of complement activa- tion serve several functions (see Fig. 2-18, Chapter 2), one of which is to recruit neutrophils and monocytes, triggering inflammation in tissues. Leukocytes may also be activated by engagement of Fc receptors, which rec- ognize the bound antibodies. This mechanism of injury is exemplified by Goodpasture syndrome and pemphi- gus vulgaris. * Antibody-mediated cellular dysfunction. In some cases, antibodies directed against cell surface receptors impair or dysregulate cellular function without causing cell injury or inflammation (Fig. 4-10, C). In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against acetylcholine receptors in the motor end plates of skeletal muscles inhibit neuromuscular transmission, with resultant muscle weakness. Antibodies can also stimulate cellular Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of antibody-mediated injury. A, Opsonization of cells by antibodies and complement components, and ingestion of opso- nized cells by phagocytes. B, Inflammation induced by antibody binding to Fc receptors of leukocytes and by complement breakdown products. C, Antireceptor antibodies disturb the normal function of receptors. In these examples, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor activate thyroid cells in Graves disease, and acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antibodies impair neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia g responses excessively. In Graves disease, antibodies against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor stim- ulate thyroid epithelial cells to secrete thyroid hormones, resulting in hypehyroidism. Antibodies against hor- mones and other essential proteins can neutralize and block the actions of these molecules, causing functional derangements.",A

A Child presents with complaints of abdominal colic and hematuria USG showed a renal stone 2.5cm in diameter in renal pelvis the next step in management of this case,PCNL,ESWL,Nephroureterostomy,Conservative,"ESWL is the treatment of choice for most of the renal calculi which are not able to pass spontaneously, however PNL is the preferred method for larger (>2 cm) renal stones. Campbell's Urology writes- ""In summary, for patients harboring nonstaghorn stones smaller than 10 mm, SWL is usually the primary approach. For patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm, SWL can still be considered a first-line treatment unless factors of stone composition, location, or renal anatomy suggest that a more optimal outcome may be achieved with a more invasive treatment modality (PNL or ureteroscopy). Patients with stones larger than 20 mm should primarily be treated by PNL unless specific indications for ureteroscopy are present (e.g., bleeding diathesis, obesity)."" Spontaneous passage of stones -- Most stones <5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 5 nun in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones >10 mm in diameter. The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone. Three minimally invasive surgical techniques currently available are: Shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) Rigid and flexible ureteroscopy (URS) Also know Steinstrasse literally means 'stone street' it is condition which follows the use of ESWL. small pieces of fragmented calculi collect and obstruct in the distal ureter, like sand occluding a straw Ref - Bailey and love 27e Kidney , Internet",A

All are true about histological feature of Kaposi's sarcoma except,Microscopically lesion similar to granulation tissue,Dilated and irregular blood vessels with interspersed infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma,Atypical blood vessels having solid spindle appearance,Nodules is the intial lesion of Kaposi's sarcoma,"Ref Robbins 9/e p254,8/e p529; 7/e p549 Neoplasms. Patients with AIDS have a high incidence of ceain tumors, paicularly Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and cervical cancer in women. The common feature of all of these diverse neoplasms is that the tumor cells in each are typically infected by an oncogenic virus. The basis of the increased risk of virus-associated malignancy is multifactorial, but defective T cell immunity is believed to be the predominant contributor. Kaposi sarcoma, a vascular tumor that is otherwise rare in the United States (Chapter 9), was once the most common neoplasm in AIDS patients but its incidence has decreased significantly with anti-retroviral therapy. The tumor is far more common among homosexual or bisexual males than in intravenous drug abusers or patients belonging to other risk groups. The lesions can arise early, before the immune system is compromised, or in advanced stages of HIV infection. Unlike the lesions in sporadic cases of Kaposi sarcoma, those that occur in patients with AIDS are multi- centric and tend to be more aggressive; they can affect the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, and lungs. The lesions contain spindle cells that share features with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells and are believed to be lymphatic endothelial cells or mesenchymal cells that can form vascular channels. In dif- ferent patients, the lesions are monoclonal or oligoclonal or even polyclonal, an unusual feature shared by other pro- liferations driven by oncogenic viruses, such as ceain EBV-related B cell proliferations. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by a herpesvirus called Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The mechanisms by which the virus causes the vascular proliferation are unceain. One hypothesis is that KSHV infects lymphatic endothelial or other cells, and in conce with cytokines produced by HIV-infected immune cells, stimulates proliferation of the endothelial cells. The KSHV genome contains homologues of several human oncogenes and cytokines that may contribute to the growth and survival of the proliferating vessels. B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas constitute the second most common type of AIDS-associated tumors. These tumors are highly aggressive, occur most frequently in severely immunosuppressed patients, and involve many extranodal sites. The brain is the most common extranodal site in late- stage HIV infection, and hence primary lymphoma of the brain is considered an AIDS-defining condition. Close to 100% of these brain lymphomas are EBV-related. In com- parison only 30% to 40% of lymphomas occuring earlier in the course of HIV infection are EBV-related, emphasizing the contribution of other factors, such as chronic B cell hyperstimulation, to lymphoma risk in HIV-infected indi- viduals. Another, less common AIDS-related lymphoma is primary effusion lymphoma, which grows exclusively in body cavities, manifesting as pleural, peritoneal, or peri- cardial effusions. This rare tumor is always associated with KSHV, and in many cases the tumor cells are co-infected with both KSHV and EBV. The incidence of cervical carcinoma also is increased in patients with AIDS. This correlation is attributable to the high prevalence of human papillomavirus infection among patients with AIDS, whose immune systems are compro- mised. This virus is believed to be intimately associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and its precur- sor lesions, cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ (Chapter 18). Hence, gynecologic examination should be pa of the routine evaluation in HIV-infected women. In general, the incidence of the classical ""AIDS-defining cancers""--Kaposi sarcoma, EBV-associated tumors, and cervical cancer--has decreased significantly with the use of antiretroviral therapy, but the relative incidence of other tumors considered ""non-AIDS-defining cancers"" is ctually increasing. This latter group includes liver cancer, anal cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma, all of which are types of tumors associated with various viral infections.",D

First, the pseudoglandular stage entails growth of the intrasegmental bronchial tree between 6 and 16 weeks. Second, during the canalicular stage, from 16 to 26 weeks, the bronchial cailage plates extend peripherally. Each terminal bronchiole gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, and each of these inturn divides into multiple saccular ducts. Next, the terminal sac stage begins at 26 weeks. During this stage, respiratory bronchioles give rise to primitive pulmonary alveoli . Last, the alveolar stage begins at 32 weeks. During the alveolar stage, the alveolar epithelial lining thins to improve gas exchange. At bih, only approximately 15 percent of the adult number of alveoli is present. Thus, the lung continues to grow, adding more alveoli for up to 8 years. Reference: William's Obstetrics; 24th edition; Chapter 7; Embryogenesis and Fetal Morphological Development.",A

A tender cordlike superficial thrombosed vein is formed and when the skin over the breast is stretched by raising the arm, a narrow r shallow subcutaneous groove alongside the cord becomes apparent, Rarely it may be bilateral. Management It's a benign self-limited disorder. The differential diagnosis is lymphatic permeation from an occult carcinoma of the breast. When the diagnosis is unceain or a mass is present near the cord, a biopsy may be done. Treatment An inflammatory drugs and warm compresses Restricted arm movements as well as brassiere suppo of breast o It usually resolves within 4 to 6 weeks.

Into which area will regurgitation of blood occur in this patient?,Pulmonary trunk,Left atrium,Ascending aorta,Right atrium,"The tricuspid valve is the atrioventricular valve located between the right atrium and right ventricle. An incompetent valve would allow blood to regurgitate into the right atrium during systole and subsequently raise pressure in the venous system, increasing capillary pressure and causing edema. A regurgitation of blood into the pulmonary trunk would be a result of an incompetent pulmonary valve. Regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium is a result of prolapse of the mitral valve. There is no direct anatomic relationship between the tricuspid valve and the ascending aorta. Blood would pool in the left ventricle in the event of aortic valve incompetence.",D

Most common histological type of renal cell carcinoma,Clear cell,Medullary,Papillary,Mixed type,"Refer Robbins 9/e p953 Clear cell carcinoma. This is the most common type, accounting for 70% to 80% of renal cell cancers. The tumors are made up of cells with clear or granular cytoplasm and are nonpapillary. They can be familial, but in most cases (95%) are sporadic. In 98% of these tumors, whether familial, sporadic, or associated with VHL syndrome, there is loss of sequences on the sho arm of chromosome 3. The deleted region harbors the VHL gene (3p25.3). A second nondeleted allele of the VHL gene shows somatic mutations or hypermethylation-induced inactivation in up to 80% of clear cell cancers, indicating that the VHL gene acts as a tumor suppressor gene in both sporadic and familial cancers (Chapter 7). The VHL gene encodes a protein that is pa of a ubiquitin ligase complex involved in targeting other proteins for degradation. Impoant among the targets of the VHL protein is the transcription factor hypoxia- inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). When VHL is inactive, HIF-1 levels remain high, even under normoxic conditions, causing inappropriate expression of a number of genes that are turned on by HIF. These include genes that promote angiogenesis, such as VEGF, and genes that stimulate cell growth, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). In addition, HIF collaborates in complex ways with the oncogenic factor MYC to ""reprogram"" cellular metabolism in a way that ors growth. D",A

"A 38-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with signs of cholecystitis and gallbladder stones. During cholangiography, the catheter is inserted with difficulty into the gallbladder. Which of the following structures is most likely to interfere with the passage of the catheter into the cystic duct?",Cystic duct compression by a hepatic artery,Spiral valve (of Heister),Tortuosity of the cystic duct,Adhesions from the hepatoduodenal ligament,"The gallbladder consists of a fundus, body, and neck. The fundus is the rounded, blind end that comes in contact with the transverse colon. The body is the major part and rests on the upper part of the duodenum and transverse colon. The neck is the narrowest part and gives rise to the cystic duct. This duct contains the spiral valve (of Heister), which is a redundant mucosal fold that maintains patency of the duct. This is not actually a valve and does not determine the direction of flow of bile. This could potentially be a point of constriction that could present difficulty with insertion of a catheter. The cystic duct comes into contact only with the cystic artery and is not particularly tortuous. The hepatoduodenal ligament is the thickened free edge of the lesser omentum, and it conducts the portal triad (portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile duct) and encloses structures that pass through the porta hepatis. This ligament is unlikely to compress the cystic duct. Though the cystic duct is in close relation to the portal vein and the hepatic artery, the most likely cause of difficulty would be potential constriction by the spiral valve.",B

All are features of unilateral 3rd Cranial nerve nuclear injury except-(not sure of options),B/L incomplete Ptosis,weakness of the ipsilateral superior rectus muscles,weakness of the contralateral superior rectus muscles,Unilateral Ptosis,"Pure unilateral lesions of the oculomotor nucleus are rare. Paresis of isolated muscles innervated by oculomotor branches is almost always due to a lesion of their branches within the orbit or to disease processes that affect the muscle or myoneural junction. Nuclear lesions, however, may cause isolated weakness of one of the muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve, except the superior rectus muscle (crossed innervation noted previously), the levator palpebrae superioris (a single caudal subnucleus innervates the levators bilaterally), the pupillary constrictors (visceral nuclei are spread throughout the oculomotor nucleus), and the medial rectus muscle (three separate subnuclei). Thus, isolated unilateral palsies of the inferior rectus muscle have been associated with lesions of the inferior rectus subnucleus. More characteristic of nuclear involvement is unilateral palsy of the third cranial nerve in conjunction with weaknessf the ipsilateral and contralateral superior rectus muscles and bilateral incomplete ptosis.

Bilateral palsies of the third cranial nerve but with sparing of the levator muscles of the eyelid may be caused by bilateral nuclear lesions that spare the central caudal levator subnucleus.

The three germ cell layers in embryo separate by the process of?,Ovulation,Neurilation,Gastrulation,All of the above,"Ans. C. Gastrulation.(Ref: Langman's Medical Embryology 9th/pg. 65).Longman's Medical Embryology 9th/pg. 65..........""The most characteristic event occurring during the third week of gestation is gastrulation, the process that establishes all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) in the embryo. Gastrulation begins with formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast. Thus, the epiblast, through the process of gastrulation, is the source of all of the germ layers, and cells in these layers will give rise to all of the tissues and organs in the embryo"".GASTRULATION# Definition: Gastrulation is a process that establishes the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.- This process is first indicated by the formation of the primitive streak within the epiblast.- The formation of the primitive streak is one of the first signs of gastrulation.# It is characterized as a furrow in the midline of the embryonic disk at the future caudal end of the embryo. This furrow is formed by the ingression of epiblast cells that will go on to form the definitive endoderm and mesoderm by replacing hypoblast cells.# The epiblast cells then develop into the definitive ectoderm. Gastrulation, or formation of the germ layers, continues in caudal segments while cranial structures are differentiating, causing embryo to develop cephalocaudally.Educational points:# Week 2: Bilaminar germ disc# Week 3: Trilaminar germ disc (Gastrulation, Primitive streak, notochord, mesoderm and its organization, and neural plate begin to form)# Week 4: Four limbs appear.Heart begins to beat.# Week 3-8 (Embryonic Period): Neural tube formed by neuroectoderm,closes by wk 4.0rganogenesis. Extremely susceptible to teratogens.# Week 6: Fetal cardiac activity visible by transvaginal ultrasound.# Week 10: Genitalia have male/female characteristics.Tumors Associated With GastrulationSometimes, remnants of the primitive streak persist in the sacrococcygeal region. These clusters of pluripotent cells proliferate and form tumors, known as sacrococcygeal teratomas, that commonly contain tissues derived from all three germ layers. This is the most common tumor in newborns. These tumors may also arise from primordial germ cells (PGCs) that fail to migrate to the gonadal ridge.",C

Phenotypically, the patient appears female, but has a blindly ending vagina and lacks a uterus or other female internal reproductive organs. The patient has an XY genotype. Since the gene for testes determining factor (TDF) is on the Y chromosome, TDF will cause the indifferent gonad to develop into a testis containing Seoli cells. Seoli cells at this stage will secrete MIF, a substance that suppresses the paramesonephric ducts, preventing the formation of female internal reproductive organs. This patient would not have a streak ovary, a finding in Turner's syndrome that is associated with a 45,XO genotype. In fact, the patient would have testes, since the genetic complement contained a Y chromosome. The testes in individuals with testicular feminization syndrome are often undescended and are usually removed surgically. This patient would not possess a uterus or an oviduct.

The parietal (oxyntic) cells are large, pyramidal, and acidophilic with central nuclei (look like a ""fried egg""). They make and secrete HCl. The mucous neck cells secrete mucus and appear clear. The enteroendocrine cells have affinity for silver stains and exhibit a positive chromaffin reaction; these cells synthesize amines, polypeptides, or proteins.The cardiac region is a narrow, circular band at the transition between the esophagus and stomach, consisting of shallow gastric pits and mucous glands. It does not normally contain an abundance of chief cells.The columns of Morgagni are found in the rectum, not in the stomach. These are mucous membrane infoldings in the submucosa of the proximal anal canal. They would not contain chief cells.The greater omentum is a four-layered fold of peritoneum that hangs from the greater curvature of the stomach and attaches to the transverse colon.

The abductor of vocal cord is,Posterior cricoarytenoid,Lateral cricoarytenoid,Thyroarytenoid,Cricoarytenoid,"Ans. a (Posterior cricoarytenoid) (Ref BDC vol. 3/4th/243)Posterior Cricoarytenoid is known to be the only abductor of the larynx. It opens space between the vocal cords (abduct) by rotating the arytenoids laterally (abduct), causing the vocal cords to separate opening the rima glottidis. Posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is called the safety muscle because ail the intrinsic muscles are adductors of the vocal cords except posterior cricoarytenoids which are abductors. The cricothyroid muscle is the only tensor of the larynx aiding with phonation and should not to be confused with the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, which are the only muscles directly responsible for opening (abducting) the space between the vocal cords.Laryngeal muscleAction1.Aryepiglottic MuscleDraws the epiglottis posteriorly and downward during swallowing2.Oblique ArytenoidDraws arytenoid cartilages together, adducting vocal folds3.Transverse ArytenoidDraws arytenoid cartilages together, adducting vocal folds4.ThyroarytenoideusDraws arytenoid cartilage forward, relaxing and adducting the vocal folds5.Vocalis muscle^Relaxes segments of the vocal ligament, thereby adjusting voice pitch.Educational Points# Larynx begins at C4 & ends at C7 vertebral levels Q# The only intrinsic muscle of larynx that lies outside the laryngeal framework is Cricothyroid.LIGAMENTS OF LARYNX# The extrinsic ligaments of the larynx are those connecting the thyroid cartilage and epiglottis with the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage with the trachea.# The intrinsic ligaments of the larynx are those connecting several cartilages ofthe organ to each other.

"All are true about 1st pa of duodenum, except ?",5 cm long,Is superior pa,Develops from foregut,Supplied by superior mesenteric aery,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Supplied by superior mesenteric aeryDuodenum Duodenum is 'C' shaped, shoest, widest and most fixed pa of small intestine. It is 25 cm long. It is devoid of mesentery. Most of the duodenum is retroperitoneal and fixed, except at its two ends where it is suspended by folds of peritoneum, and is therefore mobile. Duodenum lies opposite Ll, L2 and L3 veebrae.Duodenum is C-shaped curve which encloses the head of pancreas and is subdivided into four pas :1. First pa (Superior pa) : It is 5 cm (2 inches) long. It begins at the pylorus and meet the second pa at superior duodenal flexure. This pa appears as duodenal cap on barium studies.2. Second pa (Descending pa) : It is about 7.5 cm (3 inches) long. It is veical pa which begins at superior duodenal flexure and meet the third pa at inferior duodenal flexure. The interior of second pa of duodenum shows following features :i) Major duodenal papilla : It is present 8-10 cm distal to the pylorus. The hepatopancreatic ampulla or ampulla of Vater (joint pa of bile duct and pancreatic duct) opens here.ii) Minor duodenal papilla : It is present 6-8 cm distal to the pylorus. Accessory pancreatic duct opens here.3. Third pa (Horizonal pa) : It is 10 cm (4 inches) long. It begins at inferior duodenal flexure and passes towards the left in front of IVC behind superior mesenteric vessels and root of mesentery to meet 4th pa of duodenum.Fouh pa : It is 2-5 cm (1 inches) long and runs upward immediately to the left of aoa. It ends at duodenojejunal flexure by joining the jejunum.Aerial supplyThe pa of duodenum before the opening of bile duct (major duodenal papilla) develops from foregut and therefore is supplied by coeliac trunk through superior pancreaticoduodenal aery, a branch of gastroduodenal aery, which in trun is a branch of common hepatic aery. Pa of duodenum distal to opening of bile duct is developed from midgut and therefore is supplied by superior mesenteric aery through inferior pancreaticoduodenal aery.

Which of the following developmental conditions will most likely explain the symptoms?",Patent bile duct,Duodenal stenosis,Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter,Atrophied gastric antrum,"Duodenal stenosis is caused by incomplete recanalization of the duodenum. The vomit contains bile in addition to the stomach contents because of the location of the occlusion, distal to the ampulla of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla), where the common bile duct enters the small intestine. Lack of weight gain is due to constant vomiting. A patent bile duct would not cause vomiting with bile. A hypertrophied pyloric sphincter would cause projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. An atrophied gastric antrum is caused by the removal of the membranous lining of the stomach and occurs proximal to the site of the entrance of the bile duct; therefore, the vomit would not contain bile. A tracheoesophageal fistula would not cause vomiting of stomach contents and bile because it is a defect of the respiratory system and occurs proximal to the site at which bile is added to stomach contents.",B

Caseous necrosis in granuloma are not found in,TB,Leprosy,Histoplasmosis,CMV,"ref Robbins 7/e p73,9/e p98 It is also seen in wegener's granulomatosis. Caseous necrosis is a form of cell death in which the tissue maintains a cheese-like appearance. The dead tissue appears as a soft and white proteinaceous dead cell mass. CausesEdit Frequently, caseous necrosis is encountered in the foci of tuberculosis infections. It can also be caused by syphilis and ceain fungi. A similar appearance can be associated with histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis. AppearanceEdit In caseous necrosis no histological architecture is preserved. On microscopic examination with H&E staining, it is characterized by acellular pink areas of necrosis surrounded by a granulomatousinflammatory process. When the hilar lymph node for instance is infected with tuberculosis and leads to caseous necrosis, its gross appearance can be a cheesy tan to white, which is why this type of necrosis is often depicted as a combination of both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis. However, in the lung, extensive caseous necrosis with confluent cheesy tan granulomas is typical. The tissue destruction is so extensive that there are areas of cavitation (also known as cystic spaces). See Ghon's complex",B

Treatment of choice for bleeding gastric ulcer is,Gastrectomy,Antrectomy,Under running of ulcer,Vagotomy and drainage,"Bleeding gastric ulcers. Treatment of bleeding gastric ulcers depends on their cause and location; however, the initial approach is similar to duodenal ulcers. Patients require resuscitation, monitoring, and endoscopic investigation. Up to 70% of gastric ulcers are H. pylori-positive, so an attempt should be made to control the bleeding endoscopically, with multiple biopsy specimens of the ulcer obtained to rule out malignancy and concurrently obtained biopsy specimens of the body and antrum to test for H.pylori infection. Patients whose bleeding can be controlled and who are H. pylori-positive should undergo subsequent treatment for H. pylori infection. For bleeding that cannot be controlled, operative intervention again depends on the type of gastric ulcer. In all cases, the ulcer should ideally be excised with the addition of vagotomy depending on the cause of the ulcer (mostly for intractable ulcers that are not due to H. pylori infection or NSAID usage that can be stopped).

"Nerve supply of the papillary muscle, the sphincter papillae is done through",Third cranial nerve,Fouh cranial nerve,Sixth cranial nerve,Seventh cranial nerve,"The ciliary ganglion is a peripheral parasympathetic ganglion topographically connected with the nasociliary nerve from ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve but functionally connected to the oculomotor nerve.The motor or parasympathetic root of the ciliary ganglion is derived from nerve to inferior oblique and consists of preganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. These fibres relay in the ganglion. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers arise from the cells of the ganglion and pass through sho ciliry nerves to supply the ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae.The branches of the ciliary ganglion are sho ciliary nerves that contain fibres from all 3 roots, run above and below the optic nerve towards the eyeball. On reaching the eyeball, they pierce the sclera around the attachment of the optic nerve and pass forwards in the space between the sclera and the choroid to reach the target organs.The ciliary ganglion is blocked to produce dilatation of the pupil before cataract extraction.Reference: Textbook of anatomy, Head neck, and brain, Vishram Singh, 2nd edition, page no.298",A

The length of the fibres is highly variable, the longest being as much as 30 cm in length. The diameter of the fibres also varies considerably (10-60 um; usually 50-60 um). Each 'fibre' is really a syncytium with hundreds of nuclei along its length (The 'fibre' is formed, during development, by fusion of numerous myoblasts). The nuclei are elongated and lie along the periphery of the fibre, just under the cell membrane (which is called the sarcolemma). The cytoplasm (or sarcoplasm) is filled with numerous longitudinal fibrils that are called myofibrils. The most striking feature of skeletal muscle fibres is the presence of transverse striations in them. REF : Inderbir Singh's Textbook of Human Histology, seventh edition, pg.no., 108, 109.",A

Bleeding may be the initial presenting symptoms in up to 10 percent of pts with peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer bleeding is four times more common than gastric ulcer bleeding. Esophageal varices : Bleeding esophageal varices or gastric varices in the presence of liver disease account for about 10-20% of massive upper GI bleeding. In this pt. esophageal varices appears to be the cause as the pt. is a chronic alcoholic But here the amount he drinks daily should be taken into consideration. In men 40 - 80 g/day of ethanol - produces fatty liver 80 - 160 g/day of ethanol for 10 - 20 yrs - causes hepatitis or cirrhosis (Women exhibit increased susceptibility* to alcoholic liver disease at quantities > 20 g/day) He drinks 100 ml daily. Different types of drinks contain varying amounts of alcohol. What this pt. drinks is not known but even strong drinks such as 86-proof beverage contain 80 gm of ethanol in 250 ml of drinks (Wine contain 80 gm of ethanol in 1000 ml of drinks) Thus this patient is unlikely to have an alcoholic liver disease and so esophageal varies can be ruled out. Moreover even in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, avarices are cause of massive GI bleed in only 1/2 the cases. Peptic ulcer or gastritis form rest of the half. Mallory-Weiss tear It accounts for a small percentage (5 to 10%) It presents in a classic pattern - initially vomiting is without blood, but after retching and vomiting with epigastric pain, bleeding and haematemesis begin. Gastritis Acute gastritis can present as massive bleeding (though rarely) It is most commonly associated with intake of NSAIDS, alcohol, coicosteroids and oral potassium supplements. I do not have any valid reason to rule out gastritis. But duodenal ulcer is a much more common cause. Ref : CSDT 13/e p494",B

The pulse of the dorsalis pedis can be felt between the tendon of the extensor hallucis longus and the tendon of the extensor digitorum longus to the second toe. A strong pulse is a positive indicator of circulation through the limb. The fibular (peroneal) artery is a branch of the posterior tibial artery and passes in the calf between the flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior, making it difficult to palpate. The deep plantar artery, the extension of the first dorsal interosseous or lateral plantar arteries, passes deep to the aponeurotic tissues and central muscles of the foot, making palpation unlikely. The dorsal metatarsal branches of the dorsalis pedis pass under cover of the extensor digitorum longus and brevis tendons.

A 42-year-old mother of three children visits the outpatient clinic complaining that her youngest son cannot walk yet. Radiographic and physical examinations reveal an unstable hip joint. Which of the following ligaments is responsible for stabilization of the hip joint in childhood?,Iliofemoral,Pubofemoral,Ischiofemoral,Ligament of the head of the femur,"The ligament of the head of the femur conveys a small blood vessel for supply of the head of the femur (primarily in childhood). The ligament is stretched during abduction and lateral rotation of the hip joint and has an important role in stabilizing an infant's hip joint before walking. It has the potential to increase stability of the joint in hip reconstruction in developmental hip dysplasia in the pediatric population. The strength of this ligament is comparable to the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee. The iliofemoral ligament (the ""Y-shaped ligament of Bigelow"") on the anterior aspect of the hip bone resists hyperextension of the hip joint. The pubofemoral ligament arises from the pubic bone and is located on the inferior side of the hip joint; it resists abduction of the joint. The ischiofemoral ligament is a triangular band of strong fibers that arises from the ischium and winds upward and laterally over the femoral neck, strengthening the capsule posteriorly. The transverse acetabular ligament attaches to the margins of the acetabular notch and provides origin for the ligament of the head of the femur. The transverse acetabular ligament is fibrous, not cartilaginous, but is regarded as part of the acetabular labrum.",D
True regarding vessels of the umbilical cord are?,One aery and one vein,Two aeries and two vein,Two aeries and the left vein,Two vein and the left aery,"Umbilical cord: The umbilical cord consist of two aeries and one vein. The aeries carries deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta and the vein carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus.Umbilical Cord: Initially, there are four vessels two aeries and two veins.Of the two umbilical veins, the right vein disappears by the 4th month, leaving behind one vein (left) which carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus. (and only the Left vein is left behind). The aeries carry the venous blood from the fetus to the placenta. Abnormalities:Single umbilical aery is present in about 1% of cases. This finding is sometimes referred to as a 2-vessel cord. The loss of 1 umbilical aery likely occurs secondary to thrombotic atrophy of a previously normal aery. Less likely, the loss may result from primary agenesis of the aery. It is the left umbilical aery that is more commonly absent. It is more common in twins and in babies born of diabetic mothers. It is frequently associated with congenital malformation of the fetus. Ref: 1) Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology: Obstetrics.

After ovulation the discharged oocytes and surrounding layer of granulosa cells are known as,Corpus luteum,Corona radiata,Stigma,Zona pellucida,"The corona radiata is the innermost layer of the cells of the cumulus oophorus and is directly adjacent to the zona pellucida, the inner protective glycoprotein layer of the ovum . Its main purpose in many animals is to supply vital proteins to the cell. It is formed by follicle cells adhering to the oocyte before it leaves the ovarian follicle, and originates from the squamous granulosa cells present at the primordial stage of follicular development. The corona radiata is formed when the granulosa cells enlarge and become cuboidal, which occurs during the transition from the primordia to primary stage . These cuboidal granulosa cells, also known as the granulosa radiata, form more layers throughout the maturation process, and remain attached to the zona pellucida after the ovulation of the graafian follicle . For feilization to occur, sperm cells rely on hyaluronidase (an enzyme found in the acrosome of spermatozoa) to disperse the corona radiata from the zona pellucida of the secondary (ovulated) oocyte, thus permitting entry into the perivitelline space and allowing contact between the sperm cell and the nucleus of the oocyte.

All develop from mesoderm except,Skeletal muscle,Testes,Enamel,Ureter,"In all bilaterian animals, the mesoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and endoderm (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them. The mesoderm forms mesencyme, mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms. Mesoderm forms the muscles in a process known as myogenesis, septa (cross-wise paitions) and mesenteries (length-wise paitions); and forms pa of the gonads (the rest being the gametes).Myogenesis is specifically a function of mesemchyme. The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through inercellular signalling, after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizng center. The position of the organizing center is in turn determined by the regions in which beta-catenin is protected from degradation by GSK-3. Beta-catenin acts as a co-factor that alters the activity of the transcription factor tcf-3 from repressing to activating, which initiates the synthesis of gene products critical for mesoderm differentiation and gastrulation. Fuhermore, mesoderm has the capability to induce the growth of other structures, such as the neural plate, the precursor to the nervous system. Ref - wikipedia.org",C

Unlocking of knee to allow flexion ?,Popliteus,Vastus medialis,Gastronemeus,Biceps femoris,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Popliteus Locking and Unlocking of knee jointLocking is a mechanism that allows the knee to remain in the position of full extension as in standing without much muscular effo.Locking occurs as a result of medial rotation of the femur during the last stage of extension.The anteroposterior diameter of the lateral femoral condyle is less than that of the medial condyle.As a result, when the lateral condylar aicular surface is fully 'used up' by extension, pa of the medial condylar surface remains unused.At this stage the lateral condyle rotates backwards, i.e. medial rotation of the femur occurs, so that the remaining pa of the media condylar surface is also 'taken up'.This movement locks the knee joint.Locking is aided by the oblique pull of ligaments during the last stages of extension.When the knee is locked, it is completely rigid and all ligaments of the joint are taut.Locking is produced by continued action of the same muscles that produce extension, i.e. the quadriceps femoris, especially the vastus medialis pa.The locked knee joint can be flexed only after it is unlocked by a reversal of the medial rotation, i.e. by lateral rotation of the femur. Unlocking is brought about by the action of the popliteus muscle.",A

Closure of neural tube begins at which of the following level:,Cervical region,Thoracic region,Lumbar region,Sacral region,"Ans. A. Cervical regionThe process of formation of neural tube is called neurulation. The neural tube is formed from the ectoderm overlying the notochord. The neuroectodermal cells proliferate to form a thick plate called neural plate. The margins of the neural plate get elevated (neural folds) as paraxial mesoderm proliferates on either side of the notochord. This leads to the formation of neural groove flanked by neural folds. The neural groove becomes deeper and neural folds move towards midline to fuse with each other to form a cylindrical neural tube. The fusion of neural folds (i.e., closure of neural tube) begins at the cervical region and gradually extends in cephalic and caudal directions.",A

"Several deficits in muscle function of the right upper limb were noted, including inability to abduct the arm. This was caused by denervation of which muscle?",Deltoid,Infraspinatus,Latissimus dorsi,Teres minor,"Although supraspinatus initiates abduction of the arm, the deltoid muscle allows the arm to continue abducting beyond the first 15 to 20 degrees. It is innervated by the axillary nerve, which must have been damaged in this injury. (Remember: the posterior circumflex aery had to be ligated, and it runs in the quadrangular space along with the axillary nerve. So, it's pretty conceivable that the axillary nerve has been injured, too.) Infraspinatus and teres minor are both lateral rotators of the arm. Since teres minor is also innervated by the axillary nerve, it might be injured, too, but the question isn't asking about this muscle. Latissimus dorsi is a medial rotator of the arm, innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve.",A

Which of the following type of cell is involved in myelination of the CNS?,Microglia,Astrocytes,Macrophages,Oligodendrocytes,"Oligodendroglial cells are a type of neuroglial cells, they myelinate the nerve fibre of the central nervous system. The formation of a myelin sheath is the result of a process from an oligodendrocyte spiralling around an axon so that the cytoplasm is extruded until the opposite membranes meet, thus forming a multi-layered lipoprotein coat with a node of Ranvier at each end. It has multiple cytoplasmmic processes and myelinate several axons at the same time.Must know: Peripheral nerves are myelinated from the schwann cells. Loss of myelin, known as demyelination, results in disturbance of the ability to transmit a nerve impulse through the demyelinated segment and this has serious consequences for function. Damage to one oligodendrocyte, therefore, can result in loss of myelin from many axons, whereas damage to a Schwann cell only results in loss of myelin from a single axon. Good to know: Tracts in the nervous system get myelinated at about the time they sta to function.",D

Which of the following is true regarding gastrulation?,Establishes all the three germ layers,Occurs at the caudal end of the embryo prior to its cephalic end,Involves the hypoblastic cells of inner cell mass,Usually occurs at 4 weeks,"Ans. A. Establishes all the three germ layersGastrulationa. It is the most characteristic event occurring during the third week of gestationb. Gastrulation is process that establishes all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) in the embryo.c. It begins with formation of the primitive streak on the surface of the epiblast.d. Initially, the streak is vaguely defined, but in a 15- to 16-day embryo, it is clearly visible as a narrow groove with slightly bulging regions on either side. The cephalic end of the streak, the primitive node, consists of a slightly elevated area surrounding the small primitive pit. Cells of the epiblast migrate toward the primitive streak. Upon arrival in the region of the streak, they become flask-shaped, detach from the epiblast, and slip beneath it. This inward movement is known as invagination.e. Once the cells have invaginated, some displace the hypoblast, creating the embryonic endoderm, and others come to lie between the epiblast and newly created endoderm to form mesoderm. Cells remaining in the epiblast then form ectoderm.f. Thus, the epiblast, through the process of gastrulation, is the source of all of the germ layers, and cells in these layers will give rise to all of the tissues and organs in the embryo.",A
"During a strenuous game of tennis a 55 year old woman complained of severe shoulder pain that forced her to quit the game. During physical examination it was found that she could not initiate abduction of her arm, but if her arm was elevated to 45 degrees from the veical (at her side) position, she had no trouble fully abducting it. Injury to which muscle was responsible?",Deltoid,Infraspinatus,Supraspinatus,Teres major,"Supraspinatus is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm, while deltoid is responsible for continuing abduction of the arm past the first 15 or 20 degrees. Since this patient can abduct her arm when it is lifted to 45 degrees, deltoid seems to be intact. But, she can't initiate the motion, so you know that she has probably injured supraspinatus.

The dorsal scapular nerve innervates rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and levator scapulae. If the dorsal scapular nerve is damaged, the rhomboids will be denervated, and retraction of the scapula will be weakened. An injury to the greater occipital nerve will result in a loss of sensation on the posterior scalp but no muscular deficit.

Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other pas of the body, paicularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomenand lymph nodes The most common cause is infection by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Ceain types of H. pylorihave greater risks than others. Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetablesand obesity are other risk factors.About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach.Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other pas of the body",B

Injury to cervical sympathetic trunk produces Horner's syndrome that includes all except:,Enophthalmos,Ptosis,Mydriasis,Anhydrosis,"Horner’s syndrome: 
The head and neck region is supplied by the sympathetic fibres, which arise in the upper thoracic spinal segments. 
These preganglionic fibres pass through stellate ganglion to relay in the superior cervical sympathetic
ganglion. 
The postganglionic fibres arise from cells of this ganglion and supply the structures in the head and neck.
An injury to cervical sympathetic trunk produces a clinical condition called Horner’s syndrome.
Characteristic features:

Partial ptosis (partial drooping of upper eyelid), due to paralysis of smooth part of levator palpebrae superioris muscle (Muller’s muscle).
Miosis, i.e., constriction of the pupil, due to paralysis of dilator pupillae.
Anhydrosis, i.e., loss of sweating on that side of face, due to sudomotor and vasoconstrictor denervation.
Increased temperature and redness.
Enophthalmos, i.e., sunken eyeball, not confirmed by ophthalmometry.
Loss of ciliospinal reflex, i.e., pinching the skin of the back of neck does not produce dilation of the pupil, which in healthy person takes place.

Which Rectus muscle is not supplied by occulomotor nerve ?,Medial rectus,Lateral rectus,Superior rectus,Inferior rectus,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Right side TestisTestis is the male gonad. It is suspended in the scrotum by spermatic cord.Left testis is slightly (1 cm) lower than the right one.The average testicular dimensions are 5 cm (length), 25 cm (breath), 3cm (anteroposterior diameter or thickness) and 10.5-14 gms (weight).The epididymis is attached to is posterolateral surface.Vas (ductus) deference arises from lower pole of epididymis.Lateral pa of epididymis is separated from testis by an extension of cavity of tunica vaginalis, called sinus of epididymis.There is small oval body attached to upper pole of testis called appendix of testis, a remnant of paramesonephric duct.Testis is covered by three coats (from outside to inside) :- (i) tunica vaginalis (which has a parietal and a visceral layer); (ii) tunica albuginea; and (iii) tunica vasculosa. Outside these three coats, there are layers of scrotum. StructureTestis consists of 200-300 lobules.Each lobules consists of 2-3 seminiferous tubules (where spermatozoa are formed).Seminiferous tubules join at the apex of lobules to form straight tubules, which anastomose with each other to form rete testis.Which emerge from upper pole and enter the epididymis. Each tubule becomes highly coiled to form a lobe of the head of epididymis.All tubules end in a single duct which is coiled on itself to form the body and tail of the epididymis. It is continuous with ductus deference.Aerial supplyTestes are supplied by testticular aery, a branch of abdominal aoa, arises at L2 veebral level.

Predisposing factor for venous thrombosis,AT 3 deficiency,Protein s deficiency,Protein c deficiency,All,"Ref Harrison 16/e p686 , Robbins 7/e p 132 Hypercoagulability Hypercoagulability contributes infrequently to aerial or intracardiac thrombosis but is an impoant underlying risk factor for venous thrombosis. It is loosely defined as any alteration of the coagulation pathways that predis- poses affected persons to thrombosis, and can be divided into primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) disorders (Table 3-2). Primary (inherited) hypercoagulability most often is caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes: * Approximately 2% to 15% of whites carry a specific factor V mutation (called the Leiden mutation, after the Dutch city where it was first described). The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. Thus, an impoant antithrom- botic counter-regulatory mechanism is lost. Heterozy- gotes carry a 5-fold increased risk for venous thrombosis, with homozygotes having a 50-fold increased risk. * A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1% to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrom- bin transcription and is associated with a nearly three- fold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as anti- thrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life. Congenitally elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to aerial and venous thromboses (and indeed to the development of atherosclerosis)",D

Anemia which is associated with pancytopenia is,Hemolytic,Iron deficiency,Megaloblastic,All,"Ref Robbins 9/e p645 The morphologic hallmark of megaloblastic anemia is the presence of megaloblasts, enlarged erythroid precursors that give rise to abnormally large red cells (macrocytes). Granu- locyte precursors are also increased in size. Underlying this cellular gigantism is a defect in DNA synthesis that impairs nuclear maturation and cell division. Because the synthesis of RNA and cytoplasmic elements proceeds at a normal rate and thus outpaces that of the nucleus, the hematopoietic precursors show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. This maturational derangement contributes to the anemia in several ways. Many megaloblasts are so defective in DNA synthesis that they undergo apoptosis in the marrow (inef- fective hematopoiesis). Others mature into red cells but do so after fewer cell divisions, fuher diminishing the output of red cells. Granulocyte and platelet precursors are also affected (although not as severely) and most patients present with pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia).",C

Most common organ involved in retroperitoneal fibrosis,Ureter,Aoa,Inferior venacava,Sympathetic nerve plexus,"The most impoant clinical aspect of retroperitoneal fibrosis is that the fibrotic process frequently entraps and constricts the ureters thereby causing obstructive uropathy. Retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is a nonspecific, nonsuppurative inflammation of fibro-adipose tissue of unknown cause that produces symptoms by the gradual compression of tubular structures in retroperitoneal space. Aetiology of retroperitoneal fibrosis - About 2/3rd cases are primary idiopathic, are also known as Ormond's disease Secondary Retroperitoneal fibrosis a variety of inflammatory conditions - chronic pancreatitis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, or actinomycosis. drugs methysergide (most imp.) b blockers hydralazine a methyldopa Etacapone (used in the t/t of Parkinson's ds.) - malignancies (prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, sarcoma, characinoid & gastric cancer). antoimmune disorders (ankylosing spondylitis, SLE PAN etc.) Symptoms of retroperitoneal fibrosis - It is more common in men between 40-60 yrs of age Early symptoms are nonspecific and vague. These are Pain - Dull noncolicky and insidious in onset. Anorexia, nausea General malaise, diarrhea Later on, symptoms result from compression of tubular retroperitoneal structures. The major structure involved are- Ureter - Most commonly involved Aoa Inferior venacava Symptoms due to the involvement of ureter (usually b/1 involvement) Dysuria Frequency of urination Chills and fever occur with secondary infection of a hydronephrotic kidney. Hematuria can occur. Diagnosis The diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis usually can be made accurately by intravenous pyelography if uremia is not present. The characteristic finding on pyelogram are Hydronephrosis with a dilated touous upper ureter. Medial detion of the ureter Extrinsic ureteral compression Note: In a retroperitoneal tumor, ureter is laterally deted while in retroperitoneal fibrosis ureter medially detes. Currently, the imaging procedure of choice is the CT scan. But if renal function is compromised contrast agents are not given and then MRI is the procedure of choice. T/T of Retroperitoneal fibrosis Coicosteroids, with or without surgery, are the mainstay of medical therapy. Surgical treatment is required in patients who present with moderate or massive hydronephrosis. It consists primarily of ureterolysis (freeing the ureter from adhesions and surrounding tissue) or ureteral stenting.. Also, know Paial or complete ureteral obstruction occurs in 75 to 85% of patients. Most common site of urethral obstruction is lower third of the ureter. Ref : Love & Bailey 25/e p1007",A

Dorsal column relay in which nucleus:,Substantia gelatinosa,Nucleus proprius,Accessory cuneate nucleus,Gracile nucleus,"Ans. D. Gracile nucleusa. The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway is a sensory pathway of the central nervous system that conveys sensations of fine touch, vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception (position) from the skin and joints.b. The pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body, and carries this in nerve tracts in the white matter of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, to the medulla where it is continued in the medial lemniscus, on to the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex.c. There are three groupings of neurons that are involved in the pathway: first-order neurons, second-order neurons, and third-order neurons. The first-order neurons are sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia, that send their afferent fibers through the two dorsal columns - the gracile fasciculus, or gracile tract, and the cuneate fasciculus or cuneate tract. The first-order axons make contact with second-order neurons at the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus in the lower medulla. The second-order neurons send their axons to the thalamus. The third- order neurons are in the ventral nuclear group in the thalamus and fibres from these ascend to the postcentral gyrus.",D

Best investigation when there is clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism in a patient is,D-dimer assay,Multi detector CT angiography,Doppler ultrasound,Catheter angiography,"CT of the chest with intravenous contrast is the principal imaging test for the diagnosis of PE . Multidetector-row spiral CT acquires all chest images with <=1 mm of resolution during a sho breath hold. Sixth-order branches can be visualized with resolution superior to that of conventional invasive contrast pulmonary angiography. CTPA is the first-line diagnostic test . It has the advantage of visualising the distribution and extent of the emboli or highlighting an alternative diagnosis, such as consolidation, pneumothorax or aoic dissection. The sensitivity of CT scanning may be increased by simultaneous visualisation of the femoral and popliteal veins, although this is not widely practised. As the contrast media may be nephrotoxic, care should be taken in patients with renal impairment, and CTPA avoided in those with a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media. In these cases, either V/Q scanning or ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V /Q SPECT) may be considered Colour Doppler ultrasound of the leg veins may be used in patients with suspected PE, paicularly if there are clinical signs in a limb, as many will have identifiable proximal thrombus in the leg veins.

"A 3-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital because of a soft, anterior, midline cervical mass. When the patient is asked to protrude his tongue, the mass in the neck is observed to move upward. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A thyroglossal duct cyst,Defect in sixth pharyngeal arch,A branchial cyst,Cystic fistula of the third pharyngeal arch,Thyroglossal duct cysts occur due to retention of a remnant of the thyroglossal duct along the path followed by the descending thyroid gland during development. The path begins from the foramen cecum of the tongue and descends in the midline to the final position of the thyroid. The sixth pharyngeal arch provides origin to muscles and cartilage of the neck and would produce a midline mass connected to the tongue. A branchial cyst or fistula would not be present in the midline. The first pharyngeal arch gives rise to muscles of mastication and the malleus and incus.

"A 31-year-old female presents to the department of surgery with a complaint of Bell's palsy, which had appeared a year earlier and had resulted in paralysis of muscles of one side of her face. The chief of plastic surgery recommends a nerve graft, taking a cutaneous nerve from the lower limb to replace the defective facial nerve. The surgery is successful. Six months after the procedure, there is restoration of function of previously paralyzed facial muscles. There is an area of skin on the back of the leg laterally and also on the lateral side of the foot that has no sensation. What nerve was used in the grafting procedure?",Superficial fibular (peroneal),Tibial,Common fibular (peroneal),Sural,"The sural nerve is formed by contributions from the tibial nerve and a branch from the common fibular (peroneal) nerve. It provides sensation for the lower lateral portion of the calf and continues beneath the lateral malleolus as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the foot. It is often used for nerve grafting procedures as well as biopsied for diagnostic purposes. When it is grafted to the ""living end"" of a cut motor or sensory nerve, the severed nerve processes within the ""living"" nerve grow into the sural nerve sheath, using it as a guide to the distal, surgically anastomosed nerve. Thus, axons from a branch of a functional motor nerve can grow to reinnervate paralyzed muscles. In this case, the surgeon would connect portions of the sural nerve to the functional facial nerve, tunnel it to the opposite side of the face, and join it surgically to the branches of the paralyzed nerve, where it would grow through the now-empty nerve sheaths (due to Wallerian degeneration) to the muscles. Growth and reinnervation usually occur at a rate of 1mm/day (or 1inch/month) so the time estimated before reinnervation is based on the distance the regenerating fibers need to traverse. The tibial nerve supplies muscles and sensation to the calf and plantar surface of the foot. The common fibular (peroneal) nerve innervates the lateral and anterior compartment muscles and sensation to the dorsum of the foot. The saphenous nerve accompanies the great saphenous vein on the medial side of the leg and foot.",D

Rosette shaped arrangement of cells is seen in,Thecoma of ovary,Ependymoma,Neurofibroma,Lymphoma,"An ependymoma is a glial tumor of the ependymal cells that line the center of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. There are several different types of ependymoma cancers, which are also classified by grade. The three grades used for ependymoma cancers are determined by how closely the cancer cells resemble normal cells. The lower the grade, the more closely the cancer cells resemble normal cells. The different types of ependymomas appear in different locations within the spinal column or brain. Grade I tumors - These include subependymomas and myxopapillary ependymomas, and are typically slow growing. Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to appear at the lower end of the spinal column. Subependymomas appear near a ventricle in the brain. These ventricles are involved in the creation of cerebrospinal fluid. Grade II tumors - These are the most common ependymomas. Many ependymoma subtypes exist in this grade, including cellular, papillary, tancytic, RELA fusion-positive, and clear cell ependymomas. These may appear anywhere along the ventricular system where cerebrospinal fluid is produced. Grade III tumors - These are known as anaplastic ependymomas and are typically faster growing than the other grades. Anaplastic ependymomas are usually found in the skull, brain, and brain stem.

The inheritance pattern of familial retinoblastoma is,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,"Ref Robbins 7/e p1442,299- 300,9/e p292-293 In hereditary retinoblastoma, mutations in the RB1gene appear to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Autosomal dominant inheritance means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to increase the risk of cancer. A person with hereditary retinoblastoma may inherit an altered copy of the RB1 gene from one parent, or the altered gene may be the result of a new mutation that occurs in an egg or sperm cell or just after feilization. For retinoblastoma to develop, a mutation involving the other copy of the RB1 gene must occur in retinal cells during the person's lifetime. This second mutation usually occurs in childhood, typically leading to the development of retinoblastoma in both eyes. In the non-hereditary form of retinoblastoma, typically only one eye is affected and there is no family history of the disease. Affected individuals are born with two normal copies of the RB1 gene. Then, usually in early childhood, both copies of the RB1 gene in ceain retinal cells acquire mutations. People with non-hereditary retinoblastoma are not at risk of passing these RB1 gene mutations to their children. However, without genetic testing it can be difficult to tell whether a person with retinoblastoma in one eye has the hereditary or the non-hereditary form of the disease.",B

True about acute pancreatitis,Serum Amylase is diagnostic,CECT is preferred over USG in diagnosis,Grey Turner sign seen around the umbilicus,Alcohol is the MC cause,"Gall stones are the most common cause, alcohol being IInd most common. Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe fonn of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self-limited in --85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days. Surgical management is needed in cases of necrotic pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess and intervention in gall stone pancreatitis.

Which of the following aeries has been compressed by the displacement of this fracture?,Anterior tibial aery,Femoral aery,Popliteal aery,Posterior tibial aery,"The patient has suffered a supracondylar fracture of the femur. The supracondylar surface of the femur forms the floor of the popliteal fossa. This fossa contains the popliteal aery, in close proximity to the femur. After crossing the knee this aery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial aeries, which supply the leg and foot.Note:The anterior tibial aery is a branch of the popliteal aery that arises distal to the knee and would therefore not be compressed by a femoral fracture. The anterior tibial aery is renamed the dorsalis pedis aery after it crosses the ankle. The femoral aery is in the anterior compament of the thigh. After passing through the adductor hiatus to reach the popliteal fossa, the femoral aery is renamed the popliteal aery. The posterior tibial aery is a branch of the popliteal aery that arises distal to the knee and would therefore not be compressed by a femoral fracture. The posterior tibial aery passes through the posterior compament of the leg and, after passing behind the medial malleolus of the ankle, divides into the medial and lateral plantar aeries.

ANCA antibody with peripheral rim distribution is indicative of,Antihistone antibody,Anti Smith antibody,Anti double stranded DNA antibody,Anti double stranded RNA antibody,"Ref 9/e p219,8/e p214,7/e 228 Antinuclear antibodies. ANAs are directed against several nuclear antigens and can be grouped into four catego- ries: (1) antibodies to DNA, (2) antibodies to histones, (3) antibodies to nonhistone proteins bound to RNA, and (4) antibodies to nucleolar antigens. Table 4-10 lists several autoantibodies, including ANAs, and their asso- ciation with SLE as well as with other autoimmune dis- eases, to be discussed later. The most widely used method of detecting ANAs is the indirect immunofluo- rescence assay (IFA), which screens for autoantibodies that bind to a variety of nuclear antigens, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. Four staining patterns are seen with IFA: homogeneous or diffuse, rim or periph- eral, speckled, and nucleolar. While each pattern can be suggestive of the presence of specific autoantibodies, the strength of these associations is limited and should not be relied on. ANA testing by IFA is extremely sensitive, as more than 95% of patients with SLE will test positive, but the test's specificity is quite limited, because patients with other autoimmune diseases, chronic infections, and cancer will test positive as well. Fuhermore, ANAs are seen in approximately 5% to 15% of healthy people, and the incidence increases with age. Recently, the IFA has been replaced in many clinical laboratories by multiplex flow cytometry immunoassays that can simultaneously test for multiple specific autoantibodies, but these assays may lack the sensitivity of the IFA. Antibodies to double- stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the so-called Smith (Sm) antigen can be detected by ELISA or multiplex flow methods and are specific for SLE. * Other autoantibodies. Antibodies against blood cells, including red cells, platelets, and lymphocytes, are found in many patients. Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 40% to 50% of patients with lupus and react with a wide variety of proteins in complex with phospholipids. Some bind to cardiolipin antigen, used in serologic tests for syphilis, so patients with lupus may have a false-positive test result for syphilis.

A 42-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with injury to the upper (superior) trunk of the brachial plexus. The diagnosis is Erb-Duchenne palsy. Which of the following conditions is expected to be present during physical examination?,Winged scapula,Inability to laterally rotate the arm,Paralysis of intrinsic muscles of the hand,Paresthesia in the medial aspect of the arm,"Injury to the superior trunk of the brachial plexus can damage nerve fibers going to the suprascapular, axillary, and musculocutaneous nerves. Damage to the suprascapular and axillary nerves causes impaired abduction and lateral rotation of the arm. Damage to the musculocutaneous nerve causes impaired flexion of the forearm. A winged scapula would be caused by damage to the long thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve is formed from spinal cord levels C5, C6, and C7, so the serratus anterior muscle would be weakened from the damage to C5 and C6, but the muscle would not be completely paralyzed. The intrinsic muscles of the hand are innervated by the ulnar nerve, which would most likely remain intact.

How soon after bih should this murmur normally disappear?,1-2 months,1-2 weeks,1-2 days,Immediate closure,"Ductus aeriosus closure- Functionally-immediately after bih Structurally-1-3 months after bih The ductus aeriosus functionally closes immediatly (1-2 hours) after bih smooth muscle contraction of the tunica media. Before bih, the patency of the ductus aeriosus is controlled by the low oxygen content of the blood flowing through it, which in turn stimulates production of prostaglandins, which cause smooth muscle to relax. After bih, the high oxygen content of the blood due to lung ventilation inhibits production of prostaglandins, causing smooth muscle contraction. Premature infants can be treated with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors (such as indomethacin) to promote closure of the ductus aeriosus.",D
A 1-day-old infant has a mass protruding through her umbilicus. Physical examination reveals an umbilical hernia.

At the end of prophase, the nuclear membrane disappears and metaphase begins. Following this, anaphase occurs, at which time the centromere divides and each daughter chromatid goes to 1 of the poles of the spindle. Telophase then ensues, at which time the spindle breaks and cell cytoplasm divides. A nuclear membrane now forms, and mitosis is complete. Each daughter cell has received chromosome material equal in amount and identical to that of the parent cell.

The intiating mechanism in endotoxic shock is,Peripheral vasodilation,Endothelial injury,Increased vascular permeability,Cytokine release,"Ref Robbins. 9/e p132-133 Endothelial injury is also a cause..see the above questions In gram-negative sepsis, free LPS attaches to a circulating LPS-binding protein, and the complex then binds to the CD14 receptor on monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling an associated ""Toll-like receptor"" protein 4 (TLR-4). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the innate immune system to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as tissue factor pathway inhibitor and thrombomodulin.

The azygos veins consist of the main azygos vein, the inferior hemiazygos vein, and the superior hemiazygos vein. They drain blood from the posterior pas of the intercostal spaces, the posterior abdominal wall, the pericardium, the diaphragm, the bronchi, and the esophagus. Azygos vein is often formed by the union of the right ascending lumbar vein and the right subcostal vein. It ascends through the aoic opening in the diaphragm on the right side of the aoa to the level of the fifth thoracic veebra. Here it arches forward above the root of the right lung to empty into the posterior surface of the superior vena cava. The azygos vein has numerous tributaries, including the eight lower right intercostal veins, the right superior intercostal vein, the superior and inferior hemiazygos veins, and numerous mediastinal veins. The inferior hemiazygos vein is often formed by the union of the left ascending lumbar vein and the left subcostal vein.

Weakest cartilage among the following is,Hyaline cartilage,Elastic Cartilage,Fibrocartilage,All have equal strength,"Depending upon the presence and predominance of collagen or elastic fibers the cartilages are classified into three types: fibrocartilage, hyaline cartilage, and elastic cartilage.
The hyaline cartilage has a homogeneous, glassy, bluish, and opalescent appearance. The collagen fibers present in the matrix are fine and not seen easily.
The fibrocartilage is a dense, fasciculated, opaque white tissue. The collagen fibers present in fibrocartilage are numerous and very obvious.
The elastic cartilage is pliable and imparts yellowish tinge. The intercellular substance of elastic cartilage, as the name indicates, is permeated by elastic fibers.
The mesenchymal cells surrounding the surface of developing cartilage form the perichondrium.
Weakest cartilage among these is hyaline cartilage. 

Key Concept:
The hyaline cartilage has a homogeneous, glassy, bluish, and opalescent appearance. The collagen fibers present in the matrix are fine and not seen easily.

Which of the following conditions will most likely explain the symptoms?",Duodenal stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter,Atrophied gastric antrum,"Duodenal atresia is the result of a failed reformation of the lumen of the duodenum and is associated with vomiting within the first few days of birth. Polyhydramnios is seen due to abnormal absorption of amniotic fluid by the intestines. Finally, radiographic or ultrasound examination would review the ""double bubble"" sign because of distended, gas-filled stomach. Duodenal stenosis is caused by incomplete recanalization of the duodenum and often results in vomiting of stomach contents plus bile later in life. Hypertrophied pyloric sphincter would cause projectile vomiting. An atrophied gastric antrum is caused by the removal of the membranous lining of the stomach and occurs proximal to the site of the entrance of the common bile duct; therefore, vomit would not contain bile. Tracheoesophageal fistula is an abnormal passage between the trachea and esophagus and would not be a cause for any of symptoms cited in the question.",B

Gingival biopsy is useful in the diagnosis of,Sarcoidosis,Amyloidosis,Histoplasmosis,Scurvy,"Ref Harrison 17/ 2146; Robbins 9/e p 262,7/e p264 Other Organs. Amyloidosis of other organs generally is encountered in systemic disease. The adrenals, thyroid, and pituitary are common sites of involvement. In such cases as well, the amyloid deposition begins in relation to stromal and endothelial cells and progressively encroaches on the paren- chymal cells. Surprisingly large amounts of amyloid may be present in any of these endocrine glands without apparent disturbance of function. In the gastrointestinal tract, a rela- tively ored site for deposition, amyloid may be found at all levels, sometimes producing tumorous masses that must be distinguished from neoplasms. Nodular depositions in the tongue may produce macroglossia. On the basis of the frequent involvement of the gastrointestinal tract in systemic cases, gingival, intestinal, and rectal biopsies serve in the diag- nosis of suspected cases. Deposition of b2-microglobulin amyloid in patients receiving long-term dialysis occurs most commonly in the carpal ligaments of the wrist, resulting in compression of the median nerve (leading to carpal tunnel syndrome).",B

Potassium is absorbed in the jejunum by,Active transpo,Facilitated transpo,Passive transpo,Active and passive transpo,"As with other substrates, the net movement of K+ across the intestinal mucosa is determined by the difference between two opposing unidirectional fluxes; compared to sodium fluxes, potassium fluxes are small. Net movement of K+ in jejunum and ileum occurs only down the electrochemical gradient (i.e., it is largely passive). Potassium diffuses primarily through the lateral spaces and tight junctions. In the colon potassium is usually secreted, and the luminal concentration must be above 25 mEq/L for net absorption to take place. This explains why potassium deficiency tends to develop in diarrhoea. Potassium secretion by the colon appears to be a passive process",C

The inferior mesenteric artery always arises separately, however, replaced, accessory or anastomotic vessels occasionally arise from the proximal superior mesenteric artery or its branches and contribute to the arterial supply to the proximal territory of the inferior mesenteric artery.d. The coeliac trunk and its branches supplies the gastrointestinal tract from the distal third of the oesophagus to the mid part of the duodenum and all derived adenexae (liver, biliary tree, spleen, dorsal pancreas, greater omentum and lesser omentum).e. The superior mesenteric artery supplies the tract from the mid second part of the duodenum to the distal third of the transverse colon (jejunum, ileum, caecum, appendix, ascending colon and ileal mesentery).f. The inferior mesenteric artery supplies the tract from the distal transverse colon to the upper anal canal.g. Other than accessory arteries, numerous medium calibre arteries form anastomoses between the vascular territories. The most profuse occurs around the head of the pancreas and the duodenum, where anastomoses form between the anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries; the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery and jejunal arteries; the greater pancreatic artery and jejunal arteries.h. The anastomoses between the territories of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries are less pronounced and more variable: the most reliable is the pericolic marginal artery, which runs along the transverse colon. Additional anastomotic arcades may exist in the colic mesentery between the transverse and descending colon",B

In patients with chronic liver disease, an increasing MELD score is associated with increasing severity of hepatic dysfunction and three-month moality risk. Given its accuracy in predicting sho-term survival among patients with end-stage liver disease, MELD is used by the transplant community in the United States for prioritization of patients awaiting liver transplantation. It was originally developed as a tool to predict moality after transjugular intrahepatic poosystemic shunt (TIPS). The MELD model that is currently used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in prioritizing allocation of deceased donor organs for liver transplantation is calculated according to the following formula: MELD = 3.8 + 11.2 + 9.6 + 6.4 where Ln is the natural logarithm. MELD is scored on a 6- to 40-point scale A higher MELD score indicates a sicker patient, with a higher risk for moality.

Sistrunk operation is used for,Thyroglossal cyst,Branchial cyst,Cystic hygroma,Laryngocele,"ThyroglossalDuct Cyst A thyroglossal duct cyst is a midline neck lesion that originates at the base of the tongue at the foramen cecum and descends through the central poion of the hyoid bone. Although thyroglossal duct cysts may occur anywhere from the base of the tongue to the thyroid gland, most are found at or just below the hyoid bone . A thyroid diveiculum develops as a median endodermal thickening at the foramen cecum in the embryonic stage of development. The thyroid diveiculum descends in the neck and remains attached to the base of the tongue by the thyroglossal duct. Also, as the thyroid gland descends to its normal pretracheal position, the ventral cailages of the second and third branchial arches form the hyoid bone--hence the intimate anatomic relationship of the thyroglossal duct remnant with the central poionof the hyoid bone. The thyroglossal duct normally regresses by the time the thyroid gland reaches its final position. When the elements of the duct persist despite complete thyroid descent, a thyroglossal duct cyst may develop. Failure of normal caudal migration of the thyroid gland results in a lingual thyroid, in which no other thyroid tissue is present in the neck. Ultrasound or radionuclide imaging may provide useful information to identify the presence of an ectopic thyroid gland in the neck. The standard operation for thyroglossal duct cysts has remained unchanged since it was described by Sistrunk in 1928, which involves complete excision of the cyst in continuity with its tract, the central poion of the hyoid bone, and the tract interior to the hyoid bone extending to the base of the tongue Failure to remove these tissues entirely will likely result in recur- rence because multiple sinuses have been histologically identified in these locations.

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.

These comprise the pre-aortic and para-aortic groups.# The pre-aortic nodes are arranged around the three ventral branches of the aorta and consequently receive lymph from the territories that are supplied by these branches. This includes most of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, gall bladder, spleen and pancreas. The efferent vessels from the pre-aortic nodes coalesce to form a variable number of intestinal trunks that deliver the lymph to the cistema chyli.# The para-aortic nodes are arranged around the lateral branches of the aorta and drain lymph from their corresponding territories, i.e., the kidneys, adrenal, gonads and abdominal wall, as well as the common iliac nodes. The efferent vessels from the para-aortic nodes coalesce to form a variable number of lumbar trunks which deliver the lymph to the cisterna chyli.# Cisterna chyli: is a lymphatic sac that lies anterior to the bodies of the LI and L2.

Heaburn, postprandial choking, and nocturnal coughing are commonly seen. The dysphagia that patients experience often begins with liquids and progresses to solids. Most patients describe eating as a laborious process during which they must pay special attention to the process. They eat slowly and use large volumes of water to help wash the food down into the stomach. As the water builds up pressure, retrosternal chest pain is experienced and can be severe until the LES opens, which provides quick relief. Regurgitation of undigested, foul-smelling food is common, and with progressive disease, aspiration can become life-threatening. Pneumonia, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis often result from long-standing achalasia. The dysphagia progresses slowly during years, and patients adapt their lifestyle to accommodate the inconveniences that accompany this disease. Patients often do not seek medical attention until their symptoms are advanced and will present with marked distention of the esophagus.the operation of choice.

What is the histological appearance of brain in Creutzefeldt Jakob disease,Neuronophagia,Spongiform change in brain,Microabscess,Demylination,"Refer Robbins page no 1282MORPHOLOGY The progression of the dementia in CJD is usually so rapid that there is little if any grossly evident brain atrophy. The pathog- nomonic finding is a spongiform transformation of the cerebral coex and, often, deep gray matter structures (caudate, putamen); this multifocal process results in the uneven forma- tion of small, apparently empty, microscopic vacuoles of varying sizes within the neuropil and sometimes in the perikaryon of neurons (Fig. 28-32A). In advanced cases there is severe neu- ronal loss, reactive gliosis, and sometimes expansion of the vacuolated areas into cystlike spaces (""status spongiosus""). Inflammation is notably absent. Electron microscopy shows the vacuoles to be membrane-bound and located within the cyto- plasm of neuronal processes. Kuru plaques are extracellular deposits of aggregated abnormal protein; they are Congo red- and PAS-positive and usually occur in the cerebellum (Fig. 28-32B), but are abundant in the cerebral coex in cases of vCJD (Fig. 28-32C).

Not a premalignant condition,Fragile X syndrome,Down's syndrome,Blount's syndrome,Fanconi's syndrome,"Ref Robbins 9/e p169 Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that causes a range of developmental problems including learning disabilities and cognitive impairment. Usually, males are more severely affected by this disorder than females. Affected individuals usually have delayed development of speech and language by age 2. Most males with fragile X syndrome have mild to moderate intellectual disability, while about one-third of affected females are intellectually disabled. Children with fragile X syndrome may also have anxiety and hyperactive behavior such as fidgeting or impulsive actions. They may have attention deficit disorder (ADD), which includes an impaired ability to maintain attention and difficulty focusing on specific tasks. About one-third of individuals with fragile X syndrome have features of fragile X syndrome. Most males and about half of females with fragile X syndrome have characteristic physical features that become more apparent with age. These features include a long and narrow face, large ears, a prominent jaw and forehead, unusually flexible fingers, flat feet, and in males, enlarged testicles (macroorchidism) after pubey. Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of a gene in each cell causes the disorder. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. In women, the FMR1 gene premutation on the X chromosome can expand to more than 200 CGG repeats in cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with the premutation have an increased risk of having a child with fragile X syndrome. By contrast, the premutation in men does not expand to more than 200 repeats as it is passed to the next generation. Men pass the premutation only to their daughters. Their sons receive a Y chromosome, which does not include the FMR1 gene.",A

Fibers in the dorsal column ascend ipsilaterally and decussate in the caudal medulla. Lesion of dorsal column of spinal result in ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration. Isolated involvement of dorsal column occur in tabes dorsalis a form of teiary syphilis.In patients with syringomyelia decussating fibers of the spinothalamic tract from both sides are involved without affecting other ascending or descending tracts. These patients develop dissociated sensory abnormalities with loss of pain and temperature sensibility in appropriate dermatomes with preservation of vibration and position sense.Ref: Waxman S.G.

The lateral maxillary prominence then merges with the merged medial nasal prominences. Failure of this merger to occur results in a unilateral cleft lip.Failure of a lateral palatine process to fuse with the median palatine process, which is synonymous with a failure of the primary palate to fuse with the secondary palate, results in a primary cleft palate. Primary clefts of the palate are found anterior to the incisive foramen of the palate. Primary cleft palates may occur along with cleft lips but are the result of a separate developmental defect.Failure of the right and left medial nasal prominences to merge results in a median cleft lip. This is a rare anomaly. Normally, the right and left medial nasal prominences merge into a single prominence which forms the philtrum of the lip.

Which of the following surface glycoprotein is most often expressed in human hematopoietic stem cells,CD22,CD40,CD15,CD34,"Ref Robbins 9/e p590 CD34 derives its name from the cluster of differentiation protocol that identifies cell surface antigens. CD34 was first described on hematopoietic stem cells independently by Civin et al. and Tindle et al. as a cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a cell-cell adhesion factor. It may also mediate the attachment of hematopoietic stem cellsto bone marrow extracellular matrix or directly to stromal cells. The CD34 protein is a member of a family of single-pass transmembrane sialomucin proteins that show expression on early hematopoietic and vascular-associated tissue. However, little is known about its exact function. CD34 is also an impoant adhesion molecule and is required for T cells to enter lymph nodes. It is expressed on lymph node endothelia, whereas the L-selectin to which it binds is on the T cell.Conversely, under other circumstances CD34 has been shown to act as molecular ""Teflon"" and block mast cell, eosinophil and dendritic cell precursor adhesion, and to facilitate opening of vascular lumina.Finally, recent data suggest CD34 may also play a more selective role in chemokine-dependent migration of eosinophils and dendritic cell precursors.Regardless of its mode of action, under all circumstances CD34, and its relatives podocalyxin and endoglycan, facilitates cell migration.",D

Which is associated with G2M transition in cell cycle,Cycling A,CyclinB,CyclinC,CyclinD,"Ref Robbins 8/e p286,7/e p290,9/e p26 Cyclin B is necessary for the progression of the cells into and out of M phase of the cell cycle. At the end of S phase the phosphatase cdc25c dephosphorylates tyrosine15 and this activates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Upon activation the complex is shuttled to the nucleus where it serves to trigger for entry into mitosis. However, if DNA damage is detected alternative proteins are activated which results in the inhibitory phosphorylation of cdc25c and therefore cyclinB/CDK1 is not activated. In order for the cell to progress out of mitosis, the degradation of cyclin B is necessary. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex also interacts with a variety of other key proteins and pathways which regulate cell growth and progression of mitosis. Cross-talk between many of these pathways links cyclin B levels indirectly to induction of apoptosis. The cyclin B/CDK1 complex plays a critical role in the expression of the survival signal survivin. Survivin is necessary for proper creation of the mitotic spindlewhich strongly affects cell bility, therefore when cyclin B levels are disrupted cells experience difficulty polarizing. A decrease in survivin levels and the associated mitotic disarray triggers apoptosis caspase 3 mediated pathway.",B

Pudendal nerve supplying sphincter of bladder has the root value of?,T12-L1,L4-L5,S2-S4,L2-L3,"Ans. C.S2 -S4 a. A nerve that is formed by fibers from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and accompanies the internal pudendal artery to terminate as the dorsal nerve of the penis or of the clitoris.b. The pudendal nerve is a nerve in the pelvic region that innervates the external genitalia of both sexes, as well as sphincters for the bladder and the rectum.c. The pudendal nerve originates in the sacral plexus; it derives its fibers from the ventral branches of the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves (S2 ,S3 ,S4 ),d. It passes between the piriformis and coccygeus muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen.e. It crosses the spine of the ischium, and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen.f. It accompanies the internal pudendal vessels upward and forward along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal.g. The pudendal nerve gives off the inferior anal nerves. It soon divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve, and the dorsal nerve of the penis (males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).h. Inferior anal nerves given off shortly after passing through the Greater sciatic foramen. Perineal nerve more superficial terminal branch Dorsal nerve of penis/Dorsal nerve of clitoris deeper terminal branch, travelling into the deep perineal pouchi. The pudendal nerve innervates the penis and clitoris, bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles, and areas around the scrotum, perineum, and anus.

At the time of bih, there are 2 million ova, but 50% of these are atretic. The million that are normal undergo the first pa of the first meiotic division at about this time and enter a stage of arrest in prophase in which those that survive persist until adulthood. Atresia continues during development, and the number of ova in both of the ovaries at the time of pubey is less than 300,000.

The inferior border of the rectus sheath posteriorly is called the?,Falx inguinalis,Inguinal ligament,Internal inguinal ring,Arcuate line,"The rectus sheath is a tough, tendinous sheath over the rectus abdominis muscle. It covers the entire anterior surface of the rectus abdominis. However, on the posterior side of the muscle, the sheath is incomplete. It ends inferiorly at the arcuate line. Below the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis is covered by transversalis fascia, not the rectus sheath. The linea alba is also related to the rectus abdominis. It is a ligament that runs down the middle of the abdomen, bisecting the rectus abdominis. It is made by the intermingling of the aponeuroses of the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. All of the other answer choices are related to the inguinal canal. The falx inguinalis (sometimes called the inguinal falx or conjoint tendon), is the inferomedial attachment of transversus abdominis with some fibers of internal abdominal oblique. It contributes to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal. The inguinal ligament is the ligament that connects the anterior superior iliac spine with the pubic tubercle. It makes the floor of the inguinal canal.

Most common site for lymphoma in AIDS patients is,CNS lesions,Spleen,Thymus,Abdomen,"Ref Robbins 9/e p254, 8/e p529,7/e p549 Pathogenesis of CNS Involvement The pathogenesis of the neurologic manifestations in AIDS deserves special mention because, in addition to the lymphoid system, the nervous system is a major target of HIV infection. Macrophages and cells belonging to the monocyte-macrophage lineage (microglial cells) are the predominant cell types in the brain that are infected with HIV. The virus is most likely carried into the brain by infected monocytes (thus, brain HIV isolates are almost exclusively of the R5 type). The mechanism of HIV-induced damage of the brain, however, remains obscure. Because neurons are not infected by HIV, and the extent of neuro- pathologic changes is often less than might be expected from the severity of neurologic symptoms, most expes believe that the neurologic deficit is caused indirectly by viral products and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines such as TNF) produced by macrophages and microglial cells. In addition, injury from nitric oxide induced in neuronal cells by gp41 and direct damage of neurons by soluble HIV gp120 have been postulated.",A

"All of the following genes are associated with establishment of left sidedness, EXCEPT:",Sonic hedgehog,FGF 8,Nodal,None of the above,"Left-right-sidedness, also established early in development, is orchestrated by a cascade of genes. When the primitive streak appears, fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is secreted by cells in the node and primitive streak and induces expression of Nodal but only on the left side of the embryo. Later, as the neural plate is induced, FGF8 maintains Nodal expression in the lateral plate mesoderm, as well as LEFTY-2, and both of these genes upregulate PITX2. PITX2 is a homeobox-containing transcription factor responsible for establishing left-sidedness. Also, it is expressed on the left side of the hea, stomach, and gut primordia, and, if expressed ectopically, it results in laterality defects. Simultaneously, LEFTY is expressed on the left side of the floor plate of the neural tube and may act as a barrier to prevent left-sided signals from crossing over. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) may also function in this role as well as serving as a repressor for left-sided gene expression on the right. Ref: Langman's embryology 11th edition Chapter 35.",D

It was first formulated by Alfred G. Knudson retinoblastoma, a tumor of the retina that occurs both as an inherited disease and sporadically. He noted that inherited retinoblastoma occurs at a younger age than the sporadic disease. In addition, the children with inherited retinoblastoma often developed the tumor in both eyes, suggesting an underlying predisposition. Knudson suggested that two ""hits"" to DNA were necessary to cause the cancer. In the children with inherited retinoblastoma, the first mutation in what later came to be identified as the RB1 gene, was inherited, the second one acquired. In non-inherited retinoblastoma, instead two mutations, or ""hits"", had to take place before a tumor could develop, explaining the later onset.",B

The type of joint between the sacrum and the coccyx is a,Symphysis,Synostosis,Synchondrosis,Syndesmosis,"The sacrococcygeal symphysis is an amphiahrodial (slightly mobile) joint, formed between the oval surface at the apex of the sacrum, and the base of the coccyx.The movements which take place between the sacrum and coccyx, and between the different pieces of the latter bone, are forward and backward; they are very limited. Their extent increases during pregnancy.A zygapophyseal joint (or facet joint) is a veebral joint between the superior aicular process of one veebra and the inferior aicular process of the one adjacent. It is of plane synol variety. In fact, all the joints of veebra are plane synol Except the median one- which is a symphysis (as expected *).*All midline joints tend to be symphysis, only very few Exceptions are there. E.g., spheno-occipital joint, which is a synchondrosisInterveebral discs (or interveebral fibrocailage) lie between adjacent veebrae in the spine. Each disc forms a secondary cailaginous (symphysis) joint to allow slight movement of the veebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the veebrae together.Discs consist of an outer annulus fibrosus, which surrounds the inner nucleus pulposus. The annulus fibrosus consists of several layers of fibrocailage. The strong annular fibers contain the nucleus pulposus and distribute pressure evenly across the disc. The nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel the consistency of jelly. The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body&;s daily activities and keeping the two veebrae separated.The disc can be likened to a doughnut: whereby the annulus fibrosis is similar to the dough and the nucleus pulposis is the jelly. If one presses down on the front of the doughnut the jelly moves posteriorly or to the back. When one develops a prolapsed disc the jelly/ nucleus pulposis is forced out of the doughnut/ disc and may put pressure on the nerve located near the disc. This will give one the symptoms of sciatica if the disc herniation is at lumbosacral region.There is one disc between each pair of veebrae, Except for the first cervical segment, the atlas. There are a total of twenty-three discs in the spine.When the annulus fibrosus tears due to an injury or the aging process, the nucleus pulposus can begin to extrude through the tear, most commonly postero-lateral. This is called disc herniation. Near the posterior side of each disc, all along the spine, major spinal nerves extend out to different organs, tissues, extremities etc. It is very common for the herniated disc to press against these nerves (pinched nerve) causing radiating pain, numbness, tingling, and diminished strength and/or range of motion. In addition, the contact of the inner nuclear gel, which contains inflammatory proteins, with a nerve can also cause significant pain and muscle spasm. Nerve-related pain is called radicular pain.",A

Hodgkin's lymphoma caused for by,EBV,CMV,HHV6,HHV8,"Ref Robbins 9/e p607 One clue stems from the involvement of EBV. EBV is present in the RS cells in as many as 70% of cases of the mixed-cellularity subtype and a smaller fraction of other ""classical"" forms of Hodgkin lymphoma. More impoant, the integration of the EBV genome is identi- cal in all RS cells in a given case, indicating that infection precedes (and therefore may be related to) transformation and clonal expansion. Thus, as in Burkitt lymphoma and B cell lymphomas in immunodeficient patients, EBV infection prob- ably is one of several steps contributing to tumor develop- ment, paicularly of the mixed-cellularity subtype. The characteristic non-neoplastic, inflammatory cell infil- trate is generated by a number of cytokines, some secreted by RS cells, including IL-5 (which attracts and activates eosin- ophils), transforming growth factor-b (a fibrogenic factor), and IL-13 (which may stimulate RS cells through an autocrine mechanism). Conversely, the responding inflammatory cells, rather than being innocent bystanders, produce additional factors such as CD30 ligand that aid the growth and survival of RS cells and contribute fuher to the tissue reaction.",A

Which muscle is attached to intra-articular disc of temporomandibular joint ?,Masseter,Temporalis,MedialPterygoid,Lateral pterygoid,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Lateral pterygoid Temporomandibular jointo It is a synovial, bicondylar joint between the mandibular fossa and articular tubercle of temporal bone above and the head of mandible below. The joint is completely divided into two compartments (upper and lower) by a fibro cortilaginous articular disc. Ligaments of TM joints are fibrous capsule, Lateral temporomandibular ligament, and stylomandibular ligament.o The articular disc is a fibrocartilaginous disc which divides joint cavity into an upper and a lower compartment. The upper compartment permits gliding movement and the lower compartment permits rotatory as well as gliding movements. The articular disc represents the degenerated premitive insertion of lateral pterygoid: Central portion of articular disc is least vascular. Articular disc acts as shock absorber, prevents friction between articular surfaces and also has proprioceptive function. Articular disc also increases the area of contact and hence helps in distribution of weight across the joint, o There are following movements in TM joints1) Protrusion (protraction of chin):- Lateral and medial pterygoid of both sides acting together, assisted by superficial fibers of masseter.2) Retraction (Retraction of chin):- Posterior fibers of temporalis assisted by deep fibers of masseter.3) Elevation (Closing of mouth):- Masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid, of both sides.4) Depression (opening of mouth):- Both lateral pterygoids assisted by digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid.5) Side to side (lateral) movement:- Lateral and medial pterygoid of one side acting alternately with each other.o Dislocation of mandible occurs when mouth is opened too widely by excessive contraction of lateral pterygoid. Head of the mandible slips anteriorly into infratemporal fossa, o TM joints is supplied by auriculotemporal nerve and masseteric nerve.",D

"If the head of the femur is dislocated postero-medially, compression of which nerve is likely to be a result?",Femoral,Lumbosacral trunk,Obturator,Sciatic,"The sciatic nerve is closely related to the posterior hip joint, which makes this nerve very vulnerable in cases where the femur is dislocated postero-medially. If the sciatic nerve was completely paralyzed, the compaments innervated by its two branches: the common fibular and tibial nerves, would lose function. This would mean that the hamstrings and all the muscles of below the knee would lose their innervation. (Luckily, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is very rare). The hip joint is very stable, so it is difficult to dislocate the femur. Most dislocations occur when the hip is flexed and the thigh is adducted. In flexion, the joint capsule is lax, and the femoral head tends to dislocate posteriorly when forces drive the femur posteriorly. This means that the sciatic nerve will be very vulnerable when the femur is dislocated!The other nerves listed in the question are not closely related to the hip joint. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps and is on the anterior of the thigh. The lumbosacral trunk is located in the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductor compament, and is on the anteromedial side of the thigh. Although the superior gluteal nerve innervates muscles near the hip socket (gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae), it would not be damaged by a dislocated hip.",D

These axonal branches should not be confused with dendrites. Pseudounipolar neurons do not have dendrites. Each axon has a peripheral branch (from the cell body to the periphery: skin, joint and muscle) and a central branch (from the cell body to spinal cord)The soma (cell body) of each pseudounipolar neuron is located within a dorsal root ganglion. The axon leaves the cell body (and out of the dorsal root ganglion) into the dorsal root, where it splits into two branches. The central branch goes to the posterior (dorsal) horn of the spinal cord, where it forms synapses with other neurons. The peripheral branch travels through the distal dorsal root into the spinal nerve all the way until skin, joint, and muscle.",A

It originates at the level of L1/2 vertebral body and extends 5-7 cm in the caudocephalad axis.* Thoracic duct originates from the chyle cistern in the abdomen and ascends through the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm. Thoracic duct ascends in the posterior mediastinum among the thoracic aorta on its left, the azygos vein on its right, the esophagus anteriorly, and the vertebral bodies posteriorly. At the level of the T4, T5, or T6 vertebra, the thoracic duct crosses to the left, posterior to the esophagus, and ascends into the superior mediastinum.* NOTE: Although thoracic duct derives from cisterna chyli, it is the thoracic duct that passes through diaphragm and not the cisterna chyli.",D
Division of long thoracic nerve results in,Inability to retract the scapula,Wasting of pectoralis major muscle,Weakness of adduction of humerus,Winging of scapula,"Nerve to serratus anterior is also called long thoracic nerve(C5,C6,C7). A)Serratus anterior muscle along with the pectoralis minor pulls the scapula forwards around the chest wall to protract the upperlimb. B)The fibres inseed into the inferior angle of the scapula pull it forwards and rotate the scapula so that the glenoid cavity is turned upwards.In this action,the serratus anterior is helped by the trapezius which pulls the acromion upwards and backwards. when the muscle is paralyzed,the medial margin of the scapula gets raised specially when 'pushing movements' are attempted.This is called 'winging of scapula'.

The reaction is initiated by entry of an antigen, which is called an allergen because it triggers allergy. Many allergens are environmental substances that are harmless for most persons on exposure. Some people apparently inherit genes that make them susceptible to allergies. This susceptibility is manifested by the propen- sity of such persons to mount strong TH2 responses and, subsequently, to produce IgE antibody against the aller- gens. The IgE is central to the activation of the mast cells and release of mediators that are responsible for the clinical and pathologic manifestations of the reaction. Immediate hypersensitivity may occur as a local reaction that is merely annoying (e.g., seasonal rhinitis, or hay fever), severely debilitating (asthma), or even fatal (anaphylaxis)",A

However these enzymes are structurally and mechanistically different. For a video of this process click here. A type I topoisomerase cuts one strand of a DNA double helix, relaxation occurs, and then the cut strand is re-ligated. Cutting one strand allows the pa of the molecule on one side of the cut to rotate around the uncut strand, thereby reducing stress from too much or too little twist in the helix. Such stress is introduced when the DNA strand is ""supercoiled"" or uncoiled to or from higher orders of coiling. A type II topoisomerase cuts both strands of one DNA double helix, passes another unbroken DNA helix through it, and then re-ligates the cut strands. Type II topoisomerases utilize ATP hydrolysis and are subdivided into two subclasses which possess similar structure and mechanisms: Type IIA topoisomerases which include eukaryotic and eukaryal viral Topoisomerase IIa and Topoisomerase IIb, bacterial gyrase, and topoisomerase IV.

"An unconscious 48-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital. CT scan reveals a tumor in her brain. When she regains consciousness, her right eye is directed laterally and downward, with complete ptosis of her upper eyelid, and her pupil is dilated. Which of the following structures was most likely affected by the tumor to result in these symptoms?",Oculomotor nerve,Optic nerve,Facial nerve,Ciliary ganglion,"An injury to the oculomotor nerve would cause the eye to point downward and laterally due to the unopposed contractions of the trochlear and abducens nerves. The oculomotor nerve also provides innervation to the levator palpebrae superioris; thus, any injury would cause complete ptosis or drooping of the eyelid. The constriction of the pupil is provided by parasympathetic nerves via the oculomotor nerve. The optic nerve is responsible only for the sensory aspect of light via the retina in the eye. The facial nerve innervates the facial muscles, including the orbicularis oculi, which supplies the blink reflex. The ciliary ganglion could be damaged in this patient, but the loss of parasympathetic supply would not adequately explain the ptosis of the eyelid. The superior cervical ganglion provides sympathetic innervation to the head and neck, but no loss of sympathetics is evident in this patient.",A

C: 1, 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (Calcitriol)Calcitriol (1, 25-DHCC) is the biologically active form of vitamin DCalcitriol/ 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol/ 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3It is the hormonally active form of vitamin D with three hydroxyl groups (abbreted 1,25-(OH)2D3 or simply 1, 25 (OH)2D).It increases the level of calcium (Ca2+) in the blood by (1) increasing the uptake of calcium from the gut into the blood, (2) decreasing the transfer of calcium from blood to the urine by the kidney, and (3) increasing the release of calcium into the blood from boneCalcitriol increases blood calcium levels () by promoting absorption of dietary calcium from the gastrointestinal tract and increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium thus reducing the loss of calcium in the urine.Calcitriol also stimulates release of calcium from bone by its action on the osteoblasts, causing them to release RANKL, which in turn activates osteoclasts.Calcitriol acts in conce with parathyroid hormone (PTH) in all three of these roles.For instance, PTH also stimulates osteoclasts.However, the main effect of PTH is to increase the rate at which the kidneys excrete inorganic phosphate (Pi), the counterion of Ca2+.The resulting decrease in serum phosphate causes Ca5 (PO4)30H to dissolve out of bone thus increasing serum calcium.PTH also stimulates the production of calcitriol.Many of the effects of calcitriol are mediated by its interaction with the calcitriol receptor, also called the vitamin D receptor or VDR.The maintenance of electroneutrality requires that the transpo of Ca2+ ions catalyzed by the intestinal epithelial cells be accompanied by counterions, primarily inorganic phosphate.Thus calcitriol also stimulates the intestinal absorption of phosphate.Calcitriol also inhibits the release of calcitonin, a hormone which reduces blood calcium primarily by inhibiting calcium release from bone.Calcitriol is produced in the cells of the proximal tubule of the nephron in the kidneys by the action of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, a mitochondrial oxygenase and an enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol).The activity of the enzyme is stimulated by PTH.The reaction is an impoant control point in Ca2+ homeostasis.The production of calcitriol is also increased by prolactin, a hormone which stimulates lactogenesis, a process which requires large amounts of calcium.",C

The histological feature of shock includes,ATN,Pulmonary congestion,Depletion of lipids in adrenal coex,Hepatic necrosis,"All the four options is the answer Ref Robbins 7/e p142,9/e p134 Shock is characterized by failure of multiple organ systems.due to systemic hypoperfusioncaused by reduced cardiac output Or ineffective circulatory blood volume The cellular and tissue effects of shock are essentially those of hypoxic injury (Chapter 1) and are caused by a combina- tion of hypoperfusion and microvascular thrombosis. Although any organ can be affected, brain, hea, kidneys, adrenals, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly involved. Fibrin thrombi can form in any tissue but typically are most readily visualized in kidney glomeruli. Adrenal cor- tical cell lipid depletion is akin to that seen in all forms of stress and reflects increased utilization of stored lipids for steroid synthesis. While the lungs are resistant to hypoxic injury in hypovolemic shock occurring after hemorrhage, sepsis or trauma can precipitate diffuse alveolar damage (Chapter 12), leading to so-called shock lung.

Sacrococcgeal teratoma arises from ?,Primitive streak,Neural plate,Cloacal membrane,Posterior neuropore,"The cause of sacrococcygeal teratomas is unknown. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are germ cell tumors. Germ cells are the cells that develop into the embryo and later on become the cells that make up the reproductive system of men and women. Most germ cell tumors occur in the testes or ovaries (gonads) or the lower back. When these tumors occur outside of the gonads, they are known as extragonadal tumors. Researchers do not know how extragonadal germ cell tumors form. One theory suggests that germ cells accidentally migrate during to unusual locations early during the development of the embryo (embryogenesis). Normally, such misplaced germ cells degenerate and die, but in cases of extragonadal teratomas researchers speculate that these cells continue to undergo mitosis, the process where cells divide and multiply, eventually forming a teratoma. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are thought to arise from an area under the coccyx called ""Henson's Node"". This is an area where primitive cells persist (germ cells) that can give rise to cells of the three major tissue layers of an embryo: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm. These embryonic layers eventually give rise to the various cells and structures of the body. Sacrococcygeal teratomas can contain mature tissue that looks like any tissue in the body, or immature tissue resembling embryonic tissues. Ref- <a href=""",A

"A chronic alcoholic presents with repeated episodes of severe intractable abdominal pain. At evaluation, the pancreatic duct was found to be dilated and stones were noted in the tail of the pancreas. The most appropriate management is:",Pancreatic Tail Resection,Pancreatico Jejunostomy,Percutaneous removal of stone,Medical management,"Here this patient is presenting with repeated attacks of severe intractable pain, thus he is a candidate for surgical intervention. Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy with side-to-side anastomosis is the most suitable surgical option for this patient. (As his ductal system is dilated, a drainage procedure would be helpful) Surgical options for Chronic pancreatitis Drainage procedures Drainage procedures for patients with small ducts Patients with small (< 4-6 mm) pancreatic ducts, but in whom pancreatitis is caused by obstruction at the ampullary level, may benefit from transduodenal sphincteroplasty of the CBD with the division of the septum that lies between the MPD & CBD (pancreatic septectomy). However, most patients with chronic pancreatitis have multiple areas of duct stricture throughout the pancreas and are unlikely to benefit from these transduodenal procedures. Drainage procedures for patients with dilated ducts. A dilated duct system reflects obstruction. Thus the ideal treatment for these patients with dilated ducts is creating an anastomotic connection between the dilated ducts and the intestinal lumen. Longitudinal pancreatico jejunostomy (Puestow procedure) is the most commonly used drainage procedure. Entire pancreatic duct is longitudinally opened and anastomosed side to side to a Roux-en-Y segment of jejunum. Pancreatectomy Painful chronic pancreatitis can be treated with resection of the body and tail of the pancreas (distal pancreatectomy), resection of the head and uncinate process (Whipple procedure), subtotal pancreatectomy that spares a rim of the pancreas along with the inner curve of the duodenum, or total pancreatectomy. Many surgeons believe that it is the inflammatory process in the head of the pancreas that controls both the severity of the symptoms and fuher progression of the disease in the remaining gland. Resection of the pancreatic head can be achieved by Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) or its pylorus preserving modification or duodenum preserving pancreatic head resection. A good no. of pts. (70-80%) are completely relieved of pain. Distal pancreatectomy is the ideal surgical procedure for patients whose disease is confined to the pancreatic tail. Total or near total pancreatectomy is indicated in patients in whom a previous operative procedure like distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy has failed to control pain. However, its role is not clear, as several patients even after total pancreatectomy continues to experience severe pancreatic pain. Celiac plexus block Celiac plexus nerve blocks performed either percutaneously or endoscopically have been employed to relieve chronic pancreatic pain with inconsistent results. A newer and more effective variant of this approach is thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy - resection of the segments of the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves as they enter the thorax from the abdomen.

Which of these is not true about Cardio esophageal sphincter?,An anatomic sphincter can be found,Located at 40 cm from incisors,It has a pinch cock like mechanism,It has a flap valve mechanism,"ANSWER: (A) An anatomic sphincter can be foundREF: Gray's anatomy 40th ed ch: 71GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION : The upper esophageal sphincter (UES ) and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) mark the entrance and exit to the esophagus, respectively.These sphincters are defined by a high-pressure zone but can be difficult to identify anatomically. The UES corresponds reliably to the cricopharvngeus muscle, but the LES is more complex to discern. The opening from the oesophagus into the stomach is the cardiac orifice It is typically situated to the left of the midline behind the seventh costal cartilage at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. It is 10 cm from the anterior abdominal wall and 40 cm from the incisor teeth. The short abdominal part of the oesophagus curves sharply to the left as it descends and is continuous with the cardiac orifice. The right side of the oesophagus is continuous with the lesser curvature, the left side with the greater curvature. There is no specific anatomical cardiac sphincter related to the orificeThere are four anatomic points that identify the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ): two endoscopic and two external. Endoscopically, there are two anatomic considerations that may be used to identify the GEJ. The squamocolumnar epithelial junction (Z-Iine) may mark the GEJ provided the patient does not have a distal esophagus replaced by columnar-lined epithelium as seen with Barretts esophagus. The transition from the smooth esophageal lining to the rugal folds of the stomach may also accurately identify the GEJ. Externally, the collar of Helvetius (or loop of Willis), where the circular muscular fibers of the esophagus join the oblique fibers of the stomach, and the gastroesophageal fat pad are consistent identifiers of the GEJUnlike the rest of the esophagus, the musculature of the gastroesophageal junction (lower esophageal sphincter; LES) is tonicaily active but relaxes on swallowing. The tonic activity of the LES between meals prevents reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. The LES is made up of three components. The esophageal smooth muscle is more prominent at the junction with the stomach (intrinsic sphincter). Fibers of the crural portion of the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle, surround the esophagus at this point (extrinsic sphincter) and exert a pinchcock-like action on the esophagus. In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises.Several anatomical and physiological factors normally prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux.The folds of gastric mucosa present in the gastro-oesophageal junctionThe mucosal rosette, contribute to the formation of a fiuid-and gas-tight seal. They also help to ensure that even low levels of tone within the lower oesophageal wall muscles may occlude the lumen of the junction against low pressures of gastric gas.The angle of the cardiac orifice may help to form a type of 'flap valve' and the length of abdominal oesophagus is buttressed externally by pads of adipose connective tissue at and below the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus.However, the major anti-reflux mechanism is the tonic contractions of the lower oesophageal musculature, which forms an effective high pressure zone (HPZ).The specialized smooth muscle of the wall of the lower oesophagus and the encircling fibres of the crural diaphragm exert a radial pressure that can be measured by a sensing device as it is withdrawn from the stomach into the oesophagus. If reflux is to be prevented, this pressure must always exceed the difference between the pressures on either side of the junction, i.e. the difference between intra-abdominal pressure (transferred to the stomach, and augmented by any contraction of the stomach wTall itself), and intrathoracic pressure (transferred to the oesophagus).",A

Ligament resisting hyperextension of hip are all except:,Ischiofemoral ligament,Pubofemoral ligament,Iliofemoral ligament,Sacroiliac ligament,"Ans. D: Sacroiliac ligament When the knee is flexed, flexion is limited by the anterior surface of the thigh coming into contact with the anterior abdominal wall. When the knee is extended, flexion is limited by the tension of the hamstring group of muscles. Extension, which is the movement of the flexed thigh backward to the anatomic position, is limited by the tension of the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral ligaments. Abduction is limited by the tension of the pubofemoral ligament, and adduction is limited by contact with the opposite limb and by the tension in the ligament of the head of the femur. Lateral rotation is limited by the tension in the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments, and medial rotation is limited by the ischiofemoral ligament. The following movements take place: Flexion is performed by the iliopsoas, rectus femoris, and saorius and also by the adductor muscles. Extension (a backward movement of the flexed thigh) is performed by the gluteus maximus and the hamstring muscles. Abduction is performed by the gluteus medius and minimus, assisted by the saorius, tensor fasciae latae and piriformis. Adduction is performed by the adductor longus and brevis and the adductor fibers of the adductor magnus. These muscles are assisted by the pectineus and the gracilis.

Intrinsic muscles of the tongue are derived from,"2 ""d branchial cleft",Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme,Occipital somites,Cervical somites,"occipital somites Most of the tongue muscles are derived from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital somites.Embryological Origin of the TongueThe tongue's embryonic orgin is derived from first 4 pharyngeal arches contributing different components.Anterior 2/3"" or body of tongue: is derived from 3 lingual buds- the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar) and 2 lateral lingual swellings developing at each side of the median tongue bud. All arising from the la pharyngeal arch. The lateral tongue buds rapidly increase in size, merge with each other, and overgrow the median tongue bud. The merged distal tongue buds form the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue. The median tongue bud forms no recognizable pa of the adult tongue. Since the mucosa covering the ant. 2/3rd of the tongue originates from the first pharyngeal arch; sensory innervation to this area is by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. (Taste sensation to the anterior 2/3rd of the tongue is provided by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve).Post 1/3"" or root of the tongue: is formed from two median elevations;- The copula arising from the 2""d pair of branchial arches, just caudal to the foramen ceacum.- The hypopharyngeal or hypobranchial eminence developing caudal to the copula from the 3rd and dh pair of arches.As the tongue develops the copula is gradually overgrown by the hypopharyngeal eminence and disappears. As a result, the post pa of the tongue develops from the hypopharyngeal eminence( the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches) . Thus the sensory nerve supply to this pa of tongue is from the glossopharyngeal nerve.(taste sensation is also carried by the glossopharyngeal nerve).Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme forms the connective tissue and vasculature of the tongue. Some of the tongue muscles probably develop in situ from mesenchyme, but most develop from myoblasts that migrate from the occipital myotomes. The hypoglossal nerve accompanies the myoblasts during their migration and innervates the tongue muscles.The Nerve Supply of the Tonguea. Motor nerve- All the intrinsic & extrinsic muscles, except the palatoglossus, are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve. The palatoglossus is supplied by the cranial pa of the accessory nerve through the pharyngeal plexus.b.

Feilized orum reaches the uterus,3-4 days,6-8 days,10-12 days,12-14 days,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 3-4 days Feilized ovum (zygote) reaches the uterus in morula stage, 4 days after feilization.Feilization and implantation Feilization refers to fusion of male and female gametes (i.e. spermatozoon and ovum). It takes place in the middle segment (ampulla) of fallopian tube. Before feilization, the ovum and sperms reach the ampulla for feilization. Fusion of spermatocyte and ovum leads to formation of zygote. First week of development begins immediately after feilization and includes :?Cleavage of zygote : Zygote (feilized ovum) stas dividing immediately and large zygote is subdivided into smaller daughter cells called blastomeres. Blastomeres are still surrounded by zona pellucida. Cleavage occurs in fallopian tube (uterine tube).Formation of morula : At about 16 cells stage the blastomeres tightly align by the process of compaction to form a compact ball of cells called morula (mulberry). This process of compaction leads to segregation of cells into two groups (i) inner cells (inner cell mass), and (ii) outer cells (outer cell mass). Morula enters uterine cavity 4 days after feilization.Formation of blastocyst : As the morula enters the uterine cavity, uterine fluid diffuses through zona pellucida and fills small intercellular gaps between blastomeres, and morula is conveed to blastocyst. Blastocyst consists of :?Zona pellucida : Outer covering.Embryoblast : A group of centerally located cells of inner cell mass and later give rise to tissues of embryo proper.Trophoblast : A thin outer layer of cells formed from outer cells mass and later give rise extraembryonic tissues.Blastocele : Cavity of blastocyst :The region of blastocyst containing embryoblast is known as embryonic pole and the opposite pole, the abembryonic pole. The trophoblasts overlying the embryoblast at embryonic pole is called polar trophoblast and that occupying the rest of wall called mural trophoblast. Between 5-6 days after feilization, blastocyst hatches from zona pellucida, and this naked blastocyst is ready for implantation.Implantation : About 6-7 days after feilization the blastocyst attaches to the endometrium, a process called as implantation or embedding. Normal site of implantation is posterior wall of the body of uterus close to fundus (at junction offundus with body).",A

In acute inflammation endothelial retraction leads to,Delayed transient increase in permeability,Immediate transient increase in permeability,Delayed prolonged increase in permeability,Immediate transient decrease in permeability,"ref Robbins 8/e p45,9/ep74 Several mechanisms may contribute to increased vascu- lar permeability in acute inflammatory reactions: * Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial cell con- traction occurs rapidly after binding of histamine, bra- dykinin, leukotrienes, and many other mediators to specific receptors, and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskel- eton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necro- sis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This reaction may take 4 to 6 hours to develop after the initial trigger and persist for 24 hours or more. * Endothelial injury results in vascular leakage by causing endothelial cell necrosis and detachment. Endothelial cells are damaged after severe injury such as with burns and some infections. In most cases, leakage begins immediately after the injury and persists for several hours (or days) until the damaged vessels are throm- bosed or repaired. Venules, capillaries, and aerioles can all be affected, depending on the site of the injury. Direct injury to endothelial cells may also induce a delayed prolonged leakage that begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days, and involves venules and capillaries. Examples are mild to moderate thermal injury, ceain bacterial toxins, and x- or ultraviolet irradiation (i.e., the sunburn that has spoiled many an evening after a day in the sun). Endo- thelial cells may also be damaged as a consequence of leukocyte accumulation along the vessel wall. Activated leukocytes release many toxic mediators, discussed later, that may cause endothelial injury or detachment.",C

The enlargement of the gland is usually symmetric and diffuse, but in some cases it may be sufficiently localized to raise the suspicion of a neoplasm. In the usual case, hypothyroidism develops gradually. In some patients, however, it may be preceded by transient thyrotoxicosis caused by disruption of thyroid follicles, leading to release of thyroid hormones (""hashitoxicosis""). During this phase, free T4 and T3 levels are elevated, TSH is diminished, and radioactive iodine uptake is decreased.

Folate trap occurs due to the deficiency of,Thiamine,Biotin,Folic acid,vitamin B12,"The conversion of 5,10-methylene-THF into 5-methyl-THF is irreversible. The only way to make fuher use of 5-methyl-THF and to maintain the folate cycle is by the vitamin B12-dependent remethylation of homocysteine to methionine (regenerating THF). The methyl group transfer is therefore greatly dependent on 5-methylTHF and the availability of Vitamin-B12. In cases of vitamin-B12 deficiency, an intracellular deficiency of biologically active THF arises as methyl-THF is not conveed to THF and the folate gets trapped as methyl-THF. This situation is called a 'folate trap' (or methyl group trap). Reference: Harpers illustrated biochemistry 30th edition",D

True about screening mammography is,Indicated in 50-60 years of age,Radiation due to mammography can cause carcinoma,MRI is better than mammography,USG is better than mammography,"Mammography Soft tissue radiographs are taken by placing the breast in direct contact with ultrasensitive film and exposing it to low-voltage, high-amperage x-rays . The dose of radiation is approximately 0.1 cGy and, therefore, mammography is a very safe investigation. The sensitivity of this investigation increases with age as the breast becomes less dense. In total, 5% of breast cancers are missed by population-based mammographic screening programmes; even in retrospect, such carcinomas are not apparent. Thus, a normal mammogram does not exclude the presence of carcinoma. Digital mammography is being introduced, which allows manipulation of the images and computer-aided diagnosis. Tomo-mammography is also being assessed as a more sensitive diagnostic modality. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pg no : 864",A

CLINICAL ANATOMY

Hypertrophy or enlargement of the nasopharyngeal tonsil or adenoids may obstruct the posterior nasal aperture and may interfere with nasal respiration and speech leading to mouth breathing. These tonsils usually regress by puberty.
Hypertrophy of the tubal tonsil may occlude the auditory or pharyngotympanic tube leading to middle ear problems.

Waldeyers tonsillar ring has:-

Adenoid tonsil (or nasopharyngeal tonsils) – in nasopharynx
Two palatine tonsils (or simply tonsils) – in oropharynx b/w palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches

There are 3 muscles that attach to the coracoid process of the scapula- the short head of the biceps, the pectoralis minor, and the coracobrachialis. All 3 can have an affect on the brachial plexus. The least known of the 3 is the coracobrachialis (CB). The CB flexes and adducts the humerus. The musculotaneous nerve, a branch of the brachial plexus, passes right through it. Therefore, if the CB is overly tight, that nerve can become impinged and send pain to the lower arm.

Basic pathology in cystic fibrosis is,Defect in the transpoation of chloride across epithelia,Defect in transpo of sodium across epithelia,Defect in transpo of potassium across epithelia,Defect in transpo of bicarbonate across epithelia,"Ref Robbins 9/e p222 Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the lungs, pancreas, intestines, sweat ducts and liver, due to an abnormal salt transpo across the apical border of epithelial cells. Mutations in the CF underlying gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, result in most cell types in an misprocessing so that little of the protein reaches the membranes. In case of clinical suspicion and/or doubtful sweat test results, mutation analysis can suppo the diagnosis of CF. Also carrier detection is offered. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY CF is caused by a mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The CFTR protein produced by this gene regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial cell membranes.Figure 1).Pseudomonas, Haemophilus influenza, and Staphylococcus aureus. These pathogens cause an overwhelming inflammatory response. Ultimately, chronic infection and this repetitive inflammatory response can lead to airway destruction.CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It is caused by the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. When the CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing.

"All of the following are observed in acute inflammation, except",Vasodilation,Stasis of blood,Increase in vascular permeability,Decreased in hydrostatic pressure,"Ref Robbins 7/e p50-51..9/e p73-74 The acute inflammatory response rapidly delivers leuko- cytes and plasma proteins to sites of injury. Once there, leukocytes clear the invaders and begin the process of digesting and getting rid of necrotic tissues. Acute inflammation has two major components (Fig. 2-2): * Vascular changes: alterations in vessel caliber resulting in increased blood flow (vasodilation) and changes in the vessel wall that permit plasma proteins to leave the cir- culation (increased vascular permeability). In addition, endothelial cells are activated, resulting in increased adhesion of leukocytes and migration of the leukocytes through the vessel wall. * Cellular events: emigration of the leukocytes from the circulation and accumulation in the focus of injury (cel- lular recruitment), followed by activation of the leuko- cytes, enabling them to eliminate the offending agent. The principal leukocytes in acute inflammation are neu- trophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes). Stimuli for Acute Inflammation Acute inflammatory reactions may be triggered by a variety of stimuli: * Infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic) are among the most common and medically impoant causes of inflammation. * Trauma (blunt and penetrating) and various physical and chemical agents (e.g., thermal injury, such as burns or frostbite; irradiation; toxicity from ceain environ- mental chemicals) injure host cells and elicit inflamma- tory reactions. * Tissue necrosis (from any cause), including ischemia (as in a myocardial infarct) and physical and chemical injury * Foreign bodies (splinters, di, sutures, crystal deposits) Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity reactions) against environmental substances or against ""self"" tissues. Because the stimuli for these inflammatory responses often cannot be eliminated or avoided, such reactions tend to persist, with features of chronic inflam- mation. The term ""immune-mediated inflammatory disease"" is sometimes used to refer to this group of disorders. Although each of these stimuli may induce reactions with some distinctive characteristics, in general, all inflamma- tory reactions have the same basic features. In this section, we describe first how inflammatory stimuli are recognized by the host, then the typical reac- tions of acute inflammation and its morphologic features, and finally the chemical mediators responsible for these reaction",D

The gold standard test for insulinoma,72 hr fasting test,Plasma insulin levels,C-peptide levels,Low glucose levels < 30 mg/dl,"""The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, C-peptide, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h."" --Harrison An insulinoma is an endocrine tumor of the pancreas derived from beta cells that ectopically secretes insulin, which results in hypoglycemia. The clinical symptoms are because of the effects of hypoglycaemia (sweating, tremor, palpitations, confusion, headache, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, or even coma) The diagnosis of insulinoma requires the demonstration of an elevated plasma insulin level at the time of hypoglycemia. This is because insulinomas do not reduce the secretion of insulin in the presence of hypoglycaemia. Whereas in a normal person, insulin levels would decrease with a decrease in blood glucose levels. The most reliable test to diagnose insulinoma is a fast up to 72 h with serum glucose, and insulin measurements every 4-8 h. The test is terminated if the patient becomes symptomatic or glucose levels are <40 mg/dL (2.2 mmol/L). Diagnosis of insulinoma is made if: A serum insulin level of 6 microunit/mL or more in the presence of blood glucose values below 40 mg/dL the ratio of plasma insulin to glucose is > 0.3 In addition to the above criteria, some other measurements are also required before making the diagnosis of insulinoma C-peptide level serum proinsulin level, serum sulfonylurea levels These additional tests are used because any hidden use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics taken by the patient would resemble insulinoma causing high levels of insulin in presence of hypoglycaemia. The combination of elevated proinsulin levels (normal in exogenous insulin/hypoglycemic agent users), elevated C-peptide levels (low in exogenous insulin users), antibodies to insulin (positive in exogenous insulin users), and measurement of sulfonylurea levels in serum or plasma will allow the correct diagnosis to be made.

Cardiac dominance is determined by coronary aery:,Supplying circulation to the SA node,Supplying circulation to the inferior poion of the interventricular septum,Supplying circulation to the interatrial septum,Supplying circulation to the anterior poion of the interventricular septum,"In 85% of patients the right coronary aery (RCA) is said to be ""dominant"" because it supplies circulation to the inferior poion of the interventricular septum the right posterior descending coronary aery/posterior interventricular aery.In these cases the RCA travels to the cross-section of the AV groove and the posterior interventricular (IV groove). Here, it gives rise to the right posterior descending coronary aery (PDA) branch which travels in the posterior IV groove and gives off several septal perforator branches (SP). The SP supply blood to the lower poion of the IV septum. Generally, the dominant RCA also gives rise to the AV nodal branch which supplies blood to the AV nodeThe dominant RCA also provides the right postero-lateral (PLA) branch to the lower postero-lateral poion of the left ventricle.The sinus or sino-atrial (SA) node branch originates in the proximal poion of the RCA in 60% of cases and as a left atrial branch of the Cx in the remaining 40% of cases.

Characteristics of SLE of kidney is,Focal sclerosis,Focal necrosis,Wire loop lesion,Diffused glomerulosclerosis,"Ref Robbins 9/e p224 Kidneys. Kidney involvement is one of the most impoant clinical features of SLE, with renal failure being the most common cause of death. The focus here is on glomerular pathology, although interstitial and tubular lesions are also seen in SLE. The pathogenesis of all forms of glomerulonephritis in SLE involves deposition of DNA-anti-DNA complexes within the glomeruli. These evoke an inflammatory response that may cause proliferation of the endothelial, mesangial, and/or epithelial cells and, in severe cases, necrosis of the glomeruli. Although the kidney appears normal by light microscopy in 25% to 30% of cases, almost all cases of SLE show some renal abnormality if examined by immuno- fluorescence and electron microscopy. According to the current International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathol- ogy Society morphologic classification, there are six patterns of glomerular disease in SLE (none of which is specific to the disease): class I, minimal mesangial lupus nephritis; class II, mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis; class III, focal lupus nephritis; class IV, diffuse lupus nephritis; class V, membra- nous lupus nephritis; and class VI, advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis. * Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I) is rarely encountered in renal biopsies. Immune complexes are present in the mesangium, but there are no concomitant structural alterations detectable by light microscopy. * Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis (class II) is seen in 10% to 25% of cases and is associated with mild clinical symptoms. Immune complexes deposit in the mesangium, with a mild to moderate increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity. * Focal lupus nephritis (class III) is seen in 20% to 35% of cases. Lesions are visualized in fewer than half the glomeruli, and they may be segmentally or globally distrib- uted within each glomerulus. Active lesions are character- ized by swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, infiltration by neutrophils, and/or fibrinoid deposits with capillary thrombi (Fig. 4-18, A). The clinical presentation may range from only mild microscopic hema- turia and proteinuria to a more active urinary sediment with red blood cell casts and acute, severe renal insufficiency. * Diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) is the most serious form of renal lesions in SLE and is also the most commonly encountered in renal biopsies, occurring in 35% to 60% of patients. It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid ""wire loops"" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C). Electron microscopy reveals prominent electron-dense subendo- thelial immune complexes (between endothelium and basement membrane) (Fig. 4-18, D), but immune com- plexes are also usually present in other pas of the capil- lary wall and in the mesangium. Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, result- ing in a granular fluorescent staining pattern (Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, glomerular injury may give rise to scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Most affected patients have hematu- ria with moderate to severe proteinuria, hypeension, and renal insufficiency. * Membranous lupus nephritis (class V) occurs in 10% to 15% of cases and is the designation for glomerular disease characterized by widespread thickening of the capillary wall due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes. Membranous glomerulonephritis associated with SLE is very similar to that encountered in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (Chapter 13). Thickening of capillary walls is caused by increased deposition of base- ment membrane-like material, as well as accumulation of immune complexes. Patients with this histologic change almost always have severe proteinuria with ove nephrotic syndrome (Chapter 13). * Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis (class VI) is characterized by complete sclerosis of greater than 90% of glomeruli and corresponds to clinical end stage renal disease.",C
Oxygen comes from alveoli to blood by ?,Diffusion,Receptor mediated,Active transpo,Osmosis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Diffusion Oxygen is transferred from the alveoli to the pulmonary capillaries by the process of diffusion. The diffusion occurs across the respiratory membrane. As oxygen diffuses into the blood, it combines with hemoglobin. However, the oxygen, in combination with hemoglobin, does not contribute to the PO2 of blood. Therefore the alveolar - capillary gradient of PO2 is maintained much longer than it would be if hemoglobin were not present. The sequence mey be visualized as follows:- i) Oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the plasma due to the PO2 gradient. ii) To sta with, the PO2 in the RBC fluids is the same as in the plasma. As soon as diffusion from the alveoli to plasma raises the PO2 of plasma above that of the RBC fluids, oxygen diffuses from the plasma into the RBC. iii) As soon as oxygen enters the RBC, it combines with hemoglobin, which mops up oxygen but does not let PO2 rise. The process continues till hemoglobin cannot pick up any more oxygen. iv) Then the PO2 in the RBC fluids rises to equal that in the plasma and diffusion from the plasma to RBC stops. v) After that the PO2 in the plasma also rises to equal that in the alveoli, and consequently diffusion from the alveoli to the plasma stops. Thus, the presence of hemoglobin makes an enormous difference to the amount of oxygen transferred. By mopping up oxygen without letting the PO2 rise, it lets the diffusion of oxygen continue much longer. While the PO2 gradient determines the direction of diffusion of oxygen, it is actually hemoglobin that lays the trap for carrying large amounts of oxygen in the blood.",A

Heinrich kluver and Paul Bucy first described the syndrome in 1937 after experimental work where they removed rhesus monkey's temporal lobes. They found that the monkeys developed.1) Visual agnosia : they could see, but were unable to recognise familiar objects or their use.2) Oral tendencies : they would examine their surroundings with their mouths instead of their eyes.3) Hypermetamorphosis : a desire to explore everything.4) Emotional changes : emotion was dulled and facial movements and vocalisations were far less expressive. They lost fear where it would normally occur. Even after being attacked by a snake, they would casually approach it again. This was called ""placidity"".5) Hypersexuality : a dramatic inc rease in ove sexual behaviour, including masturbation, and homosexual and heterosexual acts. They may even attempt copulation with inanimate objects.The syndrome in humans is due to bilateral destruction of the amygdaloid body and inferior temporal coex, most commonly due to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). It shares visual agnosia and loss of normal fear and anger responses in common with the monkey model but one also seen loss of memory with dementia, distractibility and seizures. The hypersexuality tends to be less ove than in the monkeys but may be public and unacceptable.",C

True regarding chronic pancreatitis is,Autosomal recessive disorder,Caused by mutation of cationic trypsinogen gene,Accounts for about 30 % of cases,IgG concentrations are elevated,"Hereditary Pancreatitis Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disorder usually related to mutations of the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1). Mutations in this gene cause premature activation of trypsinogen to trypsin and cause abnormalities of ductal secre- tion, both of which promote acute pancreatitis. Mutations in the SPINK1 protein, which blocks the active binding site of trypsin, is also likely to have a role in predisposing to acute pancreatitis. Variations in penetration and phenotype are common and there are many other mutations that may become implicated. Mutant enzymes activated within acinar cells can overwhelm the first line of defense (pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor) and resist backup defenses (e.g., proteolytic degradation, enzyme Y, and trypsin itself) allowing activated mutant cationic trypsin to trig- ger the entire zymogen activation cascade.32 Ref: schwaz's principle of surgery 10th edition Pg no :1352",B

Iron absorption is increased in all except,Iron deficiency,Pregnancy,Alkaline pH of stomach,Ferrous iron salts,"Ref Harrison 19 th ed pg 626 The first stage is negative iron balance, in which the demands for (or losses of) iron exceed the body's ability to absorb iron from the diet. This stage results from a number of physiologic mecha- nisms, including blood loss, pregnancy (in which the demands for red cell production by the fetus outstrip the mother's ability to provide iron), rapid growth spus in the adolescent, or inadequate dietary iron intake. Blood loss in excess of 10-20 mL of red cells per day is greater than the amount of iron that the gut can absorb from a normal diet. Under these circumstances, the iron deficit must be made up by mobilization of iron from RE storage sites. During this period, iron stores--reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stain- able iron on bone marrow aspirations--decrease. As long as iron stores are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within nor- mal limits. At this stage, red cell morphology and indices are normal.",C

Venous flow in the lower limb veins in the standing position depends upon all except:,Aerial blood pressure,Presence of deep facial planes,Compression of calf muscles,Presence of perforators,"A i.e. Aerial blood pressure- In standing position, venous return from the lower limb depends largely on muscular activity, especially contraction of calf and foot muscles, known as muscle pump, whose efficiency is aided by the tight sleeve of deep fascia and valves in perforating veins- In standing position, venous return from leg depends largely on the muscular activity of the triceps surae. The efficiency of calf pump is improved by the deep fascia that invests the muscle like an elastic stocking. The blood is prevented from flowing back in superficial veins by presence of valves in perforating veins. If valves become incompetent the blood is forced into superficial veins during calf muscle contraction and by hydrostatic pressure (of blood column) when straining of standing and these veins become high pressure leaks during muscle contraction leading to varicosity .- Within the closed fascial compament, thin walled, valved deep veins are subjected to intermittent pressure. The pulsation of adjacent aeries and contraction of large muscles within the compament compress these deep veins and force the blood up in limb. Presence of valves in perforating veins prevent backward flowing of blood from high pressure deep veins to low pressure superficial veins. More over as the muscles in closed deep fascial compament relax, venous blood is sucked from superficial into deep veins. - So by this time it must be very clear that venous return in lower limb is dependent on muscle pump, deep fascia, valves in perforators, and pulsation of adjacent aeriesQ- Blood flow in blood vessels including veins is primarily because of pumping action of hea. However, venous flow is aided by hea beat (in great veins draining into atrium), the increase in negative intrathoracic pressure (especially in great veins, intrathoracic & intraabdominal veins), and muscle pump (lower limb veins).",A

FA cells show chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C. Recent studies indicate that there are at least 8 genetically distinct FA groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G). To date, 6 genes (for A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been cloned. In this review, we describe the structures and functions of FA proteins. Increasing evidence indicates that the multiple FA proteins cooperate in a biochemical pathway and/or a multimer complex. FANCD2, a downstream component of the FA pathway, has recently been shown to be ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and to translocate to nuclear foci containing BRCA1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product, suggesting a role for this protein in DNA repair functions. We also describe 2 emerging issues: genotype-phenotype relationships and mosaicism. The FA pathway is likely to play a critical role as a caretaker of genomic integrity in hematopoietic stem cells. Clarifying the molecular basis of this disease may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure syndromes and myeloid malignancies.",B

CN VII innervates the anterior tongue and all of the soft palate, CN IX innervates the posterior tongue, and CN X innervates the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, the larynx, and the proximal portion of the esophagus. The mandibular branch of CN V (V3) conveys somatosensory information (e.g., touch, burning, cooling, irritation) to the brain. Although not technically a gustatory nerve, CN V shares primary nerve routes with many of the gustatory nerve fibers and adds temperature, texture, pungency, and spiciness to the taste experience. The chorda tympani nerve is notable for taking a recurrent course through the facial canal in the petrosal portion of the temporal bone, passing through the middle ear, then exiting the skull via the petrotympanic fissure, where it joins the lingual nerve (a division of CN V) near the tongue. This nerve also carries parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublingual glands, whereas the greater petrosal nerve supplies the palatine glands, thereby influencing saliva production.",A

Acanthocytes are seen in,Abetalipoproteinemia,Hanup disease,Whipple disease,None,"Ref, Tejinder Singh 1/e p38 Abetalipoproteinemia is an autosomal recessive disease char- acterized by an inability to secrete triglyceride-rich lipo- proteins. Although it is rare, it is included here as an example of a transepithelial transpo defect that leads to malabsorption. Mutation in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein renders enterocytes unable to expo lipo- proteins and free fatty acids. As a result, monoglycerides and triglycerides accumulate within the epithelial cells. Lipid vacuoles in small intestinal epithelial cells are evident by light microscopy and can be highlighted by special stains, such as oil red O, paicularly after a fatty meal. Abetalipoproteinemia manifests in infancy, and the clinical picture is dominated by failure to thrive, diarrhea, and steatorrhea. Failure to absorb essential fatty acids leads to deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, and lipid defects in plasma membranes often produce acanthocytic red cells (spur cells) in peripheral blood smears.",A

In Apoptosis intiation,The death receptors induce Apoptosis when they get engaged by fas ligand system,Cytochrome C inhibits Apoptosis activating factor,Apoptosis may be intiated by capase activation,Apoptosis mediated through DNA damage,"Ref Robbins 9/e p56 The Death Receptor (Extrinsic) Pathway of Apoptosis Many cells express surface molecules, called death recep- tors, that trigger apoptosis. Most of these are members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, which contain in their cytoplasmic regions a conserved ""death domain,"" so named because it mediates interaction with other proteins involved in cell death. The prototypic death receptors are the type I TNF receptor and Fas (CD95). Fas ligand (FasL) is a membrane protein expressed mainly on activated T lymphocytes. When these T cells recognize Fas-expressing targets, Fas molecules are cross-linked by FasL and bind adaptor proteins the death domain. These in turn recruit and activate caspase-8. In many cell types caspase-8 may cleave and activate a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family called Bid, thus feeding into the mitochondrial pathway. The combined activation of both pathways delivers a lethal blow to the cell. Cellular proteins, notably a caspase antagonist called FLIP, block activation of caspases downstream of death receptors. Interestingly, some viruses produce homologues of FLIP, and it is suggested that this is a mechanism that viruses use to keep infected cells alive. The death receptor pathway is involved in elimination of self-reactive lympho- cytes and in killing of target cells by some cytotoxic T lymphocytes.",A

What ligament is most likely injured?",Calcaneofibular ligament,Deltoid ligament,Spring ligament,Plantar ligament,"Pott's fracture is a rather archaic term for a fracture of the fibula at the ankle. The term is often used to indicate a bimalleolar fracture of fibula and tibia, perhaps with a tear in the medial collateral ligament, allowing the foot to be deviated laterally. (The medial malleolus will often break before the deltoid ligament tears.) This fracture is also known as Dupuytren's fracture. The fracture results from abduction and lateral rotation of the foot in extreme eversion. There can also be breaking of the posterior aspect of the distal tibia. The spring ligament, also known as the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, extends from the calcaneus to the navicular bone and is a part of the medial longitudinal arch. This ligament would not be affected in eversion or inversion of the ankle. The plantar ligament, which is composed of the long and short plantar ligaments, supports the lateral longitudinal arch of the foot and would therefore not be affected by inversion or eversion of the foot. The calcaneofibular ligament runs from the calcaneus to the fibula. It would be injured during inversion of the foot, not in eversion, as is the case in a Pott fracture.",B

The spinal cord receives its blood supply from three longitudinal arterial channels that extend along the length of the spinal corda) The anterior spinal artery is presemt in relation to the anterior median fissure.b) Two posterior spinal arteries ( one of each side) run along the posterolateral sulcus (i.e., along the line of attachment of the dorsal nerve roots.)c) In addition to these channels the pia mater covering the spinal cord has an arterial plexus (called the arterial vasocorona) which also sends branches into the substance of the cord.2. The main source of blood to the spinal cord is from the vertebral arteries (form which the anterior and posterior spinal arteries take origin)a) However, the blood from the vertebral artery reaches only up the cervical segments of the cord.b) Lower down the spinal cord receive blood through radicular arteries that reach the cord along the roots of spinal nerves. These radicular arteries arise form spinal branches of the vertebral, ascending cervical, deep cervical, intertcostal, lumbar and sacral arteriesc) Many of these radicular arteries are small and end by supplying the nerve roots.d) A few of them, which are larger, join the spinal arteries and contribute blood to them.",C

The induced mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) can transform into lymphoma. Peptic ulcer disease can be caused by H. pylori chronic gastritis and the resultant hyperchlorhydria or NSAID use. Ulcers can develop in the stomach or duodenum and usually heal after suppression of gastric acid production and, if present, eradication of the H. pylori. H. pylori: Chronic gastritis, most commonly due to H. pylori infection, promotes the development and progres- sion of cancers that may be induced by diverse genetic alterations (Chapter 5). As is the case with many forms of chronic inflammation, H. pylori-induced chronic gastritis is associated with increased production of proinflamma- tory proteins, such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). It is therefore not surprising that polymorphisms associated with enhanced production of these cytokines confer increased risk of chronic gastritis- associated intestinal-type gastric cancer in those with co- existing H. pylori infection.",D

Features x Pain and boggy swelling in frontal region which is warm, tender. x Toxicity and drowsiness. x Pitting scalp oedema is typical. x Investigations:  Total leucocyte count--increased. ESR--raised.  X-ray skull. CT scan. x Differential diagnosis: Secondaries in the skull or brain. Complications Osteomyelitis of frontal bone. Spread of infection into intracranial cavity leads to intracranial abscess (Extradural or subdural abscess) (dumb-bell abscess). So may present with features of raised intracranial tension like headache, coning and convulsions. Pott's Puffy tumor can be associated with coical vein throm- bosis, epidural brain abscess/subdural empyema. The cause of vein thrombosis is explained by diplopic veins in frontal bone, which communicates with the dural venous plexus; septic thrombi can potentially evolve from foci within the frontal sinus and propagate through this venous system. Treatment x Antibiotics and drainage under general anaesthesia before it spreads into cranial cavity. x Once it extends into cranial cavity, it is treated accordingly by formal neurosurgical decompression (often using Dandy's brain cannula). x Osteomyelitis of skull bones requires radical removal with recon- struction of skull defect.

It is caused by sphincter weakness. Detrusor instability this is phasic increase in detrusor pressure (due to phasic contraction of detrusor muscle) giving rise to sensation of urgency of micturition and urge incontinence. It is found in pts with several types of neurogenic bladder dysfunction such as multiple sclerosis (MS) Parkinson disease or following a stroke or ceain types of spinal injury when it is known as detrusor hyperreflexia.

Most impoant pathophysiological cause of GERD is,Hiatus hernia,Transient LES relaxation,LES hypotension,Inadequate esophageal clearance,"""Transient LES relaxations account for at least 90% of reflux in normal subjects or GERD patients without a hiatus hernia""- Harrison Transient lower oesophagal sphincter relaxations account for essentially all reflux events in individuals with a normal LES pressure at the time of reflux. Pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) The primary event in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a movement of gastric juice from the stomach into the oesophagus. The three dominant pathophysiologic mechanisms causing gastroesophageal junction incompetence are: Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (tLESRs) A hypotensive lower oesophagal sphincter (LES) Anatomic disruption of the gastroesophageal junction, often associated with a hiatal hernia The latest concept is that the dominant mechanism varies as a function of disease severity with tLESRs predominating with mild disease and mechanisms associated with a hiatus hernia and/or a weak sphincter predominating with more severe disease Transient LES relaxations are different from swallow-induced LES relaxation: tLESRs occur without an associated pharyngeal contraction, are unaccompanied by oesophagal peristalsis, and persist for longer periods (>10 sec) than do swallow-induced LES relaxations. tLESRs are the physiological mechanism of belching.
