"In restrictive lung disease, TLC is -",Increased,Decreased,No change,May be increased or decreased,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Decreased o Lung volumes alter in many lung diseases as follows : -1) Chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD):# Dynamic compression of airways occurs mainly in expiration (Dynamic compression of airways will be discussed later in details).# So, air tends to enter the lung easily (as inspiraton is less affected) but then becomes trapped in the lung over a period of months or year, this increases total lung capacity, residual volume (RV) and functional residual capacity (FRC). Due to obstruction FEV1 is decreased and vital capacity is also decreased later.# The characteristic feature of COPD is early decrease of FEV1 and out of proportion to vital capacity/forced vital capacity. Therefore, FEV1/FVC is decreased.# The most important COPD is emphysema.2) Restrictive lung disease :# Restrictive lung diseases are characterized by decreased lung compliance and constricted lungs.# Therefore, all volumes and capacity are decreased. TLC, FEV1, VC/FVC, RV, FRC all are reduced.# FEV1 is decreased in proportion or slightly less than FRV; therefore, FEV1/FVC is either normal or slightly increased.# Interstitial lung diseases (like pneumoconiosis, interstitial pneumonitis, sarcoidosis) and pulmonary fibrosis are restrictive lung diseases.",B

Nucleus pulposis is derived from:,Neural crest,Notochord,Sclerotome,None of the above,"The nucleus pulposus is the sole remnant of the embryonic notochord, the initial longitudinal skeletal axis of the body. The developing bodies and interveebral discs of the veebral column replace the notochord. NOTOCHORD: The notochordal plate becomes the centrally placed notochord, which acts as a foundation around which the veebral column develops. It extends throughout the entire length of the future veebral column, and reaches as far as the anterior end of the mid-brain, where it ends in a hook-like extremity in the region of the future dorsum sellae of the sphenoid bone. The notochord then undergoes involution and becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervetebral disks. Remnants of the notochord: are located in the nucleus pulposus, clivus, nasopharyngeal notochordal bursa, and sacrum.The most common anomaly due to incomplete resorption of notochord is butterfly veebra. Nucleus pulposis: The nucleus pulposus is 70-90% water although the exact propoion varies with age.

Not a feature of competitive inhibition?,Inhibitor and substrate can bind simultaneously to same enzyme molecule,Inhibitor is structural analogue of substrate,Km increases,Vmax unaffected,"Ans. a (Inhibitor and substrate can bind simultaneously to same enzyme molecule) (Ref. Harper 27th/Ch. 8)In noncompetitive inhibition, binding of the inhibitor does not affect binding of substrate. Formation of both El and EIS complexes is therefore possible. However, while the enzyme-inhibitor complex can still bind substrate, its efficiency at transforming substrate to product, reflected by Vmax, is decreased. Noncompetitive inhibitors bind enzymes at sites distinct from the substrate-binding site and generally bear little or no structural resemblance to the substrate.The effects of competitive inhibitors, which typically resemble substrates, are overcome by raising the con- centration of the substrate.

A 31 year old HIV-positive man develops a severe pneumonia. Lower respiratory tract secretions obtained by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and stained with methenamine silver stain demonstrate cup-shaped cysts with sharply outlined walls. Which of the following organisms is the most likely pathogen in this case?,Candida albicans,Giardia lamblia,Haemophilus influenzae,Pneumocystis carinii,"The organism described is Pneumocystis carinii, which is an oppounistic parasite that appears to be more closely related to fungi than to protozoa. Its cyst form, when stained with silver stains, has the distinctive appearance described in the question stem, and is typically found in frothy material that occupies the lumen of alveoli. The trophozoites are smaller and much harder to recognize. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered much more reliable than induced sputum as a diagnostic specimen. Pneumocystis pneumonia is a common infection among AIDS patients, and is very uncommon in other clinical settings. Formerly, many AIDS patients died with Pneumocystis pneumonia, but the combination of early drug treatment (with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine) and prophylaxis (usually with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) has decreased the number of fatal infections. In severe cases, Pneumocystis infection can sometimes be demonstrated in extrapulmonary sites. Candida albicans(choice A) can infect the lung and stain with methenamine silver, but the description of the lavage material would probably include the terms fungal hyphae and yeast forms. Giardia lamblia (choice B) causes diarrhea, rather than pneumonia. Haemophilus influenzae(choice C) and Streptococcus pneumoniae(choice E) are bacteria and would not stain with silver stains.

Oxidative injury of the red blood cells leading to heamolysis is associated with of the following clinical conditions?,G6PD deficiency,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Hemophilia,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial step in the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt, oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate to 6- phosphogluconolactone and reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH. The main function of the HMP shunt is to protect red blood cells against oxidative injury the production of NADPH. Red blood cells contain relatively high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH) which is protective against oxidant injury. The oxidants, such as super oxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide, are formed within red cells due to reactions of hemoglobin with oxygen and due to drugs or infections. They accumulate within red cells and cause oxidation of hemoglobin and other proteins leading to loss of function and cell death. The combined effect of HMP shunt to glutathione metabolism is responsible for protecting intracellular proteins from oxidative stress. G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic episodes related to altered HMP shunt and glutathione metabolism. The cells that over express G6PD are protected against oxidative injury.",A

Polymer of fructose,Dextrose,Cellulose,Inulin,Glycogen,"Ans. c (Inulin) (Ref. Ganong.-23rd/Ch. 38. 26th/pg. 105).Substances Used to Measure GFRIn addition to the requirement that it be freely filtered and neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a substance suitable for measuring the GFR should be nontoxic and not metabolized by the body. Inulin, a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5200 that is found in dahlia tubers, meets these criteria in humans and most animals and is extensively used to measure GFR. Radioisotopes such as 51Cr-EDTA are also used, but inulin remains the standard substance. In practice, a loading dose of inulin is administered intravenously, followed by a sustaining infusion to keep the arterial plasma level constant. After the inulin has equilibrated with body fluids, an accurately timed urine specimen is collected and a plasma sample obtained halfway through the collection. Plasma and urinary inulin concentrations are determined and the clearance calculated. The GFR in a healthy person of average size is approximately 125 mL/min.CLASSIFICATION OF IMPORTANT SUGARS AldosesKetosesTrioses (C3H6O3)GlyceroseDihydroxyacetoneTetroses (C4H8O4)ErythroseErythrulosePentoses (C5Hl0O5)RiboseRibuloseHexoses (C6H12O6)GlucoseFructoseHexoses of Physiologic ImportanceSugarSourceImportanceClinical significanceD-GlucoseFruit juices.

Best medium to grow anaerobic bacteria exclusively is: March 2007,Blood agar,Robeson's cooked meat medium,Thioglycollate medium,Sabouraud Dextrose agar,"Ans. B: Robeson's cooked meat medium An anaerobic bacteria culture is a method used to grow anaerobes from a clinical specimen. Robeson's cooked meat medium is probably the most widely used fluid medium for the culture of anaerobes. Obligate anaerobes are bacteria that can live only in the absence of oxygen. Obligate anaerobes are destroyed when exposed to the atmosphere for as briefly as 10 minutes. Facultative anaerobes are those organisms that will grow with or without oxygen. Many anaerobes have characteristic microscopic morphology. For example, Bacteroides spp. are gram-negative rods that are pleomorphic (variable in size and shape) and exhibit irregular bipolar staining. Fusobacterium spp. are often pale gram-negative spindle-shaped rods having pointed ends. Clostridium spp. are large gram-positive rods that form spores. Blood agar is a solid culture medium consisting of agar, peptones and blood. It is an example of an enriched, non selective general purpose medium since it suppos the growth of most aerobic and aerobic bacteria.

"About Apoptosis ,true statement is",Injury due to hypoxia,Inflammatory reaction is present,Council man bodies are associated with Apoptosis,Cell membrane is damaged,"Ref Robbins 8/e p25; 7/e p26;9/e p823 Councilman body, also known as Councilman hyaline body or apoptotic body, is an acidophilic (eosinophilic / pink-staining on H&E) globule of cells that represents a dying hepatocyte often surrounded by normal parenchyma. ... It represents a hepatocyte that is undergoing necrosis/apoptosis In H&E-stained tissue sections, the nuclei of apoptotic cells show various stages of chromatin condensation and aggregation and, ultimately, karyorrhexis (Fig. 1-21); at the molecular level this is reflected in fragmentation of DNA into nucleosome-sized pieces. The cells rapidly shrink, form cytoplasmic buds, and fragment into apoptotic bodies composed of membrane-bound vesicles of cytosol and organelles (Fig. 1-6). Because these fragments are quickly extruded and phagocytosed without eliciting an inflammatory response, even substantial apoptosis may be histologically undetectable",C

"Which of the following organisms, when isolated in the blood, requires the synergistic activity of penicillin and an aminoglycoside for appropriate therapy",Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,Bacteroides fragilis,"Enterococci are present in the intestine, genital tract and saliva. They are frequently isolated from cases of urinary tract infection and wound infection. Also causes endocarditis, infection of the biliary tract, septicemia and intra-abdominal abscess complicating diveiculitis and peritonitis. Strains resistant to Penicillin and other antibiotics occur frequently, so it is essential to perform antibiotic sensitivity for proper therapy. Enterococci are intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins and offer low-level resistance to aminoglycosides. In penicillin-sensitive strains, synergism occurs with combination treatment with Penicillin and aminoglycosides. If strains showed high-level resistance to aminoglycosides, this synergism does not occur. The drug of choice in such cases is vancomycin.

Role of Fluorine in dental health is the following EXCEPT,To make enamel harder than usual,To replace several hydroxyl ions in hydroxyapatite,To make enamel several times less soluble,To promote deposition of calcium phosphate to 'heal' pits in enamel surface,"Ans. a. (To make enamel harder than usual) (Ref. Guyton physiology 11th/994, 879)Role of Fluorine in Preventing Caries. Teeth formed in children who drink water that contains small amounts of fluorine develop enamel that is more resistant to caries than the enamel in children who drink water that does not contain fluorine. Fluorine does not make the enamel harder than usual, but fluorine ions replace many of the hydroxyl ions in the hydroxyapatite crystals, which in turn makes the enamel several times less soluble. Fluorine may also be toxic to the bacteria. Finally, when small pits do develop in the enamel, fluorine is believed to promote deposition of calcium phosphate to ""heal"" the enamel surface. Regardless of the precise means by which fluorine protects the teeth, it is known that small amounts of fluorine deposited in enamel make teeth about three times as resistant to caries as teeth without fluorine.# Fluorine does not seem to be a necessary element for metabolism & it does not make the teeth themselves stronger but has a poorly understood effect in suppressing the cariogenic process.# Even though the mottled teeth are highly resistant to the development of caries, the structural strength of these teeth may be considerably lessened by the mottling process.",A

M. leprae has not been grown in any culture medium. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to Leishmania species that show a worldwide distribution. The infection is transmitted through a sandfly bite, and the skin lesion is typically ulcerated. Histology shows intracellular parasites within the dermis and epidermis. Granulomas are not formed. Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a roundworm infection transmitted by black flies of Africa and South America. The microfilariae grow at the site of inoculation, and cause an inflamed subcutaneous nodule. The organism is seen on tissue sections. Rhinoscleroma is a destructive granulomatous infection of the nasopharynx caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. Gram-negative rods can be cultured from the lesions. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010).

What is the basis of this statement - 'FATS BURN IN THE FLAME OF CARBOHYDRATES ':,Fats & carbohydrates are oxidized together,Beta oxidation occurs in the presence of carbohydrates,Acetyl CoA is never glucogenic,Acetyl Co A is oxidized completely in the presence of oxaloacetate,"""Fats burn in the flame of carbohydrates"" means fats can only be oxidized in the presence of carbohydrates. Acetyl CoA is a fat derivative, which can be oxidized TCA cycle. As Oxaloacetate is the carrier of TCA cycle So, TCA cycle can operate only if oxaloacetate is available in sufficient amounts. Now oxaloacetate is mainly produced from pyruvate by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate is mainly produced from glycolysis of carbohydrates. So we can say that main source of oxaloacetate is carbohydrates. As carbohydrates are the main source of oxaloacetate which is required for oxidation of acetyl-CoA (produced from fats) through TCA. Hence this statement ""Fats burn in the flame of carbohydrates"".",D

In prepubescent children, epidemic tinea capitis is usually self-limiting.Zoophilic species may induce a severe combined inflammatory and hypersensitivity reaction called a kerion.Another manifestation of tinea capitis is favus, an acute inflammatory infection of the hair follicle caused by T schoenleinii, which leads to the formation of scutula (crusts) around the follicle. In favic hairs, the hyphae do not form spores but can be found within the hair shaft.Table :Some Clinical Features of Dermatophyte InfectionSkin DiseaseLocation of LesionsClinicalFungiTinea corporis (ringworm)Nonhairy, smooth skin.Circular patches with advancing red, vesiculated border and central scaling.

Phenylketonuria I is due to deficiency of -,Phenylalanine hydroxylase,Homogentisate oxidase,Tyrosinase,None.,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Phenylalanine hydroxylase Phenylketonuria o It is an inborn metabolism of phenylalanine, in which there is inability of oxidation of phenylalanine into tyrosine. There is defective function of phenylalanine hydroxylase, which may be due to Classical phenylketonuria (hyperphenylalanemia type I) - Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Atypical phenylketonuria (Hyperphenylalanemia type II and III) - Defect in dihydrobiopterin re- ductase. Hyperphenylalanemia type - IV and V - Defect in dihydrobiopterin synthesis. o Phenylalanine level is raised as it can not be oxidized into tyrosine. Therefore, some minor pathways of phenylalanine metabolism become active (which does not require hydroxylase). This result in accumulation toxic metabolites of phenylalanine which include phenylpyruvate, phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenylacetylglutamine. Increased excretion of phenylalanine in urine gives the urine a mousy odor. For detection of phenylalanine, following tests are used : - Guthrie's test: - It detect phenylalanine in the serum.

What is essential for transfer of fatty acid across mitochondrial membrane -,Creatine,Creatinine,Carnitine,None.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Carnitine o Formation of acyl Co A (activated fatty acid) takes place in the cytosol,o Further degradation occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.o This creates a problem because the inner mitochondral membrane is impermeable to long chain acyl CoA (activated fatty acid).o To overcome this problem, participation of a carrier, carnitine is required Q,o It is Synthesized from lysine Q and methionine in liver and kidney.o The transport process, referred to as carnitine shuttle, comprises following steps: -The acyl group af acyl CoA is transferred to carnitine, resulting in formation of fatty acylcamitine. The reaction is catalyzed by rate-limiting enzyme of b-oxidation, carnitine acyl transferase-1: CAT-1 (or carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1), which is located on outer side (cytosolic side) of inner mitochondrial membrane or inner side of outer mitochond rial membrane QAcylcamitine is able to penetrate the inner membrane Q and is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by an enzyme translocase (camitine-acylcamitine translocase). Entry of acylcamitine is coupled with exit of carnitine.Once inside the mitochondrial matrix, acyl group of acylcamitine is transferred back to CoA by the enzyme carnitine acyl transferase-11: CAT-11 (or carnitine palmitoyl transferase-11) located on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Acyl-CoAis reformed in mitochondrial matrix with liberation of carnitine which is returned to the cytosalic side by the translocase (camitine-acylcamitine translocase) in exchange for an incoming acylcamitine.",C

Characteristics of SLE of kidney is,Focal sclerosis,Focal necrosis,Wire loop lesion,Diffused glomerulosclerosis,"Ref Robbins 9/e p224 Kidneys. Kidney involvement is one of the most impoant clinical features of SLE, with renal failure being the most common cause of death. The focus here is on glomerular pathology, although interstitial and tubular lesions are also seen in SLE. The pathogenesis of all forms of glomerulonephritis in SLE involves deposition of DNA-anti-DNA complexes within the glomeruli. These evoke an inflammatory response that may cause proliferation of the endothelial, mesangial, and/or epithelial cells and, in severe cases, necrosis of the glomeruli. Although the kidney appears normal by light microscopy in 25% to 30% of cases, almost all cases of SLE show some renal abnormality if examined by immuno- fluorescence and electron microscopy. According to the current International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathol- ogy Society morphologic classification, there are six patterns of glomerular disease in SLE (none of which is specific to the disease): class I, minimal mesangial lupus nephritis; class II, mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis; class III, focal lupus nephritis; class IV, diffuse lupus nephritis; class V, membra- nous lupus nephritis; and class VI, advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis. * Minimal mesangial lupus nephritis (class I) is rarely encountered in renal biopsies. Immune complexes are present in the mesangium, but there are no concomitant structural alterations detectable by light microscopy. * Mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis (class II) is seen in 10% to 25% of cases and is associated with mild clinical symptoms. Immune complexes deposit in the mesangium, with a mild to moderate increase in the mesangial matrix and cellularity. * Focal lupus nephritis (class III) is seen in 20% to 35% of cases. Lesions are visualized in fewer than half the glomeruli, and they may be segmentally or globally distrib- uted within each glomerulus. Active lesions are character- ized by swelling and proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells, infiltration by neutrophils, and/or fibrinoid deposits with capillary thrombi (Fig. 4-18, A). The clinical presentation may range from only mild microscopic hema- turia and proteinuria to a more active urinary sediment with red blood cell casts and acute, severe renal insufficiency. * Diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) is the most serious form of renal lesions in SLE and is also the most commonly encountered in renal biopsies, occurring in 35% to 60% of patients. It is distinguished from focal lupus nephritis (class III) by involvement of half or more of glomeruli. Most of the glomeruli show endothelial and mesangial prolifera- tion, leading to diffuse hypercellularity of these structures (Fig. 4-18, B) and producing in some cases epithelial crescents that fill Bowman's space. When extensive, sub- endothelial immune complexes create a circumferential thickening of the capillary wall, resembling rigid ""wire loops"" on routine light microscopy (Fig. 4-18, C). Electron microscopy reveals prominent electron-dense subendo- thelial immune complexes (between endothelium and basement membrane) (Fig. 4-18, D), but immune com- plexes are also usually present in other pas of the capil- lary wall and in the mesangium. Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, result- ing in a granular fluorescent staining pattern (Fig. 4-18, E). In due course, glomerular injury may give rise to scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Most affected patients have hematu- ria with moderate to severe proteinuria, hypeension, and renal insufficiency. * Membranous lupus nephritis (class V) occurs in 10% to 15% of cases and is the designation for glomerular disease characterized by widespread thickening of the capillary wall due to deposition of subepithelial immune complexes. Membranous glomerulonephritis associated with SLE is very similar to that encountered in idiopathic membranous nephropathy (Chapter 13). Thickening of capillary walls is caused by increased deposition of base- ment membrane-like material, as well as accumulation of immune complexes. Patients with this histologic change almost always have severe proteinuria with ove nephrotic syndrome (Chapter 13). * Advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis (class VI) is characterized by complete sclerosis of greater than 90% of glomeruli and corresponds to clinical end stage renal disease.",C

Which receptors are present in the liver for uptake of LDL,Apo E,Apo A and Apo E,Apo E and Apo B100,Apo B100,"Apo E and Apo B100 

This question is a tricky one.
For uptake of LDL in the liver, there are LDL receptors, which are also called apo-B100 / apo-E receptors because apo-B100 functions as a ligand of these receptors for LDL uptake and apo-E serves as a ligand for the uptake of IDL and chylomicron remnants.
Thus, receptors are the same for the uptake of LDL, IDL and chylomicron remnants, i.e. LDL receptors (apo-B100/apo-E receptors), but the ligand (apoprotein of these lipoproteins) for these receptors are different.
If the question would have been, which ligand is used for LDL (instead of receptors), then the answer would have been apo-B100.
In the liver, receptors for the uptake of LDL, IDL, chylomicron remnants → LDL receptors (apo-B100/apo-E receptors)

"In micturition reflex, the first change to occur is _______",Trigone relaxation,Detrusor contraction,Relaxation of perineal muscles,Decreased urethral pressure,"One of the initial events is the relaxation of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and this may cause a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Micturition Reflex Micturition is fundamentally a spinal reflex facilitated and inhibited by higher brain centers and is subject to voluntary facilitation and inhibition. These centers include Strong facilitative and inhibitory centers in the brain stem, located mainly in the pons Several centers located in the cerebral coex that is mainly inhibitory but can become excitatory. The micturition reflex is the basic cause of micturition, but higher centers normally exe final control of micturition. Micturition reflex is the result of a stretch reflex initiated by sensory stretch receptors in the bladder wall, especially by the receptors in the posterior urethra when this area begins to fill with urine at the higher bladder pressures. Sensory signals from the bladder stretch receptors are conducted to the sacral segments of the cord through the pelvic nerves and then reflexively back again to the bladder through the parasympathetic nerve fibers by way of these same nerves. As the bladder continues to fill, the micturition reflexes become more frequent and cause greater contraction of the detrusor muscle. Once a micturition reflex begins, it is &;self-regenerative&; It is a single complete cycle of The progressive and rapid increase of pressure A period of sustained pressure and Return of the pressure to the basal tone of the bladder. As the bladder becomes more and more fiilled, micturition reflexes occur more and more often and more and more powerfully. Once micturition reflex becomes powerful enough, it causes another reflex, which passes through the pudendal nerves to the extrenal sphincter to inhibit it. If this inhibition is more potent in the brain than the voluntary constrictor signals to the extrenal sphincter, urination will occur. If not, urination will not occur until the bladder fills still fuher and the micturition reflex becomes more powerful. Ref: Guyton and Hall 13th edition Pgno: 329-330",C

With which of the following viruses is the newborn most likely infected?",Cytomegalovirus,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,Hepatitis D,"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection results from transplacental acquisition of a primary or recurrent maternal infection. Most infections are asymptomatic, but about 5% will present with hepatosplenomegaly, periventricular brain calcification, petechial hemorrhages, and hydrops. Sensorineural deafness is a common manifestation in affected infants. Primary infection of the mother is strongly associated with more severe symptoms in affected infants. The moality rate is 30% and most of the survivors will have neurologic impairment. Also know: CMV infections in children and adults are often asymptomatic; however, the virus is responsible for 10% of infectious mononucleosis cases (characterized by an absence of sheep RBC agglutinins). CMV also causes serious disease in immunosuppressed patients, including bone marrow recipients and AIDS patients. Ganciclovir is the drug of choice, although foscarnet has also been used with some success. Infections with hepatitis viruses, if symptomatic, are characterized by jaundice, lethargy, failure to thrive, abdominal distention, clay- colored stools, and elevated transaminase levels. Hepatitis B is the only viral hepatitis agent that is recognized as an impoant cause of neonatal disease. The infection is usually acquired during the bih process; therapy includes hyperimmune human anti-hepatitis B serum followed a few weeks later with active immunization with HBsAg injections.

Most of what we commonly consider ""memory"" is explicitly memory. Answers you give on an exam are a product of explicit memory. Everything you ""know"" you remember is explicit memory.Explicit memory may be further subdivided into declarative memories and episodic memories> Explicit memory = Declarative memory + Episodic memory> Declarative memories are memories about general factual information, such as that George Washington was the first president of the United States.> Episodic memories are personal, autobiographic memories, such as what your first day of school was like, or what you did on your last vacation.# IMPLICIT MEMORIES are memories that we do not consciously remember, which nonetheless can be show to influence our behavior. Implicit memory is close to Freud's concept of ""unconscious thought."" Since we are not consciously aware of implicit memories, it is difficult to demonstrate that they exist.Implicit memory may be further divided into procedural memory and conditioning effects.> Implicit memory = Procedural memory + Conditioning effects> Procedural memories are memories for how to do things, such as riding a bike or driving a car.> Conditioning effects are memories that are formed more or less automatically through the processes of classical and operant conditioning, which we will study future chapters.> Implicit memories and explicit memories seem to be processed and stored in different parts of the brain.

Cytoplasmic translation system has the following number of t-RNAs,20,26,28,31,"In molecular biology and genetics, translation is the process in which ribosomes in the cytoplasm or ERsynthesize proteins after the process of transcription of DNA to RNA in the cell's nucleus. The entire process is called gene expression. In translation, messenger RNA (mRNA) is decoded in the ribosome decoding center to produce a specific amino acid chain, or polypeptide. The polypeptide later foldsinto an active protein and performs its functions in the cell. The ribosomefacilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodonsequences to mRNA codons. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is read by the ribosome. Translation proceeds in three phases: Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. The first tRNA is attached at the sta codon. Elongation: The tRNA transfers an amino acid to the tRNA corresponding to the next codon. The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next mRNA codon to continue the process, creating an amino acid chain. Termination: When a peptidyl tRNA encounters a stop codon, then the ribosome folds the polypeptide into its final structure. Ref satyanarayana 4e",A

Which of the following bacteria manifests its clinical features by increasing cAMP?,Vibrio cholerae,Staphylococcus aureus,E. coli heat stable toxin,Salmonella,"Vibrio cholerae secretes an enterotoxin called choleragen (cholera toxin). Choleragen consists of an A (active) subunit and a B (binding) subunit. The B subunit binds to a ganglioside receptor on the surface of the enterocyte. The A subunit is inseed into the cytosol, where it catalyzes the addition of ADP-ribose to the Gs protein. This locks the Gs protein in the ""on"" position, which causes the persistent stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The resulting overproduction of cyclic AMP activates cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates ion transpoers in the cell membrane, resulting in the loss of water and ions from the cell. The watery efflux enters the lumen of the gut, resulting in a massive watery diarrhea that contains neither neutrophils nor red blood cells. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 18.

(A) Trophozoite--ventral view (B) Trophozoite--lateral view (C) Cyst Infection is acquired by the ingestion of cysts in contaminated food and water. Infectivity is high, as few as 10 cysts being capable of initiating infection. Within half an hour of ingestion, the cyst hatches out into two trophozoites which multiply successively by binary fission and colonise the duodenum. The trophozoites as they pass down the colon develop into cysts. G. lamblia is seen typically within the crypts in the duodenum. It does not invade tissues, but remains tightly attached by means of the sucking disc to the epithelial surface in the duodenum and jejunum. The diarrhoea in some cases may be steatorrhoeic with excess mucus and fat, but no blood. Children may develop chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, weight loss and a sprue-like syndrome.

All are true about ketone bodies except,Acetoacetate is primary ketone body,Synthesized in mitochondria,Synthesized in liver,HMG CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme,"KETOSIS Under ceain metabolic conditions associated with a high rate of fatty acid oxidation, liver produces considerable quantities of compounds like acetoacetate and bbb-OH butyric acid, which pass by diffusion into the blood. Acetoacetate continually undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to produce acetone. These three substances are collectively known as ""ketone bodies"" (or ""acetone bodies""). Sometimes also called as ""ketones"", which is rather a misnomer. KETONE BODY FORMATION IN LIVER (KETOGENESIS) Enzymes are mitochondrial: Steps 1. Aceto-acetyl-CoA: Aceto-acetyl-CoA is the staing material for ketogenesis. This can arise in two ways: (a)Directly during the course of b-oxidation of fatty acids, or (b)As a result of condensation of two C-2 units, i.e. 'active acetate' (acetyl-CoA) by reversal of thiolase reaction. 2. Formation of Acetoacetate: Acetoacetate is the first ketone body to be formed. This can occur in two ways: a) By deacylation: Acetoacetate can be formed from aceto-acetyl-CoA by simple deacylation catalysed by the enzyme aceto-acetyl-CoA deacylase. SECTION FOUR when excessive amount of ketone bodies are formed, the The above does not seem to be the major pathway deacylation reaction is not enough to cope up. (b) Second pathway: Formation of acetoacetate intermediate production of ""bbb-OH-bbb-methyl glutaryl CoA"" (HMG-CoA). Present opinion ours the HMG-CoA pathway as the major route of ketone body formation. Steps Involves two steps: * Condensation of aceto-acetyl-CoA with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form b-OH-b methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) catalysed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (mitochondrial enzyme). *HMG-CoA is then acted upon by an another enzyme, HMG-CoA Lyase, which is also mitochondrial enzyme, to produce one molecule ""acetoacetate"" and one molecule of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 25.10). Note *Both the enzymes HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA Lyase are mitochondrial and must be available in mitocondrion for ketogenesis to occur. *Both the enzymes are present in liver cells mitochon- dria only. *A marked increase in activity of HMG-CoA Lyase has been noted in fasting. *HMG-CoA is a committed step. Cholesterol also can be formed by ""HMG-CoA reductase"". 3. Formation of Acetone: As stated earlier, acetone is formed from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxy- lation (Non-enzymatic). 4.Formation of b-OH Butyrate: Acetoacetate once formed is conveed to b-OH-butyric acid; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme b-OH-butyrate dehydro- genase, which is present in liver and also found in many other tissues. b-OH-butyrate is quantitatively the predominant ketone body present in blood and urine in KetosisRef: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry Dr (Brig) MN Chatterjea Rana Shinde, page no: 425,426",D
Flask-like ulcers extending to submucosa are characteristic of,Giardiasis,Amoebiasis,Ascariasis,Trichuriasis,"E histolytica invades the intestinal epithelium and form discrete ulcers with a pinhead-sized center and raised edges, from which mucus, necrotic cells, and amebae pass. The trophozoites multiply and accumulate above the muscularis mucosae, often spreading laterally. A rapid lateral spread of the multiplying amebae follows, undermining the mucosa and producing the characteristic ""flask-shaped"" ulcer of primary amebiasis: a small point of entry, leading a narrow neck through the mucosa into an expanded necrotic area in the submucosa.Bacterial invasion usually does not occur at this time, the cellular reaction is limited, and damage is by lytic necrosis.Ref: Jawetz; 27th edition; Page no: 711",B

"Following acute failure of the left ventricle is the hea is man, pulmonary edema generally begins to appear when left atrial pressure approaches",7 mm Hg,I5 mm Hg,20 mm Hg,30 mm Hg,"Pulmonary edema is one of the most serious consequences of left ventricular cardiac failure. When the left ventricle fails or when the mitral valve fails, left atrial pressure (LAP) may increase substantially. The resulting increase in pulmonary capillary pressure (Pc) forces excess fluid filtration through the pulmonary capillary walls and into the lung tissue. At first, the fluid collects within the lung interstitial space. If LAP exceeds a critical level of ~25 mmHg, the volume of edema fluid will overwhelm the capacity of the interstitial spaces and fluid will flood the airways and alveoli (8). This airway edema directly interferes with gas exchange, and it can kill the patient. However, many people live for months or years with modestly elevated LAP (<25 mmHg). We believe that sustained, subcritical LAP elevations lead to two phases of change in the lungs. The first phase is the acute edema that develops in the first few hours of elevated LAP. The second phase concerns the effect of long-term (7 days or more) increases in LAP below the critical level. This review deals with the acute phase and long-term phase changes in the lung caused by modestly elevated LAP. The acute phase of pulmonary edema has been the subject of intense investigation for many years. In 1896, Starling (7) laid the foundation for our current understanding of pulmonary edema with his famous fluid filtration equation. The equation relates the rate of fluid filtration through the capillary wall (Jv) to the pressures across the capillary wall and to the filtration characteristics of the capillary membrane Ref: guyton and hall textbook of medical physiology 12 edition",C

Which of the following is not secreted by the pancreas,Procarboxypeptidase,Trypsinogen,Phospholipase A,Pepsinogen,"Pancreatic juice is secreted most abundantly in response to the presence of chyme in the upper portions of the small intestine, and the characteristics of the pancreatic juice are determined to some extent by the types of food in the chyme. (The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestine-by  the  islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas). The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin.
Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause  release  of  individual  amino  acids. However,  carboxypolypeptidase splits  some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is  pancreatic  amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates  (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides.The main enzymes for fat digestion are
(1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into  fatty  acids  and  monoglycerides; 
(2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters;and 
(3)  phospholipase,  which splits fatty acids  from phospholipids.
When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in the inactive forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen.  Chymotrypsinogen is  activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner.",D

Substance which binds to substrate other than catalytic enzyme is ?,Competitive inhibitor,Non-competitive inhibitor,Reversible inhibitor,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Non-competitive inhibitor Non-competitive inhibitor In this type of inhibition no competition occurs between substrate and inhibitor. Inhibitor is structurally different from substrate and binds to enzyme at a site other than the substrate binding (catalytic) site. Occupancy of this site by the inhibitor alters the shape of the enzyme such that its catalytic activity is reduced or lost. The substrate is still able to bind the enzyme, but the enzyme cannot catalyze the reaction when inhibitor is bound. Thus, the non-competitive inhibitor does not block the active site of enzyme, but behaves as though it were removing active enzyme from the solution. Evidently, unlike competitive inhibition, increasing the substrate concentration does not reverse the inhibition. Non-competitive inhibition may be reversible or irreversible.",B

Which of the following tactile receptors respond to the vibration sense of 30 - 800 Hz?,Pacinian corpuscles,Ruffini ending,Merkel's disk,Meissner's corpuscles,"Ans. A. Pacinian corpuscles. (Ref. Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587; Ganong 23rd/pg. 121-127, 746)Guyton Physiology 11th/pg. 587.........""Detection of Vibration: All tactile receptors are involved in detection of vibration, although different receptors detect different frequencies of vibration. Pacinian corpuscles can detect signal vibrations from 30 to 800 cycles per second because they respond extremely rapidly to minute and rapid deformations of the tissues, and they also transmit their signals over type Ab nerve fibers, which can transmit as many as 1000 impulses per second. Low-frequency vibrations from 2 up to 80 cycles per second, in contrast, stimulate other tactile receptors, especially Meissner's corpuscles, which are less rapidly adapting than pacinian corpuscles"". The Ruffini ending is a tonic receptor that produces a train of action potentials proportional to the intensity of pressure applied to the skin.Free nerve endings:# found everywhere in the skin and in many other tissues# Can detect touch and pressure.# For instance, even light contact with the cornea of the eye, which contains no other type of nerve ending besides free nerve endings, can nevertheless elicit touch and pressure sensations.Meissner fs corpuscle:# It is a touch receptor with great sensitivity is the Meissner's corpuscle# It is an elongated encapsulated nerve ending of a large (type Ab) myelinated sensory nerve fiber.# Present in the nonhairy parts of the skin and are particularly abundant in the finger- tips, lips, and other areas of the skin where one's ability to discern spatial locations of touch sensations is highly developed.# Meissner's corpuscles adapt in a fraction of a second after they are stimulated, which means that they are particularly sensitive to movement of objects over the surface of the skin as well as to low- frequency vibration.Merkel's discs:# Merkel's discs are often grouped together in a receptor organ called the Iggo dome receptor, which projects upward against the underside of the epithelium of the skin. This causes the epithelium at this point to protrude outward, thus creating a dome and constituting an extremely sensitive receptor.# Also note that the entire group of Merkel's discs is innervated by a single large myelinated nerve fiber (type Ab).# These receptors, along with the Meissner's corpuscles, play extremely important roles in localizing touch sensations to specific surface areas of the body and in determining the texture of what is felt.Hair end-organ:# Slight movement of any hair on the body stimulates a nerve fiber entwining its base. Thus, each hair and its basal nerve fiber, called the hair end-organ, are also a touch receptor.# This receptor adapts readily and, like Meissner's corpuscles, detects mainly- (a) movement of objects on the surface of the body or- (b) initial contact with the body.Ruffini's end-organs:# Located in the deeper layers of the skin and also in still deeper internal tissues are many Ruffini's end-organs, which are multibranched, encapsulated endings.# These endings adapt very slowly and, therefore, are important for signaling continuous states of deformation of the tissues, such as heavy prolonged touch and pressure signals.# They are also found in joint capsules and help to signal the degree of joint rotation.Pacinian corpuscles:# lie both immediately beneath the skin and deep in the fascial tissues of the body.# They are stimulated only by rapid local compression of the tissues because they adapt in a few hundredths of a second.# Therefore, they are particularly important for detecting tissue vibration or other rapid changes in the mechanical state of the tissues.",A
GFR is opposed by,Osmotic pressure in peritubular,Osmotic pressure in glomerular,Hydrostatic pressure in peritubular,Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular,"(B] (Osmotic pressure in glomerular): (680-Ganong 24th edition, 538- Jain 5th, 317-18; Guyton 10th)Glomerular Filtration RateIn normal resting man the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) averages 125cc/min. The ultrafiltrate is derived from an average total renal plasma flow (RPF) of 600 cc/min. The ratio of glomerular ultrafiltrate to renal plasma flow is referred to as the filtration fraction (FF):FF=GFR/RPFWhere, the FF represents the fraction of plasma which is filtered across the glomerular capillary bed. Alterations in the FF can have an important effect on proximal tubular reabsorption of fluid. The glomerular filtration rate is several fold that of fluid movement in capillary beds of other tissues, principally because the surface area available for diffusion plus the permeability of the glomerular capillary membrane (Kf) is approximately 100 fold that of other capillary beds.Physical Determinants of Glomerular FiltrationThe net filtration across a capillary bed (including the glomerular capillary membrane wall is governed by the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across the capillary wall.Schematic depiction of the physical determinants responsible for the formation of an ultra filtrate of plasma in Bowman's space. The principal driving force for the formation of the glomerular ultrafiltrate is the hydraulic pressure within the glomerular capillary (Pgc)- In contrast, the principle forces opposing filtration include the oncotic pressure ( 1/4 GC) within the glomerular capillary and hydrostatic pressure in Bowmans space (PBS). Net ultrafiltration is further modulated by the hydraulic permeability and surface area of the glomerular capillary (Kf).The glomerular filtration rate can be derived using the following mathematical relationshipGFR = Kf x (PGC-PBS)-(pGC-7pBs)= Kf x (AP-Att)= Kf x Pufwhere; Kf is the membrane porosity * surface area;PGC is the hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary network;PBS is the Bowman's space pressure;pGC is the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure;tcBS is the Bowman's space oncotic pressure;AP is the transcapillary hydrostatic pressure (PGC - PBS);Arc is the transcapillary oncotic pressure (rcGC - rcBS) andPUF is the net ultrafiltration pressureSince the glomerular ultrafiltrate is typically protein free, pi BS is equal to zero, and, thus, the oncotic pressure inBowman's space is usually excluded from the above analysis. Therefore, the major direct determinants of GFR include.* PGC* PBS* Kf* rcGCIn addition to the above direct determinants of GFR, RPF also indirectly modulates GFR.PGC - In general, increases in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure will increase GFR while decreases result in the opposite effect.p- In general, increases in Kf will tend to increase GFR while decreases will tend to decrease GFR.PBS- Normally Bowman's space pressure remains constant because of unimpeded flow of glomerular filtrate.An obstruction to urinary out flow distal to Bowman's space will result in a fall in delta P (and hence GFR) incident to a rise in Bowman's space pressure.pGC- The glomerular capillary oncotic pressure is the principle factor opposing glomerular filtrationThe pressure in the glomerular capillaries is higher than that in other capillary beds because the afferent arterioles are short, straight branches of the interlobular arteries. Further more the vessels ""downstream"" from the glomeruli, the efferent arterioles have a relatively high resistance. The capillary hydrostatic pressure is opposed hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule. It is also opposed by the oncotic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary (pGC - pT) is normally negligible and the gradient is essentially equal to the oncotic pressure of the plasma proteins.Hormones or autocoidsEffect on GFR(i) Norepinephrine, Epinephrine Endothelin,| (ii) Angiotension II -(prevent |)(iii) Endothelial derived nitric oxide prostaglandins (PGE2), Dopamine(iv) High protein intake| (v) Increased blood glucose| Uncontrolled DM|",B

Lambda phage which is true:,It causes mad cow disease,Lytic & lysogenic conversion cannot occur together,In Lysogenic phase host chromosome and remains dormant,"Lytic phase incorporates in host DNA, proliferate & causes rupture of cell","Ans. B. Lytic & lysogenic conversion cannot occur togethera. Lambda phage is dsDNA phage of E. coli discovered by Lederberg in 1950. It shows 2 types of cycles- lytic or temperate. In lysogenic cycle, it gets inserted only between the genes determining galactose utilization and biotin utilization due to the presence of site specific recombinase.b. On induction of the lytic cycle, the integration is reversed and the phage genome is excised at the same site as the integration.c. Occasionally, however, excision process occurs between two sites other than the normal attachment regions of the phage and host DNA, usually one within the prophage and one just outside. The consequence is that a ring of DNA is excised that contains primarily of lambda genes and a few host genes from either side of the attachment site. This hybrid DNA can be packaged in a lambda head and released, where it is able to infect a further cell and inject into it DNA that contains some host genes. This is an example of specialized transduction.",B

The placenta acts as a barrier and prevents many bacteria and other harmful substances from reaching the fetus, however most viruses (including poliomyelitis, measles and rubella) and some bacteria can pass across it. Drugs taken by the mother may also enter the fetal circulation and can produce congenital malformations. As a rule, maternal hormones do not reach the fetus. However, synthetic progestins and synthetic oestrogens (eg. Diethylstilbestrol) easily cross the placenta, and can have adverse effects on the fetus(including carcinoma in later life)5. While permitting the exchange of several substances between the maternal and fetal blood, it keeps these blood streams separate, thereby, preventing, antigenic reactions between them.6. The placenta synthesizes several hormones. These are probably produced in the syncytiotrophoblast* The source of oxygenated blood is not the lung but the placenta (262-IBS) only a small portion of this blood reaches the lungs, and passes through it to the left atrium.

"During pronation of foot, the axes of which two joints become parallel",Talocrural and subtalar,Talonavicular and calcaneocuboid,Talonayieular and subtalar,Midtarsal and tarsometatarsal,"An impoant function of the foot is propulsion of weight during stance phase . This function is made possible by the MT joint locking and unlocking. During heel strike, the foot needs to be flexible in order to adjust to the surface and the MT joint unlocks to provide this flexibility. Later in the gait cycle, the foot then needs to act as a rigid lever to propel the weight of the body forward which is made possible by MT joint locking. During pronation/eversion of the foot, the axis of the TN and CC joints are parallel to each other, making it easier for them to independently move and unlock the MT joint. The axes cross each other during supination/inversion which locks the MT joint making it difficult to move. Blackwood et al concluded that there is increased forefoot movement when the calcaneus is eveed. This is consistent with the MT joint locking mechanism. Ref - <a href=""",B

Coronary blood flow is maximum during?,Isovolumetric contraction,Rapid ejection,Slow ejection,Isovolumetric relaxation,"ANSWER: (D) I so volumetric relaxationREF: Ganongs 22nd ed page 621CORONARY BLOOD FLOW:Coronary blood flow, like blood flow in other vessels, is dependent on a pressure gradient, principally driven by mean arterial pressure. However, because aortic pressure can vary widely and because the heart beats continuously, the pressure gradient and, hence coronary blood flow fluctuate depending on the state of contraction. During systole, especially on the left side of the heart, the pressure within the coronary artery secondary to extravascular compression from the squeezing effect of the contracting myocardium virtually eliminates antegrade coronary blood flow. The coronary blood flow"" goes to zero just prior to ventricular ejection, corresponding to isovolumic contraction and increased extravascular compression. Conversely, coronary blood flow through the left side is maximal during blood flow through the right side, however, is maximal during peak systole, because developed pressure and consequently extravascular compression within the RV are considerably less than in the LV, thus allowing for antegrade flow during both systole and diastole",D

Although some follicular dendritic cells are infected with HIV, most viral paicles are found on the surface of their dendritic processes. Follicular dendritic cells have receptors to the Fc poion of immunoglobulins that serve to trap HIV virions coated with anti-HIV antibodies. These coated HIV paicles retain the ability to infect CD4+ T cells as they traverse the dendritic cells. B lymphocytes have a surface marker (CD21 protein-a complement receptor) to which an Epstein-Barr envelope glycoprotein can bind. The virus associates with the host cell genome, producing a latent infection. These B cells undergo polyclonal activation and proliferation. Ganglion cells, paicularly the satellite cells around the ganglion cells in the dorsal root ganglia, can be infected by varicella-zoster.

Which of the following enzyme does not catalyse the irreversible step in glycolysis?,Hexokinase,Phosphoglycero kinase,Pyruvate kinase,Phosphofructokinase,"Step 1 of Glycolysis - i. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose-6- phosphate. ii. The enzyme is hexokinase (HK),which splits the ATP into ADP, and the Pi is added on to the glucose. The energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP is utilized for the forward reaction. iii. Hexokinase is a key glycolytic enzyme. Hexokinase catalyses a regulatory step in glycolysis that is irreversible. But this irreversibility is circumvented by another enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (see gluconeogenesis). Step 3 of Glycolysis - i. Fructose-6-phosphate is fuher phosphorylated to fructose1,6-bisphosphate. The enzyme is phosphofructokinase. ii. PFK is an allosteric, inducible, regulatory enzyme. It is an impoant key enzyme of this pathway. This is again an activation process, the energy being derived by hydrolysis of yet another molecule of ATP. This irreversible step is the rate limiting reaction in glycolysis. However, during gluconeogenesis, this step is circumvented by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Step 9 of Glycolysis - i. Phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) is dephosphorylated to pyruvate, by pyruvate kinase. First PEP is made into a transient intermediary of enol pyruvate; which is spontaneously isomerized into keto pyruvate, the stable form of pyruvate. ii. One mole of ATP is generated during this reaction. This is again an example of substrate level phosphorylation. iii. The pyruvate kinase is a key glycolytic enzyme. This step is irreversible.

Free water clearance by the kidney is increased by which of the following,Diabetes insipidus,Renal failure,Diuretic therapy,Diabetes mellitus,"Free-water clearance (CH2O) is calculated as the difference between water excretion (urine flow rate) and osmolar clearance.Thus, the rate of free-water clearance represents the rate at which solute-free water is excreted by the kidneys. When free-water clearance is positive, excess water is being excreted by the kidneys; when free-water clearance is negative, excess solutes are being removed from the blood by the kidneys and water is being conserved.Inappropriate secretion of ADH: Either too much or too little ADH secretion results in abnormal water excretion by the kidneys.In Diabetes insipidus: Because the distal tubular segments cannot reabsorb water in the absence of ADH, It results in the formation of a large volume of dilute urine with urine volumes that can exceed 15 L/day.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 29 Urine Concentration and Dilution",A

Gel filtration chromatography separates proteins based on,Polarity,Hydrophobicity,Stokes radius,pH,"Gel filtration chromatography separates proteins based on their Stokes radius, the radius of the sphere they occupy as they tumble in solution. The Stokes radius is a function of molecular mass and shape. When rapidly tumbling, an elongated protein occupies a larger effective volume than a spherical protein of the same mass. Size-exclusion chromatography employs porous beads. The pores are analogous to indentations in a riverbank. As objects move downstream, those that enter an indentation are retarded until they drift back into the main current. Similarly, proteins with Stokes radii too large to enter the pores (excluded proteins), remain in the flowing mobile phase, and emerge before proteins that can enter the pores (included proteins). Proteins thus emerge from a gel filtration column in descending order of their Stokes radii.

They form an impoant pa of the inflammatory response of the body against infection. These cytokines increase the expression of adhesion factors on endothelial cells to enable transmigration (also called diapedesis) of immunocompetent cells, such as phagocytes, lymphocytes and others, to sites of infection. They also affect the activity of the hypothalamus, the thermoregulatory center, which leads to a rise in body temperature (fever) . That is why IL-1 is called an endogenous pyrogen. Besides fever, IL-1 also causes hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity), vasodilation and hypotension",A

Surfactant is produced by: March 2010,Alveolar macrophages,Lymphocytes in the alveoli,Type I alveolar cells,Type II alveolar cells,"Ans. D: Type II alveolar cells The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Surfactant is impoant at bih. The fetus makes respiratory movements in utero, but the lungs remain collapsed until bih. After bih, the infant makes several strong inspiratory movements and the lungs expand. Surfactant keeps them from collapsing again. Surfactant deficiency is an impoant cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease), the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. Maturation of surfactant in the lungs is accelerated by glucocoicoid hormones. Fetal and maternal coisol increase near term, and the lungs are rich in glucocoicoid receptors. Patchy atelectasis is also associated with surfactant deficiency in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery involving use of a pump oxygenator and interruption of the pulmonary circulation. In addition, surfactant deficiency may play a role in some of the abnormalities that develop following occlusion of a main bronchus, occlusion of one pulmonary aery, or long-term inhalation of 100% 0,. Cigarette smoking also decreases lung surfactant.",D

Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. This means they can survive only by establishig residence inside animal cells They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transpo system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. . This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving aificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. . Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Mc Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to our competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs paiculary in the yolk sac. . The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are: - The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria - It has a relatively high lipid content - It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix. - N Acetylmuramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall. . Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae: - Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins and other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the impoant point about t/t, that cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical disease. .

A patient is on low calcium diet for 8 weeks. Level of which of the following increases to maintain serum calcium levels?,PTH,Calcitonin,"Active 24, 25 dihydroxy cholecalciferol",Serum phosphate level,"The primary function of PTH is to maintain the extracellular fluid (ECF) calcium concentration within a narrow normal range. The hormone acts directly on bone and kidney and indirectly on the intestine through its effects on synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D to increase serum calcium concentrations; in turn, PTH production is closely regulated by the concentration of serum ionized calcium. Any tendency toward hypocalcemia, as might be induced by calcium-deficient diets, is counteracted by an increased secretion of PTH. This in turn (1) increases the rate of dissolution of bone mineral, thereby increasing the flow of calcium from bone into blood; (2) reduces the renal clearance of calcium, returning more of the calcium filtered at the glomerulus into ECF; and (3) increases the efficiency of calcium absorption in the intestine by stimulating the production of 1,25(OH)2D.

"A pregnant woman in her second trimester complains of heat intolerance and palpitations. Physical examination reveals a slightly enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland, and a normal cardiac exam. The serum thyroxine (T4) level is increased; however, the serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is normal. Which of the following best explains the laboratory findings in this patient?",Decreased estrogen,Increased free thyroxine (T4),Increased progesterone,Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG),"The total serum thyroxine (T4) represents the sum of the T4 bound to thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) and the free T4. An increased total T4 may be due to an increase in TBG or an increase in free T4, the latter leading to signs of thyrotoxicosis. A decreased total T4 may be secondary to a reduction in TBG or in free T4, the latter leading to signs of hypothyroidism. In a euthyroid state, one-third of the binding sites on TBG are occupied by T4. An increase in estrogen (pregnancy, bih control pills) increases the synthesis of TBG. Since one-third of the binding sites on TBG will be occupied, the T4 bound to the additional TBG increases the total serum T4. The addition of extra TBG does not alter the free T4 level because of the equilibrium between the serum concentration of T4 and thyroid gland T4 production. Since the free T4 level is normal, there is no stimulus to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland. Regarding the patient's enlarged thyroid gland, heat intolerance, and palpitations, these are normal findings in pregnancy and do not indicate an overactive thyroid gland. Estrogen is increased (not decreased) in pregnancy. The serum free T4 is normal in pregnancy. This explains why the serum TSH is normal in the presence of an elevated serum T4, which reflects the increase in TBG normally occurring in pregnancy. The increase in progesterone during pregnancy has no effect on TBG levels.",D

A man cannot digest carbohydrate. The enzyme deficient is -,Lipase,Amylase,Pepsin,Trypsin,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Amylase o Principal enzyme involved in digestion of dietary carbohydrate is amylase.Digestion of carbohydrateso The most abundant carbohydrate in our food is starch. The other forms of carbohydrate which are consumed in substantial amounts are sucrose and lactose.o Starch is a polysaccharide composed entirely of glucose units linked by 1,4- alpha linkage and 1, 6 branching points. What it means that carbon atom -1 of a glucose unit is linked to carbon atom - 4 of the adjacent glucose unit, and that bond is of alpha - type. At the branching points, carbon atom-1 is linked to carbon atom-6 of the adjacent glucose unit.o Digestion of starch starts in the mouth itself by salivary amylase (ptylin). But the hydrolysis by salivary amylase cannot proceed much because the optimal pH for the reaction is 6-7 which is very different from the highly acidic environment of the stomach. The process is resumed by 'pancreatic amylase' in the small intestine. Amylase attacks only internal, 1-4 alpha glucose-glucose bondsQ but spares 1-6 linkages and terminal 1-4 alpha linkages. Hence the products of starch hydrolysis are maltose (a disaccharide, two glucose residues linked by 1:4 a bonds), maltoriose (a trisaccharide, three glucose residues linked by 1:4a bonds), and alpha limit dextrins (Polymers of glucose containing 8 glucose molecules with 1-6 a linkages).o Both salivary1 and pancreatic amylases are activated by Cl-Qo Further digestion of starch derivatives occurs by the enzymes (oligosaccharidases) present in the brush border of small intestinal epithelial cells. Maltase (a-glucosidase) breaks 1:4 linkages in maltose and maltotriose and releases glucose (two molecules of glucose from maltose and three molecules of glucose from maltotriose). Isomaltase (a- limit dextrinase) breaks 1:6 a linkages of alpha-limit dextrin and releases glucose. Isomaltase (a-limit dextrinase) is the only enzyme that attacks 1: 6a linkage.o Sucrose is hydrolysed into fructose and glucose by sucrase (an enzyme present in brush border of intestinal epithelium). Lactose is hydrolysed into galactose and glucose by lactase (b-glucosidase). Trehalase hydrolyzes trehelose (a 1:1 a - linked dimer of glucose) into two glucose molecules. Trehalose is found in mushrooms.About other optionso Pepsin and trypsin are invloved in protein metabolism.o Lipase is involved in fat metabolism.",B

Mantoux test is an indicator of,Immediate hypersensitivity,Delayed hypersensitivity,Cell mediated hypersensitivity,Immune complex mediated hypersensitivity,"Tuberculin-Type HypersensitivityDelayed hypersensitivity to antigens of microorganisms occurs in many infectious diseases and it has been used as an aid in diagnosis. The tuberculin reaction is a good example of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. When a small amount of tuberculin is injected into the epidermis of a patient previously exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, there is a little immediate reaction. Gradually, however, induration and redness develop and reach a peak in 24-72 hours. Mononuclear cells, especially CD4 Th1 cells, accumulate in the subcutaneous tissue. A positive skin test indicates that the person has been infected with the microorganism but does not imply the presence of current disease. However, a recent change of skin test response from negative to positive suggests recent infection and possible current activity.Reference: Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg's Medical Microbiology; 27th edition; Chapter 8; Immunology",B

Hepcidin associated with which molecule-,Iron,Copper,Selenium,Flurine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., IronMucosal Block Theory* Iron absorption along the basolateral side of intestine is regulated strictly by hepcidin.* Hepcidin is a plasma protein that is synthesized by liver* It inhibits basolateral side transport of iron along enterocytes.* This is mucosal block theory* In conditions of iron demand, liver reduces the synthesis and release of hepcidin and basolateral side transport of iron occurs.# Hepcidin is a positive acute phase reactant. Hence during inflammation liver releases more hepcidin. This inhibits basolateral side transport of iron along intestine. This results in a hematological picture which mimics iron deficiency anemia. This is the basis of Anemia of Chronic Disease.* The basolateral side transport of iron is through Ferroportin. It is also supported by hephaestin.* Once iron gets into circulation, it is converted into ferric form and is attached to apotransferrin forming transferrin. The conversion of ferrous to ferric form is supported by ceruloplasmin, a ferrioxidase.",A

"A viral organism was isolated from a painful blister on the lip of a teenage girl. The agent was found to double-stranded, linear DNA and was enveloped. The patient had a similar sore approximately 2 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",Adenovirus,Coxsackie virus,Herpes simplex type 1 virus,Herpes zoster virus,"Herpes simplex is an enveloped, linear DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent; most adults will have anti-Herpes simplex antibodies in their serum, although many may not have ever had any clinical signs of disease. The hallmark of this disease is painful skin vesicles often called ""cold"" sores, or ""fever"" blisters to denote the precipitating event that preceded the appearance of the lesions. The virus has a propensity to become latent in the host, finding safe refuge in nervous tissue. Activation of the infection occurs following mild trauma (e.g., a visit to the dentist), hormonal changes (e.g., menses), and immunosuppression (e.g., following organ transplantation). Other, more serious, manifestations of disease include encephalitis, pneumonia, and hepatitis; these are paicularly likely to be seen in immunodeficient patients such as those with AIDS. Adenoviruses are naked, linear, double-stranded DNA viruses that cause acute, usually self-limiting, influenza-like illnesses occurring in winter. The symptoms include pharyngitis, fever, cough, and general malaise. Epidemic pharyngoconjunctivitis and pneumonia can occur in closed populations such as military installations. Coxsackie viruses are naked, single-stranded, polycistronic viruses with an RNA genome. They are divided into groups A and B based on their virulence in suckling mice. Coxsackie A group causes generalized myositis and flaccid paralysis, which is rapidly fatal to infant mice, whereas group B produces less severe lesions of the hea, pancreas, and central nervous system. In man, Coxsackie A causes herpangina and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, while Coxsackie B is seen in patients with pleurodynia, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Both groups cause upper respiratory infections, febrile rashes, and meningitis. Herpes zoster, the varicella virus, is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that is a very common infectious agent in children. Chickenpox is a mild, self-limiting illness in children that is evidenced as a fever followed by a macular rash that progresses to papules, then vesicles of the skin and mucous membranes. Shingles is a recurrence of a previously latent varicella infection in which the virus has taken refuge in sensory ganglia of spinal or cranial nerves. Various factors that decrease the immune status of the patient contribute to the exacerbation of the infection. Severe dermatomal pain occurs with a vesicular eruption, fever, and malaise.

Where does capacitation of sperms occur in the reproductive tract?,Epididymis,Vas deferens,Vagina,Uterus,"After ejaculation into the female, spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Capacitation involves two components : increasing the motility of spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. From the isthmuses the capacitated spermatozoa move rapidly to the tubal ampullas, where feilization takes place. Spermatozoa attain progressive motility in the epidydimis. It involves activation of a unique set of proteins from the CatSper family, which are localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail. Ejaculation of the spermatozoon involves contractions of the vas deferens mediated in pa by P2X receptors, ligand-gated cation channels that respond to ATP.

Bain Bridge reflex causes:,Increases Hea rate,Decreases hea rate,Decreases blood pressure,Decreases distension of large somatic veins,"A Bainbridge Reflex is a positive feedback mechanism in which there is a compensatory increase in hea rate, due to a rise in right atrial pressure. It is commonly referred to as an Atrial Reflex. Bainbridge reflex, or atrial reflex: is an acceleration of the hea rate resulting from increased blood pressure in, or increased distension of, the large systemic veins and the right upper chamber of the hea. Atrial stretch receptors are responsible for this. Afferent signals: are carried through the vagus nerves to the medulla of the brain. Efferent signals are transmitted back through vagal and sympathetic nerves to increase hea rate and strength of hea contraction. Prevents damming of blood in the veins atria and pulmonary circulation. The reflex competes with the baroreceptor-mediated decrease in hea rate produced by volume expansion and is diminished or absent when the initial hea rate is high. Bain bridge Reflex can be eliminated by transection of the cardiac autonomic nerve supply and injection of atropine. A ""reverse"" Bainbridge reflex has been proposed to explain the decreases in hea rate observed under conditions in which venous return is reduced, such as during spinal and epidural anesthesia, controlled hypotension, and severe hemorrhage.

"A butcher develops a questionable habit of eating various kinds of raw, ground meat over several years. He eventually starts suffering from fatigue and lymphadenopathy. In his extensive physical examination, intensely white focal retinal lesions with vitritis are observed. Chorioretinitis is diagnosed, even though an older laboratory test, the Sabin-Feldman dye test, is found positive. This patient is found to be infected with which of the following?",Giardiasis,Schistosomiasis,Toxoplasmosis,Trichinosis,"Toxoplasmosis is generally a mild, self-limiting disease; however, severe fetal disease is possible if pregnant women ingest Toxoplasma oocysts. Consumption of uncooked meat may result in either an acute toxoplasmosis or a chronic toxoplasmosis that is associated with serious eye disease. Most adults have antibody titers to Toxoplasma, and thus would have a positive Sabin-Feldman dye test. The Sabin-Feldman dye test measures antibodies that render the membrane of living T. gondii impermeable to methylene blue (no staining occurs). It is being replaced by IFA and ELISA tests. While we usually think of in utero infections of a developing fetus and the subsequent medical difficulties of the newborn infant, an equally important source of human exposure is raw or undercooked meat in which infective tissue cysts are frequently found. When a tissue cyst ruptures, numerous bradyzoites are released and grow, causing chorioretinitis, myocarditis, and polymyositis. Treatment is with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Schistosomiasis is caused by blood flukes whose cercariae (larvae) penetrate skin in snail-infested water. Trichinosis is caused by the trichina worm whose larvae are found in uncooked pork. Cutaneous larva migrans consists of subcutaneous migrating larvae of hookworms. Visceral larva migrans is a condition in humans caused by the migratory larvae of certain nematodes, humans being a terminal host.

Which of the following helps in generating reactive oxygen intermediate in the neutrophil,NADPH oxidase,SOD (superoxide dismutase),Catalase,Glutathione peroxidase,"Ref Robbins 9/e p79 Killing and Degradation of Phagocytosed Microbes. The culmination of the phagocytosis of microbes is killing and degradation of the ingested paicles. The key steps in this reaction are the production of microbicidal substances within lysosomes and fusion of the lysosomes with phago- somes, thus exposing the ingested paicles to the destruc- tive mechanisms of the leukocytes (Fig. 2-8). The most impoant microbicidal substances are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosomal enzymes. The production of ROS involves the following steps: * Phagocytosis and the engagement of various cellular receptors stimulate an oxidative burst, also called the respiratory burst, which is characterized by a rapid increase in oxygen consumption, glycogen catabolism (glycogenolysis), increased glucose oxidation, and production of ROS. The generation of the oxygen metabolites is due to rapid activation of a leukocyte NADPH oxidase, called the phagocyte oxidase, which oxi- dizes NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleo- tide phosphate) and, in the process, conves oxygen to superoxide ion (O2 * ) (see Fig. 1-18, B, Chapter 1). * Superoxide is then conveed by spontaneous dismuta- tion into hydrogen peroxide (O2 * + 2H+ - H2O2). These ROS act as free radicals and destroy microbes by mecha- nisms that were described in Chapter 1. * The quantities of H2O2 produced generally are insuffi- cient to kill most bacteria (although superoxide and hydroxyl radical formation may be sufficient to do so). However, the lysosomes of neutrophils (called azuro- philic granules) contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO), and in the presence of a halide such as Cl- , MPO conves H2O2 to HOCl* (hypochlorous radical). HOCl* is a powerful oxidant and antimicrobial agent (NaOCl is the active ingredient in chlorine bleach) that kills bacteria by halogenation, or by protein and lipid peroxidation. Founately, the phagocyte oxidase is active only after its cytosolic subunit translocates to the membrane of the pha- golysosome; thus, the reactive end products are generated mainly within the vesicles, and the phagocyte itself is not damaged. H2O2 is eventually broken down to water and O2 by the actions of catalase, and the other ROS also are degraded (Chapter 1). Reactive nitrogen species, paicu- larly nitric oxide (NO), act in the same way as that described for ROS.",A

Adequate vaccination can prevent the disease but not the colonization.

‘Mass immunization might result in disappearance of toxigenic strains from many populations but has no effect on carriage of nontoxigenic strains.’

Since the child is completely vaccinated, antitoxin level in serum can always neutralize the toxin but it can not prevent the colonization of nontoxigenic strain.
So, the organism can be grown on Potassium tellurite medium but since it might be a nontoxigenic strain, so any test to detect the toxigenicity will be negative.

"In a foetus, the insulin secretion begins by",3rd month,5th month,7th month,9th month,"Insulin is a peptide hormone, produced by beta cells of the pancreas, and is central to regulating carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the body. Insulin causes cells in the liver, skeletal muscles, and fat tissue to absorb glucose from the blood. In the liver and skeletal muscles, glucose is stored as glycogen, and in fat cells (adipocytes) it is stored as triglycerides. In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the b-cells of the islets of Langerhans. One million to three million islets of Langerhans (pancreatic islets) form the endocrine pa of the pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland.

Which of the following complications is currently the major limitation to the long-term success of cardiac transplantation?,Allograft rejection,Graft aeriosclerosis,Graft atherosclerosis,Oppounistic infections,"Currently, graft aeriosclerosis (AKA graft vascular disease) is the most impoant limit to the long-term success of hea transplantation. For unknown reasons, the coronary aeries of transplanted heas undergo intimal thickening associated with hyperplasia of myocytes and fibroblasts and deposition of matrix. This results in luminal stenosis and myocardial ischemia. Patients may develop myocardial infarction, which is clinically silent because the hea is denervated. The overall survival after hea transplantation is 80% at 1 year and 60% at 5 years. Do not confuse graft aeriosclerosis with graft atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is caused by accumulation of cholesterol esters and development of atheromas. Atherosclerosis may recur in the coronary aeries of transplanted heas, but is not a limiting factor in long-term success of hea transplantation. Allograft rejection is ceainly a major postoperative problem. However, thanks to early diagnosis based on periodic endomyocardial biopsy and the availability of immunosuppressant therapy, this complication can be prevented or successfully treated. Although oppounistic infections and development of Epstein-Barr related lymphomas are undesired effects of profound immunosuppression, these complications do not constitute a significant limitation to the overall outcome of cardiac transplantation.

Which of the following statements about High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is false -,HDL increases oxidation of LDL,HDL reduces foam cell production by LDL,HDL is the best predictor of CAD,HDL helps to clear lipids from atheromas,"Ans. A. HDL increases oxidation of LDL The reverse cholesterol transport system:-a. HDL serves as a chemical shuttle that transports excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. This pathway is called the reverse cholesterol transport system. In this system, plasma HDL takes up cholesterol from the peripheral tissues, such as fibroblasts and macrophages.b. This may occur by passive diffusion or may be mediated by the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) - binding cassette transporter 1. The latter interacts directly with free Apo A-1, generating nascent, or so-called discoidal, HDL. Cholesterol undergoes esterification by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) to produce cholesteryl ester, which results in the production of the mature spherical HDL.c. Cholesterol is also taken up from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in a process mediated by a phospholipid transfer protein (ie, CETP).d. Cholesterol is then returned to the liver by multiple routes. In the first route, cholesterol esters may be transferred from HDL to the Apo B-containing lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) or intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), by CETP. These lipoproteins undergo metabolism and subsequent uptake by the liver, primarily by a process mediated by the B, E receptor.e. In the second route, HDL particles may be taken up directly by the liver. In the third, free cholesterol may be taken up directly by the liver. Finally, HDL cholesterol esters may be selectively taken up via the scavenger receptor SR-B1.",A

All are lysosomal storage disorders except -,I cell disease,Hunter's disease,Me Ardle's Disease,Farber's disease,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Me Ardle's Disease* Lysosomal storage disorders is a group of metabolic disorders caused by a defect of lysosome. Lysosomes are sacs concerned with metabolising unwanted lipids, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides.* They are classified as# Lipid storage disorders* E.g., sphingolipidosis like Gml gangliosidosis caused by b galactosidase defect, GM2 gangliosidoses caused by hexosaminidase A defect, Fabry's disease caused by a galactosidase defect, Gaucher's disease caused by b glucosidase defect, Farber's disease caused by ceramidase defect (It is a granulomatous condition and it presents with painful subcutaneous nodules, hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary involvement)# Mucopolysaccharidoses* E.g., Hurler syndrome caused by a defect of L-iduronidase, Hunter syndrome caused by a defect of L-iduronate sulfatase.# Glycoprotein storage disorders* E.g., Fucosidosis, Mannosidosis# Mucolipidosis* E.g., I cell disease - caused by a defect of GlcNAC phosphotransferase. Because of this defect, the lysosomal enzymes are not labelled with mannose 6 phosphate. Mannose 6 phosphate is required as a label for targeting lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. In this condition, lysosomal enzymes do not reach lysosomes. They are secreted out. Lysosomes are empty bags. Hence all undigested glycoproteins and lipids accumulate within all cells as Inclusions, that is why the name I cell disease or Inclusion cell disease. This condition resembles hurler syndrome# Apart from this classification, there is also lysosomal transporter defects like cystinosis caused by a defect of efflux of cysteine from lysosomes. It is characterised by fanconi's syndrome, photophobia and characteristic cysteine crystals can be observed in cornea on slit lamp examination# All these disorders are autosomal recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome and Fabry's disease, both of which are X linked recessive disorders.# All lysosomal storage disorders present as hepatosplenomegaly, mental retardation, seizures with or without deafness and blindness.# Me Ardle's disease is not a lysosomal storage disorder. It is Glycogen Storage Disorder Type V (GSDIV). It is caused by Muscle Glycogen phosphorylase defect. It presents as exercise intolerance, intolerance to anaerobic exercises. Glycogen phosphorylase is not a lysosomal enzyme, it is a cytoplasmic enzyme.# The only Glycogen storage disorder which is also a Lysosomal Storage disorder is Type IIGSD or Pompe's disease, caused by alpha glucosidase defect.",C

Hypogastric sheath is a condensation of -,Scarpa's fascia,Colle's fascia,Pelvic fascia,Inferior layer of the Urogenital diaphragm,"Ans. C. Pelvic fasciaCondensations of endopelvic fascia-a. Although types of endopelvic fascia do not differ much in their gross appearance, some parts of the endopelvic fascia haveva much more fibrous consistency, containing an abundance of collagen and elastic fibers, and a scattering of smooth muscle fibers. These parts are often described as ""fascial condensations"" or pelvic ""ligaments.""b. Hypo gastric sheath is a thick band of condensed pelvic fascia. This fascial condensation is not merelya barrier separating the two potential spaces namely the retropubic space and presacral space. It gives passage to essentially all the vessels and nerves passing from the lateral wall of the pelvis to the pelvic viscera, along with the ureters and, in the male, the ductus deferens.c. As it extends medially from the lateral wall, the hypogastric sheath divides into three laminae (layers) that pass to or between the pelvic organs, conveying neurovascular structures and providing support. Because of the latter function, they are also referred to as ligaments.d. The anterior most lamina, the lateral ligament of the bladder, passes to the bladder, conveying the superior vesical arteries and veins.e. The posterior most lamina (lateral rectal ligament) passes to the rectum, conveying the middle rectal artery and vein.f. In the male, the middle lamina forms a relatively thin fascial partition, the rectovesical septum, between the posterior surface of the bladder and the prostate anteriorly and the rectum posteriorly.g.

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by: September 2012,Bacteria,Fungus,Protozoa,Virus,"Ans. D i.e. Virus Molluscum contagiosum (MC) It is a viral infection of the skin or occasionally of the mucous membranes, sometimes called water was. It is caused by a DNA poxvirus called the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). MCV has no nonhuman-animal reservoir (infecting only humans). There are four types of MCV, MCV-1 to -4; MCV-1 is the most prevalent and MCV-2 is seen usually in adults. The virus that causes molluscum is spread from person to person by touching the affected skin. The virus may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it, such as a towel, clothing, or toys. Molluscum can be spread from one person to another by sexual contact. This common viral disease has a higher incidence in children, sexually active adults, and those who are immunodeficient, and the infection is most common in children aged one to ten years old. MC can affect any area of the skin but is most common on the trunk of the body, arms, groin, and legs. It is spread through direct contact or shared items such as clothing or towels.",D

True about tropomysin is?,Lies on top of troponin,Lies on top of actin,ATP binds to it,Calcium binds to it,"ANSWER: (B) Lies on top of actinREF: Guyton 12th ed page 72-76SLIDING FILAMENT THEORY OF MUSCLE CONTRACTION:In resting muscle, the ends of the actin filaments extending from two successive Z discs barely begin to overlap one another. Troponin I is tightly bound to actin and tropomyosin covers the sites where myosin heads bind to actin i.e the tropomyosin molecules lie on top of the active sites of the actin strands, Thus, the troponin-tropomyosin complex constitutes a ""relaxing protein"" that inhibits the interaction between actin and myosin filaments to cause contractionIn contracted state, these actin filaments have been pulled inward among the myosin filaments, so their ends overlap one another to their maximum extent. Also, the Z discs have been pulled by the actin filaments up to the ends of the myosin filaments. Thus, muscle contraction occurs by a sliding filament mechanism.Actin filaments slide inward among the myosin filaments by forces generated by interaction of the cross-bridges from the myosin filaments with the actin filaments. Under resting conditions, these forces are inactive. But when an action potential travels along the muscle fiber, this causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release large quantities of calcium ions that rapidly surround the myofibrils. When the Ca2+ released by the action potential binds to troponin C, the binding of troponin I to actin is presumably weakened, and this permits the tropomyosin to move laterally. This movement uncovers binding sites for the myosin heads. ATP is then split and contraction occurs. Seven myosin-binding sites are uncovered for each molecule of troponin that binds a calcium ion. But energy is needed for the contractile process to proceed. This energy comes from high-energy bonds in the ATP molecule, which is degraded to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to liberate the energy.Molecular Basis of ContractionThe process by which the shortening of the contractile elements in muscle is brought about is a sliding of the thin filaments over the thick filaments. The width of the A bands is constant, whereas the Z lines move closer together when the muscle contracts and farther apart when it is stretched. The sliding during muscle contraction occurs when the myosin heads bind firmly to actin, bend at the junction of the head with the neck, and then detach. This ""power stroke"" depends on the simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP. Myosin-II molecules are dimers that have two heads, but only one attaches to actin at a time. The process by which depolarization of the muscle fiber initiates contraction is called excitation-contraction coupling.Steps in contractionDischarge of motor neuron.Release of transmitter (acetylcholine) at motor end-plate.Binding of acetylcholine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Increased Na+ and K+ conductance in end-plate membrane.Generation of end-plate potential.Generation of action potential in muscle fibers.Inward spread of depolarization along T tubules.Release of Ca2+ from terminal cisterns of sarcoplasmic reticulum and diffusion to thick and thin filaments.Binding of Ca2+ to troponin C, uncovering myosin-binding sites on actin.Formation of cross-linkages between actin and myosin and sliding of thin on thick filaments, producing movementSteps in relaxationCa2+ pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum.Release of Ca2+ from troponin.Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin.",B

"True about gap junctions are all, except ?",Transmit electric signals,Allow ions to pass,Intercellular space 1000 nm,Seen in cardiac muscle,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Intercellular space 1000 nm Gap junctions are intercellular connections consist of a pair of hemichannels (connexons) inseed into the membrane of adjacent cells. Each connexone is made of six identical protein subunits called connexins which enclose a central channel. When the corresponding connexons of adjacent cell link up end-to-end, they form a continuous channel that permits substances to pass through from cell to cell. At gap junctions, the intercellular space narrows down to 3nm, thereby helping in binding the cells together. o However, their real physiological significance lies in allowing ions to flow through them, i.e. they conduct ionic current. This enables electrical excitation to spread from cell to cell, as in smooth and cardiac muscles. The pore size of gap junctions decreases when intracellular Ca' is high or pH is low, both of which are commonly associated with cell damage. Closure of gap junctions in response to these stimuli isolates damaged cells so that the Ca+2 and 1-1+ do not spread from the damaged to normal cells.",C

There has been much speculation on the pathogenesis of group B streptococcal disease in the neonate.

Neonates acquire the disease during birth from mothers who harbor the organism. Risk factors include prematurity, premature rupture of membranes, and group B streptococcal carriage. The Gram's stain of cerebrospinal fluid is a rapid test for GBS disease. Although sensitive, the Gram's stain requires experience to differentiate these streptococci from other Gram-positive cocci. Latex tests for GBS antigen are also available, but sensitivity in CSF is not significantly higher than the Gram's stain. GBS can be reduced by intrapartum administration of penicillin. Experimentally, GBS polysaccharide vaccines have also been used. Screening pregnant females early in pregnancy probably offers little advantage because of the possible acquisition of GBS late in the pregnancy. There has been speculation concerning the pathogenesis of GBS. These include failure to activate complement pathways and immobilization of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) due to the inactivation of complement C5a, a potent chemoattractant. While GBS is relatively more resistant to penicillin than group A streptococci, the great majority of GBS isolates are still penicillin-susceptible. An aminoglycoside such as gentamicin may be added to GBS treatment regimens due to the relative reduced susceptibility of some strains.",D

Neurotransmitter depleted in Parkinson's disease: September 2007,Dopamine,Acetylcholine,Glutamate,GABA,"Ans. A: Dopamine Parkinson's disease has both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic features. In this condition, which was originally described by James Parkinson and is named for him, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons degenerate. The fibers to the putamen are most severely affected. Dopaminergic neurons and dopamine receptors are steadily lost with age in the basal ganglia in normal individuals, and an acceleration of these losses apparently precipitates parkinsonism. Symptoms appear when 60-80% of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are lost. Parkinsonism is also seen as a complication of treatment with the phenothiazine group of tranquilizer drugs and other drugs that block D2 dopamine receptors.",A

Vitamin D is maximally found in: March 2011,Milk,Egg,Green leafy vegetables,Halibut liver oil,"Ans. D: Halibut liver oil Halibut liver oil is the richest source of vitamin D (and also vitamin A) Vitamin D It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in very few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, food, and supplements is biologically ine and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first occurs in the liver and conves vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D , also known as calcidiol. The second occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D , also known as calcitriol. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal mineralization of bone and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany. It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and reduction of inflammation. Serum concentration of 25(OH)D is the best indicator of vitamin D status. It reflects vitamin D produced cutaneously and that obtained from food and supplements and has a fairly long circulating half-life of 15 days. Serum 25(OH)D levels do not indicate the amount of vitamin D stored in body tissues. In contrast to 25(OH)D, circulating 1,25(OH)2D is generally not a good indicator of vitamin D status because it has a sho half-life of 15 hours and serum concentrations are closely regulated by parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphate. Levels of 1,25(OH)2D do not typically decrease until vitamin D deficiency is severe The flesh of fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils (Shark-30-100 microgram/ 100 gram; Cod-200-750 microgram/ 100 gram; Halibut-500-10,000 microgram/ 100 gram) are among the best sources. Small amounts of vitamin D are found in beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D in these foods is primarily in the form of vitamin D3 and its metabolite 25(OH)D3.",D
True about caisson's disease -,O2 release from tissues,CO2 release from tissues,"N, release from tissues","H, release from tissues","Ans. is 'c' i.e., N, release from tissues Caisson's diseaseo Caisson's disease, (also called decompression sicknessQ, Bendst Diver's Paralysis, Dysbarism) is a particular form of gas embolism, which occurs when individuals are exposed to sudden lowering of atmospheric pressure like - rapid ascend of scuba and deep sea divers0, individuals in unpressurized aircraft in rapid ascent (e.g., in pilotsQ), underwater construction workers and extra-vehicular activity from spacecraft.o When air is breathed at high pressure (e.g., during a deep sea dive), increased amounts of gas (particularly nitrogen) become dissolved in the blood and tissues. If the diver then ascends (depressurizes) too rapidly, the nitrogen expands in the tissues and bubbles out of solution in the blood to form gas emboli.o Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, it can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain, ischemia in tissues to paralysis and death,o The rapid formation of gas bubbles within skeletal muscles and supporting tissues in and about joints is responsible for the painful condition called the bends. In the lungs, edema hemorrhages, and focal atelectasis or emphysema may appear, leading to respiratory distress, the so-called chokes,o Treatment of gas embolism requires placing the individual in a compression chamber where the barometric pressure may be raised, thus forcing the gas bubbles back into solution. Subsequent slow decompression theoretically permits gradual resorption and exhalation of the gases so that obstructive bubbles do not re-form.",C

Which of the following is a superantigen ?,Cholera toxin,Diphtheria toxin,TSST,Vero-cytoxin,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., TSST Superantigens Ceain species of infectious microorganisms produce powerful, immunostimulatory and disease causing toxins called superantigen, so called because of their ability to polyclonally active large fraction ( up to 20% ) of T cell population. Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens stimulate very large numbers of T cells, without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to an excessive and dysregulated immune response with release of cytokines IL - 1, IL - 2, TNF - a and IF - y. Conventional antigens bind to MHC class I or II molecules in the groove of the cc 13 dimer (T cell receptor). In contrast, superantigen bind directly to the lateral poion of TCR 13 chain and MHC class II 13 chain, and stimulate T cells solely on 7 13 gene segment utilized independent of the D, J and y a - sequences present - Tf3 restricted T cell mitogens. Superantigens are capable of activating up to 20% of the peripheral T-cell pool, where as conventional antigens activate < I in 10, 000.

True about acute pancreatitis,Serum Amylase is diagnostic,CECT is preferred over USG in diagnosis,Grey Turner sign seen around the umbilicus,Alcohol is the MC cause,"Gall stones are the most common cause, alcohol being IInd most common. Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe fonn of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self-limited in --85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days. Surgical management is needed in cases of necrotic pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess and intervention in gall stone pancreatitis.

During gluconeogenesis reducing equivalents from mitochondria to cytosol are transported by -,Malate,Aspartate,Glutamate,Oxaloacetate,"↵

Gluconeogenesis is a reversal of the glycolytic pathway except for 4 thermodynamic barriers.
These 4 energy barriers are:-


Between pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate
Between fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate and fructose 6-phosphate
Between glucose 6-phosphate and glucose
Between glucose 1-phosphate and glycogen


Reducing equivalents (NADH+H+) are transported from mitochondria to cytosol in overcoming the 1"" barrier i.e. ­between pyruvate and phosphoenolpyruvate.
Conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate is achieved by 2 enzymes:-


Pyruvate carboxylase, a mitochondrial enzyme converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate (OAA).
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, present chiefly in the cytosol, converts OAA to phosphoenolpyruvate.


It is noted here that OAA is formed inside the mitochondria but the reaction to convert it into phosphoenolpyruvate occurs in cytosol and OAA is not permeable to the mitochondrial membrane.
The OAA is transferred to the cytosol by 2 mechanisms:-


By formation of Malate
By formation of Citrate


The conversion of OAA to Malate and further of Malate to phosphoenolpyruvate is depicted below. The reducing equivalents (NADH+.1-1+) are transferred across the mitochondrial membrane, along with transport of OAA in the form of malate.",A

True about active absorption of iron is: March 2009,Absorbed in distal ileum,Absorbed in stomach,Not absorbed in duodenum and proximal jejunum,Decreases following gastrectomy,"Ans. D: Decreases following gastrectomyIn adults, the amount of iron lost from the body is relatively small. The losses are generally unregulated, and total body stores of iron are regulated by changes in the rate at which it is absorbed from the intestine.Various dietary factors affect the availability of iron for absorption; for example, the phytic acid found in cereals reacts with iron to form insoluble compounds in the intestine. So do phosphates and oxalates.Most of the iron in the diet is in the ferric (Fe3+) form, whereas it is the ferrous (Fe2+) form that is absorbed. Fe3+ reductase activity is associated with the iron transpoer in the brush borders of the enterocytesNo more than a trace of iron is absorbed in the stomach, but the gastric secretions dissolve the iron and permit it to form soluble complexes with ascorbic acid and other substances that aid its reduction to the Fe2+ form. The impoance of this function in humans is indicated by the fact that iron deficiency anemia is a troublesome and relatively frequent complication of paial gastrectomy.Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. Some is stored in ferritin, and the remainder is transpoed out of the enterocytes by a basolateral transpoer named ferropoin 1. A protein called hephaestin (Hp) is associated with ferropoin 1. It is not a transpoer itself, but it facilitates basolateral transpo.In the plasma, Fe2+ is conveed to Fe3+and bound to the iron transpo protein transferrin. This protein has two iron-binding sites. Normally, transferrin is about 35% saturated with iron.Intestinal absorption of iron is regulated by three factors: recent dietary intake of iron, the state of the iron stores in the body, and the state of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow.",D

Coli, Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Fusobacterium use this method of gene transfer* Bacteriophages are viruses that parasitize bacteria* Most bacteriophages carry their genetic information (the phage genome) as a length of double-stranded DNA coiled up inside a protein coat.* Lysogenic conversion: Phage DNA integrated in bacterial chromosome as prophase - replicated stably as part of host cell chromosome - transferred to daughter cell.# In other words: ""This process by which the prophage DNA confers genetic information to a bacterium is called lysogenic or phage conversion.""# NOTE: In transduction, phage acts only as a vehicle carrying bacterial genes from one cell to another but in lysogenic conversion the phage DNA itself is the new genetic element.",B
Anemia which is associated with pancytopenia is,Hemolytic,Iron deficiency,Megaloblastic,All,"Ref Robbins 9/e p645 The morphologic hallmark of megaloblastic anemia is the presence of megaloblasts, enlarged erythroid precursors that give rise to abnormally large red cells (macrocytes). Granu- locyte precursors are also increased in size. Underlying this cellular gigantism is a defect in DNA synthesis that impairs nuclear maturation and cell division. Because the synthesis of RNA and cytoplasmic elements proceeds at a normal rate and thus outpaces that of the nucleus, the hematopoietic precursors show nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony. This maturational derangement contributes to the anemia in several ways. Many megaloblasts are so defective in DNA synthesis that they undergo apoptosis in the marrow (inef- fective hematopoiesis). Others mature into red cells but do so after fewer cell divisions, fuher diminishing the output of red cells. Granulocyte and platelet precursors are also affected (although not as severely) and most patients present with pancytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia).",C

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which participates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",A
Which of the following is an amine hormone -,TSH,T4,Insulin,FSH,"Ans. is'b' i.e., T4o Three general classes of hormone exist : -Proteins and polypeptideMost of hormones in the body are polypeptides and proteins. In general, polypeptides writh 100 or more aminoacids are called proteins, and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as peptides.Proteins and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough ER. They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins (precursors) that are not biologically active (preprohormone) and cleaved in the ER to form smaller prohormones. These are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packing into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. Vesicles are stored into cytoplasm and secretion of the hormones occur by exocytosis.The peptide/protein hormones are :-Hypothalamus Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), Growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRh), Growth hormone inhibitory hormone (GHIn), i.e., somatostatin, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).Anterior pituitary Growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone (THS) or thyrotropin, adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), leutinizing hormone (LH).Posterior pituitary ; - Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin, oxytocin.Thyroid gland : - CalcitoninPancreas : - Insulin, glucagon.Parathyroid : - ParathormonePlacenta : - Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), Human somatomammotropin.Kidney : - Renin, erythropoietinHeart: - Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)Stomach : - GastrinSmall intestine : - Secretin, Cholecystokinin (CCK)Adipocytes : - LeptinAngiotensin IISome of these peptide hormones are glycoproteins, i.e., they have sugar associated with proteins.

In the United States, low dietary intake is an infrequent culprit but is sometimes culpable in infants fed exclusively milk, the impoverished, the elderly, and teenagers subsist- ing predominantly on junk food. * Increased demands not met by normal dietary intake occur worldwide during pregnancy and infancy. * Malabsorption can occur with celiac disease or after gas- trectomy (Chapter 14). Regardless of the cause, iron deficiency develops insidiously. Iron stores are depleted first, marked by a decline in serum ferritin and the absence of stainable iron in the bone marrow. These changes are followed by a decrease in serum iron and a rise in the serum transferrin. Ultimately, the capac- ity to synthesize hemoglobin, myoglobin, and other iron- containing proteins is diminished, leading to microcytic anemia, impaired work and cognitive performance, and even reduced immunocompetence.",C

Inulin is used for the measurement of-,ECF,ICF,Plasma volume,Blood volume,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., ECF * The volume of the various body compartments can be measured by injecting into them an indicator substance (marker or dye) and estimating its volume of distribution.* Measurement of body fluid volumes is done by 'Dilution method' i.e., by knowing the diluted concentration of dye in the fluid. Suppose 5 gm of dye is added to a beaker containing unknown volume of water. After equilibrium, if the marker concentration in water is lg/100 ml, the waterin the beaker can calculated as follows : Volume of water =Total amount of marker--------------------Concentration of marker in water=5g-----1g/100 ml= 500 ml Volume of fluid =Total amount of marker injected------------------------------Concentration of marker in the fluid, to be measured* Most of the fluid are calculated directly by dilution method, except for intracellular fluid (ICF) and interstitial fluid. Both these are calculated indirectly by calculating other body fluids.ICF = Total body water volume - ECF volumeInterstitial fluid = ECF volume - Plasma volume* Dyes used for various fluid volume measurement are : -Fluid volumeDye/indicator usedTotal body water (TBW) volumeDeuterium oxide: D2O (most commonly used), tritium oxide (3H2O), Aminopyrine, AntipyrineExtracellular fluid (ECF) volumeInulin (most accurate), Sucrose, Mannitol, Sodium thiosulfate, Na22, I125- iothalamatePlasma volume (PV)Evans Blue (T-1824), Serum albumin labeled with radioactive iodine(I125)Blood cell volumeCr51 labeled RBC",A

Smoking is a risk factors for all the carcinoma except,Oral,Bronchial,Bladder,Thyroid,"Ref Robbins 9/e p415 Genetic Factors. Distinct molecular events are involved in the pathogenesis of the four major variants of thyroid cancer. As stated, medullary carcinomas do not arise from the follicu- lar epithelium. Genetic alterations in the three follicular cell- derived malignancies are clustered along two oncogenic pathways--the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K)/AKT pathway (Fig. 19-13). In normal cells, these pathways are transiently activated by binding of soluble growth factor ligands to the extracellular domain of receptor tyrosine kinases, which results in autophosphorylation of the cytoplas- mic domain of the receptor, permitting intracellular signal transduction. In thyroid carcinomas, as with many solid cancers (Chapter 5), gain-of-function mutations along components of these pathways lead to constitutive activation even in the absence of ligand, thus promoting carcinogenesis. Environmental Factors. The major risk factor predispos- ing to thyroid cancer is exposure to ionizing radiation, paicularly during the first 2 decades of life. In keeping with this finding, there was a marked increase in the incidence of papillary carcinomas among children exposed to ionizing radiation after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. Defi- ciency of dietary iodine (and by extension, an association with goiter) is linked with a higher frequency of follicular carcinomas.",D

Iron absorption takes place in which part of intestine-,Duodenum,Ileum,Jejunum,Colon,"Ans. is 'a' i.e.. Duodenum o Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum.Iron absorptiono Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum,o In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron.o Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron,o inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.o After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes.o A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin.o However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine,o Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases,o This regulation is mediated by ""iron metabolism regulatory' hormone"" i.e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption,o When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption,o Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites.Transport and storage of irono Iron is transported is blood in combination with a glycoprotein transferrin.o Iron is transported into cells through attachment of transferrin to specific membrane bound receptors,o Iron is stored as ferritin (major storage form) or haemosiderin.o Ferritin is a complex of iron and apoferritin (iron + apoferritin = ferritin).o Iron is mainly stored in reticuio-endothelial cells monocytes.'macrophages of liver, spleen, bonemarrow,o It is also stored in hepatocvtes (parenchymal cells of liver) and myocytes of skeletal muscles.Note :Iron is stored in ferritin in ferric form.Factors affecting iron absorptionA.

The part of peritoneal cavity that is most dependent in supine position?,Right subphrenic space,Lesser sac,Supramesocolic space,Right subhepatic space,"Ans. d. (Right subhepatic space) (Ref. BDC 3rd/Vol. Ill)Morison's pouch (Right subhepatic space), in a patient lying supine in bed, is the b part of peritoneal cavity. It is the deepest space of the four and the most common site of a subphrenic abscess, which usually arises from appendicitis, cholecystitis, a perforated duodenal ulcer or following upper abdominal surgery.Otherwise, Abscesses are most commonly found in pelvis, right subhepatic space and right subphrenic space.THE PERITONEAL CAVITY# The peritoneal cavity is the largest cavity in the body, the surface area of its lining membrane (2 m2 in an adult) being nearly equal to that of the skin.# It is the space between the parietal and visceral layers (continuous with one another) and is lubricated by serous fluid. It can be divided into the greater sac and smaller lesser sac, which lies behind the stomach.# The greater sac of the peritoneum is divided into- (a) the subphrenic spaces,- (b) the pelvis, and- (c) the peritoneal cavity proper.# The peritoneal cavity proper is redivided by the transverse colon and transverse mesocolon into -- supracolic and- infracolic compartment.# When the supracolic compartment overflows, as is often the case when a peptic ulcer perforates, it does so over the colon into the infracolic compartment, or by way of the right paracolic gutter to the right iliac fossa, and thence to the pelvis.# Whereas the left is open to the pelvis medially, the right is bounded by the ascending mesocolon, which is continuous with the small-bowel mesentery. This boundary means that pathology within this space tends to follow the superior aspect of the small-bowel mesentery as it attempts to reach the pelvis, finally reaching the medial aspect of the caecum. Similarly, pathology within the left infracolic space will involve the superior aspect of the sigmoid mesocolon before being liberated into the pelvis (to reach the lateral paravesical spaces and pouch of Douglas). Negative intrathoracic pressure tends to drive pelvic fluid up the paracolic gutters.# However, although pelvic pathology may freely communicate with the right supracolic spaces (the right subphrenic and subhepatic spaces, and lesser sac) via the right paracolic gutter, the left gutter is partially bounded by the phrenicocolic ligament. This simple concept explains why metastases from ovarian carcinoma frequently involve the liver surface more often than the spleen.# When a visceral perforation occurs the free fluid which spills into the peritoneal cavity runs downwards, largely directed by the normal peritoneal attachments. For e.g., spillage from a perforated duodenal ulcer may run down the right paracolic gutter.",D
Which of the following undergo enterohepatic circulation?,Bilirubin,Biliverdin,PAHA (para amino hippuric acid),Bi linogen,"Substances are said to undergo an enterohepatic circulation (EHC) when they are excreted into the bile, pass into the lumen of the intestine, are reabsorbed and then return to the liver the circulation. Many endogenous and exogenous substances can undergo an EHC. Among the endogenous substances are the bile salts, the biliary lipids and biliary phospholipids, bilirubin, estrone and estriol, folic acid, vitamin B12, and urobilinogen. In contrast to bile salts, which undergo a highly efficient enterohepatic circulation, glucuronic acid conjugates of bilirubin are biliary excretory molecules that in health do not have a continuing biologic life. Intestinal absorptive cells are devoid of recapture transpoers for bilirubin conjugates, and their large size and polarity prevent absorption by passive diffusion. However, unconjugated bilirubin can be absorbed passively from any pa of the small and large intestines. This can occur only if unconjugated bilirubin is kept in solution and does not undergo rapid bacterial reduction to form urobilinoids. Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), a derivative of hippuric acid, is a diagnostic agent useful in medical tests involving the kidney used in the measurement of renal plasma flow. It filters freely through the glomerular membranes. Urobilinogen is a colourless by-product of bilirubin reduction. It is formed in the intestines by bacterial action on bilirubin. About half of the urobilinogen formed is reabsorbed and taken up the poal vein to the liver, enters circulation and is excreted by the kidney.

A luminal cell membrane Na+ channel is the main pathway for Na+ reabsorption in:,Proximal tubule cells,Thick ascending limb cells,Distal convoluted tubule cells,Collecting duct principal cells,"Ans D. Collecting duct principal cellsNa+ reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells occurs via a Na+ channel called ENaC (epithelial sodium channel). Na+ reabsorption in proximal tubule cells is coupled to transport of solutes via cotransport (e.g., Na-glucose) and antiport (e.g., Na+/H+ exchanger) mechanisms. Na+ reabsorption in the thick ascending limb involves a Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and, in the distal convoluted tubule, a Na-Cl cotransporter. Collecting duct intercalated cells are primarily concerned with acid-base, not Na+, transport.",D

"If both the carotids are occluded proximal to the carotid bifurcation, it would cause",| BP and | hea rate,| BP and | hea rate,| BP and | hea rate,| BP and | hea rate,"Baroreceptors are located above the carotid bifurcation. When carotid aeries are occluded below the bifurcation, there would be a fall of pressure in the carotid sinus. This will reduce the stretch on its wall and the baroreceptors, being stretch receptors, decrease their discharge. The normal tonic effect of this discharge on the medullary VMC is inhibitory; the medullary vasoconstrictor area now escapes from that tonic inhibitory discharge. Carotid aeries supply blood to the brain; their occlusion may result in cerebral ischemia. However, increased BP and hea rate seen after their occlusion is NOT a result of VMC ischemia or CNS ischemic response. This may be concluded from two observations: If the carotid sinus nerves (IX N.) have been previously cut, abolishing the discharge of baroreceptors to VMC, rise in BP is not seen after carotid occlusion although there is cerebral ischemia. If the carotids are clamped beyond the carotid sinus baroreceptors, it produces cerebral ischemia but no rise in BP. Sectioning the carotid sinus nerves will produce the same effect as that of carotid clamping. decreased discharge to the VMC and a resultant increase in BP and hea rate. Carotid occlusion will also lead to reduced blood flow to the carotid body chemoreceptors; it will increase their discharge, resulting in an increased ventilatory drive and vasoconstriction as well.",A

The predominant isoenzyme of LDH in cardiac muscle is,LDH 1,LDH 2,LDH 3,LDH 5,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of two monomer types: H (for the hea) and M (for muscle) that combine to yield five LDH isozymes: HHHH (I1), HHHM (I2), HHMM (I3), HMMM (I4), and MMMM (I5). The relative propoions of each subunit in the cells of a paicular organ are determined by tissue-specific patterns in the expression of the H and M genes. Isozyme I1 predominates in hea tissue and isozyme I5 in the liver. Thus, when LDH levels rise in blood plasma, the identity of the injured tissue can be inferred from its characteristic pattern of LDH isozymes. In the clinical laboratory, individual isozymes can be separated by electrophoresis and detected using a coupled assay (Figure 7-12). While historicallyof impoance, the assay of LDH has been superseded as a marker for MI by proteins that appear in plasma more rapidly than LDH.Ref: Harper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Chapter 7; Enzymes: Mechanism of Action",A

Which of the following structures is found only in Gram-negative microorganisms?,Cell envelope,Exotoxin,Peptidoglycan,Periplasmic space,"This question requires you to appreciate the key structural difference between gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Most gram-negatives (other than exceptional microorganisms, such as Mycoplasma, that lack a cell wall) have a more complex cell envelope than gram-positive microorganisms. It includes both a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer membrane. Between these two membranes is the periplasmic space, which contains enzymes such as phosphatase and penicillinase, binding proteins for the transpo of various nutrients, and peptidoglycan, as well as a poion of the lipoprotein that firmly anchors the outer that a baby can form with an acute membrane to the peptidoglycan. Gram-positives do not have outer membranes. The cell envelope is incorrect because both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms have this structure, which is defined as all the layers that enclose the cytosol of the bacterium. It is the composition of the envelope that differs between gram-positives and gram-negatives. Exotoxin is not exclusive to gram-negative microorganisms, but is also found in some gram-positives. By contrast, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is found exclusively in gram- negatives. Peptidoglycan is found in the cell walls of both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Note that there is a larger amount of peptidoglycan in gram-positive microorganisms. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 2. Cell Structure. In G.F.

The mode of secretion of sebaceous gland is,Merocrine,Holocrine,Apocrine,Eccrine,"Sebaceous  Glands 
Sebaceous glands, producing an oily secretion, are widely  distributed all over the dermis of the skin, except for the palms and soles.
Sebaceous glands are holocrine in nature, i.e. they produce their secretion by complete fatty degeneration of the central cells of the alveolus, which are then replaced by the proliferating peripheral  cells. The secretion is under hormonal control, especially the androgens. The oily secretion of sebaceous glands is called sebum.

N2 diffuses from the tissues into the lungs along the partial pressure gradient. If the return to atmospheric pressure (decompression) is gradual, no harmful effects are observed; but if the ascent is rapid, N2 escapes from solution. Bubbles form in the tissues and blood, causing the symptoms of decompression sickness (the bends, caisson disease). Bubbles in the tissues cause severe pains, particularly around joints, and neurologic symptoms that include paresthesias and itchingLung damage causes air embolism and not vice versa. The problem of nitrogen narcosis can be avoided by breathing mixtures of 02 and helium, and deeper dives can be made. However, the high-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) develops during deep dives with such mixtures.

Which of the following injuries will most likely correspond to the symptoms of the physical examination?,Fracture of the medial epicondyle,Fracture of the glenoid fossa,Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus,Fracture of the anatomic neck of the humerus,"Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus often injures the axillary nerve, which innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles. Abduction of the humerus between 15deg and the horizontal is performed by the deltoid muscle. Lateral rotation of the humerus is mainly performed by the deltoid muscle, teres minor, and the infraspinatus. The deltoid and teres minor are both lost in this case. Fracture of the glenoid fossa would lead to drooping of the shoulder. Fracture of the anatomic neck of the humerus will similarly lead to a drooping of the shoulder but would not necessarily affect abduction of the humerus. It is also quite unusual.

Gastric emptying is mainly regulated by,neural reflexes,Enteric reflexes,Local hormones in stomach,Local hormones in duodenum,"Gastric emptying is mainly regulated by enteric reflexes. Regulation of gastric emptying is mainly by the inhibitory feedback signals from the duodenum that includes enterogastric reflex and hormonal feedback by cholecystokinin. Enterogastric reflex: When food enters the duodenum , multiple nervous reflexes are inititiated from the duodenal wall. They strongly inhibit the pyloric pump propulsive contractions and increase the tone of the pyloric sphincter. These reflexes are mediated by three routes: Directly from the duodenum to the stomach through the enteric nervous system in the gut wall(major role) Through inhibitory sympathetic nerve fibers to the stomach (minor role) Vagus nerves to the brainstem where they inhibit the normal excitatory signals transmitted to the stomach (minor role) Cholecystokinin is released from the mucosa of the jejunum in response to fatty substances in the chyme. This hormone acts as an inhibitor to block increased stomach motility caused by gastrin. Ref: Guyton and Hall 13th edition Pgno: 812",B

Action Potential is,Decremental phenomenon,Does not obey all or none phenomenon,K+ goes from ECF to ICF,Threshold stimulus is required,"All-or-Nothing Principle: Once an action potential has been elicited at any point on the membrane of a normal fiber, the depolarization process travels over the entire membrane if conditions are right, but it does not travel at all if conditions are not right. This principle is called the all-or-nothing principle, and it applies to all normal excitable tissues.The threshold for Initiation of the Action Potential: An action potential will not occur until the initial rise in membrane potential is great enough to create the positive feedback. This occurs when the number of sodium ions entering the fiber becomes greater than the number of potassium ions leaving the fiber. A sudden rise in membrane potential of 15 to 30 millivolts is usually required.Ref: Guyton; 13th edition; Chapter 5; Membrane Potentials and Action Potentials",D

Which of the following findings would implicate hepatitis B as the etiology?",Positive hepatitis B surface antigen,Positive antihepatitis B surface antibody,Positive antihepatitis A antibody,Positive antihepatitis B-core antibody,"The presence of hepatitis B surface antigen means actively replicating virus, and in the context of the history of recent needle-stick injury, this likely represents a hepatitis B infection. During the acute episode of disease, when there is active viral replication, large amounts of HBsAg and hepatitis B virus DNA can be detected in the serum, as can fully developed virions and high levels of DNA polymerase and HBeAg. Upon resolution of acute hepatitis B, HBsAg and HBeAg disappear from serum with the development of antibodies (anti-HBs and anti-HBe) against them. The development of anti-HBs is associated with elimination of infection and protection against reinfection. Anti-HBc is detected early in the course of disease and persists in serum for years. It is an excellent epidemiologic marker of infection, but is not protective. In patients with chronic hepatitis B, evidence of viral persistence can be found in serum. HBsAg can be detected throughout the active disease process, and anti-HBs does not develop, which probably accounts for the chronicity of the disease. However, anti-HBc is detected.

The role NK cells play is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the veebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. Typically, immune cells detect the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release, causing lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of antibodiesand MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction. They were named ""natural killers"" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing ""self"" markers of MHC class 1. This role is especially impoant because harmful cells that are missing MHC I markers cannot be detected and destroyed by other immune cells, such as T lymphocyte cells.",C

Source of energy in Kreb's cycle is -,NAD,NADP,NADPH,NADH,"Energetics of TCA cycles (Kreb's cycle)One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12-5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :-",D

Consequently, the intestinal mucosa overexpresses cAMP, resulting in a mild and self-limited secretory diarrhea. Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) does not express a toxin, but is seen to cluster over the colonic mucosa in some individuals. Although occasionally found in patients with chronic diarrhea, no clear mechanism for mucosal pathophysiology has been determined for EAEC. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), classically associated with strain O157:H7 and present in undercooked hamburgers, expresses a Shiga-like toxin that causes bloody diarrhea and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) does not express a toxin, but rather is pathogenic through its capacity to invade the colonic mucosa and evoke an inflammatory response. The resulting dysentery-like inflammatory diarrhea generally necessitates vigilant hydration, but no antibiotics are indicated. Ref: Brooks G.F. (2013). Chapter 15.

"All of the following are TRUE regarding myoglobinuria, EXCEPT:",Myoglobin is present in striated skeletal and cardiac fibers,200 g of muscle must be destroyed to color the urine visibly,Benzidine tests performed on urine is positive,The serum is deep red in color,"The red pigment myoglobin, responsible for much of the color of muscle, is an iron-protein compound present in the sarcoplasm of striated skeletal and cardiac fibers. Destruction of striated muscle, regardless of the cause liberates myoglobin, and because of its relatively small size, the molecule filters through the glomeruli and appears in the urine, impaing to it a burgundy-red color. Because of the low renal threshold for myoglobin, excretion of the pigment is so rapid that the serum remains uncolored. It is estimated that 200 g of muscle must be destroyed to color the urine visibly. As with hemoglobinuria, the guaiac and benzidine tests performed on urine are positive if myoglobin is present. Myoglobinuria should thus be suspected when the urine is deep red and the serum is normal in color. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 45.

"An individual has been determined to have hypertriglyceridemia, with a triglyceride level of 350 mg/dL (normal is <150 mg/dL). The patient decides to reduce this level by keeping his caloric intake the same, but switching to a low-fat, low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet. Three months later, after sticking faithfully to his diet, his triglyceride level was 375 mg/dL. This increase in lipid content is being caused by which component of his new diet?",Phospholipids,Triglycerides,Amino acids,Carbohydrates,"Dietary glucose is the major source of carbon for synthesizing fatty acids in humans. In a high-carbohydrate diet, excess carbohydrates are converted to fat (fatty acids and glycerol) in the liver, packaged as VLDL, and sent into the circulation for storage in the fat cells. The new diet has reduced dietary lipids, which lower chylomicron levels, but the excess carbohydrate in the diet is leading to increased VLDL synthesis and elevated triglyceride levels. Dietary amino acids are usually incorporated into proteins, particularly in a low-protein diet.",D
"A 24-year-old woman has a dull aching pain in the umbilical region, and flexion of the hip against resistance (psoas test) causes a sharp pain in the right lower abdominal quadrant. Which of the following structures is most likely inflamed to cause the pain?",Appendix,Bladder,Gallbladder,Pancreas,"The appendix is the most likely structure that is inflamed. It lies in the right lower quadrant, and of the choices provided, it is most closely associated with the umbilical region by way of referral of pain. The patient also exhibited a positive psoas sign when flexion of the hip against resistance was attempted. This is because the iliopsoas muscle group lies directly beneath the appendix, and upon flexion of this muscle group, contact and direct irritation to the appendix can occur. The bladder lies inferior to the umbilicus within the pelvis and is not related to the site of pain or with a positive psoas sign. The gallbladder lies inferior to the liver and is positioned in the upper right abdominal quadrant, which is superior to the umbilicus. It is not associated with a positive psoas sign. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and is positioned between the spleen and the duodenum. It therefore lies in the upper left quadrant and is superior to the umbilicus.

Vestibulo-ocular reflex is concerned with -,Archicerebellum,Flocculonodular lobe,Neocerebellum,Occipital lobe,"Ans. B. Flocculonodular lobeFUNCTIONAL DIVISIONS OF CEREBELLUM: -a. From a functional point of view, the cerebellum is divided into three parts. The nodulus in the vermis and the flanking flocculus in the hemisphere on each side form the vestibulo cerebellum (or flocculonodular lobe).b. This lobe, which is phylogenetically the oldest part of the cerebellum, has vestibular connections and is concerned with equilibrium and eye movements. The rest of the vermis and the adjacent medial portions of the hemispheres form the spino cerebellum, the region that receives proprioceptive input from the body as well as a copy of the ""motor plan"" from the motor cortex. By comparing plan with performance, it smooths and coordinates movements that are ongoing.c. The vermis projects to the brainstem area concerned with control of axial and proximal limb muscles (medial brainstem pathways), whereas the hemispheres of the spino cerebellum project to the brainstem areas concerned with control of distal limb muscles (lateral brainstem pathways). The lateral portions of the cerebellar hemispheres are called the cerebro cerebellum. They are the newest from a phylogenetic point of view, reaching their greatest development in humans. They interact with the motor cortex in planning and programming movements.d. Most of the vestibulocerebellar output passes directly to the brainstem; but the rest of the cerebellar cortex projects to the deep nuclei, which in turn project to the brainstem. The deep nuclei provide the only output for the spino cerebellum and the cerebro cerebellum. The medial portion of the spino cerebellum projects to the fastigial nuclei and from there to the brainstem. The adjacent hemispheric portions of the spino cerebellum project to the emboliform and globose nuclei and from there to the brainstem.e. The cerebro cerebellum projects to the dentate nucleus and from there either directly or indirectly to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus.",B

"A 42-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department after a fall from the balcony of her apartment. During physical examination there is an absence of heart sounds, reduced systolic pressure, reduced cardiac output, and engorged jugular veins. Which condition is most likely characterized by these signs?",Hemothorax,Cardiac tamponade,Hemopneumothorax,Pneumothorax,"Cardiac tamponade is a condition in which fluid accumulates in the pericardial cavity. It can result from pericardial effusion or from leakage of blood from the heart or proximal portions of the great vessels. The increased pressure within the pericardial sac leads to decreased cardiac filling during diastole and therefore reduced systolic blood pressure. Because of the reduced pumping capacity of the heart, there is increased pressure in the venous system, leading to the distension of the jugular venous system. Deep vein thrombosis often occurs in the lower limbs and increases the risk of pulmonary embolism. The other answers listed are conditions that affect pulmonary function rather than cardiac functions.",B
A 24-year-old female presented with pain during urination. Gram stain of the uncentrifuged urine revealed the presence of gram-negative rods. What virulence factor is essential for the survival of these uropathogenic bacteria in the urinary tract?,Pili,LPS (endotoxin),Heat labile toxin,Flagella,"Pili (a) or fimbriae are hair like structures that are found on the surface of many bacteria. They are composed of repeated subunits of the pilin protein. They promote bacterial adherence to each other and bacterial adherence to different host tissues. Uropathogenic E. coli colonize the urinary tract and resist the washing action of urine through their pili. The tip of the pilus contains a specific protein that recognizes a receptor on the host cell. The other choices are not involved in E. coli uropathogenesis. Capsules (e) are loose polysaccharide or protein layers that surround the gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. Capsules are antiphagocytic, protect the bacteria from hydrophobic molecules, and promote adhere of certain bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to host tissues. Flagella (d), which are anchored on the bacterial surface, are essential for bacterial motility. The heat-labile (c) and heat-stabile toxins are enterotoxins secreted by the enterotoxigenic E. coli. These toxins produce watery diarrhea by stimulating hypersecretion of fluids. LPS (b) composes the outer leaflet of the outer membrane in gram-negative bacteria and is an endotoxin, which stimulates innate immune responses.",A

Acclimatization to a high altitude is associated with which of the following changes?,Hyperventilation,Polycythemia,O2 dissociation curve shifts to right,Decreased concentration of systemic capillaries,"Oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve, is the curve relating percentage saturation of the oxygen carrying power of hemoglobin to the PO2. It has a characteristic sigmoid shape due to the T-R interconversion. In deoxyhemoglobin, globin units are tightly bound in a tense (T) configuration which reduces the affinity of the molecule for oxygen. When the first oxygen is bound, the bonds holding the globin units are released, producing a relaxed (R) configuration which exposes more oxygen binding sites. Thus, binding of one oxygen molecule increases the affinity of hemoglobin to bind other O2 molecules. Ascent to high altitude triggers a substantial rise in 2,3 DPG concentration in red blood cells. Factors causing shift of the curve to right includes: Fall in pH Rise in temperature Increase in 2, 3 BPG pH of the blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when PCO2 rises the curve shifts to right.

Severe muscular exercise causes,Lactic acidosis,Ketoacidosis,Hypothermia,| CPK levels,"Intense Exercise. When you exercise, your body uses oxygen to break down glucose for energy. During intense exercise, there may not be enough oxygen available to complete the process, so a substance called lactate is made. Your body can conve this lactate to energy without using oxygen. But this lactate or <a href="" acid</a> can build up in your bloodstream faster than you can burn it off. The point when lactic acid stas to build up is called the ""lactate threshold.""Inhibition of Pyruvate MetabolismLeads to Lactic AcidosisArsenite and mercuric ions react with the 'SH groups of lipoic acid and inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, as does a dietary deficiency of thiamin (see Chapter 44), allowing pyruvate to accumulate. Many alcoholics are thiamin deficient (both because of a poor diet and also because alcohol inhibits thiamin absorption), and may develop potentially fatal pyruvic and lactic acidosis. Patients with inherited pyruvate dehydrogenasedeficiency, which can be the result of defects in one or more of the components of the enzyme complex, also present with lactic acidosis, paicularly after a glucose load. Because of the dependence of the brain on glucose as a fuel, these metabolic defects commonly cause neurological disturbances. Inherited aldolase A deficiency and pyruvate kinase deficiency in erythrocytes cause hemolytic anaemia.

Juxtaglomerular apparatus is involved in regulation of-,Tubulo-glomerularfeedback,Glomerulotubular balance,Renal plasma flow,Urinary acidification,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Tubulo-glomerular feed back Tubulo-glomerular feedbacko To perform the function of autoregulation, the kidneys have a feedback mechanism that links changes in sodium chloride concentration at the macula densa with the control of renal arteriolar resistance. This feedback helps to ensure a relative constant delivery of sodium chloride to the distal tubule and helps prevent spurious fluctuations in renal excretion that would otherwise occur.o The tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism has two components that act together to control GFR : - i)An afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism (usually this component is referred to as tubuloglomerular feedback, and ii) An efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism.o These feedback mechanisms depend on the juxtaglomerular apparatus which consists of: (i) Macula densa, i.e., specialized epithelium of distal tubule where it comes in contact with afferent arteriole, (ii) Juxtaglomerular cells, i.e., modified smooth muscle cells of afferent arteriole, and (iii) Lads cells.i) Afferent arteriolar feedback mechanism :# Decrease in renal arteriolar pressure causes decrease in GFR and as a result low NaCl is delivered to distal tubules. This is sensed by macula densa and the signal is transmitted to afferent arterioles which causes decreased resistance of afferent arterioles. Decreased afferent arteriolar resistance increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure and therefore GFR.# The transmitter involves is adenosine which causes opening of Ca+2 channels.ii) Efferent arteriolar feedback mechanism :# Decreases GFR causes delivery of less NaCl to distal tubule, which is sensed by macula densa cells and the signal is transmitted to juxtaglomerular (JG) cells which secrete renin. As a result renin angiotensin system is activated and there is generation of angiotensin II which causes constriction of efferent arteriole. This results in increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and increased GFR.o It would be wise to know about glomerulotubular balance, which may be confused by tubuloglomerular feedback.o Glomerulotubular balance : - Tubular reabsorption in proximal tubules is load-dependent, i.e., when the GFR increase, the reabsorption of the filtrate in the proximal tubule increases proportionately. It occurs because tubular reabsorption is flow-limited. Because of glomerulotubular balance, the urinary Na+ output does not increase massively when the GFR increases.",A

Rate controlling enzyme of fatty acid synthesis,Thioesterase,Transacetylase,Acetyl-CoA carboxylase,Ke tacyl synthase,"Carboxylation of Acetyl CoA The first step in the fatty acid synthesis is the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to form malonyl CoA. The acetyl CoA carboxylase is not a pa of the multienzyme complex. But it is the rate-limiting enzyme. Biotin, a member of B complex vitamins, is necessary for this reaction (step 1 in Fig. 11.15). The enzyme is allosterically regulated, the major effectors being citrate (positive) and palmitoyl CoA (negative). The reaction is similar to carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. The elongation of the fatty acid occurs by addition of 2 carbon atoms at a time. But the 2-carbon units are added as 3-carbon, malonyl units. The whole reaction sequence occurs while the intermediates are bound to ACP (acyl carrier protein).Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 8th edition, page no: 137",C

Hypermethioninemia has also been found in infants receiving high-protein diets, in whom it may represent delayed maturation of the enzyme methionine adenosyl-transferase. Primary hypermethioninemia is caused by the deficiency of hepatic methionine adenosyltransferase. The majority of these patients have been diagnosed in the neonatal period through screening for homocystinuria. Affected individuals with residual enzyme activity remain asymptomatic throughout life despite persistent hypermethioninemia. Some complain of unusual odor to their breath and urine (boiled cabbage). A few patients with complete enzyme deficiency have had neurologic abnormalities related to demyelination (mental retardation, dystonia, dyspraxia). The gene for methionine adenosyltransferase is on chromosome 10q22. A novel defect, glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency, also causes isolated hypermethioninemia.",C

"Evaluation of an adult demonstrates chronic headaches accompanied by chronic mild nuchal rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid sampling demonstrates a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?",Herpes virus,Mumps virus,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Neisseria meningitidis,"Nuchal rigidity suggests meningitis. It is convenient to classify meningitis based on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings: 1) acute pyogenic meningitis if neutrophils are markedly increased; 2) acute lymphocytic meningitis if lymphocytes (alone) are markedly increased, and 3) chronic meningitis if lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts are increased. This patient has chronic meningitis. The classical cause of chronic meningitis is tuberculosis, whose etiologic agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Other causes include other indolent meningeal infections such as syphilis, brucellosis, and chronic fungal infections. The granulomas that are characteristic findings in other tissues may or may not be present in the meningeal tissue, and are usually not recognizable in CSF. Tubercular meningitis is now uncommon in this country. In immigrants from third world countries, a history of pulmonary tuberculosis may be distant, undiagnosed, or deliberately concealed.

Tangier's diseases are characterized by?,Low or absence of HDL,Deficiency of LPL,Low LDL concentration,Raised chylomicrons,"Ans. A. Low or absence of HDLa. Tangier disease is an inherited disorder characterized by significantly reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the blood. HDL transports cholesterol and certain fats called phospholipids from the body's tissues to the liver, where they are removed from the blood.b. HDL is often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" because high levels of this substance reduce the chances of developing heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Because people with Tangier disease have very low levels of HDL, they have a moderately increased risk of cardiovascular disease.c. Additional signs and symptoms of Tangier disease include a slightly elevated amount of fat in the blood (mild hypertriglyceridemia); disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy); and enlarged, orange-colored tonsils. Affected individuals often develop atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries.d. Other features of this condition may include an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), clouding of the clear covering of the eye (corneal clouding), and type 2 diabetes.",A

Role of growth hormone in spermatogenesis ?,Late division of spermatocytes,Early division of spermatogonia,Formation of Acrosomes,Stimulation of seoli and Leydig cells,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Early division of spermatogoniaGrowth hormone specifically promotes early divisions of spermatogonia themselves. In the absence of GH, spermatogenesis is severely deficient or absent.Growth hormone is also essential for general metabolic process in testis.Hormones involved in spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis is influenced by many hormones. Hormones required for spermatogenesis are FSH, LH, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormones inhibin and activin.FSH is responsible for initiation of spermatogenesis. It binds with seoli cells and spermatogonia and induces the proliferation of spermatogonia. It stimulates ceoli cells to secrete endrogen binding protein, inhibin, mullerian inhibing substance and estrogen.LH stimulates leydig cells to secrete testosterone.Testosterone is the principles hormone which directly stimulates spermatogenesis. It is responsible for the sequence of remaining stages of spermatogenesis (after initiatin by FSH). It is also responsible for maintenance of spermatogenesis.Estrogen is formed from testosterone (by aromatase) in seoli cells. It is essential for spermeogenesis (last step of spermatogenesis, i.e. formation of spermatozoa from spermatids).Growth hormone is essentialy promotes early division of spermatogonia.Inhibin plays an impoant role in regulation of spermatogenesis by feedback inhibition of FSH secretion.Activin stimulates FSH secretion and stimulates spermatogenesis.",B

The cycle of malaria parasite is in sequence of -,"1,2,3,4","1,3,2,4","1,4,2,3","1,4,3,2","Schizogony in the Human Host: Man is the intermediate host for malaria, wherein the asexual phase of the life cycle occurs. The sporozoites inoculated by the infested mosquito initiate this phase of the cycle from the liver, and the latter pa continues within the red blood cells, which results in the various clinical manifestations of the disease. Pre-erythrocytic Phase - Schizogony in the Liver: With the mosquito bite, tens to a few hundred invasive sporozoites are introduced into the skin. Following the intradermal deposition, some sporozoites are destroyed by the local macrophages, some enter the lymphatics, and some others find a blood vessel. The sporozoites that enter a lymphatic vessel reach the draining lymph node wherein some of the sporozoites paially develop into exoerythrocytic stages and may also prime the T cells to mount a protective immune response. The sporozoites that find a blood vessel reach the liver within a few hours. It has recently been shown that the sporozoites travel by a continuous sequence of stick-and-slip motility, using the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) family and an actin-myosin motor. The sporozoites then negotiate through the liver sinusoids, and migrate into a few hepatocytes, and then multiply and grow within parasitophorous vacuoles. Each sporozoite develop into a schizont containing 10,000-30,000 merozoites (or more in case of P. falciparum). The growth and development of the parasite in the liver cells is facilitated by a a orable environment created by the The circumsporozoite protein of the parasite. The entire pre-eryhrocytic phase lasts about 5-16 days depending on the parasite species: on an average 5-6 days for P. falciparum, 8 days for P. vivax, 9 days for P. ovale, 13 days for P. malariae and 8-9 days for P. knowlesi. The pre-erythrocytic phase remains a ""silent"" phase, with little pathology and no symptoms, as only a few hepatocytes are affected. This phase is also a single cycle, unlike the next, erythrocytic stage, which occurs repeatedly.",B

Mousy odour urine is present in:,Phenylketonuria,Maple syrup urine disease,Tyrosinemia,Homocystinuria,"Ans:A.)Phenylketonuria Phenylketonuria Biochemical Defect : An autosomal recessive disorder caused by multiple loss-of-function mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase or decreased tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for the enzyme. Pathophysiology : Phenylalanine hydroxylase is responsible for conveing phenylalanine into tyrosine . When this enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine builds up. High levels of phenylalanine lead to severe brain damage by competitively inhibiting amino acid transpo required for protein synthesis, impairing polyribosome stabilization, reducing myelin production, and decreasing the formation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Phenylalanine is also a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and thereby leads to hypopigmentation of the hair and skin. Clinical Manifestations : Mental and growth retardation ; microcephaly; decreased pigmentation (blonde and blue-eyed) ; eczema; ""mousy"" body odor; heavy perspiration; mousy urine odor; hypeonia,hyperreflexia. Lab findings: Phenylketones detected in urine (phenylacetate, phenyllactate, and phenyl-pyruvate); positive Guthrie test (measures phenylalanine in blood) at bih.

In endocytosis, two non cytoplasmic sides of membranes fuse. Endocytotic vesicles are generated when segments of the plasma membrane invaginate, enclosing a minute volume of extracellular fluid and is contents. The vesicle then pinches off as the fusion of plasma membranes seal the neck of the vesicle at the original site of invagination.There are two general types of endocytosis:-a) Phagocytosisb) PinocytosisPhagocvtosis:-Involves ingestion of large particles such as viruses, bacteria, cells or debris.Occurs only in specialized cells such as macrophages and granulocytes.Pinocvtosis:-Property of all cellsIt is a cellular uptake of fluid and fluid contents.It is of two types:-Fluid phase pinocytosis is a non selective process in which the uptake of a solute is simply proportionate to its concentration in the surrounding extracellular fluid.Absoipti ve pinocytosis is a receptor mediated selective process primarily responsible for the uptake of mac- romolecules. The vesicles formed dur-ing absorptive pinocytosis are derived from invagination (pits) that are coated on the cytoplasmic side with a Filamentous material.In many systems, Clathrin is the filamentous material. For e.g., LDL is internalised by means of coated pits containing the LDL receptors.",D

"Malabsorption is caused by all, EXCEPT:",Giardia,Ascaris lumbricoides,Strongyloides,Capillaria philippinensis,"Ascaris lumbricoides is the largest intestinal nematode parasite of humans, reaching up to 40 cm in length. Most infected individuals have low worm burdens and are asymptomatic. Clinical disease arises from larval migration in the lungs or effects of the adult worms in the intestines. It doesnot cause malabsorption. G. lambia may cause irritation and low-grade inflammation of the duodenal or jejunal mucosa, with consequent acute or chronic diarrhea associated with crypt hyperophy, villous atrophy or flattening, and epithelial cell damage. Stools may be watery, semisolid, greasy, bulky, and foul smelling at various times during the course of the infection. Strongyloides damages intestinal mucosa and causes malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal capillariasis is caused by ingestion of raw fish infected with Capillaria philippinensis. Subsequent autoinfection can lead to a severe wasting syndrome. If untreated, progressive auto infection can lead to protein-losing enteropathy, severe malabsorption, and ultimately death from cachexia, cardiac failure, or superinfection.

MCH restriction to antigen presentation is not done for,Killing of viruses by cytotoxic cells,Killing of bacteria by helper cells,T cells activation in autoimmunity,Graft rejection,"Ref Robbins 9/e p231-233 Immune Recognition of Allografts Rejection of allografts is a response mainly to MHC molecules, which are so polymorphic that most individuals in an outbred population differ in at least some of the MHC molecules they express (except, of course, for identical twins). There are two main mechanisms by which the host immune system recognizes and responds to the MHC mol- ecules on the graft (Fig. 4-23): * Direct recognition. Host T cells directly recognize the allo- geneic (foreign) MHC molecules that are expressed on graft cells. Direct recognition of foreign MHC seems to violate the rule of MHC restriction, which states that in every individual, all of the T cells are educated to recog- nize foreign antigens displayed by only that individual's MHC molecules. It is postulated that allogeneic MHC molecules (with any bound peptides) structurally mimic self MHC and foreign peptide, and so direct recognition of the allogeneic MHC is essentially an immunologic cross-reaction. Because DCs in the graft express high levels of MHC as well as costimulatory molecules, they are believed to be the major culprits contributing to direct recognition. The most impoant consequence of direct recognition is the activation of host CD8+ T cells that recognize class I MHC (HLA-A, -B) molecules in the graft. These T cells differentiate into CTLs, which kill the cells in the graft. Host CD4+ helper T cells may be trig- gered into proliferation and cytokine production by rec- ognition of donor class II MHC (HLA-D Indirect recognition. In this pathway, host CD4+ T cells recognize donor MHC molecules after these molecules are picked up, processed, and presented by the host's own APCs. This sequence is similar to the physiologic processing and presentation of other foreign (e.g., microbial) antigens. The activated CD4+ T cells then recognize APCs displaying graft antigens and secrete cytokines that induce inflammation and damage the graft. The indirect pathway is also involved in the pro- duction of antibodies against graft alloantigens; if these antigens are proteins, they are picked up by host B cells, and peptides are presented to helper T cells, which then stimulate antibody responses.",D

Which of the following is the genus of the bacterium most likely to be isolated from this patient's sputum?",Haemophilus,Klebsiella,"Streptococcus, alpha-hemolytic","Streptococcus, beta-hemolytic","The clinical and radiologic characteristics of this patient's condition are consistent with lobar pneumonia, a respiratory infection that, in its classic presentation, involves a single pulmonary lobe. In 90% to 95% of cases, the etiologic agent is Streptococcus pneumoniae (AKA pneumococcus), an alpha-hemolytic streptococcus present in the throat of 40% to 70% of healthy individuals. A small minority of cases of lobar pneumonia are due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococci, streptococci other than pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas, and Proteus. Penicillin is the drug of choice for pneumococcal pneumonia, but sputum cultures are necessary to identify the infectious agent and determine its antibiotic sensitivity. S. pneumoniae is a major cause of purulent meningitis in the elderly. Other alpha-hemolytic streptococci (viridans streptococci) cause subacute endocarditis in patients with previously altered cardiac valves. Streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci have been associated with dental caries. Bacteria belonging to the genera Haemophilus and Klebsiella cause respiratory infections; however, in immunocompetent individuals, these bacterial infections usually result in bronchopneumonia, which leads to multilobar, and often bilateral, pulmonary involvement. Beta-hemolytic streptococci cause countless infections in humans. Recall that classification of beta;-hemolytic streptococci is based on their surface antigens known as Lancefield antigens. Human diseases caused by this group of bacteria include: Streptococcus pyogenes (group A): pharyngitis, scarlet fever, erysipelas, impetigo, rheumatic fever, and glomerulonephritis.

Typical feature of olfactory sensation is?,High quantitative detection,Stimulus required is very small,Non volatile substance can stimulate,Different areas sense different smells,"The olfactory sensory neurons are located in a specialized por- tion of the nasal mucosa, the yellowish pigmented olfactory epi- thelium. In dogs and other animals in which the sense of smell is highly developed (macrosmatic animals), the area covered by this membrane is large; in microsmatic animals, such as humans, it is small. In humans, it covers an area of 5 cm2 in the roof of the nasal cavity near the septum (Figure 14-1). The human olfactory epi- thelium contains 10 to 20 million bipolar olfactory sensory neurons interspersed with glia-like suppoing (sustentacular) cells and basal stem cells. The olfactory epithelium is said to be the place in the body where the nervous system is closest to the external world. Each neuron has a sho, thick dendrite that projects into the nasal cavity where it terminates in a knob containing 10 to 20 cilia (Figure 14-2). The cilia are unmyelinated processes about 2 mm long and 0.1 mm in diameter and contain specific receptors for odorants (odorant receptors). The axons of the olfactory sensory neurons pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and enter the olfactory bulbs (Figure 14-1). New olfactory sensory neurons are generated by basal stem cells as needed to replace those damaged by exposure to the environment. The olfactory renewal process is carefully regulated, and there is evidence that in this situation a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) exes an inhibitory effect. BMPs are a large family of growth factors originally described as promoters of bone growth but now known to act on most tissues in the body during development, including many types of nerve cells.Ref: Ganon pg.no219",B

Fish odour syndrome can be prevented by intake of:,Choline,Niacin,Pantothenic acid,Riboflavin,"Ans. A. CholineTrimethylaminuria (Fish odour Syndrome) Trimethylamine is normally produced in the intestine from the breakdown of dietary choline and trimethylamine oxide by bacteria. Eggyolk and liver are the main sources of choline, and fish is the major source of trimethylamine oxide. Trimethylamine is absorbed and oxidized in the liver by trimethylamine oxidase (flavin containing monooxygenases) to trimethylamine oxide, which is odorless and excreted in the urine. Deficiency of this enzyme results in massive excretion of trimethylamine in urine. There is a foul body odor that resembles that of a rotten fish, which may have significant social and psychosocial ramifications. Restriction of fish, eggs, liver, and other sources of choline (such as nuts and grains) in the diet significantly reduce the odour.",A

"Which of the following statements is true regarding kappa, lambda and heavy chain immunogloblins ?",Coded in the same site of a chromosome,Coded in different sites of same chromosome,The chains are formed by genetic rearrangement after maturation,All,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., The chains are formed by genetic rearrangement after maturation Genetic rearrangement of antibody . During B cell development, diversity of the antigen binding variable region of Ig is generated by an ordered set of Ig gene rearrangement. . An antibody is composed of two identical light and two identical heavy chains, and the genes specifying them are found in the 'V' ( variable ) region and the 'C' ( constant ) region. . As the name suggests, genetic rearrangement occurs in variable region , constant region remains constant, i.e. there is no rearrangement at constant region. In the heavy chain, 'V' region there are three segments ; 'V', 'D' and . For heavy chain, there is first a rearrangement of D segment to J segment, followed by a second rearrangement between a V gene segment and the newly formed D-J sequence; the C segment is aligned to the V-D-J complex to yield a functional Ig heavy chain gene (V-D-J-C). . Similar rearrangements occur for light chain V- region except there are only two segments involved; 'V' and %Y. . Light chain rearrangement occurs during later stages. A functional K or X chain is generated by rearrangement of 'V' segment to J segment, ultimately yielding an intact Ig molecule composed of heavy and light chain.",C

Which of the following causes hydrolysis of Peptidoglycans?,Lysozyme,Lactoferrin,Protease,Aflatoxin,"The enzyme functions by attacking peptidoglycans (found in the cell walls of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria) and hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond that connects N-acetylmuramic acid with the fouh carbon atom of N-acetylglucosamine. It does this by binding to the peptidoglycan molecule in the binding site within the prominent cleft between its two domains. This causes the substrate molecule to adopt a strained conformation similar to that of the transition state. According to Phillips-Mechanism, the lysozyme binds to a hexasaccharide. The lysozyme then distos the fouh sugar in hexasaccharide (the D ring) into a half-chair conformation. In this stressed state, the glycosidic bond is easily broken. The amino acid side-chains glutamic acid 35 (Glu35) and aspaate 52 (Asp52) have been found to be critical to the activity of this enzyme. Glu35 acts as a proton donor to the glycosidic bond, cleaving the C-O bond in the substrate, whereas Asp52 acts as a nucleophile to generate a glycosyl-enzyme intermediate. The glycosyl-enzyme intermediate then reacts with a water molecule, to give the product of hydrolysis and leaving the enzyme unchanged",A

So, cholesterol must be transported from peripheral tissue to liver for excretion. This is facilitated by HDL and is called reverse cholesterol transport because it transports the cholesterol in reverse direction to that is transported from liver to peripheral tissues through VLDL - LDL cycle.Processo HDL is synthesized in liver and small intestine. Nascent HDL contain phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol and Apo-A, C, E. This nascent HDL is secreted into circulation where it acquires additional unesterified cholesterol from peripheral tissues. Within the HDL particle, the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin - cholesterol acetyltransferase (LCAT) to form cholesteryl ester and additional lipid are transported to HDL from VLDL and chylomicrons. Apo-A , activates LCAT.o There are two pathway by which this cholesterol is transported to liverIndirect pathwayCholesteryl ester is tranfered from HDL to VLDL and chylomicrons in exchange with triglyceride by the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).This cholesteryl ester is then transported to liver (see previous explanation).Direct pathwayHDL cholesterol can also be taken up directly by hepatocytes via the scavenger receptors class BI (SR-BI).",A

Once proteins have been assigned to appropriate vesicles, the vesicles themselves must be addressed so that they reach the correct cellular location. This is done using a specific SNARE protein. Coatomer proteins and clathrin are necessary to promote the 'nipping off' of segments of the membrane to form vesicles but are not involved in specific targeting. Reference: Harper; 30th edition",D

"A 7 year old boy presents to the pediatrician because his mother noticed a ""smoky"" color to his urine. Upon questioning the mother, it is revealed that the child suffered a sore throat several weeks ago that was left untreated. Physical examination reveals hypeension and mild generalized edema. Urinalysis is significant for red blood cell casts. Which of the following accurately describes the microorganism responsible for this child's illness?",It causes alpha-hemolysis on blood agar,It is catalase positive,It is coagulase positive,It is sensitive to bacitracin,"In this case, you need to figure out what disease the child has, what organism causes the disease, and which of the listed features is true of the microorganism. The disease in question is poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, as evidenced by the smoky urine, hypeension, edema, and red blood cell casts in the urine sediment. The history of the prior sore throat is a tip-off that this is a nonsuppurative sequelae of an infection due to Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta;-hemolytic Streptococci). You must remember the features of S. pyogenes. S. pyogenes can be differentiated from Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans Streptococci by its hemolytic pattern; it is beta-hemolytic, while the others are alpha-hemolytic . It can be distinguished from the other beta-hemolytic Streptococci by its sensitivity to the a ntibiotic bacitracin. Other impoant things to remember about S. pyogenes are its many virulence factors, including M protein, antiphagocytic capsule, hyaluronidase, streptolysins O and S, and erythrogenic toxins. 2nd option is incorrect because Streptococci are catalase negative, in contrast to Staphylococci, which are catalase positive. 3rd option is incorrect because S. pyogenes is coagulase negative. (In fact, a coagulase test should NOT be done on a catalase-negative organism.) The coagulase test is an impoant means of differentiating Staphylococcus aureus, which are coagulase positive, from all other species of Staphylococcus, which are coagulase negative.

Which of the following is most characteristics of granuloma,Epitheliod cell,Giant cells,Fibroblast,Endothelial cells,"ref Robbins 9/e p97-78 a granuloma is an organized collection of macrophages. In medical practice, doctors occasionally use the term ""granuloma"" in its more literal meaning: ""a small nodule"". Since a small nodule can represent anything from a harmless nevus to a malignant tumor, this usage of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term granuloma are the lesions known as vocal cord granuloma (known as contact granuloma), pyogenic granuloma and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of granulation tissue, not granulomas. ""Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma"" is a lesion characterized by keloid-like fibrosis in the lung, and is not granulomatous. Similarly, radiologists often use the term granuloma when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term ""granuloma"" requires a pathologist to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope. Histiocytes (specifically macrophages) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells (Langhans giant cell). The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as ""epithelioid"". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to epithelial cells. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with eosin. These changes are thought to be a consequence of ""activation"" of the macrophage by the offending antigen.",A

Hypehyroid state is characterized by ?,Increased protein synthesis,Decreased glycolysis,Lipolysis,Increased cholesterol,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., LipolysisIn hypehyroidism all effects of thyroid hormone are aggravated :-i) Calorigenic effect :- Thyroid hormones enhance oxygen consumption, and hence the basal metabolic rate (BMR). This may be at least paly due to increase in the activity of membrane Nall(' ATPase. Thyroid hormones also increase the number and activity of mitochondria, which may be the cause or the effect of increase in oxygen consumption. By increasing the BMR, thyroid hormones raise body temperature, loss of body weight and increase urinary nitrogen loss.ii) Growth and development :- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development.iii) Carbohydrate metabolism :- Thyroid hormones have both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic effects. The hypoglycemic effect is the increased glycolysis. The hyperglycemic effects are stimulation of glycogenolysis and glucoconeogenesis. The net effect is hyperglycemia and depletion of glycogen.iv) Fat metabolism :- Thyroid hormone stimulates both lipogenesis and lipolysis. The lipolysis exceeds lipogenesis. Thus thyroid hormones moblize fat from adipose tissue, leading to an increase in plasma concentration of FFAs.v) Protein metabolism : - Thyroid hormone has a protein anabolic effect but in large doses, it has a protein catabolic effect. Thus thyroid hormone increases both protein synthesis and protein degradation.vi) Cardiovascular effects :- The thyroid hormones increase the hea rate, cardiac contractility, stroke volume and cardiac output, and consequently also the systolic BP. But the diastolic BP may fall due to vasodilatation in several vascular beds with decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid hormones are paly mediated by potentiation of effects of catecholamines.vii) GIT :- Thyroid hormones increase GI secretion, absorption and motility.viii) Nervous system :- Thyroid hormones are essential for normal formation of synapses and myelination in the developing brain.ix) Respiratory system :- Thyroid hormones increase the rate and depth of respiration.About option a & dIn low concentration thyroid hormone increases protein synthesis, but in high concentration (as in hypehyroidism) it is catabolic.Hypehyroidism causes decrease in cholesterol due thyroxine induced increased LDL receptor synthesis in liver, and consequent increase in the removal of LDL from circulation.",C

The primary role of dietary carbohydrate is to provide enegyQ.The carbohydrates are not essential nutrient, because the carbon skeletons of amino acids can be conveed into glucose by gluconeogenesis. However the absence of dietary carbohydrates lit ketone body production, protein degradation & gluconeogenesis.Recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for carbohydrate is set at 130 gm/day for adults & children, based on the amount of glucose used by carbohydrate dependent tissues, such as brain and RBC.Adults should consume 45-60% of their total calories from carbohydrate and added sugars represent no more than 25% of total energy.Very low carbohydrate diets, providing only 20 gm/day, but permitting unlimited consumption of fat and protein promote weight loss because of high energy (ATP) cost of gluconeogenesis. Since there is a continual demand for glucose, there will be a considerable amount of gluconegenesis from amino acids; the associated high ATP cost must then be met by oxidation of fatty acids.Glycogen is the only carbohydrate in optionsMacronutrientRange (deg/o of energy)KCI gmCarbohydrate (No less than 130gm/ day)45 - 65 Protein10-354Fat20-259- n-6 only unsaturated FA5- 10 - n-3 Polyunsaturated FA0.6-1.2 Carbohydrate45-654No less than 130 gm/day - Added sugars - Fiber in men : 38 gm - in women: 25gm Quality of protein : Protein digestibility corrected aminoacid Scoring (PDCAAS)SourcePDCAAS valueAninial proteinEggMilk11 Beef / Poultry /Fish0.82- 0.92 Gelatin0.08Plant proteinSoyabean1 Kidney beans0.68 Whole wheat bread0.40",B

Hypervitaminosis D may cause all of the following EXCEPT:-,Remineralization of bone,Deposition of calcium in arteries,Renal calculi,Loss of appetite,"Hypervitaminosis D:

 Vitamin D is stored mostly in liver and slowly metabolised. 
Among the vitamins,  vitamin D is the most toxic in overdoses (10-100 times RDA). 
Toxic eﬀects of hypervitaminosis D  include demineralization of bone (resorption) and increased calcium absorption from the intestine,  Ieading to elevated calcium in plasma (hypercalcemia). Prolonged hypercalcemia is associated with  deposition of calcium in many soft tissues such as kidney and arteries. 
Hyper- vitaminosis D may lead  to formation of stones in kidneys (renal calculi). 
High consumption of vitamin D is associated with loss  of appetite, nausea, increased thirst, loss of weight

Key Concept:
Toxic eﬀects of hypervitaminosis D  include demineralization of bone (resorption) and increased calcium absorption from the intestine,  Ieading to elevated calcium in plasma (hypercalcemia).

What will happen if a bacteria acquires genes coding for restriction endonuclease aEUR',Bacteria will die as lacks methylase,It will damage the host cell,It will have capacity to divide & multiple many times,Enhances proof reading activity of that bacteria,"Bacteria will die as it lacks methylase Bacterias are susceptible to attack by viruses known as bacte- riophages. Bacterias have developed their defense mechanism to protect themselves .from the bacteriophages. The system that bacterias possese against the phage viruses is the restriction modification system? This system consists of restriction endonuclease enzyme and a methylase enzyme. Each bacterial species and strains have their own combination of restriction and methylating enzymes i.e., restriction modification system is species specific Restriction enzyme These are enzymes present in baeteria that recognize specific base sequences in the D.N.A. and, cut the DNA at that site (restriction site). - A restriction enzyme acts as biochemical scissors and are therefore called restriction endonuclease. Bacterias use this enzyme in defense against phage viruses (bacteriophages) When a phage virus infects bacteria it inses its DNA into bacteria so that it gets replicated The restriction enzyme prevents this replication by cutting the D.N.A of the phage virus into many pieces. - When a strain of bacterias lacking restriction enzyme is infected with phage virus most viruses can initiate a successful infection - When the same strain contains a restriction enzyme, however, the probability of successful infection decreases The presence of additional restrictive enzymes has multiplicative effect. A bacteria with four to .five restriction enzyme would be viually impregnable. The bacterial cell uses the restriction enzyme to cut the invading DNA of the virus at a specific site. This prevents the virus replication. But bacterial DNA will also contain sites that could be cleaved by the restriction enzyme. How is the bacterial cell protected. from auto destruction by restriction endonuclease???. Restriction enzyme usually occur in combination with one or two modification enzymes (DNN- methylasetransferase) that protects the cells own DNA from cleavage by the restriction enzytne Modification enzymes recognize the same DNA sequences as the restriction enzymes that they accompany, but, instead of cleaving the sequence they methylate one of the bases in each of the DNA strands. The methyl groups protrude in to the major groove of DNA at the binding site and prevents the restriction enzyme from acting upon it. ""So the viral DNA is restricted in the bacterial cell by restriction enzymes and the bacterial DNA is modified by the methylase and is provided protection from its own restriction enzyme"" -It is impoant to note that the restriction modification system is species specific i.e., each bacterial species has its own restriction modification enzyme. It is significant because the restriction enzyme may kill any virus that invade the bacteria but the methylase enzyme can only protect that paicular bacteria from lysis because it will recognize those bacterial DNA as host and protect it against restriction endonuclease. If a bacteria acquires new restriction endonuclease it would also lyse bacterial DNA because the bacteria does not have the species specific methylase enzyme to protect its DNA from the newly acquired restriction endonuclease.",A

Which of the following malarial parasites is the causative agent?,Plasmodium vivax,Plasmodium malariae,Plasmodium falciparum,Plasmodium ovale,"Plasmodium falciparum is a unicellular protozoan parasite of humans, and the deadliest species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans. 
The parasite is transmitted through the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito and causes the disease's most dangerous form, falciparum malaria. 
Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. 
A mature gametocyte is 8–12 μm long and 3–6 μm wide. 
Haemozoin is a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites, the hematophagous organisms such as malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.). 
In Plasmodium the food vacuole fills with hemozoin crystals, which are about 100-200 nanometres long and each contain about 80,000 heme molecules.
Detoxification through bio-crystallization is distinct from the detoxification process in mammals, where an enzyme called heme oxygenase instead breaks excess heme into biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide.

The sodium-potassium pump is an example of:,Active transport,Passive transport,Facilitated diffusion,Osmosis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Active transport Transport of substances through the cell membraneCell membrane is a 'lipid bilayer1 that allows the diffusion of only water and lipid soluble substances (O2, N2, & CO2) through it.Lipid bilayer is impermeable to most essential molecules and ions. These are transported inside the cell with the help of transport proteins.These transport proteins are of two typesIon channels- some transport proteins provide watery spaces all the way through the molecule. This allows free movement of water as well as selected ions or molecules through them.Carrier proteins - These carter proteins bind with molecules or ions that are to be transported and then changes its configuration. This conformational change in the carrier protein transports the substance across the membrane.Transport by carrier proteins are of 2 typesfacilitated diffusion - when carrier protein moves substances in the direction of their chemical or electrical gradient. Here no energy input is required, eg-glucose transport by glucose transporter, which moves glucose down its cone, gradient from the ECF to cytoplasm of cell.active transport - when carrier protein transports substances against their electrical and chemical gradients. This form of transport requires energy.In man this energy is provided by hydrolysis of ATP therefore active transport proteins are ATPase's, the most important of which is Na+, K+ATPase also k/a Na+ - K+ pump.",A

Blood agar is an example of: March 2010,Enrichment media,Enriched media,Selective media,Transpo media,"Ans. B: Enriched media A growth medium is considered differential if, when specific microbes are present, the medium or bacterial colonies themselves exhibit a color change that provides information about their identity. Blood agar (BAP) is a differential growth medium which is used to distinguish clinically significant bacteria from throat and sputum cultures. BAP contains 5% sheep blood. Ceain bacteria produce enzymes (hemolysins) that act on the red blood cells to lyse or break them down. Beta hemolysis means that the bacteria's hemolytic enzymes completely beak down the blood cells. The a-hemolysis pattern results in the media displaying clear halos around bacterial colonies. Alpha hemolysis (a-hemolysis) means that the bacterial enzymes only paially break down the blood cells. This results in the media showing a yellowish/greenish/brownish discoloration (like a bruise) around the colony, indicating incomplete hemolysis. Gamma hemolysis is essentially no hemolysis at all. The bacteria have no effect on the red blood cells, and there is no change to the color of the medium. Some of the terms for media are interchangeable. For example, the blood agar medium is an enriched medium but bacteria lysing red cells show a clearing around their colonies. Thus, it is an differential medium as well.",B

Whenever you see dog or cat bites in a question stem, consider Pasteurella multocida as a primary cause of wound infection. This organism is a sho, encapsulated, gram-negative rod demonstrating bipolar staining. Rapidly arising cellulitis is paicularly indicative of this organism. Brucella melitensis is a small, acapsular, gram-negative rod that causes brucellosis (undulant fever) and is associated with contact with goats or sheep. Brucella abous and Brucella suis are variants associated with contact with cows and pigs, respectively. The organisms enter the body through the skin or through contaminated dairy products, such as unpasteurized impoed goat's milk or cheeses. Eikenella corrodens is commonly found in human bites. It is a gram-negative rod that is pa of the normal flora of the human mouth. Francisella tularensis is a small, pleomorphic, gram-negative rod that causes tularemia (rabbit fever). It occurs most commonly in rural areas. Ref: Ray C.G., Ryan K.J. (2010). Chapter 36. Plague and Other Bacterial Zoonotic Diseases. In C.G. Ray, K.J. Ryan (Eds), Sherris Medical Microbiology, 5e.",D

Peripheral resistance is best indicated by:,Diastolic blood pressure,Pulse pressure,Systolic resistance in aoa as it increases in its length,"Mean aerial pressure, which is responsible for blood flow to an organ","Ans. a. Diastolic blood pressure Aerial hypeension is the result of abnormal flow/resistance relationships. Resistance to outflow consists of different components: the systolic component is the one generated by conductance vessels, whereas the diastolic component consists of peripheral resistance, which regulates peripheral blood supply due to the run-off of conductance vessels during left ventricular diastole. Thus, an increase in systemic resistance results in a rise in diastolic blood pressure. If the elasticity of conductance vessels decreases, diastolic run-off also decreases and diastolic blood pressure goes down. When this loss of elasticity occurs, the ejection force cannot be anymore offset by aerial distension, the pulse wave velocity increases and reflex waves to the hea arrive earlier, causing the systolic blood pressure to augment. Such an augmentation, together with decreasing diastolic blood pressure results in an enhancement of the pulse pressure. When the stroke volume is normal, an increase in pulse pressure is, therefore, a marker of altered conductance. However, if, due to loss of elasticity of the conductance aeries diastolic blood pressure goes down, increasing systolic pressure also protects against a decrease in mean pressure. Indeed, in conditions of elevated pulse pressure, the mean pressure can be normal or high, indicating that when evaluating blood pressure all components should be taken into consideration. A high systolic blood pressure associated with a normal mean blood pressure is suggestive of a normal peripheral resistance.'Diastolic PressureSystolic pressure is peak pressure reached during systole, similarly, diastolic pressure refers to lowest pressure during diastole.Diastolic blood pressure is an index to peripheral resistance.Elasticity of aoa and large aeries is mainly responsible for origin and maintenance of diastolic pressure (by Windkessel elastic recoil effect).Because the elasticity is higher in younger subjects, diastolic pressure is maintained and pulse pressure is narrow.Because the elasticity is lower in old persons, diastolic pressure is decreased and pulse pressure is widened.",A

Which of the following is not a Sarcolemmal proteins?,Sarcoglycan,Dystrophin,Dystroglycan,Perlecan 1,"The sarcolemma generally maintains the same function in muscle cells as the plasma membrane does in other eukaryote cells. It acts as a barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compaments, defining the individual muscle fiber from its surroundings. The lipid nature of the membrane allows it to separate the fluids of the intra- and extracellular compaments since it is only selectively permeable to water through aquaporin channels. As in other cells, this allows for the compositions of the compaments to be controlled by selective transpo through the membrane. Membrane proteins, such as ion pumps, may create ion gradients with the consumption of ATP, that may later be used to drive transpo of other substances through the membrane (Co-transpo) or generate electrical impulses such as Action potentials. Perlecan is a key component of the vascular extracellular matrix, here it interacts with a variety of other matrix components and helps to maintain the endothelial barrier function. Perlecan is a potent inhibitor of smooth muscle cell proliferation and is thus thought to help maintain vascular homeostasis. Perlecan can also promote growth factor (e.g., FGF2) activity and thus stimulate endothelial growth and regeneration.

In acute inflammation endothelial retraction leads to,Delayed transient increase in permeability,Immediate transient increase in permeability,Delayed prolonged increase in permeability,Immediate transient decrease in permeability,"ref Robbins 8/e p45,9/ep74 Several mechanisms may contribute to increased vascu- lar permeability in acute inflammatory reactions: * Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial cell con- traction occurs rapidly after binding of histamine, bra- dykinin, leukotrienes, and many other mediators to specific receptors, and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskel- eton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necro- sis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This reaction may take 4 to 6 hours to develop after the initial trigger and persist for 24 hours or more. * Endothelial injury results in vascular leakage by causing endothelial cell necrosis and detachment. Endothelial cells are damaged after severe injury such as with burns and some infections. In most cases, leakage begins immediately after the injury and persists for several hours (or days) until the damaged vessels are throm- bosed or repaired. Venules, capillaries, and aerioles can all be affected, depending on the site of the injury. Direct injury to endothelial cells may also induce a delayed prolonged leakage that begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days, and involves venules and capillaries. Examples are mild to moderate thermal injury, ceain bacterial toxins, and x- or ultraviolet irradiation (i.e., the sunburn that has spoiled many an evening after a day in the sun). Endo- thelial cells may also be damaged as a consequence of leukocyte accumulation along the vessel wall. Activated leukocytes release many toxic mediators, discussed later, that may cause endothelial injury or detachment.",C

Stain with parasite having charcot-laden crystals but no pus cells -,Giardia,Tenia,E. Histolytica,Trichomonas,"Microscopic appearance of ENTAMOEBA HISTOLYTICA-The cellular exudate is scanty and consists of a few pus cells, epithelial cells and macrophages. The red cells are aggregated and yellowish or brownish red in colour. Charcot-Leyden crystals are often present. But this finding is only suggestive, because they may also occur in some other bowel disorders such as ulcerative colitis and malignancy. In freshly passed motion unmixed with urine or antiseptics, actively motile trophozoites of E.histolytica can be demonstrated in unstained saline mounts. The presence of ingested erythrocytes clinches the identity of E.histolytica, as they are not found in any other intestinal amoeba. Stained films may not be necessary as a routine for diagnosis in acute cases, but trichrome or iron-haematoxylin stained films provide the most dependable identification and differentiation TEXTBOOK OF MEDICAL PARASITOLOGY,CKJ PANIKER,6TH EDITION,PAGE NO 24",C
Loffler's medium is?,Indicator medium,Selective medium,Enrichment medium,Enriched medium,"Ans. D. Enriched medium.Enriched mediumThe media containing ingredients which enhance their growth-promoting qualities are enriched media e.g. blood agar, chocolate agar and Loeffler medium.The usual media employed for cultivation of the diphtheria bacillus are Loeffler's serum slope and tellurite blood agar.Diphtheria bacilli grow on Loeffler's serum slope very rapidly and colonies can be seen in 6-8 hours, long before the other bacteria grow.TYPES OF Bacteriological Media MediaCommente.g.1.Ordinary culture mediaThese are routinely employed in a laboratorye.g. nutrient broth, nutrient agar, infusion broth and lysate media.2.Enriched mediaCertain organisms do not grow on ordinary nutrient media. They require growth- promoting ingredients such as blood, glucose, serum, egg, etc. The media containing ingredients which enhance their growth- promoting qualities are enriched mediae.g. blood agar, chocolate agar and Loeffler medium.3.Enrichment mediaEnrichment media are liquid media containing chemical constituents which inhibit some normal flora and allow pathogens which may be present in very small number in the specimen, to grow unhampered and thus enriching them. Isolated colonies of these organisms may be obtained by subculturing onto solid media.An example of enrichment media is selenite F broth used for primary isolation of enteric bacteria.4.Differential/ Indicator mediaDifferential media have got some chemical constituents which characterize different bacteria by their special colonial appearances in the culture e.g. MacConkey agar contains lactose as a substrate and neutral red as an indicator. Bacteria fermenting lactose produce acid and this will change the colour of the indicator and thus the colonies will turn red. The red lactose fermenting colonies can be differentiated from the pale non-lactose fermenting colonies.1. Eosin methylene blue (EMB), which is differential for lactose and sucrose fermentation2. MacConkey (MCK), which is differential for lactose fermentation3. mannitol salt agar (MSA), which is differential for mannitol fermentation4. X-gal plates, which are differential for lac operon mutants5. Selective mediaSelective media will selectively permit the growth of pathogens and inhibit the commensals. In addition, it may differentiate the pathogen from commensals that grow by the colour and opacity of the coloniese.g. blood tellurite medium for C. diphtheriae.Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar, which is selective for certain gram-negative bacteria, especially Legionella pneumophila6. Transport mediaTransport media are also frequently used to sustain the viability of organisms when a clinical specimen is to be transported from the periphery to laboratory.The transport medium prevents the outgrowth of contaminants during transit and sustains the pathogen.Cary and Blair and Stuart media.Venkat-Ramakrishnan(VR) medium for v. cholerae.Thioglycolate broth for strict anaerobes.Loeffler MediaIt is primarily used for the isolation of Corynebacterium diphtheriae from clinical specimens. It is also used to determine the proteolytic activity and pigment production of various microorganisms.PRINCIPLE:Recovery is further enhanced when Loeffler Media is used in combination with Potassium Tellurite CystineAgar Media and blood agar. On Loeffler Media, C. diphtheriae produces characteristic metachromatic granules that can be detected by staining with methylene blue; it also demonstrates the characteristic Chinese-letter formation which is due to the cells snapping off when they divide. With the above information, a presumptive identification can result in 16-18 hours. Loeffler Media enhances the demonstration of the organism's natural morphological and physiological characteristics, i.e. pigmentation.FORMULA: Approximate, per 250 ml of deionized filtered water.Loeffler Media: Beef Extract..................................0.75 gDextrose.......................................1.25Sodium Chloride.............................1.25Proteose Micro Peptone....................2.50Horse Serum.................................750.00 mlInterpretation:Corynebacterium diphtheriae BiotypesMetachromatic GranulesMorphologyMitisIntensely stainedLong, pleomorphic but rigid rodsintermediusCells frequently swollen with terminal granules Irregularly barredHighly pleomorphic with very long and short rodsgravisNo granules but alternate bands of light and dark blueShort rods with many cocci of pear-shaped formsAdditional Educational points:Stains1Congo redAmyloid; apple-green birefringence in polarized light (because of a-pleated sheets).2Giemsa'sBorrelia, Plasmodium, trypanosomes, Chlamydia.3PAS (periodic acid-Schiff)Stains glycogen, mucopolysaccharides; used to diagnose Whipple's disease.4Ziehl-NeelsenAcid-fast bacteria.5India inkCryptococcus neoformans.6Silver stainFungi, PCP, Legionella.",D

Significant titres of IHA is seen in all types of amoebiasis except-,Acute amoebic dysentery,Brain abscess,Liver abscess,Cyst passers,"Infection with E. histolytica does not necessarily lead to disease. Infact, in most cases it remains within the lumen of the large intestine, feeding on the colonic contents and mucus as a commensal without causing any ill effects. Such persons become carriers or asymptomatic cyst passers, as their stool contains cysts. They are responsible for the maintenance and spread of infection in the community. The infection may get spontaneously eliminated in many of them. Sometimes, the infection may be activated and clinical disease ensues. Such latency and reactivation are characteristic of amoebiasis.

Which of the following is associated with aging?,Reduced cross linkages in collagen,Increased free radical injury,Decreased Somatic mutations in DNA,Increased superoxide dismutase levels,"Free radicals are chemical species with a single unpaired electron in an outer orbital. Such chemical states are extremely unstable, and free radicals readily react with inorganic and organic chemicals; when generated in cells, they avidly attack nucleic acids as well as a variety of cel- lular proteins and lipids. In addition, free radicals initiate reactions in which molecules that react with free radicals are themselves conveed into other types of free radicals, thereby propagating the chain of damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a type of oxygen- derived free radical whose role in cell injury is well estab- lished. Cell injury in many circumstances involves damage by free radicals; these situations include ischemia- reperfusion (discussed later on), chemical and radiation injury, toxicity from oxygen and other gases, cellular aging, microbial killing by phagocytic cells, and tissue injury caused by inflammatory cells. There are different types of ROS, and they are produced by two major pathways (Fig. 1-18). * ROS are produced normally in small amounts in all cells during the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions that occur during mitochondrial respiration and energy genera- tion. In this process, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced in mitochondria by the addition of four elec- trons to generate water. This reaction is imperfect, however, and small amounts of highly reactive but sho-lived toxic intermediates are generated when oxygen is only paially reduced. These intermediates include superoxide (O2 * ), which is conveed to hydro- gen peroxide (H2O2) spontaneously and by the action of the enzyme superoxide dismutase. H2O2 is more stable than O2 * and can cross biologic membranes. In the pres- ence of metals, such as Fe2+ , H2O2 is conveed to the highly reactive hydroxyl radical * OH by the Fenton reaction.

The primary direct stimulus for excitation of central chemoreceptors regulating ventilation is?,>Increased ft,>Increased CO2,>Increased 02,>Decreased CO2,"increased 11+/Ref: Ganong 23/e p627-629] The primary direct stimulus for central chemoreceptors is increased Ir concentration in the CSF and brain interstitial fluid. (But the H+ conc. in the brain parallels the aerial PCO2 and not aerial H+ conc.) There are 2 types of chemoreceptors regulating ventilation: central chemoreceptors (located in brain stem, mainly medulla) and the peripheral chemoreceptors (aoic and carotid bodies). They regulate ventilation by resonding to increased aerial H+ conc., increased PaCO2, and decreased Pa02. Thus the peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidemia to cause hyperventilation; whereas central chemoreceptors are stimulated only by hypercapnia. Why the central chemoreceptors respond to blood PaCO2 and not to blood H+ cone?. Even though the central chemoreceptors are directly stimulated by H+ ions: the blood H+ ions are poorly permeable through the blood brain barrier and hence are not able to regulate ventilation through the central chemoreceptors. Whereas CO2 is highly permeable to the blood brain barrier. It enters the brain, where it is hydrated to give rise to H+ and HCO3- ions. Now these H+ ions directly stimulate the central chemoreceptors to regulate the ventilation. So the central chemoreceptors respond to changes in H+ ions in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain interstial which are brought about by changes in aerial PaCO2. Remember: The link between metabolism and ventilation is CO2 and not 02.",A

Tropical spastic paraparesis is caused by,Human T cell lymphotropic virus,Hepatitis B virus,Human immunodeficiency virus,Epstein Barr virus,"Oncogenic RNA Viruses The study of oncogenic retroviruses in animals has pro- vided spectacular insights into the genetic basis of cancer. However, only one retrovirus, the human T cell lympho- tropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), has been demonstrated to cause cancer in humans. HTLV-1 is associated with a form of T cell leukemia/lymphoma that is endemic in ceain pas of Japan and the Caribbean basin but is found sporadically elsewhere, including the United States. Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-1 has tropism for CD4+ T cells, and this subset of T cells is the major target for neoplastic transformation. Human infec- tion requires transmission of infected T cells through sexual intercourse, blood products, or breastfeeding. Leukemia develops only in about 3% to 5% of infected persons after a long latent period of 20 to 50 years. There is little doubt that HTLV-1 infection of T lympho- cytes is necessary for leukemogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms of transformation are not clear. The HTLV-1 genome does not contain a viral oncogene, and in contrast with ceain animal retroviruses, no consistent integration site next to a cellular oncogene has been discovered. Indeed, the long latency period between initial infection and devel- opment of disease suggests a multistep process, during which many oncogenic mutations are accumulated. The genome of HTLV-1 contains, in addition to the usual retroviral genes, a unique region called pX. This region contains several genes, including one called TAX. The TAX protein has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for cellular transformation. By interacting with several transcription factors, such as NF-kB, the TAX protein can transactivate the expression of genes that encode cytokines, cytokine receptors, and costimulatory molecules. This inappropriate gene expression leads to autocrine signaling loops and increased activation of promitogenic signaling cascades. Fuhermore, TAX can drive progression through the cell cycle by directly binding to and activating cyclins. In addition, TAX can repress the function of several tumor suppressor genes that control the cell cycle, including CDKN2A/p16 and TP53. From these and other observa- tions, the following scenario is emerging (Fig. 5-31): The TAX gene turns on several cytokine genes and their recep- tors (e.g., the interleukins IL-2 and IL-2R and IL-15 and IL-15R), setting up an autocrine system that drives T cell proliferation. Of these cytokines, IL-15 seems to be more impoant, but much remains to be defined. Additionally, a parallel paracrine pathway is activated by increased pro- duction of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, which stimulates neighboring macrophages to produce other T cell mitogens. Initially, the T cell prolifera- tion is polyclonal, because the virus infects many cells, but because of TAX-based inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the proliferating T cells are at increased risk for secondary transforming events (mutations), which lead ultimately to the outgrowth of a monoclonal neoplas- tic T cell population.",A

Toxic shock syndrome is caused by,Streptococcus pyogenes,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus albicans,Enterococcus Durans,"Toxic shock syndrome is a potentially fatal multisystem disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Present as fever, hypotension, myalgia, vomiting, diarrhea, mucosal hyperemia and an erythematous rash which desquamates subsequently. This is associated with infection of mucosal or sequestered sites by toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST)-Producing S.aureus strains usually belonging to bacteriophage group I.TSST type I (formerly known as enterotoxin type F or pyrogenic exotoxin C)is most often responsible, though enterotoxin B or C may also cause the syndrome . Staphylococcal enterotoxins and TSST -1 are superantigens which are a potent activator of T lymphocytes. Being Vbeta-restricted T cell mitogens, such superantigens stimulates large numbers of T cells without relation to their epitope specificity. This leads to excessive and deregulated immune response, with the release of cytokines interleukins 1,2, tumour necrosis factor and interferon gamma. This explains multisystem involvement and florid manifestation in staphylococcal food poisoning and TSS. Soft tissue infections with some M types of S.pyogens (1,3,12,28) may sometimes cause a toxic shock syndrome resembling staphylococcal TSS.

As the substrate concentration is increased, the substrate, by competing with the inhibitor, can overcome its inhibitory effects, and eventually, the normal Vmax is reached. A noncompetitive inhibitor will decrease the Vmax without affecting the binding of substrate to the active site, so the Km is not altered under those conditions. An activator of an allosteric enzyme will decrease the apparent Km without affecting Vmax (less substrate is required to reach the maximal velocity).",A

As they are being produced, they enter the cisternae of the RER, where the signal sequence, including the initial methionine, is removed. It is thus unlikely that the mature protein will contain an N-terminal methionine. Carbohydrate groups can be attached in the RER or the Golgi. Secretory vesicles bud from the Golgi, and the proteins are secreted from the cell by the process of exocytosis. If the proteins have a hydrophobic sequence that embeds in the membrane, they remain attached to the membrane and are not secreted and become membrane-bound proteins.",D

Triglycerides are transpoed from the liver to the tissues by,HDL,LDL,VLDL,Chylomicrons,"Synthesis of VLDL, They are synthesised in the liver from glycerol and fatty acids and incorporated into VLDL along with hepatic cholesterol, Apo-B-100, C-II and E. Apo-B-100 is the major lipoprotein present in VLDL when it is secreted. Apo-E and C-II are obtained from HDL in plasma. Metabolism of VLDL The half-life of VLDL in serum is only 1 to 3 hours. When they reach the peripheral tissues, apo-C-II activates LpL which liberates fatty acids that are taken up by adipose tissue and muscle. The remnant is now designated as IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein) and contains less of TAG and more of cholesterol. The major fraction of IDL fuher loses triglyceride, so as to be conveed to LDL (low-density lipoprotein). This conversion of VLDL to IDL and then to LDL is referred to as lipoprotein cascade pathway. A fraction of IDL is taken up by the hepatic receptors.Ref: DM Vasudevan - Textbook of Biochemistry, 6th edition, page no: 153",C

The cells are packed with mitochondria that supply energy to drive the apical H, K-ATPase, or proton pump, that moves H+ ions out of the parietal cell against a concentration gradient of more than a million-fold. At rest, the proton pumps are sequestered within the parietal cell in a series of membrane compaments known as tubulovesicles. When the parietal cell begins to secrete, on the other hand, these vesicles fuse with invaginations of the apical membrane known as canaliculi, thereby substantially amplifying the apical membrane area and positioning the proton pumps to begin acid secretion. The apical membrane also contains potassium channels, which supply the K+ ions to be exchanged for H+, and Cl- channels that supply the counterion for HCl secretion. The secretion of protons is also accompanied by the release of equivalent numbers of bicarbonate ions into the bloodstream, are later used to neutralize gastric acidity once its function is complete.Reference: Ganong review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 434",B

Guyton 11th/pg. pg. 477; Ganong Physiology 22nd ed. 651).The functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of each normal expiration, is important to lung function. Because its value changes markedly in some types of pulmonary disease, it is often desirable to measure this capacity. The spirometer cannot be used in a direct way to measure the functional residual capacity, because the air in the residual volume of the lungs cannot be expired into the spirometer, and this volume constitutes about one half of the functional residual capacity. To measure functional residual capacity, the spirometer must be used in an indirect manner, usually by means of a helium dilution method.LUNG VOLUMES Lung VolumeDefinitionNormal value1.Residual volume (RV)Air in lung at maximal expiration1..2L2.Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)Air that can still be breathed out after normal expiration2.2 L3.Tidal volume (TV)Air that moves into lung with each quiet inspiration500 ml4.Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)Air in excess of tidal volume that moves into lung on maximum inspiration3.3 L5.Vital capacity (VC)It is everything but the residual volume 5.4 L6.Timed Vital CapacityFEV10.787.Functional reserve capacity (FRC)RV + ERV.

Which of the following trace elements is important for conversion of procollagen to collagen -,Se,Cu,Zn,Mg,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cu o Lysyl oxidase is involved in stabilization of collagen cross-linking, wrhen tropocollagen molecules assemble to form collagen fibrils.o Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase;Biosynthesis of collageno The collagens are synthesized and secreted by specilized cells called fibroblasts0. Following steps occur in collagen synthesisPolypeptide chain synthesisSynthesis of polypeptide chains (a-chains) of collagen occurs in ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Collagen is synthesized as preprocollagen, which contains a leader or signal sequence along with main polypeptide chain.Post-translational modificationNewly synthesized collagen (polypeptide chains) undergoes extensive post-translational modification.In endoplasmic reticulum:- Signal (leader) sequence of preprocollagen directs the polypeptide chain into the lumen of RER from the ribosomes. As it enters the RER, signal sequence is enzymatically removed. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs to form hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Then glycosylation of hydroxylysine0 takes place in procollagen molecule. Then, three pro-a-chains assemble together to form triple helix0, which is helped by formation of intrachain and interchain disulfide (S-S) bonds in extension peptides (propeptides), (extension peptides are additional amino acid residues (100-300) on both amino and carboxy terminals). Winding starts from carboxy terminal end. After formation of triple helix, no hydroxylation of proline or lysine and glycosylation of hydroxy lysines take place.Golgi-Apparatus:- Procollagen is then transported to golgi apparatus w'here it is packed in the secretory vesicles and then secreted out of the fibroblasts.C) Extracellular (out side the fibroblasts) :- Following secretion from the fibroblast, extracellular enzymes called procollagen aminopeptidase and procollagen carboxypeptidase remove extension peptides (propeptides) from amino-and carboxy-terminal, respectively. By removal of extension peptides, procollagen is converted to tropocollagen (mature collagen monomer). Then, these triple helical tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble to form collagen fibrils. These tropocollagen molecules (which have aggregated into collagen fibrils) now become extensively cross linked0 covalently to produce mature collagen fiber. These cross-linked are further stabilized by lysyl oxidase that oxidatively deaminates the amino group of same lysine and hydroxylysine residues. The tensile strength of collagen is provided by these covalent cross-links between and within triple helical units (tropocollagen).",B

Which of the following compounds directly inhibits the expression of the HMG-CoA reductase gene?,Superoxide Dismutase,HMG-CoA,Isopentenyl pyrophosphate,Cholesterol,"The major regulatory enzyme of cholesterol metabolism, HMG-CoA reductase, is regulated by three distinct mechanisms. The first is phosphorylation by a cAMP dependent protein kinase. Phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase inactivates the enzyme. The other two mechanisms involve the levels of cholesterol. The degradation of the enzyme is controlled by cholesterol levels. a) The half-life of HMG-CoA reductase is regulated by cholesterol levels with high concentrations of cholesterol leading to a shoer half-life. b) The final regulatory mechanism involves control of the expression of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. High levels of cholesterol lead to a decrease in the mRNA levels coding for HMG-CoA reductase. Ref: Botham K.M., Mayes P.A. (2011). Chapter 26. Cholesterol Synthesis, Transpo, & Excretion. In D.A.

"True about iron absorption are all, except ?",Major site of absorption is duodenum,Stored as Ferritin,Absorbed in ferrous form,Pancreatic secretions improves the absorption,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Pancreatic secretions improves the absorption Iron absorption Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum. In diet iron occurs in two forms, haeme iron and inorganic (non-haeme) iron. Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form. After absorption ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes. A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin. However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin, some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine. Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases. This regulation is mediated by ""iron metabolism regulatory hormone"", i.e., hepcidin that inhibit iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, concentration of hepacidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepacidin also decreases release of iron from storage sites. Transpo and storage of iron Iron is transpoed is blood in combination with a glycoprotein transferrin. Iron is transpoed into cells through attachment of transferrin to specific membrane bound receptors. Iron is stored as ferritin (major storage form) or haemosiderin. Ferritin is a complex of iron and apoferritin (iron + apoferritin ferritin). Iron is mainly stored in reticulo-endothelial cells monocytes/macrophages of liver, spleen, bonemarrow. It is also stored in hepatocytes (parenchymal cells of liver) and myocytes of skeletal muscles. Note : Iron is stored in ferritin in ferric form.",D
White infract is seen in,Lung,Intestine,Hea,Ovary,"ref Robbins 8/e p674; 9/e p134,664-665 White infarcts occur with aerial occlusions in solid organs with end-aerial circulations (e.g., hea, spleen, and kidney), and where tissue density limits the seepage of blood from adjoining patent vascular beds (Fig. 3-17, B). Infarcts tend to be wedge-shaped, with the occluded vessel at the apex and the organ periphery forming the base (Fig. 3-17); when the base is a serosal surface, there is often an overlying fibrinous exudate. Lateral margins may be irregular, reflecting flow from adjacent vessels. The margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly hemorrhagic; with time, the edges become better defined by a narrow rim of hyperemia attributable to inflammation. Infarcts resulting from aerial occlusions in organs without a dual circulation typically become progressively paler and sharply defined with time (Fig. 3-17, B). By comparison, hemorrhagic infarcts are the rule in the lung and other spongy organs (Fig. 3-17, A).

Once beyond the cardia, they are usually passed in a few days. A plain radiograph of the abdomen, chest and neck should establish the site of radio-opaque objects. Oesophageal objects can be removed endoscopically under general anaesthesia. Button batteries must be removed within hours because if they remain in the oesophagus they can perforate into the trachea or aoa. Batteries in the stomach are either removed urgently or followed very closely with repeat x-rays over a couple of days. The need to remove sharp objects depends on their size, the age of the child and their position in the gut. Ingested magnets can cause entero-enteric fistulae when they fix to one another in adjacent loops of bowel. Battery ingestion in older children and young people may be a manifestation of self-harm. Inhaled foreign bodies cause sudden-onset coughing and stridor. If there is worsening dyspnoea or signs of hypoxia then the infant should be given back blows in a head-down position. Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich manoeuvre) can be used in older children.

Rosette shaped arrangement of cells is seen in,Thecoma of ovary,Ependymoma,Neurofibroma,Lymphoma,"An ependymoma is a glial tumor of the ependymal cells that line the center of the spinal cord and the ventricles of the brain. There are several different types of ependymoma cancers, which are also classified by grade. The three grades used for ependymoma cancers are determined by how closely the cancer cells resemble normal cells. The lower the grade, the more closely the cancer cells resemble normal cells. The different types of ependymomas appear in different locations within the spinal column or brain. Grade I tumors - These include subependymomas and myxopapillary ependymomas, and are typically slow growing. Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to appear at the lower end of the spinal column. Subependymomas appear near a ventricle in the brain. These ventricles are involved in the creation of cerebrospinal fluid. Grade II tumors - These are the most common ependymomas. Many ependymoma subtypes exist in this grade, including cellular, papillary, tancytic, RELA fusion-positive, and clear cell ependymomas. These may appear anywhere along the ventricular system where cerebrospinal fluid is produced. Grade III tumors - These are known as anaplastic ependymomas and are typically faster growing than the other grades. Anaplastic ependymomas are usually found in the skull, brain, and brain stem.

The electric dipolar nature of the water molecule is due to its structure which consists of two hydrogen atoms linked covalently to an oxygen atom.
Each of the hydrogen atom shares a pair of electrons with the oxygen atom.
Oxygen has a strong electron - withdrawing tendency and therefore it pulls shared electrons away from the hydrogen nuclei to lie more towards oxygen. Consequently, hydrogen atom acquires a localized partial positive charge.
Oxygen has two more pairs of electrons which remain unshared. These electrons impart a partial negative charge to oxygen.",C

"Some bacteriologic culture media are used for both selective and differential purposes. Which of the following media may be considered differential, but not selective",Mannitol salt agar,Blood agar plate,Blood agar containing X and V factors,Thayer-Main agar,"Culture techniques remain a major mechanism in the isolation and identification of specific microorganisms as etiologic agents of disease. While some bacteria may be isolated from a lesion or other clinical specimen in pure culture, more often the pathologic agent will need to be isolated from a mixture of many bacteria (including nonpathogenic normal flora). A selective medium contains an added chemical that will inhibit large numbers of unwanted bacteria (normal flora) and allow specific types to grow. For example, manuitol salt agar selects for Staphylococcus, Thayer-Main agar selects for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis, and bile-esculin agar is selective for enterococci (enteric streptococci). Differential medium will include a system to distinguish specific species within a selected group. The mannitol in mannitol salt agar will distinguish between Staphylococcus epidermidis (mannitol negative-nonpathogenic) and S. aureus (mannitol positive- pathogenic). X and V factors are used to identify species of Haemophilus. Factor X is heme and factor V is nicotinamide (NAD) or other coenzymes. X and V are supplied to the culture system by being placed on paper strips on the agar surface.

Which is not true about secondary immunoglobulin response is: March 2011,Predominance of IgG,Takes 5 days to appear,Depends on immunologic memory,May be repeated in physiological limits,"Ans. B: Takes 5 days to appear The secondary response is prompt, powerful and prolonged, with a shoer or negligible lag phase and much higher level of antibodies that lasts for long period (Antibody is predominantly IgG) Immune response The first time a harmful antigen is encountered in the body it triggers the primary immune response. Antibody formed in primary immune response is predominantly IgM For many days after an antigen has entered the body there are no antibodies produced in the bloodstream to fight the antigen. This lag period can last for as little as 10 days or as long as 4 weeks. During the lag phase, B-lymphocytes are preparing to become active so they can sta to divide and begin to produce antibodies. Soon antibodies specific for the harmful antigen begin to appear in the bloodstream and increase until they level off and then slowly decrease until the antibodies are barley detectable. Slowly as the primary immune response progresses, the quality of antibodies improves. The antibodies that are more effective in killing the invading antigens become predominant. The secondary immune response occurs after an antigen that has already been encountered reappears. For example, if someone had recovered from the flu and later encounters the same strain of that virus antibodies that were made specifically for that antigen will rise dramatically with almost no lag period. Also after the antigen has been killed the antibodies fall even slower than they did in the primary immune response. The most dominant antibodies are what signals the other immune cells to attack, thus the immune system is said to memory response.",B
Which of the following do not increase in isotonic exercise?,Respirator rate,Total peripheral resistance,Heart rate,Stroke volume,"Ans. B. Total peripheral resistance. (Ref. Ganong 23rd/pg. 80-81; Guyton 11th/pg. 80)During exercise, sympathetic stimulation of the heart increases contractility; and thus stroke volume. A decrease in venous compliance, caused by sympathetic stimulation, increases venous return to the heart; which also increases stroke volume by a Frank-Starling mechanism. The increased stroke volume, coupled with an increase in heart rate, cause an increase in cardiac output Systemic arterial pressure also increases in response to the increase in cardiac output. However, the fall in total peripheral resistance, which is caused by dilation of the blood vessels within the exercising muscles, results in a decrease in diastolic pressure. The pulmonary vessels undergo passive dilation as more blood flows into the pulmonary circulation. As a result, pulmonary vascular resistance decreases.Additional Educational points:Isometric Versus Isotonic Contraction# Muscle contraction is said to be isometric when the muscle does not shorten during contraction and isotonic when it does shorten but the tension on the muscle remains constant throughout the contraction.# In the isometric system, the muscle contracts against a force transducer without decreasing the muscle length. In the isotonic system, the muscle shortens against a fixed load. The characteristics of isotonic contraction depend on the load against which the muscle contracts, as well as the inertia of the load. However, the isometric system records strictly changes in force of muscle contraction itself. Therefore, the isometric system is most often used when comparing the functional characteristics of different muscle types.",B
Sencent cells are deficient in -,RNA polymerase,DNA polymerase,Telomerase,Helicase,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Telomerase o Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the end of eukary otic chromosomesQ.o In normal cells, telomeres get shortened in each replicated cycle.o After the telomers get shortened by a critical length, cell stops dividing and enters into Go phase (senscence).o However, germ ceilsQ, cancer cellsQ and stem cellsQ have an enzyme telomerase (telomerase activity ) which prevents telomer shortening.o Thus telomers are not shortened in these cells, and therefore these cells have ability to self replicate extensively,o Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomers (replication of end of chromosomeQ),o Thus, telomerase provide iongetivitv to the cellsQ which contain this enzyme.o Telomerase is absent from most of the somatic cellsQ and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle.o Senscent cells lack telomerase so their telomers get shortened by critical length and these cells remains in Go phase.",C

Which of these is not true about Cardio esophageal sphincter?,An anatomic sphincter can be found,Located at 40 cm from incisors,It has a pinch cock like mechanism,It has a flap valve mechanism,"ANSWER: (A) An anatomic sphincter can be foundREF: Gray's anatomy 40th ed ch: 71GASTROESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION : The upper esophageal sphincter (UES ) and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) mark the entrance and exit to the esophagus, respectively.These sphincters are defined by a high-pressure zone but can be difficult to identify anatomically. The UES corresponds reliably to the cricopharvngeus muscle, but the LES is more complex to discern. The opening from the oesophagus into the stomach is the cardiac orifice It is typically situated to the left of the midline behind the seventh costal cartilage at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. It is 10 cm from the anterior abdominal wall and 40 cm from the incisor teeth. The short abdominal part of the oesophagus curves sharply to the left as it descends and is continuous with the cardiac orifice. The right side of the oesophagus is continuous with the lesser curvature, the left side with the greater curvature. There is no specific anatomical cardiac sphincter related to the orificeThere are four anatomic points that identify the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ): two endoscopic and two external. Endoscopically, there are two anatomic considerations that may be used to identify the GEJ. The squamocolumnar epithelial junction (Z-Iine) may mark the GEJ provided the patient does not have a distal esophagus replaced by columnar-lined epithelium as seen with Barretts esophagus. The transition from the smooth esophageal lining to the rugal folds of the stomach may also accurately identify the GEJ. Externally, the collar of Helvetius (or loop of Willis), where the circular muscular fibers of the esophagus join the oblique fibers of the stomach, and the gastroesophageal fat pad are consistent identifiers of the GEJUnlike the rest of the esophagus, the musculature of the gastroesophageal junction (lower esophageal sphincter; LES) is tonicaily active but relaxes on swallowing. The tonic activity of the LES between meals prevents reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. The LES is made up of three components. The esophageal smooth muscle is more prominent at the junction with the stomach (intrinsic sphincter). Fibers of the crural portion of the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle, surround the esophagus at this point (extrinsic sphincter) and exert a pinchcock-like action on the esophagus. In addition, the oblique or sling fibers of the stomach wall create a flap valve that helps close off the esophagogastric junction and prevent regurgitation when intragastric pressure rises.Several anatomical and physiological factors normally prevent gastro-oesophageal reflux.The folds of gastric mucosa present in the gastro-oesophageal junctionThe mucosal rosette, contribute to the formation of a fiuid-and gas-tight seal. They also help to ensure that even low levels of tone within the lower oesophageal wall muscles may occlude the lumen of the junction against low pressures of gastric gas.The angle of the cardiac orifice may help to form a type of 'flap valve' and the length of abdominal oesophagus is buttressed externally by pads of adipose connective tissue at and below the level of the diaphragmatic hiatus.However, the major anti-reflux mechanism is the tonic contractions of the lower oesophageal musculature, which forms an effective high pressure zone (HPZ).The specialized smooth muscle of the wall of the lower oesophagus and the encircling fibres of the crural diaphragm exert a radial pressure that can be measured by a sensing device as it is withdrawn from the stomach into the oesophagus. If reflux is to be prevented, this pressure must always exceed the difference between the pressures on either side of the junction, i.e. the difference between intra-abdominal pressure (transferred to the stomach, and augmented by any contraction of the stomach wTall itself), and intrathoracic pressure (transferred to the oesophagus).",A

False about smooth muscle,Ca2+ is the excitation-contraction coupler,"The ""latch"" mechanism facilitates prolonged holding of contractions of smooth muscle",Shows the propey of plasticity,Musculature of uterus is made of multi unit smooth muscle,"Unitary smooth muscle is found primarily in the walls of hollow viscera like uterus, intestine, ureters. Multiunit smooth muscle is made up of individual units with few (or no) gap junctional bridges. It is found in structures such as the iris of the eye, in which fine, graded contractions occur. Depending on the activating stimulus, the Ca2+ increase can be due to influx through voltage- or ligand-gated plasma membrane channels, efflux from intracellular stores through the RyR, efflux from intracellular stores through the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel, or a combination of these channels. Smooth muscle behaves more like a viscous mass than a rigidly structured tissue, and it is this propey that is referred to as the plasticity of smooth muscle. .The ""latch"" mechanism facilitates prolonged holding of contractions of the smooth muscle.",D

Instead, they are attached to Hsp 70 chaperone proteins which hold them in extended form for delivery to the mitochondria. On reaching the mitochondria the protein binds to an outer membrane translocase (TOM) protein. This binding is helped by Hsp70, but as the protein translocates across the membrane the chaperones are removed and do not enter the mitochondrion. Proteins transpoed to the matrix or inner membrane are passed straight from the TOM translocase to an inner membrane translocase (TIM) which transfers them, still in extended form, to the matrix, and to the inner membrane. In the matrix, they are finally folded by mitochondrial chaperones and chaperonins. Reference: Harper; 30th edition",D

The graph below depicts a polymerase chain reaction in,DNA PCR,PCR,Nested PCR,Real time PCR,"A quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), also called real-time polymerase chain reaction, is a laboratory technique of molecular biology based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted DNA molecule. For one or more specific sequences in a DNA sample, quantitative PCR enables both detection and quantification. The quantity can be either an absolute number of copies or a relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes. The procedure follows the general principle of polymerase chain reaction; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses in ""real time"". This is a new approach compared to standard PCR, where the product of the reaction is detected at its end. Two common methods for the detection of products in quantitative PCR are: (1) non-specific fluorescent dyes that intercalate with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific DNA probes consisting of oligonucleotides that are labelled with a fluorescent repoer which permits detection only after hybridization of the probe with its complementary sequence to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA in cells or tissues.",D

Worms tend to migrate if drugs such as anesthetics or steroids are given, leading to bowel perforation and peritonitis, anal passage of worms, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Larvae migrating through lungs induce an inflammatory response (pneumonitis), especially after second infection, leading to bronchial spasm, mucus production, and Loeffler syndrome (cough, eosinophilia, and pulmonary infiltrates). It does not cause malabsorption.",B

Salvage purine synthesis refers to ?,Synthesis of purine from ribose-5-phosphate,Synthesis of purine from pyrimidine,Synthesis of purine nucleotides from purine bases,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Synthesis of purine nucleotides from purine bases Two impoant purine nucleotides are synthesized : (i) adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and (ii) guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Then AMP and GMP are conveed to other purine nucleotides like ADP, ATP, GDP, GTP etc. Purine nucleotides can be synthesized by two pathways - (1) De novo synthesis and (2) Salvage pathway. De novo pathway (De novo synthesis) In de novo pathway, the purine nucleotides are synthesized from amphibolic intermediates. Amphibolic intermediates are the intermediary metabolites of amphibolic pathways (eg. citric acid cycle) which have dual purposes, i e. they serve in catabolism as well as in anabolism. In de novo synthesis, purine ring is formed from variety of precursors is assembled on ribose-5-phosphate. Precursors for de novo synthesis are ? Glycine provides Ca, C5 and N7 Aspaate provides N, Glutamine provides N3 and N9 Tetrahydrofolate derivatives furnish C2 and C8 Carbon dioxide provides Co Salvage pathway of purine nucleotide synthesis Free purine bases (adenine, guanine and hypoxanthine) and purine nucleosides are formed in cells during the metabolic degradation of nucleic acids and nucleotides. These free purine bases and purine nucleosides are reused in the formation of purine nucleotides. This is called salvage pathway (salvage means propey saved from loss). Salvage synthesis requires far less energy than de novo synthesis.",C

Signal from Baroreceptors goes to ?,Caudal ventrolateral medulla,Rostral ventrolateral medulla,Nucleus of tractus solitarius,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medullaBaroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid aery and aoa, at specialized locations called sinuses.1) Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid aery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid aery. It is innervated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve.2) Aoic arch (aoic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aoic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve.The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aoic nerve/vagal fibers (from aoic sinus) are together called `Sinoaoic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure.Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaoic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaoic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area ofVMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP, thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases hea rate. Reduction in hea rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration.When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lower limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the hea rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BR Thus fall in BP due to change ofposture is very brief (Transient).",B

Dysmetria,Cerebellum,Cerebrum,Basal ganglia,Premotor coex,"Dysmetria refers to a lack of coordination of movement typified by the undershoot or overshoot of intended position with the hand, arm, leg, or eye. It is a type of ataxia. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale. The actual cause of dysmetria is thought to be caused by lesions in the cerebellum or by lesions in the proprioceptive nerves that lead to the cerebellum that coordinate visual, spatial and other sensory information with motor control. Damage to the proprioceptive nerves does not allow the cerebellum to accurately judge where the hand, arm, leg, or eye should move. There are two types of cerebellar disorders that produce dysmetria, specifically midline cerebellar syndromes and hemispheric cerebellar syndromes. Midline cerebellar syndromes can cause ocular dysmetria, Hemispheric cerebellar syndromes cause dysmetria in the typical motor sense that many think of when hearing the term dysmetria.

Which of the following Vitamins has been evaluated for the treatment of Fish odour syndrome:,Ribofalvin,Thiamine,Biotin,Niacin,"Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) also known as fish odour syndrome or stale Fish syndrome, is caused by defects in a protein called Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Riboflavin, a precursor of the FAD prosthetic group of FMOs may help maximize residual FMO3 enzyme activity in patients with Trimethylaminuria, allowing fuher breakdown of trimethylamine. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU): Fish odour syndrome or stale Fish syndrome. Trimethylaminuria (TMAU) is an inherited metabolic disorder that is characterised by an offensive body odour that smells like rotting fish. This odour is due to the excessive excretion of a protein called Trimethylamine (TMA) in the urine, sweat and breath. TMAU, also known as fish odour syndrome or fish malodour syndrome is caused by defects in a protein called Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3 (FMO 3). The FMO3 protein is an enzyme produced by the liver that functions mainly to break down nitrogen-containing compounds. TMA is consumed through the diet and is normally broken down through a process called N-oygenation. the abnormal function of FMO3 results in the body&;s inability to breakdown TMA from food sources, especially choline-rich foods, such as milk, eggs and peanuts. When this process doesnot work properly, TMA builds up and is released in the person&;s sweat, urine and breath. This causes the characteristic smell associated with TMAU. The offensive odour associated with TMAU can be minimized with special diets low in trimethylamine (TMA) or its precursor . Avoiding or minimizing intake of foods that contain choline, nitrogen , and sulphur may reduce the severity of body odour given off. Riboflavin a precursor of the FAD prosthetic group of FMOs, may help maximize residual FMO3 enzyme activity in patients with Trimethylaminuria, allowing fuher breakdown of trimethylamine.

It results from the sight, smell, thought, or taste of food, and the greater the appetite, the more intense is the stimulation. Neurogenic signals that cause the cephalic phase of gastric secretion originate from the cerebral coex and in the appetite centers of the amygdala and hypothalamus. They are transmitted through the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagi and then through the vagus nerve to the stomach. This phase of secretion normally accounts for about 20 percent of the gastric secretion associated with eating a meal.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology 23rd edition Page no: 432",A

A 30 year old veterinarian visits her obstetrician for a first-trimester prenatal check-up. She has no complaints.Routine physical exam is significant only for mild cervical lymphadenopathy. She is prescribed spiramycin but is noncompliant. Her baby is born with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible?,Isospora belli,Leishmania donovani,Plasmodium vivax,Toxoplasma gondii,"Humans become infected with Toxoplasma gondii by ingesting cysts in contaminated food or through contact with cat feces. The veterinarian in question was therefore paicularly at risk of infection. T. gondii is especially hazardous in pregnant women because the organism can be transmitted to the fetus through the placenta. (It is pa of the ToRCHeS group of congenital infections;Toxoplasma, Rubella, CMV, Herpes/HIV, Syphilis). Since infected mothers are usually asymptomatic, cases often go unnoticed. Occasionally, patients present with cervical lymphadenopathy, as did the veterinarian, and require treatment to prevent complications in the fetus. Though newborns are also often asymptomatic, they are at risk for developing the classic triad of chorioretinitis (at bih or later in life), hydrocephalus, and cerebral calcifications. Note that T. gondii is also a common cause of CNS infections (e.g., encephalitis) in HIV-positive patients. Isospora belli (choice A) is an intestinal protozoan that causes watery diarrhea, paicularly in the immunocompromised. Fecal-oral transmission of oocysts allows invasion of small intestinal mucosa, destroying the brush border. Leishmania donovani (choice B) causes kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), which is characterized by fever, weakness, weight loss, splenomegaly, and skin hyperpigmentation. It is prevalent in regions of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Russia, and China. The vector is the sandfly. Plasmodium vivax (choice C) causes malaria and is transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito, which introduces sporozoites into the blood. These differentiate into merozoites that destroy erythrocytes. Splenomegaly ensues. Other species of this organism also cause malaria: P. malariae and P. falciparum (which causes a more severe form of the disease). Note that sickle cell trait confers resistance to this disease.

Infection tends to spread to the mastoid bone, temporal bone, sigmoid sinus, base of the skull, meninges, and brain. Patients at increased risk include the elderly, those with diabetes, and the immunocompromised. Pseudomonas is also associated with many other clinical syndromes, including infection following traumatic wounds to the feet in persons wearing sneakers or rubber-soled shoes, since the organism can be cultured from the shoes. Must know: Haemophilus influenzae produces a variety of clinical syndromes. H.Influenzae is the third-most common cause of meningitis in children aged 1 month to 18 years. It is the most common cause of acute epiglottitis, the most common cause of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis, and the second-most common cause of otitis media.

Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase is inhibited by fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate.
If fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase becomes less sensitive to inhibition caused by fructose-2, 6-bisphosphate, its activity will increase and there will be increased conversion of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate (reaction catalyzed by fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase).
Thus, level of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate will decrease.

Which of the following is TRUE about Prions?,Defect in folding of proteins,Are virus encoded,Contain a single nucleic acid,Sensitive to nucleases,"Prions are infectious paicles that are composed solely of protein (i.e., they contain no detectable nucleic acid). The cellular form of the prion protein (PrPc) is encoded by the host's chromosomal DNA. There is a change in the conformation from the normal alpha-helical form (known as PrPC, or prion protein cellular) to the abnormal beta-pleated sheet form (known as PrPSC, or prion protein scrapie) is the impoant modification. The abnormal form then recruits additional normal forms to change their configuration, and the number of abnormal pathogenic paicles increases. Prions are much more resistant to inactivation by ultraviolet light and heat than are viruses. They are remarkably resistant to formaldehyde and nucleases.

Corpus luteum salvage hormone is:,b hCG,FSH,AFP,Estrogen,"Ans: a (b hCG) Ref: Ganong, 22nded, p. 449In humans, after fertilization corpus luteum enlarges in size (instead of regression as occurs in normal enstrual cycles). This occurs in response to human chorionic gonadotropin secreted by placenta.Corpus luteum:LH is responsible for the initial formation of corpus luteum. In the absence of pregnancy it begins to degenerate by 24th day ( 8th post ovulatory day) of the cycle and eventually gets replaced by corpus albicians. But during pregnancy corpus luteum is maintained till the 10th week of gestation by b hCG and it is the major source of progesterone during this period.hCG:* It's a glycoprotein with alpha and beta subunits.* Alpha subunit is identical to alpha subunit of LH. FSH & TSH.* Beta hCG is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts of placenta in to both maternal and fetal blood. It is used for pregnancy test.Detected in blood as early as 6th day of conception by RIA. Serum cone, doubles every 2 days.Detected in urine by 10th day--peaks in 70 days and returns to normal by 100th day.Disappears in urine after 2 days and from blood after 2 wks of delivery.Functions of hCG:1) Stimulates progesterone production ( LH like action).2) Stimulates Leydig cells of male fetus & development of male genetalia.3) Has some TSH like activity.HCG value should double every 2 days in normal pregnancy. When values are lower than normal/ slow rise/ plateauing of hCG titre, it indicates a threatened abortion/ ectopic pregnancy.High level of hCG are seen in:Multiple pregnancyChoriocarcinomaH. moleTrisomy 21 fetus (Down syndrome)",A

Which one of the following statement is NOT TRUE for an a-helix structure of a protein?,It is one of the most impoant secondary structure,It has a net dipole moment,All hydrogen bonds are aligned in the same direction,Long stretches of left handed a-helices occur in proteins,The hydrogen bonds in secondary structure of proteins are hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds. The hydrogen bonds either form alpha helix or beta pleated sheet structure. Alpha helix can be either right handed or left handed. Left handed alpha helix is less stable than right handed alpha helix. Only right handed alpha helix has been found in protein structure. Beta pleated sheet structure is formed when hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl oxygen and amide hydrogen of two or more adjacent extended polypeptide chains. Thus hydrogen bonding in beta pleated sheet structure is interchain. The structure is not absolutely planar due to the angles of bonds. Ref: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry By Chatterjea page 90.,D

Leptotene: - During leptotene, homologous chromosomes (maternal and paternal copies of the same chromosomes), replicated in a preceding S phase and each consisting of sister chromatids joined at the centromere. Cytochrome begin to condense 2. Zygotene: - During zygotene, the homologous chromosomes initiate pairing / synapsis. The pairs of synapsed homologous are known as Bivalent. The sex chromosomes also sta to synapse during zygotene. 3. Pachytene: - When synapsis is complete for all chromosomes, the cell is said to be in pachytene. Each Bivalent look like a single thick structure, but is actually two pairs of sister chromatids held together by the synaptonemal complex. Genetic recombination between non-sister chromatids is completed at this point, with sites where it has occurred, appearing as recombination nodules in the center of the synaptonemal complex. 4. Diplotene: - During diplotene, the synaptonemal complex disassembles and pairs of homologous chromosomes, now much shoened, separated, except where crossing over has occurred (chiasmata). This process is called disjunction. In the ovaries: - Primary oocyte gets arrested in diplotene by the fifth month is utero and each remains at this stage until the period before ovulation.

The number of ATPs generated in Krebs cycle are,12,24,15,30,"ATP Generating Steps in TCA Cycle There are 3 NADH molecules generated during one cycle, each of them will give rise to 2 1/2 ATPs on oxidation by electron transpo chain (ETC); so altogether they will give 3 x 2 1/2 = 7 1/2 (7.5) high energy phosphates. The FADH2 will generate 1 1/2 molecules of ATP. In addition, one molecule of GTP (equivalent to one molecule of ATP) is formed by substrate-level phosphorylation. Hence, per turn of the cycle, 10 high energy phosphates are produced. These steps are marked in Figure 18.5 and in Table 18.1. The summary is shown in Box 18.2. Note: Recent work shows that in the electron transpo chain, NADH produces only 2.5 ATPs and FADH only 1.5 ATPs. The old values (used in the Table 18.1. ATP generation steps Step Reactions no.

"A patient, who appears to be female, is found to be 46XY in genotype. The patient's vagina is very shallow, ending in a blind pouch, and there are palpable masses in the labia. The diagnosis of testicular feminization syndrome is made. Which of the following was most likely present during the early fetal life of this individual?",A streak ovary,A uterus,An oviduct,Mullerian inhibitory factor,"Testicular feminization is a disorder of the androgen receptor. Phenotypically, the patient appears female, but has a blindly ending vagina and lacks a uterus or other female internal reproductive organs. The patient has an XY genotype. Since the gene for testes determining factor (TDF) is on the Y chromosome, TDF will cause the indifferent gonad to develop into a testis containing Seoli cells. Seoli cells at this stage will secrete MIF, a substance that suppresses the paramesonephric ducts, preventing the formation of female internal reproductive organs. This patient would not have a streak ovary, a finding in Turner's syndrome that is associated with a 45,XO genotype. In fact, the patient would have testes, since the genetic complement contained a Y chromosome. The testes in individuals with testicular feminization syndrome are often undescended and are usually removed surgically. This patient would not possess a uterus or an oviduct. Both of these structures are derived from the paramesonephric duct, which is suppressed by MIF.",D

The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome typically appear during the newborn period and may include poor muscle tone (hypotonia), poor feeding, seizures, hearing loss, vision loss, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities. Affected children also develop life-threatening problems in other organs and tissues, such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. Children with Zellweger syndrome usually do not survive beyond the first year of life. The signs and symptoms of Zellweger syndrome typically become apparent within the first few hours or days of life. Affected newborns often have poor muscle tone (hypotonia); seizures; feeding difficulties; liver cysts with liver dysfunction.
Refsum disease is a rare neurologic disorder due to a metabolic defect that results in the accumulation of phytanic acid, which is found in dairy products and ruminant fat and meat. Phytanic acid is thought to have pathological effects on membrane function, protein prenylation, and gene expression.
Adult Refsum disease (ARD) is a rare genetic disease that causes weakness or numbness of the hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy).

"""Nerve terminals release chemicals"" release chemicals"" ? discovered by:",Dale,Withering,Domagk,Loewi,"D i.e. Loewi Otto Loewi discovered that nerve terminals or synapse release chemicals. In his most famous experiment, Loewi took fluid from one frog hea and applied it to another, slowing the second hea and showing that synaptic signaling used chemical messengers. Before Loewi's experiments, it was unclear whether signalling across the synapse was bioelectrical or chemical. Loewi's famous experiment, published in 1921, largely answered this question. He dissected out of frogs two beating heas: one with the vagus nerve which controls hea rate attached, the other hea on its own. Both heas were bathed in a saline solution (i.e. Ringer's solution). By electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, Loewi made the first hea beat slower. Then, Loewi took some of the liquid bathing the first hea and applied it to the second hea. The application of the liquid made the second hea also beat slower, proving that some soluble chemical released by the vagus nerve was controlling the hea rate. He called the unknown chemical Vagusstoff. It was later found that this chemical corresponded to Acetylcholine",D

Site of action of ADH is:March 2008,PCT,Vasa recta,Loop of henle,Collecting ducts,"Ans. D: Collecting ductsBecause one of its principal physiologic effects is the retention of water by the kidney, vasopressin is often called the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).It increases the permeability of the collecting ducts of the kidney, so that water enters the hypeonic interstitium of the renal pyramids.The urine becomes concentrated, and its volume decreases. The overall effect is therefore retention of water in excess of solute; consequently, the effective osmotic pressure of the body fluids is decreased. In the absence of vasopressin, the urine is hypotonic to plasma, urine volume is increased, and there is a net water loss. Consequently, the osmolality of the body fluid rises.",D

Dietary triglyceride is a major source of nutrient for the human body. It is digested mostly in the intestinal lumen by pancreatic lipase to release:,Lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acids,Glycerol and fatty acids,Diglyceride and fatty acids,2-Monoglyceride and fatty acids,"Ans. D. 2-Monoglyceride and fatty acidsa. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyzes triglyceride to form 2-monoglyceride and two fatty acids. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, not triglyceride, results in the formation of lysophosphatidylcholines. Although diglyceride is an intermediate in the hydrolysis of triglyceride by pancreatic lipase, the hydrolysis continues until 2-monoglyceride and fatty acids are formed. Pancreatic lipase does not hydrolyze triglyceride totally to form glycerol and fatty acids.b. Most fat digestion therefore begins in the duodenum, pancreatic lipase being one of the most important enzymes involved. This enzyme hydrolyzes the 1- and 3-bonds of the triglycerides (triacylglycerors) with relative ease but acts on the 2-bonds at a very low rate, so the principal products of its action are free fatty acids and 2-monoglycerides (2- monoacylglycerols). It acts on fats that have been emulsified (see below). Its activity is facilitated when an amphipathic helix that covers the active site like a lid is bent back.c. Colipase, a protein with a molecular weight of about 11,000, is also secreted in the pancreatic juice, and when this molecule binds to the -COOH-terminal domain of the pancreatic lipase, opening of the lid is facilitated. Colipase is secreted in an inactive proform and is activated in the intestinal lumen by trypsin. Another pancreatic lipase that is activated by bile salts has been characterized. This 100,000-kDa cholesterol esterase represents about 4% of the total protein in pancreatic juice. In adults, pancreatic lipase is 10-60 times more active, but unlike pancreatic lipase, this bile salt-activated lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of cholesterol esters, esters of fat-soluble vitamins, and phospholipids, as well as triglycerides. A very similar enzyme is found in human milk.d. Fats are relatively insoluble, which limits their ability to cross the unstirred layer and reach the surface of the mucosal cells. However, they are finely emulsified in the small intestine by the detergent action of bile salts, lecithin, and monoglyceride. When the concentration of bile salts in the intestine is high, as it is after contraction of the gallbladder, lipids and bile salts interact spontaneously to form micelles. These cylindrical aggregates, take up lipids, and although their lipid concentration varies, they generally contain fatty acids, monoglyceride, and cholesterol in their hydrophobic centers. Micellar formation further solubilizes the lipids and provides a mechanism for their transport to the enterocytes. Thus, the micelles move down their concentration gradient through the unstirred layer to the brush border of the mucosal cells. The lipids diffuse out of the micelles, and a saturated aqueous solution of the lipids is maintained in contact with the brush border of the mucosal cells",D

When carrier proteins move substances in the direction of their chemical or electrical gradients, no energy input is required and the process is called facilitated diffusion.- A typical E.g. is glucose transport by the glucose transporter, which moves glucose down its concentration gradient from the ECF to the cytoplasm of the cell.# B] Other carriers transport substances against their electrical and chemical gradients. This form of transport requires energy and is called active transport.- E.g. 1. ATPases is Na+-K+ ATPase pump.- 2. H+-K+ ATPases in the gastric mucosa and the renal tubules.- 3. Ca2+ ATPase pumps Ca2+ out of cells.- 4. Proton ATPases acidify many intracellular organelles, including Golgi complex and lysosomes.# Some of the transport proteins are called uniports, because they transport only one substance.# Others are called symports, because transport requires the binding of more than one substance to the transport protein and the substances are transported across the membrane together.- E.g. symport in the intestinal mucosa responsible for the cotransport by facilitated diffusion of Na+ and glucose from the intestinal lumen into mucosal cells.# Other transporters are called antiports because they exchange one substance for another.# C]. Some transport proteins are simple aqueous ion channels; many of these have special features that make them effective for a given substance such as Ca2+ or, in the case of aquaporins, for water. Many transport proteins are continuously open, and some are gated. Some are gated by alterations in membrane potential (voltage-gated), whereas others are opened or closed when they bind a ligand (ligand-gated).- A typical voltage-gated channel is the Na+ channel, and a typical ligand-gated channel is the acetylcholine receptor.- A ligand is often external (eg, a neurotransmitter or a hormone).- However, it can also be internal; intracellular Ca2+, cAMP, lipids, or one of the G proteins produced in cells can bind directly to channels and activate them.",A

Cyanosis may seen in: March 2013,Histotoxic hypoxia,Anemic hypoxia,Stagnant hypoxia,All of the above,"Ans. C i.e. Stagnant hypoxia Central cyanosis Often due to a circulatory or ventilatory problem that leads to poor blood oxygenatio in the lungs. It develops when aerial saturation drops to 85% or 75% (in dark-skinned individuals). Central cyanosis may be due to the following causes Central Nervous System (impairing normal ventilation): Intracranial hemorrhage, Drug overdose (Heroin) - Respiratory System: Pneumonia, Bronchilitis, Pulmonary hypeension - Cardiac Disorders: Congenital hea disease: TOF, Right to left shunts Blood: Methemoglobinemia, Polycythemia Others: High altitude Peripheral cyanosis Peripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to inadequate circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a blue colour. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear, however peripheral cyanosis can be observed without there being hea or lung failures. Peripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes: - All common causes of central cyanosis Reduced cardiac output (e.g. hea failure, hypovolemia) - Cold exposure - Aerial obstruction (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud phenomenon) - Venous obstruction (e.g. DVT) Differential cyanosis Differential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent ductus aeriosus . Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and pressure overload of the right ventricle occurs.

Which of the following structures is most likely compressed?",Portal vein,Inferior vena cava,Hepatic artery,Common bile duct,"The portal vein is compressed in its passage through the hepatoduodenal ligament, the anterior border of the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow). The veins of Retzius are located along the sides of the abdominal walls and communicate between tributaries of retroperitoneal parts of the gastrointestinal tract and veins of the body wall. In portal hypertension the portal blood cannot pass freely through the liver, and the portal-caval tributaries and their anastomoses become dilated. The inferior epigastric veins anastomose with the paraumbilical veins, which is the first branch off the hepatic portal vein. These would be the first affected in portal hypertension. The inferior vena cava is the main route of blood return to the right atrium and is posterior to the omental (epiploic) foramen (of Winslow); it would not likely be compressed due to herniation through the foramen. Compression of the proper hepatic artery in the hepatoduodenal ligament would not result in dilation of veins of Retzius but could conceivably diminish blood supply to the gallbladder and liver. Common bile duct compression would result in jaundice and increased serum bilirubin. The cystic duct joins with the hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Compression of this would lead to an inflamed gallbladder (cholecystitis).",A

The laboratory findings are classic for Type IIa hyperlipidemia. These patients have LDL receptor deficiencies and are at a great risk of advanced coronary atherosclerosis. Since it is autosomal dominant, the patient's father could have been affected as well. Type I hyperlipidemia, or familial hyperchylomicronemia, is caused by a lipoprotein lipase deficiency. These patients have high serum triglycerides and normal cholesterol. They do not have a substantially higher risk of atherosclerosis. Type IIb hyperlipidemia, or familial combined hyperlipidemia, presents as elevated serum LDL, VLDL, cholesterol, and triglycerides. These patients do have an increased incidence of atherosclerosis.

Microorganism motile at 25 degree Celsius but non-motile at 37 degree Celsius and shows actin binding polymerization to escape is:,Listeria monocytogenes,Campylobacter,Yersinia pestis,Streptococcus agalactiae,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Listeria monocytogenes L. monocytogenes is a short, gram positive, non-spore forming rod. The motility test rapidly differentiates listeria from diphtheroids that are members of the normal microbiota of the skin. The organism has several adhesion proteins (Ami, Fbp A, and flagellin proteins) that facilitate bacterial binding to the host cells and that contribute to virulence.It has cell wall surface proteins called internalins A and B that interact with E-cadherin, a receptor on epithelial cells, promoting phagocytosis into the epithelial cells. After phagocytosis, the bacterium is enclosed in a phagolysosome, where the low pH activates the bacterium to produce listeriolysin.This enzyme, along with two phospholipases, lyses the membrane of the phagolysosome and allows the listeriae to escape into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell. The organism proliferates, and ActA, another listerial surface protein, induces host cell actin polymerization, which propels them to the cell membrane. Pushing against the host cell membrane, they cause formation of elongated protrusions called filopods. These filopods are ingested by adjacent epithelial cells, macrophages, and hepatocytes, the listeriae are released, and the cycle begins again. L monocytogenes move from cell to cell without being exposed to antibodies, complement, or polymorphonuclear cells.",A

False about surfactant is?,Produced by Type II - alveolar epithelial cells.,Contains DPPC and Phosphatidyl glycerol,Is a lipid-surface tension lowering agent,Consists of 3 types of unique proteins in it.,"Ans. D. Consists of 3 types of unique proteins in it.SurfactantThe low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of Di palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P=2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema. It has been calculated that if it were not present, the unopposed surface tension in the alveoli would produce a 20 mm Hg force favouring transudation of fluid from the blood into the alveoli.Approximate Composition of Surfactant.ComponentPercentage CompositionDipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine62Phosphatidylglycerol5Other phospholipids10Neutral lipids13Proteins8Carbohydrate2Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Following secretion, the phospholipids of surfactant line up in the alveoli with their hydrophobic fatty acid tails facing the alveolar lumen. Surface tension is inversely proportional to their concentration per unit area. The surfactant molecules move further apart as the alveoli enlarge during inspiration, and surface tension increases, whereas it decreases when they move closer together during expiration. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled.Formation of the phospholipid film is greatly facilitated by the proteins in surfactant. This material contains four unique proteins: surfactant protein (SP)-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D. SP-A is a large glycoprotein and has a collagen-like domain within its structure. It has multiple functions, including regulation of the feedback uptake of surfactant by the type II alveolar epithelial cells that secrete it. SP-B and SP-C are smaller proteins, which facilitate formation of the monomolecular film of phospholipid. A mutation of the gene for SP-C has been reported to be associated with familial interstitial lung disease. Like SP-A, SP-D is a glycoprotein. Its full function is uncertain. However, SP-A and SP-D are members of the collecting family of proteins that are involved in innate immunity in the conducting airway as well as in the alveoli.",D

All are true about renal circulation except,Accounts about 25% of the cardiac output,Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure is 30mmHg,Renal coical blood flow is more than renal medullary blood flow,Autoregulation of RBF is by myogenic mechanism,"In a resting adult, the kidneys receive 1.2-1.3 L of blood per minute, or just under 25% of the cardiac output. When the mean systemic aerial pressure is 100 mm Hg, the glomerular capillary pressure is about 45 mm Hg. The main function of the renal coex is filtration of large volumes of blood through the glomeruli, hence, renal coical blood flow is relatively great and little oxygen is extracted from the blood. When the kidney is perfused at moderate pressures (90-220 mm Hg in the dog), the renal vascular resistance varies with the pressure so that renal blood flow is relatively constant. Autoregulation occurs by a direct contractile response to stretch of the smooth muscle of the afferent aeriole. NO may also be involved. Maintenance of a relatively constant renal blood flow and GFR is the ability of individual blood vessels to resist stretching during increased aerial pressure, a phenomenon referred to as the myogenic mechanism.",B

What is Charles's Law?,PV = constant,V/T = constant,PV =nRT,None.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. V/T = constant Physical behavior of gases Gas pressure o The gas molecules are in continuous motion, moving through space at high velocity' and being deflected from their course only upon collision with other gas molecules or with boundries of the space in which they are contained. It would be obvious that greater the concentration of the molecules of the gas, the greater wrould be the force exerted by the molecules against the container at any given time. Therefore, the pressure of a gas is directly proportionate to its concentration. Boyle's law o At a constant temperature, the pressure (P) of a given mass is inversely proportionate to its volume (p a 1/v), i.e., PV = constant. Dalton's law of partial pressure o When a mixture of gases is present in a container, each gas exerts a pressure according to its own concentration, independent of the concentration of other gases present in the mixture. In other words, each gas behaves as if it was present alone. The pressure of each gas in mixture of gases is known as its partial pressure or tension. For example, environment air is a mixture of 21 % O2 and 79% N2. Therefore, the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) in the environmental air, at sea level (barometric pressure 760 mm Hg), would be 21 /100 x 760 = 160 mm Hg. Similarly, partial pressure of N2 (pH2) in the environmental air, at sea level, wrould be 79/100 x 760 = 600 mm Hg. Total pressure = pO2 + pN2 = 760 mm Hg. Water vapour pressure o The inhaled air is humified by the water vapours from the conducting passages. By the time it reaches the alveoli, it is saturated with water vapour. Therefore, in the alveolar air, besides N2 and O2, water vapour also exerts its partial pressure, which is 47 mm Hg. It is not affected by the presence or absence of other gases, or the atmospheric pressure. That means, there is a constant water pressure of 47 mm Hg once the air reaches the alveoli (in alveolar pressure). Partial pressure of gas dissolved in water and tissues o When a gas is brought in contact writh water, (or body tissues), some of the gas molecules move into water and get dissolved in it. But the dissolved gas molecules also tend to escape from the water. After a time the rate of escape equals rate of entry, i.e., equilbrium is reached. Henery's law states that the concentration of a gas in solution at equilbrium is directly proportional to its partial pressure in gas phase : - Concentration of dissolved gas = Partial pressure x Solubility coefficient o Solubility coefficient (absorption coefficient) of CO2 is 20 times greater than O2. Charles's law When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be directly related. this directly proportional relationship can be written as: or V/T = k Avogadro's hypothesis o Different gases at the same pressure and temperature contain the same number of molecules. Thus a gram molecule of any gas occupies a volume of 22.4 liters at STPD (00C, 760 m Hg pressure, dry). Gas equation o It is PV= nRT(P = pressure. V = volume, n = gram molecules of gas.

With toluidine blue stain, bipolar metachromatic granules can be demonstrated. A capsule is present. After an incubation period of about 2 weeks, the ""catarrhal stage"" develops, with mild coughing and sneezing. During this stage, large numbers of organisms are sprayed in droplets, and the patient is highly infectious but not very ill. During the ""paroxysmal"" stage, the cough develops its explosive character and the characteristic ""whoop"" upon inhalation. This leads to rapid exhaustion and may be associated with vomiting, cyanosis, and convulsions. The ""whoop"" and major complications occur predominantly in infants; paroxysmal coughing predominates in older children and adults. The white blood count is high (16,000-30,000/ uL), with an absolute lymphocytosis. Among provided options, T. pestis and B. pertussis produce bipolar metachromatic appearance, but considering the partial immunization status and age of patient, b. pertussis is answer of choice.",B

The following organism is motile with NO external flagella,Brucella,Mycoplasma,Chlamydia,Spirochetes,"(D) Spirochetes # Spirochetes: Elongated, motile, flexible bacteria twisted spirally along the long axis are termed 'spirochetes' (from Speira, meaning coil and chaite, meaning hair). They are structurally more complex than other bacteria. A characteristic feature is the presence of varying numbers of endoflagella, which are polar fiagella wound along the helical protoplasmic cylinder, and situated between the outer membrane and cell wall. Endoflagella are believed to be responsible for motility but the exact mechanisms of locomotion are not understood.> Brucellae are coccobacilli or short rods 0.5-0.7 urn x 0.6-1.5 pm in size, arranged singly or in short chains. The cells are so small that they may be mistaken for cocci, as was done by Bruce who called them Micrococcus melitensis. In older cultures, irregular forms appear. They are nonmotile, noncapsulated and nonsporing. They are Gram negative and nonacid fast. Bipolar staining is not uncommon.> Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living microorganisms, and one of the most pleomorphic.They occur as granules and filaments of various sizes. The granules may be coccoid, balloon, disc, ring or star forms. The filaments are slender, of varying lengths and show true branching. Multiplication is by binary fission, but as genomic.> Chlamydiae occur in two forms, the elementary body and the reticulate body (formerly also called the 'initial body'). The elementary body is the extracellular, infective form. It is a spherical particle, 200-300 nm in diameter, with a rigid trilamirar cell wall similar to the cell walls of Gram negative bacteria, and an electron dense nucleoid. The reticulate body is the intracellular growing and replicative form, 500- 1000 nm in size. Its cell wall is fragile and pliable, leading to pleomorphism.",D

Gentian violet colouration of gram-positive bacteria is due to -,Peptidoglycan,Capsule,Cell membrane,None of the above,"GRAM STAINING 
The gram stain differentiates bacteria into two broad groups
1. Gram-positive → Resist decolourization and retain primary stain, appear violet.
2. Gram-negative → Decolourised by organic solvents, and therefore, take the counterstain, appearing red. Smear stained with gentian violet (primary stain)
↓ Application of dilute solution of iodine
↓ Decolourisation with an organic solvent, e.g., ethanol
↓ Counterstaining by carbol fuchsin
↓ ↓ ↓ Retain primary stain (violet)
↓ Gram-positive Take colour of counterstain (red)
↓ Gram-negative 
Why do gram-positive organisms retain primary stain, but not gram-negative organisms.

 In gram-positive bacteria, there is a thick layer of peptidoglycan (cell wall) just outside the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane.
 This thick wall traps the primary stain (crystal violet) which is not decolorized by ethanol.
 In gram-negative bacteria this peptidoglycan (cell wall) layer is thin and just outside this peptidoglycan layer is outer cell membrane (which is not present in gram-positive bacteria).
 This outer cell membrane is partially dissolved by ethanol, thus washing out the crystal violet and allowing the counterstain to take",A
True about Schwann cells ?,Pa of central nervous system,Present only in myelinated nerve fibres,Form myelin sheath,Derived from surface ectoderm,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Form myelin sheath Shwann cellsIn peripheral nervous system (PNS), Schwann cells provide structural suppo to all nerve fibres. Schawann cells form a sheath around the axon and form the outermost layer of a nerve fiber, called neurilemma, also known as sheath of Schwann or neurolemma. Schwann cells is surrounded by a basal lamina (or external lamina).In some fibres, Schwann cells additionally form myelin sheath; these fibres are called myelinated nerve fibres. Those nerve fibres in which myelin sheath is not formed, that is Schwann cells only provide structural suppo, are non-myelinated nerve fibres.Schwann cells deposit concentric layers of myelin around the axon to form myelin sheath. In myelinated fibres, one Schwann cell covers only a sho segment of the axon. The small pa of the axon present in between two adjacent Schwann cells (the pa that is devoid of myelin sheath) is called node of Ranvier.Myelin is a mixture of lipoproteins and acts as an insulator. Since myelin acts as an insulator, impulses are generated only at the nodes of Ranvier and this helps in faster conduction of the impulses. This is called saltatory conduction.Schwann cells are derived from neuroectoderm.",C

In cholesterol transpo which is not needed,Liver,Kidney,Intestine,Fat,"Cholesterol in the diet is absorbed from the intestine, and in company with other lipids, are incorporated int ""chylomicrons"" and also to some extent 'VLDL'. Of the cholesterol absorbed, 80 to 90 percent in the lymph is esterified with long-chain FA. Esterification may occur in the intestinal mucosa. In man, the total plasmacholesterol varies from 150 to 250 mg% (average 200 mg%), rising with age, although there are wide variations between individuals. The greater pa is found in the'esterified' form and is transpoed as ""lipoproteins"" in plasma. Highest propoion of circulating cholesterol is found in LDL (b-lipoproteins) which carry cholesterol totissues and also in HDL, which takes cholesterol to liver from tissues for degradation (scavenging action). However, under conditions, where the VLDL arequantitatively predominant, an increased propoion of plasma cholesterol will reside in this fraction. Dietary cholesterol takes several days to equilibrate withcholesterol in plasma, and several weeks to equilibrate with cholesterol in tissues. Free cholesterol in plasma and liver equilibrates in matter of hours. In general, freecholesterol exchanges readily between tissues and lipoproteins, whereas cholesterol esters do not exchange freely. Some plasma cholesterol ester may be formed inHDL as a result of transesterification reaction in plasma between cholesterol and FA in position-2 of lecithin which is catalysed by the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT).Cholesterol balance in tissues: Many factors will determine the cholesterol balance at the cellular level.(a) Increase of cholesterol in cells:Increased synthesis of cholesterol.Hydrolysis of cholesterol ester by the enzyme ""cholesterol ester hydro-lyase"".Uptake and delivery of cholesterol in cells by circulating LDL (uptake by specific receptors).Uptake of cholesterol containing lipoproteins by 'non-receptor' mediated pathway.Uptake of free cholesterol by cell membranes.(b) Decrease of cholesterol in cells:Efflux of cholesterol from cells to HDL (scavenging action).Esterification of cholesterol by the enzyme Acyl- CoA-cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT).Utilisation of cholesterol for synthesis of steroid hormones, viz. glucocoicoids, mineralocoicoids, Gonadal hormones.In liver cells: formation of cholic acid.Formation of Vit D3.Ref: M.N.

Tumor suppressor genes prevent the uncontrolled growth of cells that may result in cancerous tumors. The protein made by the APC gene plays a critical role in several cellular processes that determine whether a cell may develop into a tumor. The APC protein helps control how often a cell divides, how it attaches to other cells within a tissue, how the cell polarizes and the morphogenesis of the 3D structures, or whether a cell moves within or away from a tissue. This protein also helps ensure that the chromosome number in cells produced through cell division is correct. The APC protein accomplishes these tasks mainly through association with other proteins, especially those that are involved in cell attachment and signaling. The activity of one protein in paicular, beta-catenin, is controlled by the APC protein (see: Wnt signaling pathway). Regulation of beta-catenin prevents genes that stimulate cell division from being turned on too often and prevents cell overgrowth. The human APC gene is located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 in band q22.2 (5q22.2). The APCgene has been shown to contain an internal ribosome entry site. APC ohologs have also been identified in all mammals for which complete genome data are available.",A

"A 3-month-old infant was cranky and irritable, became quite lethargic between feedings, and began to develop a potbelly. A physical examination demonstrated an enlarged liver, while blood work taken between feedings demonstrated elevated lactate and uric acid levels, as well as hypoglycemia. This child most likely has a mutation in which one of the following enzymes?",Liver glycogen phosphorylase,Glycogen synthase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,Muscle glycogen phosphorylase,"The child has the symptoms of von Gierke disease, which is caused by a lack of glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In this disorder, neither liver glycogen nor gluconeogenic precursors (e.g., alanine and glycerol) can be used to maintain normal blood glucose levels. The last step (conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose) is deficient for both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Muscle glycogen cannot be used to maintain blood glucose levels because muscle does not contain glucose-6-phosphatase. A defective liver glycogen phosphorylase (Her disease) will not affect the ability of the liver to raise blood glucose levels by gluconeogenesis. In addition, the lack of liver glycogen phosphorylase does not lead to lactic and uric acid accumulation, although mild fasting hypoglycemia can be observed. Defects in liver glycogen synthase (type 0 glycogen storage disease) will lead to hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia, but not lactate acid or uric acid accumulation. Muscle does not contribute to blood glucose levels, so a defect in muscle glycogen phosphorylase (McArdle disease) will not lead to the observed symptoms but will lead to exercise intolerance.

25 year old labourer 3 yrs back presented with penile ulcer not treated. Later he presented with neurological symptoms for which he got treated. Test to monitor response to treatment is,VDRL,FTA ABS,TPI,RPR,"VDRL The history of the patient suggests neurosyphilis. Diagnosis of Neurosyphilis No definitive tool /test exists to establish the diagnosis of neurosyphilis with 100% accuracy. Most of the serological tests used in the diagnosis of syphilis cannot accurately diagnosis neurosyphilis. Hence, the diagnosis of neurosyphilis usually depends on combination of clinical features plus C.S.F. finding and serological tests. C.S.F. findings in syphilis:? - Lymphocytic pleocytosis - Protein is moderately elevated - Glucose is usually normal Among the serological tests - ""The VDRL C.S.F. test is the standard serological test for and is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis"". - Since invasion of C.S.F. by syphilis stimulates production of antilipoidal antibodies in C.S.F., VDRL test can be performed on C.S.F. to diagnose neurosyphilis. - The VDRL test is highly specific albeit insensitive for the diagnosis of neurosyphilis. - The sensitivity of VDRL for neurosyphilis is 30% and specificity is 90%. Specific treponemol tests have proved to be quite inaccurate in the diagnosis of neurosyphilis Why ??? - The antibodies against the specific treponemal antigen have the tendency to cross C.S.F., so enough antibodies may be present in the C.S.F. even before neurosyphilis develops. - Therefore specific treponemal tests have no specificity for neurosyphilis. The C.S.F. becomes positive for these tests even when neurosyphilis is not present. Moreover, Specific treponemal tests cannot be used to monitor treatment because? - These tests become positive soon after infection and typically remain positive .for life despite adequate treatment. An impoant point - Like VDRL test RPR test can also be used to monitor the treatment in syphilis but it is not suitable for testing C.S.F., so it cannot be used in neurosyphilis.

Chaperones are used for-,Protein folding,Protein targeting,Protein synthesis,Protein modification,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Protein folding* Chaperones are proteins which help in folding or unfolding of proteins* Molecular chaperones prevent aggregation and promote refolding after stress and hence promote cell survival. This so-called stress response is ubiquitous and conserved across all organisms. Hence Chaperones are otherwise known as heat shock proteins (HSP)* Chaperones are synthesized in response to heat and other stress conditions like , exposure to heavy metals, UV radiation, oxidative stress, nutrient deficiencies, dehydration, osmotic pressures and viral infections. Hence, they are otherwise called as stress proteins* Heat shock proteins are evolutionarily conserved, abundant and ubiquitous proteins in all cells and play similar roles in organisms from bacteria to humans. They are amongst the most highly expressed and can account for 1-2 % of the total protein in unstressed cells, and this can increase up to 4-6 % after heat shock* Some chaperone systems work as foldases: they support the folding of proteins in an ATP-dependent manner (for example, the GroEL/GroES or the DnaK / DnaJ / GrpE system). Other chaperones work as holdases: they bind folding intermediates to prevent their aggregation, for example DnaJ or Hsp33* The human heat shock proteins have been renamed to the following: HSPH (former name HSP110), HSPC (HSP90), HSPA (HSP70), HSPD/E (HSP60/HSP10) and CCT (TRiC), DNAJ (HSP40), and HSPB (small HSP or sHSP)* Despite the fact that heat shock proteins differ in their size, structures and activity, they all bind non-native proteins (some bind native proteins as well); and some exert their functions co-translationally by interacting with nascent polypeptides, while others act post-translationally by providing an environment that enhances folding.* Most heat shock proteins are ATP-dependent and require ATP to control binding and dissociation of substrate polypeptides, while some use an ATP-independent mechanism.* Thus,# Chaperones are otherwise called as heat shock proteins. But not all heat shock proteins are chaperones. Heat shock proteins also perform some function other than protein folding.# Chaperones are not always ATP dependent.# Chaperones do not always bind to specific segments of polypeptide chain, some just provide the environment for protein folding.# Chaperones act as either foldases or holdases.",A

The following statements are true regarding Chlamydia except:,Erthromycin is effective for therapy of Chamydial infections,Their cell wall lacks a peptidoglycan layer,They can grow in cell free culture media,They are obligate intracellular bacteria,"Unique properties of Chlamydia are
Chlamydia is an obligate intracellular parasite. This means they can survive only by establishing residence inside
Animal cells
They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a
Cell membrane transport system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP.
This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving artibacterial media.
Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses.
Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Me Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to
Treat cells with poly anionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection.
Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to favour competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of
Chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs particularly in the yolk sac.
The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are
The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content
It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contains a Tetrapeptide linked matrix.
N Acetyl muramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall
Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae.
Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins
And other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the important point about t/t,
That cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical

A gardener has multiple vesicles on hand andmultiple eruptions along the lymphatics. Most common fungus responsible is ?,Sporothrix schenckii,Cladosporium,Histoplasma,Candida,"Sporothrix schenekii Multiple vesicles on hand and multiple eruptions along the lymphatics in a gardner suggest the diagnosis of cutaneous sporotrichosis. Sporotrichosis Sporotrichosis is caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus sporothrix schenckii. Because S.schencki is naturally found in soil, hay, sphagnum moss, and plants, it usually affects farmers, gardeners, and agricultural workers. This fungal disease usually affects the skin although rare forms can affect the lungs, joints, bones, and CNS. Fungus enters through small cuts and abrasions in the skin to cause the infection. Because roses can spread the disease, it is one of a few diseases referred to as rose-thorn or rose gardener's disease. Forms and symptoms of sporotrichosis I) Cutaneous (skin) sporotrichosis - This is the most common form of this disease. Symptoms of this form includes nodular lesions or bumps in the skin, at the point of entry and also along lymph nodes and vessels. - The lesion stas off as small and painless, nodule and ranges in colour from pink to purple. - Left untreated, the lesion becomes larger and look similar to a boil and more lesions will apear, until a chronic ulcer develops. Usually cutaneous sporotrichosis lesions occur in the finger, hand and arm. 2) Pulmonary sporotrichosis - This rare form of the disease occur when S.schenckii spores are inhaled. - Symptoms include productive cough, nodules, cavitations and fibrosis of lungs; and hilar lymph node enlargement. - Patients with this form of sporotrichosis are susceptible to developing tuberculosis and pneumonia. 3) Disseminated sporotrichosis - When the infection spreads from the primary site to secondary sites in the body, the disease develops into a rare and critical form called disseminated sporotrichosis. - The infection can spread to joints and bones (called osteoaicular sporotrichosis) as well as the CNS and brain (sporotrichosis meningitis). About other options Cladosporium Cladosporium genus of fungi includes some of the most common indoor and outdoor molds. Many species of cladosporium are commonly found on living and dead plant material. Some species are plant pathogens, others parasitize other fungi. Cladosporium species are rarely pathogenic to humans, but have been repoed to cause infection of the skin and toenails, as well as sinusitis and pulmonary infections.",A

Which of the following is the most common cause of severe rectal bleeding in the pediatric age group?,Internal hemorrhoids,External hemorrhoids,Diverticulosis,Ileal (Meckel) diverticulum,"Ileal (Meckel) diverticulum, which is an outpouching of the distal ileum, is twice as prevalent in males as in females. The diverticulum is clinically important because ulceration of the diverticulum with pain, bleeding, perforation, and obstruction is a complication that may require emergent surgery. Signs and symptoms frequently mimic appendicitis or peptic ulcer. Internal hemorrhoids are thrombosed tributaries of the middle rectal vein, which can prolapse into the anal canal. External hemorrhoids are thrombosing in the veins of the external rectal venous plexus. Diverticulosis is ordinarily an outpouching of the wall of the large intestine. This primarily affects the aged and does not cause bleeding in most cases. Borborygmi are sounds created by gas and intestinal contents as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract.",D

Hea rate increase with one of the following?,Stimulation of trigeminal nerve pain receptor,Increased intracranial tension,Decreased stimulation of Baroreceptors,Increased parasympathetic stimulation,"The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms that help to maintain blood pressure at nearly constant levels. The baroreflex provides a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes the hea rate to decrease and also causes blood pressure to decrease. Decreased blood pressure decreases baroreflex activation and causes hea rate to increase and to restore blood pressure levels. The baroreflex can begin to act in less than the duration of a cardiac cycle (fractions of a second) and thus baroreflex adjustments are key factors in dealing with postural hypotension, the tendency for blood pressure to decrease on standing due to gravity. The baroreceptors are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. At low pressures, baroreceptors become inactive. When blood pressure rises, the carotid and aoic sinuses are distended fuher, resulting in increased stretch and, therefore, a greater degree of activation of the baroreceptors. At normal resting blood pressures, many baroreceptors are actively repoing blood pressure information and the baroreflex is actively modulating autonomic activity. Active baroreceptors fire action potentials (""spikes"") more frequently. The greater the stretch the more rapidly baroreceptors fire action potentials. Many individual baroreceptors are inactive at normal resting pressures and only become activated when their stretch or pressure threshold is exceeded.

Each extraocular muscle has a yoke muscle in the opposite eye to accomplish versions into each gaze position. By the Herring law, yoke muscles receive equal and simultaneous innervation. The magnitude of innervation is determined by the fixating eye, which means that the angle of detion between eyes (strabismus) may vary depending on which eye is fixating.

Shift to right in Oxygen dissociation curve is seen in all except: March 2007,Increased PaCO2,Decreased PaCO2,"Increase in 2, 3 DPG",Decreased pH,"Ans. B: Decreased PaCO2 Haemoglobin is the primary vehicle for transpoing oxygen in the blood. The oxygen carrying capacity is determined by the amount of haemoglobin present in the blood. Oxygen is also carried dissolved in the blood's plasma, but to a much lesser degree. A hemoglobin molecule can bind up to four oxygen molecules in a reversible way. The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve has a sigmoidal or S-shape. The paial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which the hemoglobin is 50% saturated, is known as the P50. The P50 is a conventional measure of hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. An increased P50 indicates a rightward shift and a decreased affinity of the standard curve, which means that a larger paial pressure is necessary to maintain a 50% oxygen saturation. Conversely, a lower P50 indicates a leftward shift and a higher affinity. Left shift of the curve is a sign of hemoglobin's increased affinity for oxygen (e.g. at the lungs). Similarly, right shift shows decreased affinity, as seen in: An increase in body temperature, An increase in hydrogen ion, An increase in 2, 3-bisphosphoglycerate An increase in carbon dioxide concentration (the Bohr effect) With fetal hemoglobin, the shift facilitates diffusion of oxygen across the placenta. The oxygen dissociation curve for myoglobin exists even fuher to the left.",B

Man is definitive host for clonorchis and snail is the secondary host. Clonorchis sinensis is caused by ingestion of metacercaria in inadequately cooked freshwater fish. The organisms excyst in the duodenum. The larva travel through the ampulla of vater and mature into adult worms in bile canaliculi. The adult worms release small operculated eggs which pass with bile into the intestines and are voided with stools. Most of the infections are asymptomatic because of the low worm burden.

A primigravida at term with mitral stenosis in labor wants analgesia for normal delivery. which form of Anesthesia to be used for her?,Inhalational Anaesthesia,Spinal Anaesthesia,Epidural Anaesthesia,Opioids,"Epidural anesthesia during PregnancyCombined spinal-epidural analgesia during labor using intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg produces good analgesia without major hemodynamic changes during the first stage of labor.During the second stage of labor, only the uterine contractile force should be allowed rather than the maternal expulsive effo that is always associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Therefore, the second stage of delivery should be cut sho by instrumentation.Supplementary analgesia for instrumentation with slow epidural boluses of fentanyl and a low concentration of bupivacaine reduces SVR and the cardiac pre-load.One of the major advantages of epidural analgesia is that it can be administered in incremental doses and that the total dose could be titrated to the desired sensory level.This coupled with the slower onset of anesthesia, allows the maternal cardiovascular system to compensate for the occurrence of sympathetic blockade, resulting in a lower risk of hypotension and decreased uteroplacental perfusion.Moreover, the segmental blockade spares the lower extremity ""muscle pump,"" aiding in venous return, and also decreases the incidence of thromboembolic events.Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious intravenous administration of crystalloid and administration of small bolus doses of phenylephrine maintain maternal hemodynamic stability.(Ref: William's Obstetrics, 22nd edition, pg no: 483)",C

"In follow up of BPH, a most impoant indication of surgery is",Prostate size >75gm,Single episode of UTI requiring 3 day antibiotics,Cannot use medication due to hypeension,Bilateral hydronephrosis,"Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones.""- Schwaz 8/e p1530 About other options: Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypeension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypeensive persons. Management of BPH Management is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology is given below. Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPH Refractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal) Recurrent UTI from BPH Bladder stones d/t BPH Renal insufficiency d/t BPH Large bladder diveicula secondary to BPH Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwaz. Medical therapy Alpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin) Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptors present in human prostate and bladder base. 5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use). Surgery Surgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed. The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate. Conventional surgical methods: Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method) Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP) Open simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) - When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes ""too large"" is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diveiculum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible. Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology. Minimally invasive methods: Laser therapy (Nd:YAG and holmium:YAG ) Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostate Microwave Hypehermia Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate- High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablation Intraurethral stents--stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent.

Intrinsic factor of castle is secreted by which of the following cells in gastric glands,Chief cells,Parietal cells,Enterochromaffin cells,B cells,"The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",B

Froment test is positive in lesion of:,Radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,Axillary nerve,Median nerve,"Froment sign To perform the test, a patient is asked to hold an object, usually a flat object such as a piece of paper, between their thumb and index finger (pinch grip). The examiner then attempts to pull the object out of the subject's hands. A normal individual will be able to maintain a hold on the object without difficulty. However, with ulnar nerve palsy, the patient will experience difficulty maintaining a hold and will compensate by flexing the FPL (flexor pollicis longus) of the thumb to maintain grip pressure causing a pinching effect. Clinically, this compensation manifests as flexion of the IP joint of the thumb (rather than extension, as would occur with correct use of the adductor pollicis). The compensation of the affected hand results in a weak pinch grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger, therefore, with the thumb in obvious flexion. FPL is normally innervated by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve.",B

The M protein (d) is the organism's most important antiphagocytic factor, and it conveys serologic specificity-over 100 serotypes are now known. In the early stages of growth, the bacteria have hyaluronic acid (b) capsules. This capsule (similar to human hyaluronic acid structure) is rapidly destroyed by the organism's own hyaluronidase. Also known as spreading factor, hyaluronidase plays a role in GAS cellulitis. Erythrogenic toxin (a) is a superantigen produced by some strain of GAS lysogenized by a bacteriophage carrying the toxin gene; it causes the rash of scarlet fever. A second superantigen, streptococcal pyrogenic toxin, causes streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

Secondary immune response is mediated by ?,IgG,IgA,IgF,1gM,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., IgG Immune response The antibody response to an initial antigenic stimulus differes qualitatively and quantitatively from the response to subsequent stimuli with same antigen. Former is called primary response and the latter secondary response. a. Primary response Primary imnme response refers to the first encounter of immune system with an antigen. The antibody that is elicted first is entirely of the IgM type. IgM antibody titre rises to a peak level and then declines almost as fast as it developed. In a few days IgG appears. IgG titre rises gradually and then declines gradually. An impoant outcome of primary antigenic challenge is the production of memory cells( primed cells). b. Secondary response A secondary response refers to a re-encounter of the same antigen against which memory cells ( T and B cells) have developed during primary exposure. As primed cells are already present antibody response is very fast with no lag phase as compared to primary response which has slow response with lag phase ( as there are no primed cells in primary response) There is brief production of IgM, but the major antibody is IgG4 which is prodced in larger amount and for longer duration.",A

Trousseau's sign and chovstek's signs are positive in:,Hyperparathyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Hypoparathyroidism,Hyperthyroidism,"Hypoparathyroidism
When the parathyroid glands do not secrete sufficient PTH, the osteocytic resorption of exchangeable calcium decreases and the osteoclasts become almost totally inactive. As a result, calcium release from the bones is so depressed that the level of calcium in the body fluids decreases.
When the parathyroid glands are suddenly removed, the calcium level in the blood falls from the normal of 9.4 mg/dl to 6 to 7 mg/dl within 2 to 3 days and the blood phosphate concentration may double. When this low calcium level is reached, the usual signs of tetany develop. Among the muscles of the body especially sensitive to tetanic spasm are the laryngeal muscles.

Trousseau sign
	Trousseau sign is the spasm of the hand that is developed after 3 minutes of arresting the blood flow to lower arm and hand. The blood flow to lower arm and hand is arrested by inflating the blood pressure cuff 20 mm Hg above the patient’s systolic pressure.
Chvostek sign
	Chvostek sign is the twitch of the facial muscles, caused by a gentle tap over the facial nerve in front of the ear. It is due to the hyperirritability of facial nerve.

The most impoant stimulant of respiratory centre is:,Alkalosis,Decrease PCo2,Increase PCo2,Decrease Pao2,"Response to Co2, PaCO2 is most impoant factor in control of ventilation under normal conditions. PCo2 is most impoant input regulating magnitude of ventilation under resting conditions. Changes in alveolar ventilation have immediate, pronounced effect on aerial Pco2 (unlike Po2). Even slight alterations from normal Pco2 induce significant reflex. Increased Pco2 increases ventilation. Blood Brain Barrier is permeable to Co2, so increased aerial Pco2 increases brain ECF Pco2 and , it stimulates central chemoreceptors which increases ventilation by stimulating respiratory centers. Regulation of respiration: The rhythmic discharges from the brain that produce spontaneous respiration are regulated by alterations in aerial Po2, PCo2, and H+ concentration. There are numerous factors that affect and control ventilation. Chemical control Co2 ( CSF and brain interstitial fluid H+ concentration) o2 ( carotid and aoic bodies) H+ ( carotid and aoic bodies) Nonchemical control Vagal afferents from receptors in the airways and lungs Afferents from the pons, hypothalamus, and limbic system Afferents from proprioceptors Afferents from baroreceptors: aerial, atrial, ventricular, pulmonary Preipheral (Carotid & Aoic) Chemoreceptors: The carotid bodies are located at the bifurcation of common carotid aery. They send afferents in the carotid sinus nerve to the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) the aoic bodies are located between the arch of aoa and pulmonary aery afferents ascend in the recurrent laryngeal nerves to the vagus (X). Stimulation results from a decrease in carotid and aoic body tissue PO2. Central Chemoreceptors: situated near (beneath) the ventral surface of the medulla, near the origins of the vagi and glossopharyngeal nerves these are anatomically separate from the respiratory centres, and are bathed in brain ECF. This is impermeable to both H+ and HCO3 -, however CO2 diffuses readily and decreases pH of CSF within a few minutes, which subsequently increases ventilation.

Dihydrobiopterin is used in management of which amino acid defect?,Alanine,Tyrosine,Phenylalanine,Tryptophan,"Ans. (c) PhenylalanineRef: Lippincott's Biochemistry, pg. 268Phenylketonuria (PKU), caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase and is the most common clinically encountered inborn error of amino acid metabolism (prevalence 1:11,000). Hyperphenylalaninemia may also be caused by deficiencies in the enzymes that synthesize or reduce the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4 ). It is important to distinguish among the various forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, because their clinical management is different. For example, a small fraction of PKU is a result of a deficiency in either dihydropteridine (BH2 ) reductase or BH2 synthetase. These mutations prevent synthesis of BH4 , and indirectly raise phenylalanine concentrations, because phenylalanine hydroxylase requires BH4 as a coenzyme. BH4 is also required for tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, which catalyze reactions leading to the synthesis of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and catecholamines.",C

Which one of the following enzymes is predominantly mitochondrial?,SGOT,SGPT,GGT,5' nucleotidase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., SGOT* Serum Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase (SGPT) or Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Serum Glutamate Oxaloacetate Transaminase (SGOT) or Aspartate Transaminase (AST) are sensitive markers of hepatocellular injury. As estimating bilirubin is a measure of functional ability of liver, it takes some time for the levels of bilirubin to increase. Enzyme levels rapidly rise because any damaged hepatocyte's membrane permeability is increased.* ALT or SGPT is purely a cytoplasmic enzyme, whereas AST or SGOT is present in both cytoplasm and mitochondria. The cytoplasmic isoform of the enzyme ASTI is derived from RBC and Heart. The mitochondrial isoform of the enzyme AST2 is derived from liver.* Hence following hepatocellular injury, the cytoplasmic enzyme ALT level rises faster (Normal level of ALT is <34 IU/L in females and <52 in males) than AST (Normal level of AST is (6 to 34IU/L in females and 8 to 40 IU/L in males). Thus AST is neither a sensitive nor a specific marker of hepatocellular damage (Not specific because it is expressed by heart as well and hence levels are elevated even after myocardial damage)* Generally when AST and ALT are elevated, AST/ALT ratio will be less than 2. If it is more than 2 it is suggestive of mitochondrial damage like alcoholic hepatitis or toxic liver injury* 5'-nucleotidase is an enzyme which catalyzes the phosphorylytic cleavage of 5'nucleotides. There are membrane bound forms and soluble forms. Membrane bound forms are GPI anchored to the cell membrane. Soluble forms are in cytoplasm. Following biliary obstruction, the bile stays in the intrahepatic biliary canaliculi. Tijs causes dissolution of liver parenchymal cell membrane and the cell bound membranes get released into circulation through hepatic sinusoids. Hence 5' nucleotidase level in circulation increases following bile duct obstruction. So, levels of 5' nucleotidase elevation along with elevation of Alkaline phosphatase confirms that the elevation of ALP is of hepatic origin (BILIARY DUCT OBSTRUCTION) not osseous (AS ALP LEVEL IS ALSO INCTREASED IN BONE RELATED CONDITIONS WITH ELEVATED OSTEOBLASTIC ACTIVITY)* Same is the case with Gamma Glutamyl Transferase. It is involved in liver conjugation reactions and absorption of neutral aminoacid along intestinal membranes. This enzyme is also a membrane bound enzyme. Hence levels are elevated following duct obstruction. But as the enzyme is involved in detoxification reactions, the enzyme gets induced by alcohol. Hence levels of GGT is high after intake of alcohol. Isolated elevation of GGT is suggestive of alcoholism. If GGT elevation is accompanied by an elevation of ALP and 5; nucleotidase, it is obstruction.",A

Blood clotting is an example of a valuable use of positive feedback. When a blood vessel is ruptured and a clot begins to form, multiple enzymes called clotting factors are activated within the clot itself. Some of these enzymes act on other unactivated enzymes of the immediately adjacent blood, thus causing more blood clotting. This process continues until the hole in the vessel is plugged and bleeding no longer occurs.

Heparin inhibits the active form of the following factors except: September 2009,V,X,XI,XII,"Ans. A: V Antic lo tting mechanisms: Antithrombin III is a circulating protease inhibitor that binds to the serine proteases in the coagulation system, blocking their activity as clotting factors. This binding is facilitated by heparin, a naturally occurring anticoagulant that is a mixture of sulfated polysaccharides with molecular weights averaging 15,000-18,000. The clotting factors that are inhibited are the active forms of factors IX, X, XI, and XII. The endothelium of the blood vessels also plays an active role in preventing the extension of clots into blood vessels. All endothelial cells except those in the cerebral microcirculation produce thrombomodulin, a thrombin-binding protein. In the circulating blood, thrombin is a procoagulant that activates factors V and VIII, but when it binds to thrombomodulin, it becomes an anticoagulant in that the thrombomodulin-thrombin complex activates protein C . Activated protein C (APC), along with its cofactor protein S, inactivates factors V and VIII and inactivates an inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator, increasing the formation of plasmin",A

"In a well fed state, the activity of CPT-I in outer mitochondrial membrane is inhibited by:",Glucose,Pyruvate,Acetyl CoA,Malonyl CoA,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Malonyl CoA ""Malonyl-CoA, the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state, is a potent inhibitor of CPT-I""Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I) is the rate limiting enzyme in the process of beta-oxidation of fatty acids.Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acids, in the form of Acyl-CoA molecules, are broken down in mitochondria to generate Acetyl-CoA.Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) to produce energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid b-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle or if activity in the TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacyl-CoA and b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG- CoA).Beta-oxidation of fatty acids is caused when there is low blood glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. In well fed state fatty acids are esterified.The entry of fatty acids into the oxidative pathway is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I).In a well fed state the CPT-I activity is low, leading to depression of fatty acid oxidation. In state of starvation, CPT-I activity is high, leading to fatty acid oxidation.CPT-I is inhibited by Malonyl-CoA.Malonyl-CoA is the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state.In well fed state, free fatty acids are nearly all esterified to acylglycerols.In starvation Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inhibited directly by acyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA decreases, releasing the inhibition of CPT-I and allowing more acyl-CoA to be beta-oxidized.Thus, beta-oxidation from free fatty acids is controlled by the CPT-I gateway into the mitochondria, and the balance of the free fatty acid uptake not oxidized is esterified.Role of Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I in fatty acid oxidation: The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids. CPT-I helps in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria.",D

Amino acid carrying ammonia from muscle to liver?,Alanine,Glutamine,Arginine,Lysine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Alanine.DISPOSAL/DETOXIFICATION OF AMMONIA1. First line of Defense (Trapping of ammonia)Being highly toxic, ammonia should be eliminated or detoxified, as and when it is formed. Even very minute quantity of ammonia may produce toxicity in central nervous system.But, ammonia is always produced by almost all cells, including neurons.The intracellular ammonia is immediately trapped by glutamic acid to form glutamine, especially in brain cells .The glutamine is then transpoed to liver, where the reaction is reversed by the enzyme glutaminase .The ammonia thus generated is immediately detoxified into urea.Aspaic acid may also undergo similar reaction to form asparagine .2. Transpoation of AmmoniaInside the cells of almost all tissues, the transamination of amino acids produce glutamic acid.However, glutamate dehydrogenase is available only in the liver.Therefore, the final deamination and production of ammonia is taking place in the liver .Thus, glutamic acid acts as the link between amino groups of amino acids and ammonia.The concentration of glutamic acid in blood is 10 times more than other amino acids.Glutamine is the transpo forms of ammonia from brain and intestine to liver; while alanine is the transpo form from muscle.3. Final disposalThe ammonia from all over the body thus reaches liver. It is then detoxified to urea by liver cells, and then excreted through kidneys.Urea is the end product of protein metabolism.Transpo of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions :?i) Providing substrate for gluconeogenesisii) Transpo of ammonia (NH4-) to liver for urea synthesis.",A
Which of the following is a Windkessel vessel?,Aorta,Radial artey,Brachial artery,Splenic artery,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Aorta Windkessel vessel* Large arteries like aorta and its branches have high elasticity. When blood is pumped into these vessels by heart during systole, the vessel expand to accomodate some excess blood temporarily. During diastole, when heart is not pumping, their elastic walls recoil and blood in them is propelled forward. These vessels are called windkessel vessel.Clinical importancei) During ventricular diastole, although ventricular pressure falls very low, aorta is able to maintain diastole BP of 80mmHg.ii) During ventricular systole, it prevents too much rise in pressureiii) Atherosclerosis in old age leads to loss of windkessel effect causing systolic hypertension",A

Alpha helix and Beta pleated sheet are examples of-,Primary',Secondary structure,Tertiary',Quaternary' structure,"Ans. is 'b' i.e,,, Secondary structure Structural organization of proteinso Eveiy protein has a unique three dimensional structure, which is referred to as its native conformation and made up of only 20 different amino acids. Protein structure can be classified into four level of organization.1) Primary structuresThe linear sequence of amino acid residues and location of disulphide bridges, if any, in a polypeptide chain constitute its primary structure. In simple words,primary structure of proteins refers to the specific sequence of amino acids. Primary structure is maintained by covalent 'peptide' bond.Secondary structureFor stability of primary structure, hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen of NH and oxygen of C = O groups of the polypeptide chain occurs, which give rise to twisting, folding or bending of the primary structure. Thus, regular folding and twisting of the polypeptide chain brought about by hydrogen bonding is called secondary structure. Important types of secondary structure are a-helix,b-pleated sheet and b-hends.Tertiary structureThe peptide chain, with its secondary structure, may be further folded and twisted about itself forming three-dimensional arrangement of polypeptide chain, i.e., tertiary structure refers to the overall folding pattern of polypeptide which forms three dimensional shape. Tertiary structure (three dimensional shape) is maintained by weak non-covalent interactions which include hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bond (electrostatic bonds or salt bridges) and Van-der wall forces. Covalent linkage (disulphide bond) also plays some (but minor) role.Quaternary structureMany proteins are made up of more than one polypeptide chains (polymers), Each polypeptide chain is known as protomer (or subunit). The subunit are linked with each other by non-covalent bonds. The structure formed by union of subunits is known as quaternary structure, i.e., spatial relation of subunits (peptide chains) with one another is called quaternary structure. Mainly three non-covalent bonds stabilize quaternary structure : Hydrophobic, hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic).# Dimeric proteins contain two polypeptide chains. Homodimers contain two copies of same polypeptide chain, while in a heterodimer the polypeptides differ.",B

Membrae-bound and secreted Igs are synthesized from mRNA that have been spliced differently. Membrane Igs, but not secreted Igs, have an additional tail made of hydrophobic amino acids at the C-terminal end of the Fc region that helps to anchor the Ig molecule in the plasma membrane. Completed Ig molecules are either released from the ER membrane (secretory Ig) or remain embedded in the membrane (membrane Ig) before being transpoed in vacuoles (or vesicles), which bud off the Golgi, to the plasma membrane. Secretory Ig are transferred by simple physical entrapment within the secretory vacuoles, wheras membrane Ig are transferred attached to the membrane. Fusion of the secretory vacuoles with the plasma membrane results in the membrane Ig being inseed in the plasma membrane while the soluble content of the vesicles are disgorged to the exterior of the cell.""- Manual of biological markers of disease By W.

Which of the following factor is responsible for the pulmonary alveoli to be kept dry under normal circumstances?,Macrophages,Tight junction between endothelium and alveolar surface,Pulmonary surfactant,Negative interstitial pressure,"Pulmonary capillaries and pulmonary lymphatic system normally maintain a slight negative pressure in the interstitial spaces. Whenever extra fluid appears in the alveoli, it will be simply sucked mechanically into the lung interstitium through the small openings between the alveolar epithelial cells. Then the excess fluid is either carried away through the pulmonary lymphatics or absorbed into the pulmonary capillaries. Thus, under normal conditions, the alveoli are kept dry, except for a small amount of fluid that seeps from the epithelium onto the lining surfaces of the alveoli to keep them moist.

Which of the following is not a contraindication for use of digitalis?,Acute rheumatic carditis,Thyrotoxicosis,WPW syndrome,Hyperkalemia,"Digitalis dried leaf of Digitalis purpurea; a cardiac glycoside. All drugs prepared from this digitalis leaf are members of the same group and principles of administration are the same, although they vary according to speed of action and potency. Digitalis in its many forms is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in the United States. It can be very effective in treatment of cardiac conditions, but its therapeutic range is narrow; a therapeutic dose is only about one third less than the dose that will induce toxicity. Moreover, physiologic changes due to age, electrolyte disturbances, renal impairment, metabolic disorders, and ceain hea conditions can predispose a patient to digitalis toxicity. Other drugs can also alter the effects of digitalis and lead to toxicity. Signs of Toxicity. Traditionally, nurses have been taught to count the patient&;s pulse or monitor the apical heabeat for rate and rhythm before administering a digitalis preparation. A decreased pulse rate of 60 per minute or less is an indication that the drug should be temporarily discontinued. While this is the most typical sign of digitalis intoxication, there frequently are earlier symptoms that deserve attention. Some of the more common complaints expressed by patients who are in the early stages of toxicity are nausea, blurred vision, mental depression, disorientation, and malaise.

These proteins are factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, protein C, and protein S.
Coumarin derivatives such as dicumarol and warfarin are also effective anticoagulants. They inhibit the action of vitamin K, which is a necessary cofactor for the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamic acid residues to γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues.

Which of the following is an impoant marker for myocardial infarction?,LDH,CK-MB,Troponins,All of the above,"LDH is a tetrameric enzyme consisting of two monomers types: H (for hea) and M (for muscle) that combine to yield 5 LDH isoenzymes: HHHH(I1), HHHM(I2), HHMM(I3), HMMM(I4), MMMM(15). Tissue injury releases a characteristic pattern of LDH isoenzymes that can be separated by electrophoresis.The blood test most commonly used to confirm the existence of hea muscle damage is the creatine kinase/CK. CK-MB shows an increase above normal in a person's blood test about six hours after the sta of a hea attack.It reaches its peak level in about 24 hours and returns to normal in 48 to 72 hours. The peak level and the return to normal can be delayed in a person who's had a large hea attack, especially if they don't get early and aggressive treatment. Tests can measure the level of other cardiac muscle proteins called troponins specifically troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI). These proteins control the interactions between actin and myosin, which contracts or squeezes the hea muscle. Troponins specific to hea muscle have been found, allowing the development of blood tests (assays) that can detect minor hea muscle injury (""microinfarction"") not detected by CK-MB. Normally the level of cTnT and cTnI in the blood is very low. It increases substantially within several hours (on average four to six hours) of muscle damage. It peaks at 10 to 24 hours and can be detected for up to 10 to 14 days.",D

Regarding prion protein which of the following statment is true -,It is protein product coded in viral DNA,It catalyses abnormal folding of other proteins,It protect disulfide bonds from oxidation,It cleaves normal proteins,"Prions are infectious proteins that cause degeneration of the central nervous system 
They are infectious particles that lack nucleic acid .
Prions are composed largely, if not entirely of PrP molecules .
Four important points about prions are: -
1. Prions are the only known infectious vatho2ens that are devoid of nucleic acid all other infectious agents
possess genomes composed of either RNA or DNA that direct the synthesis of their presence.
2. Prions disease may manifest as infectious, genetic and sporadic disorders; no other group of illness with a single
etiology presents with such a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations.
3. Prions disease result from the accumulation of PrP1 the conformation of which differs substantially from that of its precursor.
4. PrP can exist in a variety of different conformations each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype.
Prion disease: -
Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells.
Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) {α glycoprotein rich in a helix).
PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy.
Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a PrPsc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in β sheets).
These PrPsc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another PrPsc.
While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, PrPsc is shaped differently enough so that it can’t be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These
PrPsc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue.
Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into PrPsc.",B

Agonist binding induces interaction of these receptors with free intracellular tyrosine kinase - Janus kinase (JAK).# JAK phosphorylates the activators of transcription (STAT), which then regulate the nucleus transcription resulting in a biological response.# Examples - Growth hormone, Prolactin.c) Guanylyl cyclase (GC)# Activation of GC results in increased synthesis and intracellular accumulation of cGMP. cGMP acts through cGMP dependent protein kinase.# Hormone acting through cGMP are atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide",B

"In children, hypothyroidism causes",Acromegaly,Cretinism,Gigantism,Myxoedema,"Cretinism
Cretinism is caused by extreme hypothyroidism during fetal life, infancy, or childhood. This condition is characterized especially by failure of body growth and by mental retardation. It results from congenital lack of a thyroid gland (congenital cretinism), from failure of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormone because of a genetic defect of the gland, or from a lack of iodine in the diet (endemic cretinism).
A neonate without a thyroid gland may have a normal appearance and function because it was supplied with some (but usually not enough) thyroid hormone by the mother while in utero. A few weeks after birth, however, the  neonate’s movements become sluggish and both physical and mental growth begin to be greatly retarded. Treatment of the neonate with cretinism at any time with adequate iodine or thyroxine usually causes normal return of physical growth, but unless the cretinism is treated within a few weeks after birth, mental growth remains permanently retarded. This state results from retardation of the growth, branching, and myelination of the neuronal cells of the central nervous system at this critical time in the normal development of the mental powers.
Skeletal growth in a child with cretinism is characteristically more inhibited than is soft tissue growth. As a result of this disproportionate rate of growth, the soft tissues are likely to enlarge excessively, giving the child with cretinism an obese, stocky, and short appearance. Occasionally the tongue becomes so large in relation to the skeletal growth that it  obstructs swallowing and breathing, inducing a characteristic guttural breathing that sometimes chokes the child.

Detoxification of drugs is controlled by;,Cytochrome,Cytochrome P450,Cytochrome C,Cytochrome A,"Ans B. Cytochrome P450 Detoxification is the removal of toxic substances from the body. Metabolism of xenobiotics takes place in two phases. In phase 1, the major reaction involved is hydroxylation, catalyzed by members of a class of enzymes referred to as monooxygenases or cytochrome P450s . The reaction catalyzed by a monooxygenase (cytochrome P450 ) is as follows:RH+O+NADPH+H+-ROH+HO+NADPRH above can represent a very wide variety of xenobiotics, including drugs, carcinogens, pesticides, petroleum products, and pollutants (such as a mixture of PCBs). In addition, endogenous compounds, such as certain steroids, eicosanoids, fatty acids, and retinoids, are also substrates. The substrates are generally lipophilic and are rendered more hydrophilic by hydroxylation. Cytochrome P450 is considered the most versatile biocatalyst known.",B

"About type II pneumocytes, which is not TRUE?",Secrete surfactant,Are epithelial cells,Lamellar bodies are formed,Surfactant are secreted by endocytosis,"Type II pneumocytes are epithelial cells present in the alveolar surface, their cytoplasm exhibits lamellar bodies.They have many functions the most impoant is production of surfactant.Surfactant are produced by exocytosis and not endocytosis. Pneumocytes: Alveolar surface is formed by two types of epithelial cells, pneumocytes I and pneumocytes II.Type II pneumocytes are specialised cells within the alveoli of the lungs. There are as many type II as type I pneumocytes within the alveoli, but type II cells only constitute 1-5% of the alveolar surface area as they are cuboidal rather than squamous in shape. Type I pneumocytes are simple squamous epithelial cells responsible for gas exchange in the alveoli and cover a majority of the alveolar surface area. They are connected to each other by tight junctions. Type II pneumocytes are specialised cells within the alveoli of the lungs, they are adapted to produce surfactant. Their cytoplasm exhibits apical secretory granules termed lamellar bodies. These are released continuously by exocytosis onto the epithelial cell surface. The lamellar bodies contain the phospholipid component of surfactant. They occupy the thick poion of the alveolar-capillary complex. Functions: The main function of type II cells is secretion of the lung surfactant. They paicipate in clearance and in repair by proliferating and migrating to damage areas. Type II cells are able to divide and to differentiate into type I cells. They paicipate in defense responses by expressing various receptors (in paicular, Toll-like receptors). Type II cells are involved in the lung cytokine/chemokine network by secreting and responding to an array of cytokines and chemokines. They regulate transmigration of monocytes across epithelial layer and possibly paicipate in T cell activation. Ref: Color Atlas & Text of Pulmonary Pathology, edited by Philip T.

pH is maximum in,Pancreatic secretion,Intestinal secretions,Salivary secretions,Gastric secretion,"The exocrine pancreas secretes about 1000-2500 ml of juice in 24 hours. The fluid is alkaline and contains bicarbonate and enzymes. This secretion is under the control of the hormones, Secretin and cholecystokinin. Secretin is produced under the stimulation of gastric HCl. Secretin produces a secretion with high bicarbonate content. Gastrin stimulates the production of cholecystokinin (CCK), which in turn produces pancreatic secretion rich in enzymes.

An incompetent valve would allow blood to regurgitate into the right atrium during systole and subsequently raise pressure in the venous system, increasing capillary pressure and causing edema. A regurgitation of blood into the pulmonary trunk would be a result of an incompetent pulmonary valve. Regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium is a result of prolapse of the mitral valve. There is no direct anatomic relationship between the tricuspid valve and the ascending aorta. Blood would pool in the left ventricle in the event of aortic valve incompetence.",D
Delta waves on EEG are recorded in: September 2007,REM,01 NREM,02 NREM,Deep sleep,"Ans. D: Deep sleep Alpha waves generally are seen in all age groups but are most common in adults. They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals. A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions. They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation. Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e.g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes). In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform. An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage). In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli. Beta waves are observed in all age groups. They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly. Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves. Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess. Theta and delta waves are known collectively as slow waves. Delta waves are slow waves have a frequency of 3 Hz or less. They normally are seen in deep sleep in adults as well as in infants and children. Delta waves are abnormal in the awake adult. Often, they have the largest amplitude of all waves. Delta waves can be focal (local pathology) or diffuse (generalized dysfunction).",D

Man is definitive host for clonorchis and snail is the secondary host. Clonorchis sinensis is caused by ingestion of metacercaria in inadequately cooked freshwater fish. The organisms excyst in the duodenum. The larva travel through the ampulla of vater and mature into adult worms in bile canaliculi. The adult worms release small operculated eggs which pass with bile into the intestines and are voided with stools. Most of the infections are asymptomatic because of the low worm burden.

"In a patient with a tumor in superior mediastinum compressing the superior vena cava, all of the following veins would serve as alternate pathways for the blood to return to the right atrium, EXCEPT:",Azygous vein,Hemiazygos vein,Internal thoracic vein,Veebral venous plexus,"In obstruction of the superior or inferior venae cavae, the azygos veins provide an alternative pathway for the return of venous blood to the right atrium of the hea. The azygos veins consist of the main azygos vein, the inferior hemiazygos vein, and the superior hemiazygos vein. They drain blood from the posterior pas of the intercostal spaces, the posterior abdominal wall, the pericardium, the diaphragm, the bronchi, and the esophagus. Azygos vein is often formed by the union of the right ascending lumbar vein and the right subcostal vein. It ascends through the aoic opening in the diaphragm on the right side of the aoa to the level of the fifth thoracic veebra. Here it arches forward above the root of the right lung to empty into the posterior surface of the superior vena cava. The azygos vein has numerous tributaries, including the eight lower right intercostal veins, the right superior intercostal vein, the superior and inferior hemiazygos veins, and numerous mediastinal veins. The inferior hemiazygos vein is often formed by the union of the left ascending lumbar vein and the left subcostal vein.

"A previously healthy 11 year old girl develops a gastrointestinal infection with cramping and watery stools. After several days, she begins to pass blood per rectum, and is hospitalized for dehydration. In the hospital, she is noted to have decreasing urine output with rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Total blood count reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the peripheral smear is remarkable for fragmented red cells (schistocytes). Infection with which of the following bacterial genera is most likely responsible for this syndrome?",Campylobacter,Clostridium,Salmonella,Shigella,"This patient has developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of the Shiga toxin or Shiga-like toxin: exotoxins released by Shigella species and the enterohemorrhagic E.coli. HUS in children usually develops after a gastrointestinal or flu-like illness, and is characterized by bleeding, oliguria, hematuria and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Presumably the Shiga toxin is toxic to the microvasculature, producing microthrombi that consume platelets and RBCs, and may fragment the red cell membrane. The incorrect choices are all bacteria which may produce an enterocolitis, but do not elicit HUS. A long-term consequence of Campylobacter infection is a reactive ahritis or full-blown Reiter's syndrome. Clostridial enterocolitis is produced by Clostridium difficile, a normal inhabitant of the gut that produces pseudomembranous colitis when other gut flora are suppressed by treatment with antibiotics. Typhoid fever (produced by Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi) produces a protracted illness that progresses over several weeks and includes rash and very high fevers, but not HUS.

"In injury to head of fibula, all are involved except",Common peroneal Nerve,Superficial peroneal Nerve,Anterior Tibial Nerve,Tibial Nerve,"Tibial nerve (or its parent nerve) is not damaged in injury to the head/neck of fibula. Clinically it is Common peroneal nerve that is injured at this site leading to foot drop. a. Common peroneal nerve is related to the lateral side of the neck of the fibula. b. It gives two branches, which are compromised in this specific injury. i. Dep peroneal (also called anterior tibial) nerve ii. Superficial peroneal nerve c. The superficial peroneal nerve supplies the lateral leg muscles (eveors at sub-talar joint) and supplies almost the entire dorsum of foot, whereas, d. Deep peroneal nerve supplies the anterior leg muscles (extensors of the ankle and toes) and also supplies the dorsum of first interdigital cleft. II. Patient develops high stepping gait in foot drop to prevent dragging of foot on the ground. Tibial nerve supplies the posterior leg (calf) muscles and the sensations over the back of the leg and the sole of the foot. Sural nerve is a branch of tibial nerve and runs along the sho saphenous vein and supplies the dorsum of foot along its lateral border (including the little toe). The area over the great saphenous vein is supplied by the branches of femoral nerve, mainly the medial cutaneous branch of thigh and the saphenous nerve in the leg. Altered sensation over the area of great saphenous vein in leg may occur secondary to damaged saphenous nerve, as might occur during venae-section of great saphenous vein.

Decreased O2 affinity of Hb in blood with decreased pH:,Haldane effect,Double Haldane effect,Bohr effect,Double Bohr effect,Ans. C. Bohr effecta. Bohr effect:i. Definition the decrease in O2 affinity of Hb when the pH of the blood falls is called the Bohr effectii. Deoxy Hb binds H+ more actively than does oxy Hb.iii. PH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases so that when the PCO2 rises the curve shifts to the right and the P50 rises this is Bohr effect.b. Haldone effect: CO2 transport in blood:i. Definition the ability of deoxygenated - blood to carry more CO2 than oxygenated Hb.ii. Deoxygenated Hb (weak acid) binds more H+ than oxy Hb (stronger acid) does and forms carbamino compound (Hb-CO2 ).iii. Venous blood carries more CO2 than Arterial blood and CO2 uptake is facilitated in tissues and CO2 release is facilitated in the lungs.iv. Thus the Haldane effect approximately doubles the amount of CO2 released from the blood in the lungs and approximately doubles the pickup of CO2 in the tissues,C

Because ABP binds to T and DHT, these hormones are made less lipophilic and become concentrated within the luminal fluid of the seminiferous tubules. The higher levels of these hormones enable spermatogenesis in the seminiferous tubules and sperm maturation in the epididymis. ABP's production is regulated under influence of FSH on Seoli cell, enhanced by insulin, retinol, and testosterone. ABP may also be secreted in other organs; for instance, mice produce a salivary ABP",C

One bacterium receives a gene for restriction endonuclease from another by horizontal transduction. What is the likely outcome?,The proof-reading activity of the bacteria is increased,The bacterium will die as it does not have the protective methylase enzyme,The bacterium will cause digestion of host DNA on infection,The mechanism of repair is excellent,"The DNA methylase offers protection from endonucleolytic attack by the separate restriction enzyme. The descendants of cells that had lost the genes encoding DNA restriction endonucleases appeared unable to modify a sufficient number of recognition sites in their chromosomes to protect them from lethal attack by the remaining restriction enzymes, and consequently died. Hence, the fate of this bacterium which received a gene for for restriction endonuclease will be the same as given above. Restriction endonuclease: Restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific sites when the bases are not protected (modified, usually, methylation). Bacteria synthesize restriction enzymes as a defense against invading foreign DNAs such as phages and foreign plasmids. Three major types have been recognized. Type I enzymes are single multifunctional proteins of three subunits. Type II enzymes are used most widely for genetic engineering. Type II enzymes have separate endonuclease and methylase proteins. Type III enzymes carry out restriction and modification by two proteins with a shared polypeptide.

Worst prognosis memingioma is,Syncitial,Fibroblastic,Anplastic,Atypical,"Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas are uncommon tumors with a poorer prognosis than benign meningiomas. We reviewed the current literature and attempted to integrate and summarize available information to determine a logical approach to these tumors. Both tumors are rare and are often integrated with benign meningiomas when treatments are evaluated. In addition, because there has not been one histopathological classification scheme for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas in the past, there are numerous inconsistencies in the literature. Malignant progression with accumulation of mutations in a benign meningioma can result in an atypical and/or anaplastic meningioma. Both tumors are difficult to manage and have high recurrence and poor survival rates. The extent of tumor resection and histological grade are the key determinants for recurrence. In addition, metastases are unusual, but they do occur. We also review the evidence available that has resulted in the current World Health Organization classification. Radiation therapy can be used as an adjunctive treatment after both total and subtotal resection. In addition, the role of stereotactic radiosurgery is increasing, along with a possible role for brachytherapy. There are no effective chemotherapeutic agents available. A treatment algorithm is suggested. Refer Robbins page no 1315",C

TPP binds with and decarboxylates this branched-chain a-ketoacids and transfers the resulting activated -CHO groups to alipoic acid. * TPP acts as the coenzyme (Co-carboxylase) of pyruvate carboxylase in yeasts for the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde. * The coenzymes NAD+ and NADP+ operate as hydrogen and electron transfer agents by viue of reversible oxidation and reduction. The mechanism of the transfer of Hydrogen from a metabolite to oxidised NAD+, thus completing the oxidation of the metabolite and the formation of reduced NAD (NADH + H+) is shown in box. Reduction of NAD+ occurs in para position; one H loses an electron and enters the medium as H+. * Function of NADP+ is similar to that of NAD+ in hydrogen and electron transpo. The two coenzymes are interconveible. The impoant enzymes to which NAD+ and NADP+ act as coenzyme Biotin is the prosthetic group of ceain enzymes that catalyse CO2-transfer reaction (CO2-fixation reaction). In biologic system, biotin functions as the coenzyme for the enzyme called carboxylases, which catalyse the CO2-fixation (Carboxylation).

Hence allosteric inhibition is not a form of homotropic allosteric regulation.* In homotropic allosteric regulation, the substrate acts as an allosteric regulator as well. Substrates always bring about allosteric stimulation, not inhibition.* Allsoteric inhibition is most commonly an exemplification of feed back inhibition or product inhibition.* Examples for allosteric inhibition are-# Citrate and ATP inhibiting Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1)* PFK-1 is the rate limiting enzyme of glycolysis* ATP and citrate are products of glycolysis* Hence the products Citrate and ATP in a feed back mechanism mediate allosteric inhibition of PFK-1",B
The percentage of body water is greater in,Males than in females,Children than in adults,Obese than in lean individuals,Old than in young objects,"In a 70 ­kilogram adult man, the total body water is about 60 percent of the body weight, or about 42 liters. This percentage depends on age, gender, and degree of obesity. As a person grows older, the percentage of total body weight that is fluid gradually decreases. This decrease is due in part to the fact that aging is usually associated with an increased percentage of the body weight being fat, which decreases the percentage of water in the body.
Because women normally have a greater percentage of body fat compared with men, their total body water averages about 50 percent of the body weight. In premature and newborn babies, the total body water ranges from 70 to 75 percent of body weight. Therefore, when discussing “average” body fluid compartments, we should realize that variations exist, depending on age, gender, and percentage of body fat.

Regarding clostridium perfringens gas gangrene false is ?,Clostridium perfringens is the most common cause of gas gangrene,Naegler reaction positive,Most impoant toxin is hyaluronidase,Food poisoning strain of clostridium perfringens produces heat resistant spores,"Most common toxin is hyaluronidase Clostridium are gram positive spore forming rods. - The spores enable these organisms to survive in adverse conditions e.g. in soil and dust and on skin. - Most species are obligate anaerobes i.e. their spores do not germinate and growth does not normally proceed unless a suitably low redox potential (Eb) exists. Clostridium perfringens Clostridium perfringens cause two impoant diseases:? Gas gangrene ""Clostridium perfringens is the commonest cause of gas gangrene"". The disease is characterized by rapidly spreading edema, myositis and necrosis of tissues, gas production and profound toxemia. Clostridium perfringens produces several toxins and other substance which have a role in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. ""a Toxin a phospholipase lecithinase"" is generally considered to he the most impoant toxin in the pathogenesis of gas gangrene. -It is produced by all types of clostridium perfringens and most abundantly by type ""A"" strains. - It is the most impoant toxin biologically and is responsible .for profound toxemia of the gas gangrene. - It is a ""phospholipase"". Other factors which also have a role in virulence:- Hyaluronida.ve It breaks down intercellular cement substance and promotes the spread of the infection along the tissue planes Collagenases and other proteinases They break down tissues and viually liquefy muscles. Clostridium food poisoning:- Clostridium perfringens is an impoant cause of food poisoning. The .food poisoning is caused due to ingestion of spores. The spores of the clostridium perfringens strains that cause food poisoning are heat resistant. -The unique feature of spores produced by food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens is that they are heat resistant that can survive boiling for several hours. Remember - Only those strains of clostridia which are associated with food poisoning produce heat resistant spores Where as - The classic strains of this species do not have heat resistant spores. These spores are inactivated within few minutes by boiling. Typical, food poisoning strains of clostridium perfringens occur as carrier state. These strains also occur in animals thus meat is often contaminated with heat resistant spores. The vehicle of infection is usually a precooked meat food that has been allowed to stand at a temperature. The heat resistance of the spores ensures their survival in cooking. - During the cooling period they germinate in the anaerobic environment produced by the cooked meat and multiply. - Anyone who eats this meat will consume the equivalent of cooked meat broth culture of the organisms. - Large numbers of clostridia are thus consumed which may pass unharmed by the gastric acid due to high protein in the meat and reach the intestines where they produce the enterotoxin. - After an incubation period of 8-24 hours abdominal pain diarrhoea set in. Naegeler reaction ft is used to detect alpha toxin which is a phospholipase (lecithinase C) - Lecithinase or phospholipase in the presence of Ca++ and Mg' ions splits lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacylglycerol. This reaction is seen as an ""opalescence"" in serum or egg yolk media. Procedure CI perfringens is grown on a plate where one half of the plate is covered with alpha antitoxin. The half poion of the plate without the antitoxin produces opalescene. - Pho.spholipase or a toxin splits the lecithin into phosphorylcholine and diacyl glycerol. Which is seen as opalescnee. The other half of the plate where alpha antitoxin is present does not demonstrate opalescence because here alpha toxin or phospholipase is neutralized by the toxin.",C

Which of the following amino acid is active at neutral pH?,Histidine,Glycine,Leucine,Arginine,"Ans. aRef.: Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry, 30th edn.Option aTrueYes, due to its pyrolidone ring is stable at neutral pH (pH 7)Option bFalseNo, glycine is simplest amino acid and not affected by pHOption cFalseNo, it is steric hinderance is there due to branched chain amino acidOption dFalseNo, false, it is not affected by pH due to guanidino groupOption eFalseNo, not affected due to aromaticityAt physiological pH (around 7.4) the carboxyl group of the amino acid is unprotonated and the amino group is protonated. Thus an amino acid with no ionizable R-group would be electrically neutral at this pH. This species is termed a zwitterion.Histidine is a unique amino acid as pKa of its imidazole group permits it at pH 7 to function either as a base or as an acid. A minor change in pH changes the ionization charge on histidine to buffer pH change. Therefore it can serve as a buffer and is most stable at physiological pH.However, when histidine is incorporated into a protein, its side chain can be either positively charged or neutral, depending on the ionic environment provided by the polypeptide chains of the protein.This is an important property of histidine that contributes to the role it plays in the functioning of proteins such as hemoglobin.Extra edge: A tetrahydral carbon atom with four distinct parts is known as chiral.

Moderate exercise being one of the most powerful stimulators of ventilation works by the way of,Low aerial PO2,Low PO2 in mixed venous blood,low aerial pH,None of the above,"Moderate exercise doesnot reduce the aerial pO2, increase the aerial pCO2, or reduce the aerial pH. Option A: The brain, upon transmitting motor impulses to the exercising muscles, is believed to transmit collateral impulses into the brainstem at the same time to excite the respiratory center. This action is analogous to the stimulation of the vasomotor center of the brain stem during exercise that causes a simultaneous increase in aerial pressure. Option B: The pO2 of mixed venous blood does fall, but there are no known chemoreceptors that are stimualated as a result. Option C: Two points are impoant regarding pH during moderate exercise: pH = pK + log () The pH of the blood is dependent only on the ratio of the amount of CO2 to the amount of HCO3- The concentration of both buffer components (HCO3- and CO2-) are very large compared to the amount of H+ added to the blood during moderate exercise. Thus, any change in HCO3- due to the addition of H+ during moderate exercise remains constant. When sufficient oxygen is not available during exercise, there is increased accumulation of lactic acid, which initially leads to an increase in paCO2. However, this is counteracted by the stimulation for fuher lactic acid production and prevents a decline in blood pH. Thus, blood pH remains constant in moderate exercise.

During other six phases, atria are relaxed, i.e., atrial diastole,o However, it should be kept in the mind that above described durations of cardiac cycle are not fixed, the durations of various phases of the cardiac cycle depend on the heart rate,o When the heart rate increases, the durations of all the phases decreases,o However, the duration of diastole decreases much more than duration of systole,o The marked reduction in diastolic time during tachycardia has important clinical implication,o It is during diastole that most of the ventricular filling occurs.o Also, it is during diastole that most of the cardiac muscle, especially the subendocardial portion of the left ventricle, gets adequately perfused by the coronary blood flow.o Hence, at heart rates greater than 180 per minute, there is reduction in ventricular filling (which tends to reduce cardiac output) and cardiac perfusion (which tends to cause myocardial ischemia and infarction).",C

Shigellosis is common in travelers to developing countries. Infection is commonly acquired through the,Skin,Gastrointestinal tract,Respiratory tract,Genital tract,"Organisms may be transmitted in a number of ways, such as by air, food, hands, sexual contact, and infected needles. However, for each disease or disease category, there is usually a portal of entry not always unique to the organism. The respiratory tract is a common portal of entry to such airborne organisms as M. tuberculosis. This is why respiratory precautions must be taken when patients are harboring viable M. tuberculosis.The gastrointestinal tract is usually infected from ingestion of contaminated food or water (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter) or by an alteration of the normal microbial flora such as with C. difficile disease. The skin is a tough integument and intact, is resistant to most infectious organisms except those that may break down human skin. Breaches of the skin as by wounds, burns, and the like predispose patients to a variety of infections such as tetanus caused by wound contamination with spores of C. tetani, or direct infection by Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, or Gram-negative rods (such as Serratia or Pseudomonas).The genital tract may become infected either by sexual contact or by alteration of the genital environment as often occurs with yeast infections.

There is a little absorption in the ileum in health because the majority of the free amino acids have already been assimilated at that point. Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. One cause of steatorrhea is defective reabsorption of bile acids in the distal ileum. When bile acid reabsorption is prevented by resection of the terminal ileum or by disease in this poion of the small intestine, the amount of fat in the stools is also increased because when the enterohepatic circulation is interrupted, the liver cannot increase the rate of bile acid production to a sufficient degree to compensate for the loss.

Arterial PO2 is decreased in hypoxia due to,Cyanide poisoning,CO poisoning,COPD,Shock,"COPD presents with Hypoxic Hypoxia. Hypoxic hypoxia is the most common form of hypoxia seen clinically. 
The diseases that cause it can be roughly divided into those in which the gas exchange apparatus fails, those such as congenital heart disease in which large amounts of blood are shunted from the venous to the arterial side of the circulation, and those in which the respiratory pump fails. 
Lung failure occurs when conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis produce alveolar-capillary block, or there is ventilation-perfusion imbalance. 
Pump failure can be due to fatigue of the respiratory muscles in conditions in which the work of breathing is increased or to a variety of mechanical defects such as pneumothorax or bronchial obstruction that limit ventilation. 
It can also be caused by abnormalities of the neural mechanisms that control ventilation, such as depression of the respiratory neurons in the medulla by morphine and other drugs.",C

Lactic acidosis is caused due to deficiency of which vitamin?,Riboflavin,Thiamin,Niacin,Pantothenic acid,"Acute thiamine deficiency causes lactic acidosis. The lack of thiamine, which is needed to conve pyruvate to acetyl Co, causes pyruvate to be conveed into lactic acid; the lactic acid then accumulates, causing acidosis. Acute beriberi due to thiamine deficiency is associated with anorexia, vomiting, lactic acidosis, altered hea rate, and cardiomegaly. Acute beriberi mostly seen in infants. In combination with proteins, riboflavin coenzymes, like flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, function in various dehydrogenation reactions. Deficiency of riboflavin causes cheilosis, glossitis, inflammation of cornea, bloodshot eyes, dimness of vision, photophobia, itching, burning, and dryness of eyes and redness of conjunctiva. Niacin is required for the synthesis of the active forms of vitamin B3, NAD+, and NADP+. Both NAD and NADP function as cofactors for numerous dehydreogenases, e.g. lactate and malate dehydrogenases. Deficiency of niacin causes pellagra characterized by glossitis of the tongue, dermatitis, depression, dementia and diarrhoea. Pantothenic acid is a component of coenzyme A and is required for the synthesis of phosphopantotheine of fatty acid synthases complex. Deficiency causes paraesthesia of extremities, abdominal cramps, restlessness and fatigue in humans. Ref: Advanced Nutrition and Human Metabolism By Sareen Annora Stepnick Gropper, Jack L.

Cells maintain a low intracellular Na+ concentration and a high intracellular K+ concentration by sodium-potassium pump which is an example of:,Active transpo,Passive transpo,Facilitated diffusion,Osmosis,"Some carriers transpo substances against their electrical and chemical gradients. This form of transpo requires energy and is called active transpo. In animal cells, the energy is provided almost exclusively by hydrolysis of ATP. One of these ATPases is sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na, K ATPase), which is also known as the Na, K pump. Na, K ATPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and uses the energy to extrude three Na+ from the cell and take two K+ into the cell for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. It is an electrogenic pump in that it moves three positive charges out of the cell for each two that it moves in, and it is therefore said to have a coupling ratio of 3:2.

Pleural pressure at the end of respiration is ?,Zero,More negative,Positive,Less negative,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., More negativeDuring quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration.Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure)It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3.8 mm Hg (- 5.0 cm watery to -6.0 mm Hg (-8.0 cm water).Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i.e., in the pleural cavity.",B

J-receptors which are responsible for rapid shallow breathing is located in,Thoracic cage and lung,Carotid aery,Alveoli-capillary junction,Aoa,"Receptors in the airways and lungs are innervated by myelinated and unmyelinated vagal fibers. The unmyelinated fibers are C fibers. The receptors innervated by myelinated fibers are commonly divided into slowly adapting receptors and rapidly adapting receptors on the basis of whether sustained stimulation leads to prolonged or transient discharge in their afferent nerve fibers. Because the C fiber endings are close to pulmonary vessels, they have been called J (juxtacapillary) receptors. They are stimulated by hyperinflation of the lung, but they respond as well to intravenous or intracardiac administration of chemicals such as capsaicin.

Oxidative deamination is catalyzed by,Glutaminase,Glutamine synthase,Glutamate dehydrogenase,None of the above,"Oxidative Deamination of Glutamate Only liver mitochondria contains glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) which deaminates glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate plus ammonia. So, all amino acids are first transaminated to glutamate, which is then finally deaminated (transamination) Amino acids are deaminated at the rate of about 50 - 70 g per day. During the transamination reaction, the amino group of all other amino acids is funneled into glutamate. Hence, the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is the final reaction which removes the amino group of all amino acids It needs NAD+ as co-enzyme. (NADP can also act as a coenzyme). It is an allosteric enzyme; it is activated by ADP and inhibited by GTP.

Delta waves on EEG are recorded in:September 2007,REM,01 NREM,02 NREM,Deep sleep,"Ans. D: Deep sleepAlpha waves generally are seen in all age groups but are most common in adults.They occur rhythmically on both sides of the head but are often slightly higher in amplitude on the nondominant side, especially in right-handed individuals.A normal alpha variant is noted when a harmonic of alpha frequency occurs in the posterior head regions.They tend to be present posteriorly more than anteriorly and are especially prominent with closed eyes and with relaxation.Alpha activity disappears normally with attention (e.g., mental arithmetic, stress, opening eyes).In most instances, it is regarded as a normal waveform.An abnormal exception is alpha coma, most often caused by hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy of destructive processes in the pons (e.g., intracerebral hemorrhage).In alpha coma, alpha waves are distributed uniformly both anteriorly and posteriorly in patients who are unresponsive to stimuli.Beta waves are observed in all age groups.They tend to be small in amplitude and usually are symmetric and more evident anteriorly.Drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, augment beta waves.Theta waves normally are seen in sleep at any age. In awake adults, these waves are abnormal if they occur in excess.

Excessive levels of which of the following may have produced this defect?",Bilirubin,Fluoride,Parathormone,Thyroid hormone,"Fluoride excess causes direct injury to ameloblasts, leading to inadequate production of tooth enamel. The resultant defect in enamel production causes recessed and discolored rings on the emerging teeth. Other conditions that cause enamel hypoplasia include inadequate levels of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamins A, C, or D, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. Jaundice in the newborn period may cause bilirubin deposition in the developing teeth, resulting in pigmented, but otherwise normal teeth. Hyperparathyroidism, with resultant hypercalcemia, will result in osteoporosis, renal stones, and neuromuscular weakness, but no obvious dental changes. Enamel hypoplasia is associated with hypoparathyroidism. Hypehyroidism characteristically produces cardiac and nervous disturbances, weight loss, hypermetabolism, and proptosis, but does not cause enamel hypoplasia.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone. Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase, which paicipates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",A

Major metabolism of saturated fatty acids in the mitochondria is called as -,b-oxidation,a-oxidation,o-oxidation,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., b-oxidation o b-oxidation is the principal pathway for catabalism of saturated fatty acids. b-oxidation mainly occurs in mitochondrial matrix (whereas fatty acid synthesis occurs in cytosol).o b-oxidatioon consists of repeated cycles of a series of reactions. With each cycle a two carbon unit (i.e. acetyl CoA molecule) is removed, started at the carboxyl end. Thus complete oxidation of the 16-Carbon fatty acid (e.g. palmitic acid) requires seven such cycles and generates eight molecules of acetyl CoA. In first 6 cycle, 6 acetyl CoA molecules (total 12 carbons) are removed leaving 4- carbon molecules for the last (7th) cycle. In 7th cycle, this 4 carbon molecules is cleaved into 2 acetyl CoA, making the total number of acetyl CoA molecules to eighto It is called b-oxidation because oxidation of fatty acids occurs at the b-carbon atom (3rd carbon and cleavage occurs between 2nd carbon (a-carbon) and 3rd carbon (b-carbon).o The pathway occurs in three stages: (i) Activation of fatty acid in the cytosol; (ii) Transport of activated fatty acid into mitochondria; and (iii) Standard b-oxidation process in mitochondrial matrix.",A

Long chain fatty acids penetrate the inner mitochondrial membrane as,Carnitine derivatives,Pyruvate,Acetyl coA derivatives,Acyl CoA,"Long-Chain Fatty Acids Penetrate the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane as Carnitine Derivatives Carnitine (-hydroxy--trimethylammonium butyrate), (CH3)3N+--CH2--CH(OH)--CH2--COO-, is widely distributed and is paicularly abundant in muscle. Long-chain acyl-CoA (or FFA) cannot penetrate the inner membrane of mitochondria. In the presence of carnitine, however, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I, located in the outer mitochondrial membrane, conves long-chain acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, which is able to penetrate the inner membrane and gain access to the -oxidation system of enzymes. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase acts as an inner membrane exchange transpoer. Acylcarnitine is transpoed in, coupled with the transpo out of one molecule of carnitine. The acylcarnitine then reacts with CoA, catalyzed by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II, located on the inside of the inner membrane, reforming acyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, and carnitine is liberated.

Sprinter gets its immediate energy from,Glycogen,Fatty acid,Creatine phosphate,None.,"Muscular activity accounts for much of the body&;s energy consumption. Muscles have a sho-term store of energy in the form of creatine phosphate which is generated from ATP and can regenerate ATP when needed with creatine kinase. Muscles also keep a storage form of glucose in the form of glycogen. Glycogen can be rapidly conveed to glucose when energy is required for sustained, powerful contractions. Within the voluntary skeletal muscles, the glucose molecule can be metabolized anaerobically in a process called glycolysis which produces two ATP and two lactic acid molecules in the process (note that in aerobic conditions, lactate is not formed; instead pyruvate is formed and transmitted through the citric acid cycle). Muscle cells also contain globules of fat, which are used for energy during aerobic exercise. The aerobic energy systems take longer to produce the ATP and reach peak efficiency, and requires many more biochemical steps.Ref: Ganong&;s review of medical physiology;24th edition; page no-106",C

Mac-Conkey's Agar medium is:,Enriched medium,Enrichment medium,Differential medium,Synthetic medium,"Key Points:-
Differential or indicator media depends on the biochemical properties of a microorganism growing in the presence of specific nutrients or indicators, such as neutral red, phenol red, eosin, or methylene blue. The medium changes color when a bacterium grows in them. For example, S. typhi grows as black colonies on Wilson and Blair medium containing sulfite. Lactose fermenting bacteria, such as E. coli produce pink colonies, whereas non-lactose fermenting bacteria, such as Salmonella spp. form pale or colorless colonies on MacConkey agar. Fermentation of lactose in the medium makes it acidic and leads to the formation of pink colonies in the presence of neutral red.

Non progressive contraction of Esophagus are classed as which of the following?,Primary,Secondary,Teiary,Quaternary,"There are three types of oesophageal contractions: primary, secondary, and teiary. Teiary contractions represents uncordinated contractions of the esophageal smooth muscle and are responsible for esophageal spasm. They are non peristaltic, non progressive and occur with both voluntary and involuntary swallow. Primary peristaltic contractions are the major stripping wave that are initiated by the act of swallowing and that propel ingested material through the entire length of the oesophagus into the stomach. Primary peristaltic contractions are progressive and move down the oesophagus at rate of 2 to 4 cm/sec and reach the LES about 9 seconds after the initiation of swallowing. It relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter before the bolus reaches it. Secondary peristaltic contractions are also progressive, similar to primary peristalsis but elicited by different stimuli. Rather than beginning with swallowing, as in primary peristalsis, the secondary peristaltic wave occurs in response to distension or irritation anywhere along the oesophagus. It begins at the level of the focus of stimulation and propels oesophageal contents distally. In effect, secondary peristalsis is a mechanism for ridding the oesophagus of refluxed gastric contents or material left behind after the progression of the primary peristaltic wave.",C
Secondary active transport true is -,Occurs only in same direction,Occurs only in opposite direction,Uses ATP molecule,No carrier required,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Uses ATP molecule Active transporto As the name suggests active transport is active pumping of drug molecules through a membrane against concentration gradient by a molecular pump (carrier mediated), which requires energy to function.o So, active transport has following characteristics:Movement is against concentration gradientA molecular pump (carrier protein) is required.Energy' is requiredo On the basis of energy utilization, active transport is divided to:Primary- (Direct) active transporty Transporter (carrier protein) binds ATP directly and energy is obtained directly by the hydrolysis of ATP.

Which of the following is suitably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix?,Alanine,Aspaic acid,Tyrosine,Glycine,"The stability of an alpha helix arises primarily from hydrogen bonds formed between the oxygen of the peptide bond carbonyl and the hydrogen atom of the peptide bond nitrogen of the fouh residue down the polypeptide chain. The ability to form the maximum number of hydrogen bonds, supplemented by van der Waals interactions in the core of this tightly packed structure, provides the thermodynamic driving force for the formation of an alpha helix. Since the peptide bond nitrogen of proline lacks a hydrogen atom to contribute to a hydrogen bond, proline can only be stably accommodated within the first turn of an alpha helix. When present elsewhere, proline disrupts the conformation of the helix, producing a bend. Because of its small size, glycine also often induces bends in alpha helices.

The mechanism of action of surfactant is,Lubricates the flow of CO2 diffusion,Binds oxygen,Makes the capillary surface hydrophilic,Breaks the structure of water in the alveoli,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Breaks the structure of water in the alveoli The water molecules on the surface of water (at air-water interphase) have an especially strong attraction for one another. This results in the water surface to contract producing surface tension.Thus the water molecules lining the alveoli produce an elastic contractile force due to surface tension which causes the alveoli to collapse.This surface tension force of water molecules is broken by surfactant (a mixture of phospholipids, proteins and ions, most important phospholipid of which is dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-choline-DPCC). It is secreted by type II alveolar epithelial cells and lines the alveoli.The phospholipid molecules have a hydrophilic head and two parallel hydrophobic 'tails'. Thus only head part of the molecule dissolves in the fluid lining the alveolar surface and the hydrophobic tails face the alveolar lumen. This new surface thus formed of the surfactant has a significantly reduced surface tension than the water molecules.By reducing the surface tension, surfactant serves two purposes:Prevents the alveoli from collapsingPrevents pulmonary edema.",D

In a normal adult sitting with eyes closed EEG will show,Alpha,Beta,Theta,Delta,"Ans. a (Alpha) (Ref. Ganong Physiology 22nd/pg. Chapter 11, Fig. 11-8).In a normal adult sitting with eyes closed EEG will show alpha waves. EEG with eyes open & mind wandering shows Beta waves.EEG wavesKey FactsAlpha# Happen between 8 and 13 times per second, or 8-13 Hertz (Hz).# Alpha represents a sort of ""idle"" state, or ""ready but not doing much"" state and is normally fairly large over the back third of the brain when the eyes are closed and when you are awake.# Alpha disappears when we either get mentally busy (e.g., open the eyes, start doing intense mental work even eyes closed) or when we become drowsy.# Thus the presence of alpha can show the presence of an awake, resting state,# If it is present at a fairly high voltage when the eyes are open, this would usually indicate an inattentive, daydreamy state.# In fact we often see this sign in adolescents and adults with attentional difficulties.Beta waves# The beta family of waves happen at frequencies from 16-40 Hz or higher.# When we get mentally busy and engaged, we should see alpha ""block,"" or reduce significantly in size.# In its place we see mostly smaller, quicker ""beta"" waves.Delta and theta waves# Are relatively slow.# Delta is usually defined as waves occurring from 1-4 times per second (1-4 Hz).# Theta occurs at 4-7 Hz.# During drowsiness, first alpha disappears, then the size of theta waves begins to increase.# As sleep begins, theta waves get quite large, then become mixed with and eventually give way to slower delta waves.# The presence of delta and theta waves in the waking, eyes open EEG is normal, but only if the waves are fairly small.# High-amplitude slow waves can be signs of various neurological and psychological problems, ranging from epilepsy to ADHD. Educational points:# In a typical night of sleep, a young adult first enters NREM sleep, passes through stages 1 and 2, and spends 70-100 minutes in stages 3 and 4.# Sleep then lightens, and an REM period follows. This cycle is repeated at intervals of about 90 minutes throughout the night. The cycles are similar, though there is less stage 3 and 4 sleep and more REM sleep towards morning.# Thus, four to six REM periods occur per night. REM sleep occupies 80% of total sleep time in premature infants and 50% in full-term neonates.# Thereafter, proportion of REM sleep falls rapidly and plateaus at about 25% until it falls further in old age.# In REM, there occurs | and variable pulse, | and variable blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence. ACh is the principal neurotransmitter involved in REM sleep.# Children have more total sleep time and stage 4 sleep than adults.# Serotonergic predominance of raphe nucleus key to initiating sleep.# NE reduces REM sleep.# Extraocular movements during REM due to activity of PPRF (paramedian pontine reticular formation/conjugate gaze center).# Benzodiazepines shorten stage 4 sleep; thus useful for night terrors and sleepwalking# Imipramine is used to treat enuresis because it | stage 4 sleep.# Characteristic feature of NREM stage IV sleep is DELTA waves.FeatureStage of SleepCardiovascular activity in Sleep:Beta wavesAwake with eyes openNREM:BP |with less variability, CO |, vasodilation increases (|flow resistance).Alpha wavesAwake with closed eyesIheta wavesStage 1Tonic REM :BP stays the same, CO stays the same, muscles vasoconstriction.Sleep-SpindlesStage 2Delta wavesStage 3 & 4Phasic REM:BP variable, CO stays the same, whole body vasoconstriction.Beta wavesREM (same as Awake)Mnemonic: (BATS Drink Blood)",A
FIGLU is intermediate product of metabolism of,Histidine,Glutamine,Alanine,Tryptophan,"Ans. a (Histidine) (Ref. Harper's Biochemistry 28th/pg. 16).# Figlu or N-formimino glutamate - is formed during catabolism of Histidine.# During process, transfer of the formimino group of Figlu to tetrahydrofolate (H4 folate) forms glutamine. In folic acid deficiency, this reaction is partially or totally blocked and figlu is excreted in the urine.# Excretion of ""Figlu"" following a test dose of Histidine therefore provides a diagnostic test for folic acid deficiency.# Figlu test and Histidine test: Formimino-glutamate (figlu), a catabolite of Histidine, transfers its formimino group to H4- folate to form N5 formimino-H4 folate.In folate deficiency, Figlu will accumulate after oral challenges with Histidine.Histidine:# maximum buffering capacity- Maximum pH regulation seen# has no charge at neutral pH- proteinate and deproteinate at neutral pH# In folic acid deficiency, group transfer to THF is impaired and Figlu is excreted.",A
"Tissues capable of utilizing the ketone bodies are all the following, EXCEPT:",Brain,Heart,RBCs,Skeletal muscles,"Ans. c (RBCs). (Ref.

Which of the following is TRUE regarding excitation contraction coupling mechanism in smooth muscles?,Presence of troponin is essential,Sustained contraction occurs with high calcium concentration,Phosphorylation of actin is required for contraction,Presence of cellular calcium is essential to cause muscle contraction,"Depending on the activating stimulus, Ca2+ increase can be due to influx through voltage- or ligand-gated plasma membrane channels, efflux from intracellular stores through the RyR receptors, efflux from intracellular stores through the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel, or a combination of these channels. The lack of troponin in smooth muscle prevents Ca2+ activation troponin binding. They do not have the troponin system, and the light chains of smooth muscle myosin molecules differ from those of striated muscle myosin. Myosin in smooth muscle must be phosphorylated for activation of the myosin ATPase. Sustained contraction is by latch bridge mechanism by which myosin cross-bridges remain attached to actin for some time after the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration falls.

This means they can survive only by establishig residence inside animal cells. They need their host's ATP as an energy source for their own cellular activity. They are energy parasites using a cell membrane transpo system that uses ATP from the host system and gives out ADP. This obligate intracellular existence makes it impossible to culture these organisms on nonliving aificial media. Due to their small size and failure to grow in cell - free media they were considered to be viruses. Chlamydiae grows in cultures of a variety of eukaryotic cell lines Mc Coy or HeLa cells. It may be necessary to treat cells with polyanionic compounds such as DEAD-dextran to reduce the electrostatic barrier to infection. Antimetabolite such as cycloheximide is added to our competition for host cell amino acid pools. All types of chlamydiae proliferate in embryonated eggs paiculary in the yolk sac. The special features in structure and chemical composition of chlamydiae are : The outer cell wall resembles the cell wall of gram negative bacteria It has a relatively high lipid content It is rigid but it does not contain typical bacterial peptidoglycan; perhaps it contain a tetrapeptide linked matrix. N Acetylmuramic acid also appears to be absent from chlamydiae cell wall. Antibiotic susceptibility of chlamydiae: Penicillin binding proteins occur in chlamydiae cell wall and chlamydiae cell wall formation is inhibited by penicillins and other drugs that inhibit transpeptidation of bacterial peptidoglycan. But remember the impoant point about t/t, that cell wall inhibitors result in the production of morphologically defective forms but are not effective in clinical disease. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (tetracyclines, erythromycins) are effective in most clinical infections. Erythromycin or tetracyclines are considered the drug of choice for chlamydiae infections.",B

About Neuropeptide Y all are true except:,It is mediated through melanocoicotropin hormone,Decreases thermogenesis,Its level decreases during starvation,Contains 36 aa residues,"its level decreases during starvation As mentioned in the previous question, NPY is an Orexigenic i.e. appetite stimulant. Thus its level increases during starvation to increase food intake and reduce energy expenditure (decrease thermogenesis). NPY is a neurohormone released by hypothalamus. The hypothalamus can sense the body's state of starvation or welfed through a peptide hormone released by adipocytes -Leptin. When the amount of adipose tissue increases (signalling excess energy storage), the adipocytes produce increased amounts of leptin. Leptin acts on hypothalamic nuclei initiating multiple actions that decrease body's fat storage. These actions are: (1) inactivation of NPY-AGRP neurons decreasing production of appetite stimulators, such as NPY and AGRP; (2) activation of POMC neurons, causing release of cc-MSH (melanocoicotropin) and activation of inelanocoin receptors; (3) increased production in the hypothalamus of substances, such as coicotropin-releasing hormone, that decrease food intake; (4) increased sympathetic nerve activity (through neural projections from the hypothalamus to the vasomotor centers), which increases metabolic rate and energy expenditure; and (5) decreased insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta cells, which decreases energy storage. Thus during starvation, leptin production is decreased causing increased levels of NPY. As mentioned in the previous question, there are 2 types of neurons in the hypothalamic nuclei regulating appetite i.e. 1) NPY-AGRP neurons - which release orixogenic substances NPY and AGRP. 2) POMC (proopiomelanocoin) neurons - which release a-MSH (a-Melanocyte stimulating hormone or melanocoicotropin) and CA (Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript). These are anorexigenic i.e. decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure. Note that some students were of the opinion that one of the option was - `NPY and melanocoicotropin have same effect'. In that case this is a false statement as NPY is orexigenic, increases food intake. Melanocoicotropin or MSH is anorexigenic, decreases food intake.

Retinal cells which secrete acetylcholine,Bipolar cells,Ganglion cells,Amacrine cells,H Cells,"The cholinergic amacrine cells of the rabbit retina secrete acetylcholine by two mechanisms. One is activated by stimulation of the retina by light or depolarization of the amacrine cells by K+ ions. It requires the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The second is independent of extracellular Ca2+ and is unaffected by large depolarizations of the cells. It bears some similarity to the acetylcholine &;leakage&; described at the neuromuscular junction. Although the Ca2+-independent mechanism accounts for about two-thirds of the total acetylcholine release in the dark, the amount of acetylcholine released in this way is small compared with the release of acetylcholine triggered by stimulation of the retina with light.

Bronchoscopes are best sterilized with,Glutaraldehyde,Ethylene oxide,Benzalakonium,Betapropiolactone,"Ans. a (Glutaraldehyde) (Ref. Ananthanarayan, Microbiology, 7th/ 31, 86)# Glutaraldehyde:- Is specifically effective against tubercle bacilli, fungi, and viruses.- Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive.- It is less toxic and irritant to eyes than formaldehyde.- It has no deleterious effect on the cement or lenses of instruments like cystoscopes and bronchoscopes.- It can safely be used to treat corrugated rubber anaesthetic tubes and face masks, plastic endotracheal tubes, polythene tubing, and metal instruments.# CIDEX (2% gluteraldehyde) is commonly used for sterilization of endoscopes.# Most rigid endoscopes are compatible with steam,formaldehyde,ethylene oxide and certain liquid chemical disinfectants.# Flexible scopes can also be sterilized by peracetic acid.Ethylene oxide (EO or EtO) gas# Is commonly used to sterilize objects sensitive to temperatures greater than 60degC such as plastics, optics and electrics.# Ethylene oxide treatment is generally carried out between 30degC and 60degC with relative humidity above 30% and a gas concentration between 200-800 mg/L for at least three hours.# Ethylene oxide penetrates well, moving through paper, cloth, and some plastic films and is highly effective.# Ethylene oxide sterilizers are used to process sensitive instruments which cannot be well sterilized by other methods.# EtO can kill all known viruses, bacteria and fungi, including bacterial spores and is satisfactory for most medical materials, even with repeated use.# However it is highly flammable, and requires a longer time to sterilize than any heat treatment.# Ethylene oxide is the most common sterilization method. used for over 70% of total sterilizations. and for 50% of all disposable medical devices.# Bacillus subtilis, a very resistant organism, is used as a rapid biological indicator for EO sterilizers. If sterilization fails, incubation at 37degC causes a fluorescent change within four hours, which is read by an auto-reader. The color change indicates a pH shift due to bacterial metabolism.Formaldehyde solutions# Like Glutaraldehyde, it is also accepted liquid sterilizing agents# Immersion time is sufficiently long (To kill all spores in a clear liquid can take up to 12 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with formaldehyde).

Free fatty acid produced in adipose tissue is transpoed by,Globulin,Albumin,Ceruloplasmin,None.,"Liver-Adipose Tissue AxisLiver produces fatty acid and TAG (triacylglycerol), which is transpoed as VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) in the blood. The fatty acids from VLDL are taken up by adipose tissue with the help of lipoprotein lipase, and stored as TAG. This neutral fat is hydrolysed by hormone-sensitive lipase into NEFA, which is carried byalbumin in blood. The NEFA is utilised by the peripheral tissues, excess of which can be taken up by liver cells.

Following changes are seen during capacitation of a sperms except ?,Increased permeability to calcium,Decreased permeability to calcium,Removal of cholesterol from acrosome,Increased motility,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Decreased permeability to calcium Capacitation of sperm (spermatozoa) Spermatozoa leaving the testis (seminiferous ubules) are not fully mobile. They continue their maturation and acquire their mobility during their passage through epididymis. From epididymis they come to vas deference, distal end of which also receives the secretions of seminal vesicle, and continues as the ejeculatory duct. The ejeculatory duct joins the prostatic urethra. Once ejeculated into the the female, vaginal secretions improve the motility and feilizing ability of sperms. Fuher exposure to secretions of female genital tract (in uterus and/or fallopian tube) fuher improves the mobility and feilizing ability of the sperms. The beneficial effects of stay in the female genital tract are collectively called capacitation, from the isthmus, capacitated sperms move rapidly to the ampullas, where feilization takes place. Following changes occur during capacitation :- i) Uterine and fallopian tube fluids wash away the various inhibitory factors that suppress sperm activity in male genital tract. ii) Removal of cholesterol vesicle from acrosome so that acrosomal membrane becomes weak and can release enzyme at the time of feilization. iii) Increase membrane permeability to calcium ion.",B

It is classically located in the distal ileum within 30 cm of the ileocecal valve, and the structure is a true diveiculum with mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria. Many Meckel's diveicula contain ectopic pancreatic tissue or gastric mucosa, and the acid production from the gastric mucosa may be sufficient to produce a small peptic ulcer in adjacent intestinal mucosa. Such small peptic ulcers are occasional sources of mysterious appendicitis-like pain or intestinal bleeding. Peptic ulceration adjacent to a Meckel's diveiculum should be suspected in any child who presents with massive, painless rectal bleeding. Technetium concentrates in gastric mucosa, and the scan in this patient demonstrated a small amount of ectopic gastric mucosa located in the diveiculum.Acute appendicitis is usually very painful and does not typically cause rectal bleeding.

What is the use of Kinemyography?,Monitoring of neuromuscular function,Monitoring of muscle spindle activity,Monitoring of exercise capacity,Not Recalled,"Acceleromyography (AMG) and kinemyography (KMG) provide increasingly objective measures of neuromuscular function. Kinemyography employs a piezoelectric transducer and consists of a moulded plastic device which mirrors the contour of the outstretched thumb and index finger. Acceleromyography measures acceleration of a given end-organ, e.g., the thumb when moved by the AP. It is related to the actual force by the formula: force = mass x acceleration Also Know: At present, the most versatile technique to monitor neuromuscular function is AMG, since it can be applied at different muscles.

A competitive inhibitor of an enzyme will?,Alter the Vmax of the reaction,Bind to the same site as the substrate,Decrease the apparent Km for the substrate,Decrease the turnover number,"Substances that reduce the activity of an enzyme are called inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to an enzyme but rapidly dissociate from it . There are several types of reversible inhibitors: Competitive inhibitors usually resemble the substrate and compete with it for binding at the active site. Thus, increasing the concentration of substrate will decrease the percent inhibition of the enzyme. The Vmax is unchanged, but the Km is increased. A noncompetitive inhibitor binds with equal affinity to both enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex. This binding leads to a distoion of the substrate binding site, so new substrate cannot bind and/or the product cannot be released. In this kind of inhibition, the Vmax is decreased (choice A), but the Km is not altered. Adding more substrate will not reverse this type of inhibition. This is the equivalent of decreasing the turnover number. An uncompetitive inhibitor does not bind to free enzyme, but binds to the enzyme-substrate complex at a site other than the catalytic site. Once bound by the inhibitor, the enzyme is trapped in the enzyme-substrate complex state until the inhibitor dissociates. In this kind of inhibition, the slope of the reaction (which is the ratio Km/Vmax) remains the same, but both Vmax and Km are reduced. Ref: Janson L.W., Tischler M.E. (2012). Chapter 5.

What is/are effect on membrane when extracellular concentration of K is decreased?,| Magnitude of RMP,| Negativity of the membrane,| Magnitude of RMP,| Negativity of membrane,"Active Transpo of Sodium and Potassium Ions Through the Membrane--The Sodium-Potassium (Na+-K+) Pump. First, let us recall from Chapter 4 that all cell membranes of the body have a powerful Na+-K+ pump that continually transpos sodium ions to the out- side of the cell and potassium ions to the inside, as illus- trated on the left-hand side in Figure 5-4. Fuher, note that this is an electrogenic pump because more positive charges are pumped to the outside than to the inside (three Na+ ions to the outside for each two K+ ions to the inside), leaving a net deficit of positive ions on the inside; this causes a negative potential inside the cell membrane. The Na+-K+ pump also causes large concentration gra- dients for sodium and potassium across the resting nerve membrane. These gradients are the following: Na+ (outside): 142 mEq/L Na+ (inside): 14 mEq/L K+ (outside): 4 mEq/L K+ (inside): 140 mEq/L The ratios of these two respective ions from the inside to the outside are Na+ inside/Na+ outside = 0.1 K+ inside/K+ outside = 35.0 Leakage of Potassium Through the Nerve Membrane. The right side of Figure 5-4 shows a chan- nel protein, sometimes called a ""tandem pore domain,"" potassium channel, or potassium (K+) ""leak"" channel, in the nerve membrane through which potassium can leak even in a resting cell. The basic structure of potassium chan- nels was described in Chapter 4 (Figure 4-4). These K+ leak channels may also leak sodium ions slightly but are far more permeable to potassium than to sodium, normally about 100 times as permeable. As discussed later, this dif- ferential in permeability is a key factor in determining the level of the normal resting membrane potential.

"A segment of an eucaryotic gene that is not represented in the mature mRNA, is known as:",Exon,Intron,Plasmid,TATA box,"Introns are the RNA sequences in the primary transcript that are not found in the mRNA. Exons RNA sequences in the primary transcript that are found in the mRNA. A TATA box is a DNA sequence that indicates the point at which a genetic sequence can be read and decoded. Transcription: Transcription is the process by which DNA is copied (transcribed) to mRNA, which carries the information needed for protein synthesis. Transcription takes place in two broad steps. First, pre-messenger RNA is formed, with the involvement of RNA polymerase enzymes. Second formation of Messenger RNA. Transcription unit: is a linear sequence of DNA that extends from a transcription sta site to a transcription stop site. The transcription unit--that poion of a gene that is copied by RNA polymerase--consists of coding regions of DNA (exons) interrupted by intervening sequences of noncoding DNA (introns). After transcription, during RNA processing, introns are removed and the exons are ligated together to form the mature mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm. 1) Transcription Steps: There are three main steps to the process of DNA transcription. Initiation: RNA Polymerase Binds to DNA. DNA is transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase. Specific nucleotide sequences tell RNA polymerase where to begin and where to end. RNA polymerase attaches to the DNA at a specific area called the promoter region. Elongation: Ceain proteins called transcription factors unwind the DNA strand and allow RNA polymerase to transcribe only a single strand of DNA into a single stranded RNA polymer called messenger RNA (mRNA). The strand that serves as the template is called the antisense strand. The strand that is not transcribed is called the sense strand. Termination: RNA polymerase moves along the DNA until it reaches a terminator sequence. At that point, RNA polymerase releases the mRNA polymer and detaches from the DNA. 2) Pre mRNA processing: RNA splicing: pre-mRNAs typically include introns.Exons:are the continuous coding regions. Introns: are the noncoding intervening sequences. They may serve to separate functional domains (exons) of coding information in a form that permits genetic rearrangement by recombination to occur more rapidly than if all coding regions for a given genetic function were contiguous. Introns are removed by RNA processing in which the intron is looped out and cut away from the exons by snRNPs, and the exons are spliced together to produce the translatable mRNA.

Which is not a step of gluconeogenesis?,Coversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose,Carboxylation of pyruvate,Coversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate,Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate,"Conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate is a step of glycolysis (not of gluconeogenesis).Reaction in gluconeogenesis o Gluconeogenesis involves glycolysis, the citric acid cycle plus some special reactions. Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share the same pathway but in opposite direction. Seven reactions of glycolysis are reversible and therefore are used with same enzyme in the synthesis of glucose by gluconeogenesis. However, three of the reactions of glycolysis are irreversible and must be circumvented by four special reactions which are unique to gluconeogenesis and catalyzed by : (I) Pyruvate carboxylase, (ii) Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase,Fructose-I,6-bisphosphatase , (iv) Glucose-6-phosphatase. These four enzymes are the key enzymes of gluconeogenesis (or gluconeogenesis enzymes). Among these four, pyruvate carboxylase is a mitocondrial enzyme and other three are cytoplasmic enzymes.All three irreversible steps of glycolysis should be bypassed for gluconeogenesis to occur. These three bypass steps are circumvented by four special reactions.A) First bypass (conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate) :- Conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate takes place through two reactions :?i) Carboxylation of pyruvate : - First, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is conveed into oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. Pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme, therefore this reactions occurs in mitochondria only.ii) Conversion of oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate : - Oxaloacetate produced in the mitrochondria cannot cross the membrane. It is first reduced to malate, which then moves across the mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. Malate is, then, reoxidized to oxaloacetate in the cytosol. Oxaloacetate is conveed to phosphoenol pyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase.B) Second bypass : - Conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into fructose-6-phosphate is catalyzed by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Its presence determines whether a tissue is capable of synthesizing glucose (gluconeogenesis) or glycogen (glyconeogenesis) not only from pyruvate, but also from triose phosphate. It is present in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, but is probably absent from hea and smooth muscle.C) Third bypass : - Conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase.",D

Replacing alanine by which amino acid will increase UV absorbance of protein at 280nm wavelength?,Leucine,Proline,Arginine,Tryptophan,"Aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine) absorb UV light at a maximum of 280 nm because the pi electrons in their aromatic rings can absorb photons. That is because benzene, the core of a phenyl group, absorbs UV light as well. Amino acids do not absorb visible light and thus are colorless. However, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and especially tryptophan absorb high-wavelength (250-290 nm) ultraviolet light. Because it absorbs ultraviolet light about ten times more efficiently than phenylalanine or tyrosine, tryptophan makes the major contribution to the ability of most proteins to absorb light in the region of 280 nm.

Best indicator of protein quality is:,Net protein utilization,Digestibility coefficient,Biological value,Amino acid score,"The net protein utilization, or NPU, is the ratio of amino acid conveed to proteins to the ratio of amino acids supplied. It may be affected by the salvage of essential amino acids within the body, but is profoundly affected by the level of limiting amino acids within a foodstuff.This value can be determined by determining dietary protein intake and then measuring nitrogen excretion. One formula for NPU is:NPU = ((0.16 x (24 hour protein intake in grams)) - ((24 hour urinary urea nitrogen) + 2) - (0.1 x (ideal body weight in kilograms))) / (0.16 x (24 hour protein intake in grams))As a value, NPU can range from 1 to 0, with a value of 1 indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was conveed to protein.",A

The progressive growth of septum primum leads to closure of foramen primum Before the complete closure of foramen primum, a second opening appears in septum primum known as foramen secondum in 7th week of IUL. The foramen secondum allows the bidirection blood flow. To make it unidirectional from right atrium to left atrium a septum secondum arises in late 7th week on the right side of septum primum from the roof of primitive atrium. Caudal end of septum secondum overlap the cephalic margin of septum primum. Thus, a valvular foramen ovale is formed. After bih, the caudal edge of septum secondum persist as limbus fossa ovalis, the persistent septum primum from the floor of fossa ovalis which is a oval depression on the right side of inter atrial septum.

Maximum iron absorption occurs in,Duodenum,Jejunum,Ileum,Caecum,"Iron is absorbed from upper small intestine mainly duodenum. In diet, iron occurs in two forms, haem iron and inorganic (non-haem) iron.

Haem iron is better absorbed than inorganic iron, but the major fraction of diet is inorganic iron. Inorganic iron is mostly in ferric form; needs to be reduced to ferrous form because iron is absorbed in ferrous form.

After absorption, ferrous form is once again oxidized to ferric form inside enterocytes.

A fraction of absorbed iron is rapidly delivered to plasma transferrin.
However, most of the iron is deposited in the enterocytes as ferritin,
some to be transferred more slowly to plasma transferrin, and some to be lost when senescent mucosal cells (enterocytes) are sloughed into the intestine.

Iron absorption is regulated according to the demand, e.g., when there is iron deficiency, absorption increases.

This regulation is mediated by “iron metabolism regulatory hormone”, i.e., hepcidin that inhibits iron absorption. When there is iron deficiency, the concentration of hepcidin falls and there is increase iron absorption. Hepcidin also decreases the release of iron from storage sites.",A

Hypothyroidism causes CNS features because of presence of which receptor in brain?,TR alpha 1,TR alpha 2,TR beta 1,TR beta 2,"Thyroid hormones enter cells and T3 binds to thyroid receptors (TR) in the nuclei. T4 can also bind, but not as avidly. The hormone-receptor complex then binds to DNA zinc fingers and increases (or in some cases, decreases) the expression of a variety of different genes that code for proteins that regulate cell function (see Chapter 1). Thus, the nuclear receptors for thyroid hormones are members of the superfamily of hormone-sensitive nuclear transcription factors. There are two human TR genes: an a receptor gene on chromosome 17 and a b receptor gene on chromosome 3. By alternative splicing, each forms at least two different mRNAsand therefore two different receptor proteins. TRb2 is found only in the brain, but TRa1, TRa2, and TRb1 are widely distributed. TRa2 differs from the other three in that it does not bind T3 and its function is not yet fully established. TRs bind to DNA as monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, paicularly the retinoid X receptor (RXR). The TR/RXR heterodimer does not bind 9-cis retinoic acid, the usual ligand for RXR, but TR binding to DNA is greatly enhanced in response to thyroid hormones when the receptor is in the form of this heterodimer. There are also coactivator and corepressor proteins that affect the actions of TRs. Presumably, this complexity underlies the ability of thyroid hormones to produce many different effects in the body. In most of its actions, T3 acts more rapidly and is three to five times more potent than T4.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:308,309",D

Fatty acid synthesis and degradation are similar in that both processes,Take place in the mitochondrion,Use acyl CoA-thioesters,Use NADPH or NADP as a cofactor,Have malonyl CoA as an intermediate,"Although fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation are different processes, both are initiated by forming an acyl CoA intermediate. The synthetic process is said to sta in the cytosol when acetyl CoA is formed from citrate, which is cleaved by citrate lyase. The degrading process stas when the free fatty acid is transpoed into a cell and is conveed into the CoA derivative by fatty acid CoA synthetase (thiokinase). In degradation, the fatty acid is transpoed into the mitochondrion using the carnitine shuttle, where the CoA derivative is reconstituted and subjected to -oxidation, in which the various acyl moieties are always maintained as the CoA derivative. The reducing equivalents obtained by oxidation of the acyl chain are transferred onto NAD+ or FAD to form NADH or FADH2. These cofactors then pass their electrons to the electron transpo chain NADH and succinate dehydrogenase, respectively. Thus, most -oxidation takes place in the mitochondrial matrix in juxtaposition to the electron transpo system. In synthesis, which takes place entirely in the cytosol and uses NADPH as the source of reducing equivalents, the acetyl CoA is transformed to malonyl CoA by a biotin requiring carboxylation reaction, the rate-limiting and regulated reaction in the synthetic sequence. The malonyl moiety of malonyl CoA is transferred to another - SH group on an acyl carrier protein that is pa of the fatty acid synthase complex. The acyl chain then grows in two-carbon increments by the addition of an acetate moiety from acetyl CoA Ref : Biochemistry by U. Satyanarayana 3rd edition Pgno : 287",B

Some of the more commonly used techniques are the following: Q banding: Fixed chromosome spreads are stained without any pretreatment using quinacrine mustard, quinacrine, or other fluorescent dyes and observed with a fluorescence microscope. G banding: Preparations are incubated in a variety of saline solutions using any 1 of several pretreatments and stained with Giemsa's stain. G-banding is generally preferred over Q-banding because G-band analysis is performed by light microscopy. R banding: Preparations are incubated in buffer solutions at high temperatures or at special pH and stained with Giemsa's stain. This process yields the reverse bands of G banding. C banding: Preparations are either heated in saline to temperatures just below boiling or treated with ceain alkali solutions and then stained with Giemsa's stain.

Myosin and actin filaments are kept in place by -,Tropomyosin,Troponin,Actinin,Titin,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Titin o The side-by-side relationship between the myosin and actin filaments is difficult to maintain.o This is achieved by a large number of filamentous molecules of a protein called titin.o Titin molecules act as a framework that holds the myosin and actin filaments in place so that the contractile machinery of the sarcomere will work.Important muscle proteins1. Myosin Myosin is the protein that constitutes the thick filaments. Myosin of skeletal muscle is myosin-II. Myosin participates in the contractile mechanism and also acts as an ATPase.2. Actin :- Actin is the major protein of thin filament. It is the actin which slides over myosin during contraction.3. Tropomyosin : - It is the other protein of thin filament. It covers the active sites (myosin binding sites) on actin. When Ca+2 concentration of cytoplasm (sarcoplasm) is raised, it uncovers the active sites of actin and allow the contraction So, the 'cross-bridge cycling ' is switched off 'or on by the tropomyosin molecule which slides on the actin molecule to cover or uncover the active sites on it.4. Troponin It is a protein also associated with thin filament. The regulatory action of Ca+2 on tropomysin is mediated by troponin, a Ca+2 binding protein. When the cytoplasmic (sarcoplasmic) Ca+2 concentration rises Ca+2 ions bind to troponin-C. The troponin - Ca+2- complex induces changes in Troponin-I and Troponin-T, which in turn brings about a shift of tropomyosin away from the active sites of actin. When the sarcoplasmic Ca+2 concentration falls, Ca+2 dissociates from troponin-C and tropomyosin slides back on the actin filament to cover the active sites. Thus, the first event during muscle contraction, after cytoplasmic rise in Ca+2 concentration, is binding of troponin C to Ca+2 which trigers the further steps by sliding the tropomysin away from the active sites of actin.o There are additional structural proteins in skeletal muscles.Actinin : It binds actin to Z-lines.Thin : It is the largest known protein and connects Z-Iines to M-linesand is responsible for passive stiffness of muscle, by limiting range of motion of sarcomere in tension.Desntin : It adds structures to Z-lines in part by binding the Z-lines to plasma membrane.",D

Cardiac output increases by -,Standing from lying down position,Expiration,Increased cardiac contractility,Parasympathetic stimulation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increased cardiac contractility Factors affecting cardiac outputo Cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate. Hence any factor which affects either the stroke volume or the heart rate or both affects the cardiac output.A) Factors affecting stroke volume# Stroke volume, which is the amount of blood pumped by the heart during one stroke, depends mainly on three factors : -1) Preload (Degree of ventricular fdling during diastole) : - Cardiac preload is represented by volume of venous blood that distends the ventricle, i.e., venous return determines the preload. An increase in preload, i.e., increase in venous return results in a higher end-diastolic volume (Preload). This results in stretching of myocardial fiber and this increase in length of myofibril increases the strength of cardiac contraction in accordance with the Frank-Star ling law or Starling rs taw of the heart. According to Starling's law, greater the initial length of muscle fiber, greater is the force of contraction. The initial length of muscle fiber (length of fiber at the initiation of contraction/systole) refers to length of the fiber at the end of the diastole, i.e., end-diastolic fiber length. Thus, the factors which improve venous return increase the cardiac output by increasing end-diastolic ventricular volume and length, i.e., preload. Opposite is true for factors which decrease venous return.| Stroke volume| Stroke volumeFactors increasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors increasing venous return or preload)#Increased total blood volume#Increased venous tone#Increased pumping action of skeletal muscle#Increased negative intrathoracic pressure (e.g. inspiration)o Lying down from sitting or standing position# Sympathatic discharge causing decrease in venous capacitance by decreasing venous complianceFactors decreasing end-diastolic ventricular muscle fiber length (Factors decreasing venous return or preload)o Decreased total blood volumeo Decreased venous toneo Decreased pumping action of skeletal muscleso Less negative or positive intrathoracic pressure (expiration)o Sitting or standing (venous pooling of blood)Contractility of ventricle : - If the contractile strength of ventricle increases, stroke volume increases. Contractility is increased by increase in sympathetic discharge or circulating catecholamines (epinephrine), for example during exercise.After load (resistance offered to ventricular pumping action): - Left ventricle has to pump out blood against aortic resistance. Increased aortic resistance (e.g., high BP) tends to decrease stroke volume. Decreased peripheral resistance increases cardiac output e.g., in exercise, AVfistula or shunt, severe anemia (due to vasodialtion by anemic hypoxia), thyrotoxicosis (due to vasodilation caused by in- creased O2 consumption), and wet beri-beri.B) Factors affecting heart rate# Heart rate is predominantly under neurohumoral influence. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and therefore cardiac output. Thus, sympathetic stimulation increases cardiac output massively by : (i) Increasing stroke volume by increasing contractility, and (ii) Increasing heart rate; but without increasing the end-diastolic volume.",C

Which of the following is known as the guardian of the genome,P53,Mdm2,P14,ATM,"Ref Robbins 7/e p302; 303; 304;9/e p293 TP53 Gene: Guardian of the Genome The p53-encoding tumor suppressor gene, TP53, is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human cancers. The p53 protein thwas neoplastic transformation by three interlocking mechanisms: activation of temporary cell cycle arrest (termed quiescence), induction of permanent cell cycle arrest (termed senescence), or triggering of pro- grammed cell death (termed apoptosis). If Rb ""senses"" external signals, p53 can be viewed as a central monitor of internal stress, directing the stressed cells toward one of these three pathways. A variety of stresses trigger the p53 response pathways, including anoxia, inappropriate oncoprotein activity (e.g., MYC or RAS), and damage to the integrity of DNA. By managing the DNA damage response, p53 plays a central role in maintaining the integrity of the genome, as described next. In nonstressed, healthy cells, p53 has a sho half-life (20 minutes) because of its association with MDM2, a protein that targets p53 for destruction. When the cell is stressed, for example, by an assault on its DNA, ""sensors"" that include protein kinases such as ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) are activated. These activated complexes catalyze post-translational modifications in p53 that release it from MDM2 and increase its half-life and enhance its ability to drive the transcription of target genes. Hundreds of genes whose transcription is triggered by p53 have been found. These genes suppress neoplastic transformation by three mechanisms: * p53-mediated cell cycle arrest may be considered the primor- dial response to DNA damage (Fig. 5-23). It occurs late in the G1 phase and is caused mainly by p53-dependent transcription of the CDKI gene CDKN1A (p21). The p21 protein, as described earlier, inhibits cyclin-CDK com- plexes and prevents phosphorylation of Rb, thereby arresting cells in the G1 phase. Such a pause in cell cycling is welcome, because it gives the cells ""breathing time"" to repair DNA damage",A

A Patient with increased BP and decreased hea rate is likely to have,Increased ICT,Deep sea diving,Brain tumor,Head tumor,"Cushing's reflex , is a physiological nervous system response to increased intra cranial pressure.Results in cushings triad - increased BP, irregular breathing and bradycardia. Usually seen in terminal stages of head injury . It can also be seen after iv administration of epinephrine. In head injury- CPP=MAP-ICP. CPP- cerebral perfusion pressure. MAP- Mean aerial pressure. ICP- intra cranial pressure Head injury causes increased ICP thus lowering CPP causing ischemia. When ICP approaches the level of mean systemic pressure , cerebral perfusion falls . Bodys response to fall in cerebral perfusion is raise systemic blood pressure and dialate cerebral vessels which increases cerebral blood volume and increases ICP followed by lowering CPP.And causes a vicious cycle. When aerial pressure lowers , a reflex called CNS ischaemic response is initiated by the hypothalamus . Hypothalamus activates sympathetic nervous system causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output. This increases aerial pressure and cerebral blood flow is restored. This response stimulates the baroreceptors in the carotid bodies thus slowing the hea rate drastically- bradycardia(baroreceptor reflex -refer image) 2) Marey's law- Explained by barereceptor reflex States that' hea rate is inversely propoional to blood pressue '(but not the vice versa) .

The capsular polysaccharide because of its acidic and hydrophilic propeies, protects the cocci from phagocytosis. Capsulated streptococcus pneumoniae are not phagocytosed efficiently in fluid media or exudates, however, they are susceptible to surface phagocytosis, being engulfed against a firm surface, such as a fibrin clot or epithelium . The enhanced virulence of type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae is due to the abundance of its capsular material. Non-capsulated strains are avirulent. Antibody to capsular polysaccharide affords protection against infection. Penicillin-resistant strains and strains resistant to erythromycin and tetracycline are found.

Monitoring of DNA denaturation in vitro is done by ?,Centrifugation,UV absorption,Chromatography,HPLC,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., UV absorptionDenaturation (melting) of DNADenaturation (melting) refers to separation of the two strands of the DNA into two component strands. When temperature of medium is raised, the hydrogen bonds linking of complementary base pair tends to break. As a result, separation of two strands occur. Melting temperature (Tm) indicates the temperature at which half of the double stranded structure is lost. Normally, Tm is between 85deg C and 95deg C.Since G and C are linked more strongly by three hydrogen bonds, in contrast to two hydrogen bonds linking A and T, G and C linking provides thermostability to DNA. Therefore, DNA molecules having higher GC content have relatively higher Tm. For every 10% increase in GC content, melting temperature increases by 5degC. Simple formula is -Tm (degC ) = 2 (number of AT base pairs) + 4 (number of GC base pairs)In addition to heat, alkali treatment and decrease of salt conentration also cause denatruation. Decrease in salt concentration decreases Tm. Therefore, increase in salt concentration increases DNA duplex stability. Denaturation affects propeies of DNA and these can be used to monitor strand separation -i) Hyperchomicity (hyperchromic effect) : DNA bases (purines and pyrimidines) absorb UV light of 260 nm. Upon denaturation, this optical absorbance is increased and is called hyperchromicity of denaturation or hyperchromic effect.ii) Viscosity : Viscosity of the DNA solution decreases on melting (denaturation) because single strands are more flexible than the stiff, resilient double helix.The separated strands of denatured DNA can rejoin on gradual cooling. This is called renaturation or reannealing.",B

All are steps of PCR EXCEPT:,Denaturation,Annealing,Extension,Transformation,"ANSWER: (D) TransformationREF: Harper's 28 ed chapter 39The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method of amplifying a target sequence of DNA. PCR provides a sensitive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any desired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence. The DNA sample is first heated to separate the two strands of the template DNA containing the target sequence; the primers, added in vast excess, are allowed to anneal to the DNA; and each strand is copied by a DNA polymerase, starting at the primer sites in the presence of all 4 dXTPs. The two DNA strands each serve as a template for the synthesis of new DNA from the two primers. Repeated cycles of heat denaturation, annealing of the primers to their complementary sequences, and extension of the annealed primers withDNA polymerase result in the exponential amplification of DNA segments of defined length (a doubling at each cycle). Early PCR reactions used an E coli DNA polymerase that was destroyed by each heat denaturation cycle. Substitution of a heat-stable DNA polymerase from Thermusaquaticus (or the corresponding DNA polymerase from other thermophilic bacteria), an organism that lives and replicates at 70-80degC, obviates this problem and has made possible automation of the reaction, since the polymerase reactions can be run at 70degC. This has also improved the specificity and the yield of DNA.",D

Pyridoxine deficiency leads to altered metabolism of?,Phenylalanine,Tryptophan,Methionine,Tyrosine,"ANSWER: (B) TryptophanREF: Harper 27th ed chapter 29Tryptophan is degraded to amphibolic intermediates via the kynurenine-anthranilate pathway. Tryptophan oxygenase (tryptophan pyTrolase) opens the indole ring, incorporates molecular oxygen, and forms N-formylkynurenine. An iron porphyrin metalloprotein that is inducible in liver by adrenal corticosteroids and by tryptophan, tryptophan oxygenase is feedback-inhibited by nicotinic acid derivatives, including NADPH. Hydrolytic removal of the formyl group of N-formylkynurenine, catalyzed by kynurenine formylase, produces kynurenine. Since kynureninase requires pyridoxal phosphate, excretion of xanthurenate in response to a tryptophan load is diagnostic of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency. Hartnup disease reflects impaired intestinal and renal transport of tryptophan and other neutral amino acids. Indole derivatives of unabsorbed tryptophan formed by intestinal bacteria are excreted. The defect limits tryptophan availability? for niacin biosynthesis and accounts for the pellagra-like signs and symptoms.",B

All of the following are the reasons for impaired absorption of calcium except:,Inositol hexaphosphate in cereals,High intake of oxalate,High concentrations of fatty acids in the intestinal lumen,Decreased iron intake,"Phytic acid (inositol hexaphosphate) in cereals binds calcium in the intestinal lumen, preventing its absorption. Other minerals, including zinc, are also chelated by phytate. This is mainly a problem among people who consume large amounts of  unleavened  whole-wheat  products;  yeast  contains  an enzyme, phytase, that dephosphorylates phytate, so rendering it inactive. High concentrations of fatty acids in the intestinal lumen, as a result of impaired fat absorption, can also reduce calcium absorption by forming insoluble calcium salts; a high intake of oxalate can sometimes cause deficiency since calcium oxalate is insoluble.

Best investigation when there is clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism in a patient is,D-dimer assay,Multi detector CT angiography,Doppler ultrasound,Catheter angiography,"CT of the chest with intravenous contrast is the principal imaging test for the diagnosis of PE . Multidetector-row spiral CT acquires all chest images with <=1 mm of resolution during a sho breath hold. Sixth-order branches can be visualized with resolution superior to that of conventional invasive contrast pulmonary angiography. CTPA is the first-line diagnostic test . It has the advantage of visualising the distribution and extent of the emboli or highlighting an alternative diagnosis, such as consolidation, pneumothorax or aoic dissection. The sensitivity of CT scanning may be increased by simultaneous visualisation of the femoral and popliteal veins, although this is not widely practised. As the contrast media may be nephrotoxic, care should be taken in patients with renal impairment, and CTPA avoided in those with a history of allergy to iodinated contrast media. In these cases, either V/Q scanning or ventilation/perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (V /Q SPECT) may be considered Colour Doppler ultrasound of the leg veins may be used in patients with suspected PE, paicularly if there are clinical signs in a limb, as many will have identifiable proximal thrombus in the leg veins.

Which of the following will take place during skeletal muscle contraction?,A band shoen,Both H and I band shoen,Both A and I band shoen,Both A and H band shoen,"During contraction, the I band decreases in size as thin filaments penetrate the A band. The H band--the pa of the A band with only thick filaments--diminishes in width as the thin filaments completely overlap the thick filaments. A net result is that each sarcomere, and consequently the whole cell (fiber), is greatly shoened. Also know: The light I band is divided by the dark Z line, and the dark A band has the lighter H band in its center. A transverse M line is seen in the middle of the H band, and this line plus the narrow light areas on either side of it are sometimes called the pseudo-H zone. The area between two adjacent Z lines is called a sarcomere. The thick filaments, which are about twice the diameter of the thin filaments, are made up of myosin; the thin filaments are made up of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin.

Regarding breast cancer all are true except,Increase with increasing age,Medullary cancer has the poorest prognosis,Involvement of subdermal lymphatic carries bad prognosis,Increased incidence with estrogen exposure,"Invasive Breast Carcinoma Invasive breast cancers have been described as lobular or duc- tal in origin.128-131 Early classifications used the term lobular to describe invasive cancers that were associated with LCIS, whereas all other invasive cancers were referred to as ductal. Current histologic classifications recognize special types of breast cancers (10% of total cases), which are defined by spe- cific histologic features. To qualify as a special-type cancer, at least 90% of the cancer must contain the defining histologic features. invasive breast cancers are described as invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (NST). These can- cers generally have a worse prognosis than special-type cancers. Foote and Stewa originally proposed the following classifica- tion for invasive breast cancer125: 1. Paget's disease of the nipple 2. Invasive ductal carcinoma--Adenocarcinoma with produc- tive fibrosis (scirrhous, simplex, NST), 80% 3. Medullary carcinoma, 4% 4. Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma, 2% 5. Papillary carcinoma, 2% 6. Tubular carcinoma, 2% 7. Invasive lobular carcinoma, 10% 8. Rare cancers (adenoid cystic, squamous cell, apocrine) Medullary carcinoma is a special-type breast cancer; it accounts for 4% of all invasive breast cancers and is a frequent phenotype of BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer. Grossly, the can- cer is soft and hemorrhagic. A rapid increase in size may occur secondary to necrosis and hemorrhage. On physical examina- tion, it is bulky and often positioned deep within the breast. Bilaterality is repoed in 20% of cases. Medullary carcinoma is characterized microscopically by: (a) a dense lymphoreticular infiltrate composed predominantly of lymphocytes and plasma cells; (b) large pleomorphic nuclei that are poorly differentiated and show active mitosis; and (c) a sheet-like growth pattern with minimal or absent ductal or alveolar differentiation. Approxi- mately 50% of these cancers are associated with DCIS, which characteristically is present at the periphery of the cancer, and <10% demonstrate hormone receptors. In rare circumstances, mesenchymal metaplasia or anaplasia is noted. Because of the intense lymphocyte response associated with the cancer, benign or hyperplastic enlargement of the lymph nodes of the axilla may contribute to erroneous clinical staging. Women with this cancer have a better 5-year survival rate than those with NST or invasive lobular carcinoma. Ref: schwaz's principles of surgery 10th edition Pgno: 521",B

Chloramphenicol resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is due to:,Inactivation of the antimicrobial drug,Alteration of the antimicrobial target,Active efflux pumping out of the drug,Decreased permeability of the drug,"Bacteria have evolved in various ways to counter the toxic propeies of antimicrobial agents. These are the following: i. Inactivation of the antimicrobial drug Resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics in many bacteria is due to production of an enzyme beta-lactamase, which inactivates the antimicrobial agent. Genes encoding betalactamases may be present on chromosome or plasmid. These genes may be constitutively expressed or induced by a beta-lactam antibiotic. Such form of resistance is seen in S.aureus, H.influenzae, E.coli, K.pneumoniae etc. Aminoglycoside modifying enzymes destroy the drug by adenylylating, phosphorylating, or acetylating them. The genes encoding for aminoglycoside modifying enzymes are usually found on plasmids and transposons. This type of resistance is seen in members of Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobactersps, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S.aureus, Campylobacterjejuni etc. ii. Alteration of the antimicrobial target As a result of mutation, the targets of the antimicrobial agents get lost or altered. Sometimes, the existing target may be replaced by an entirely novel protein. Resistances to penicillins/cephalosporins in MRSA, S. pneumoniae or enterococci are often to due to production of altered/novel penicillin binding proteins. Methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA renders the receptor on 50S subunit altered, thereby preventing the binding of erythromycin. Mutations in the 30S subunit of the ribosome interfere with ribosomal binding of streptomycin. Methylation of a single adenine in the bacterial 50s ribosome can lead to resistance against macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B in S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. iii. Adaptation of alternative metabolic pathway Some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require extracellular PABA but, like mammalian cells, can utilize preformed folic acid. A mutational loss in bacteria make them dependent on an external supply of thymine, which contributes to trimethoprim resistance. A mutational change in H. influenzae results in overproduction of dihydrofolate reductases, leading to trimethoprim resistance. iv. Active efflux pumping out of the drug Mutations in ceain bacteria permit the over-expression of the efflux-pump protein.Sometimes, an amino acid substitution in the efflux-pump protein makes it more efficient at expo of the drug. In either case, the intracellular antibiotic concentration is decreased and the bacterium becomes less susceptible to that antibiotic. This kind of resistance is seen to chloramphenicol (P.aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. typhimurium, V. cholerae), macrolides (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus sps, Bacteroides sps, Pseudomonas sps and Enterobacteriaceae members), tetracyclines (S. aureus, E. coli, A. baumannii, S. typhimurium), aminoglycosides (E. coli, P.aeruginosa, A. baumannii) and beta-lactams (H. influenzae, P.aeruginosa, A. baumannii). v. Decreased permeability of the drug Some strains of P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli exhibit aminoglycoside resistance due to a transpo defect or membrane impermeabilization. Resistance to cefoxitin in E. coli and K. pneumoniae is due to mutations leading to narrowed outer membrane proteins. Ref: Colour Atlas and Textbook of diagnostic Microbiology by Elmer. W. Koneman; 5th edition.",C

Anatomical dead space is?,l/3rd of tidal volume,2/5th of tidal volume,10 ml/kg of body weight,15 ml/kg of body weight,"ANSWER: (A) 1/3rd of tidal volumeREF: Guyton physiology 11th edition page 478, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_space_%28ph ysiology%29Indirect repeat in December 2010""The normal dead space air in a young adult man is about 150 millilitres. This increases slightly with age1'Some of the air a person breathes never reaches the gas exchange areas but simply fills respiratory passages where gas exchange does not occur, such as the nose, pharynx, and trachea.This air is called dead space air because it is not useful for gas exchange.TOTAL DEAD SPACE (also known as ""PHYSIOLOGICAL"" DEAD SPACE) can be divided into anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space.ANATOMICAL DEAD SPACEAnatomical dead space is the gas in the conducting areas of the respiratory system, such as the mouth and trachea, where air does not come into contact with the alveoli of the lungs. Birds, which, relatively, have a far longer and wider trachea than mammals, have a higher proportion of dead space.It is normally equal in milliliters to your body weight in pounds. A150 lb (68 kg) male would have an anatomical dead space of about 150 mL (1 mL per lb or 2.2 mL per kilogram of body weight). This is the same conversion of kilograms to pounds, except the final unit is in mL. This is about a third of the resting tidal volume (450-500 mL).Anatomic dead space is the volume of the conducting airways. It may be measured by Fowler's method, a nitrogen washout technique.ALVEOLAR DEAD SPACEAlveolar dead space is caused by air contacting alveoli without blood flow in their adjacent pulmonary capillaries, i.e. ventilation without perfusion. As a result, no gas exchange can occur. Alveolar dead space is negligible in healthy individuals, but can increase dramatically in some lung diseases",A

"True about Chvostek's sign are all of the following except: March 2010, March 2013",Denotes neuromuscular hyperexcitability,Elicited over face,Raised calcium level,Facial nerve is stimulated by tapping,"Ans. C: Raised calcium levelPTH is essential for life. After parathyroidectomy, there is a steady decline in the plasma Ca2+ level. Signs of neuromuscular hyperexcitability appear, followed by full-blown hypocalcemic tetany.In humans, tetany is most often due to inadveent parathyroidectomy during thyroid surgery. Symptoms usually develop 2-3 days postoperatively but may not appear for several weeks or more. Injections of PTH correct the chemical abnormalities, and the symptoms disappear. Injections of Ca2+ salts give temporary relief.The signs of tetany in humans include Chvostek's sign, a quick contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles elicited by tapping over the facial nerve at the angle of the jaw; and Trousseau's sign, a spasm of the muscles of the upper extremity that causes flexion of the wrist and thumb with extension of the fingers",C

"HIV patient is admitted with malabsorption, fever, chronic diarrhoea and acid fast positive organism. What is the likely causative agent?",Giardia,Microsporidia,Isospora,E. histolytica,"The coccidian parasite Isospora belli causes human intestinal disease. Infection is acquired by the consumption of oocysts, after which the parasite invades intestinal epithelial cells and undergoes both sexual and asexual cycles of development. Oocysts excreted in stool are not immediately infectious but must undergo fuher maturation. In patients who have AIDS, infections often are not self-limited but rather resemble cryptosporidiosis, with chronic, profuse watery diarrhea. Eosinophilia, which is not found in other enteric protozoan infections, may be detectable. The diagnosis is usually made by detection of the large (25-m) oocysts in stool by modified acid-fast staining. Oocyst excretion may be low-level and intermittent; if repeated stool examinations are unrevealing, sampling of duodenal contents by aspiration or small-bowel biopsy (often with electron-microscopic examination) may be necessary.

This is an example of:,Competitive inhibition,Non-competitive inhibition,Both,None.,"Competitive Inhibitors: 

In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor (I) binds to the substrate-binding portion of the active site thereby blocking access by the substrate. 
The structures of most classic competitive inhibitors, therefore, tend to resemble the structure of a substrate, and thus are termed substrate analogs. 
Inhibition of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase by malonate illustrates competitive inhibition by a substrate analog.

Key Concept:
Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds reversibly to the same site that the substrate would normally occupy and, therefore, competes with the substrate for that site.

Glucogenic amino acid transported to the liver most commonly -,Alanine,Glycine,Lysine,Leucine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Alanine o Transport of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions :-Providing substrate for giuconeogenesisTransport of ammonia (NH4+) to liver for urea synthesis.o During the first few days of starvation, there is a rapid breakdown of muscle protein, providing aminoacids for giuconeogenesis. The most important gluconeogenic amino acid is alanineQ (through glucose-alanine cycle). Alanine is released due to increased muscle protein breakdownQ and is transported to liver for giuconeogen-esis (glucose alanine cycle). The other important gluconeogenic amino acid in starvation is glutamine,o After some weeks of starvation, the rate of muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy'. However, when the triacylglycerol stores are completely exhaused, muscle proteins once again enter in a stage of rapid depletion due to protein breakdown,o Alanine transport from muscle to liver has an important additional role, beside giuconeogenesis. Because muscle is incapable of synthesizing urea, most of the ammonia formed by protein catabolism is transferred to pyruvate to form alanine by transamination. Alanine is transported to liver where amino group of alanine is removed to form urea and the resulting pyruvate is converted to glucose by giuconeogenesis.o Thus, sources of alanine release from muscle are (i) Degradation of protein (ii) Transamination of pyruvate.o Besides alanine, lactate produced in muscles by anerobic use of glucose, also seves as a substrate for giuconeogenesis - cori cycle or lactic acid cycle",A

Surfactant acts to maintain the lung compliance by decreasing the following factor:,Pleural pressure,Intrathoracic pressure,Surface tension,Pleural fluid secretion,"Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence of surfactant in the fluid lining the alveoli. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant also helps to prevent pulmonary edema.

 The injury is due to undue separation of the head from the shoulder; which may be seen in : -

i. Birth injury
ii. Fall on the shoulder
iii. During Anesthesia
 
Clinical features of Erb’s palsv
A. Muscles paralysed: Mainly biceps brachii, deltoid, branchialis and brachioradialis. Partly supraspinatus, infraspinatus and supinator.
B. Deformity (position of the limb)
i. Arm : Hanges by the side; it is adducted and medially rotated
ii. Forearm : Extended and pronated
The deformity is known as “policeman's tip hand’ or ‘porter’s tip hand’.
C. Disability : The following movements are lost.

 Abduction and lateral rotation of the arm (shoulder),
 Flexion and supination of the forearm,
 Biceps and supinator jerks are lost.
 Sensations are lost over a small area over the lower part of the deltoid.

 Cause of injury: Undue abduction of the arm, as in clutching something with the hands after a fall from a height, or sometimes in birth injury,
 Nerve roots involved : - Mainly T1 and partly C8.
 Muscles paralysed

i. Intrinsic muscles of the hand (T1).
ii. Ulnar flexors of the wrist and fingers (C8)
iii. Deformity (position of the hand). Claw hand due to the unopposed action of the long flexors and extensors of the fingers. In a claw hand there is hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the interphalangeal joints.

 Disability

i. Claw hand
ii. Cutaneous anaesthesia and analgesia in a narrow' zone along the ulnar border of the forearm and hand.
iii. Homer’s syndrome if T1 is injured proximal to white ramus communicans to first thoracic sympathetic ganglion. There is ptosis, miosis, anhydrosis, enophthalmos, and loss of ciliospinal

Substance which binds to substrate other than catalytic enzyme is,Competitive inhibitor,Non-competitive inhibitor,Reversible inhibitor,None of the above,"Non-competitive inhibition models a system where the inhibitor and the substrate may both be bound to the enzyme at any given time. When both the substrate and the inhibitor are bound, the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex cannot form product and can only be conveed back to the enzyme-substrate complex or the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Non-competitive inhibition is distinguished from generally mixed inhibition in that the inhibitor has an equal affinity for the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex.The most common mechanism of non-competitive inhibition involves reversible binding of the inhibitor to an allosteric site, but it is possible for the inhibitor to operate other means including direct binding to the active site. It differs from competitive inhibition in that the binding of the inhibitor does not prevent binding of substrate, and vice versa, it simply prevents product formation for a limited time.This type of inhibition reduces the maximum rate of a chemical reaction without changing the apparent binding affinity of the catalyst for the substrate",B

Somatic innervation to the pelvic organs is -,Greater splanchnic nerve,Lesser splanchnic nerve,Pudendal nerve,Ilioinguinal nerve,"Ans. C. Pudendal nervea. Pudendal nerve (in the pelvis)The pudendal nerve arises from the ventral divisions of the second, third and fourth sacral ventral rami and is formed just above the superior border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the upper fibres of ischiococcygeus. It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen between piriformis and ischiococcygeus, enters the gluteal region and crosses the sacrospinous ligament close to its attachment to the ischial spine, where it lies medial to the internal pudendal vessels. It accompanies the internal pudendal artery through the lesser sciatic foramen into the pudendal (Alcock's) canal on the lateral wall of the ischio-anal fossa. In the posterior part of the canal it gives rise to the inferior rectal nerve, the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.b. Inferior rectal nerveThe inferior rectal nerve runs through the medial wall of the pudendal canal with the inferior rectal vessels. It crosses the ischio-anal fossa to supply the external anal sphincter, the lining of the lower part of the anal canal, and the circumanal skin. It frequently breaks into terminal branches just before reaching the lateral border of the sphincter. Its cutaneous branches distributed around the anus overlap the cutaneous branches of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and of the scrotal or labial nerves. The inferior rectal nerve occasionally arises directly from the sacral plexus and crosses the sacrospinous ligament or reconnects with the pudendal nerve. In females, the inferior rectal nerve may supply sensory branches to the lower part of the vagina.c. Perineal nerveThe perineal nerve is the inferior and larger terminal branch of the pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal. It runs forwards below the internal pudendal artery and accompanies the perineal artery, dividing into posterior scrotal or labial and muscular branches. The posterior scrotal or labial nerves are usually double and have medial and lateral branches which run over the perineal membrane and pass forwards in the lateral part of the urogenital triangle with the scrotal or labial branches of the perineal artery. They supply the skin of the scrotum or labia majora, overlapping the distribution of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous and inferior rectal nerves. In females, the posterior labial branches also supply sensory fibres to the skin of the lower vagina.Muscular branches arise directly from the pudendal nerve to supply the superficial transverse perinei, bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, deep transverse perinei, sphincter urethrae and the anterior parts of the external anal sphincter and levator ani. In males, a nerve to the bulb of the urethra leaves the nerve to the bulbospongiosus, pierces this muscle to supply the corpus spongiosum penis and ends in the urethral mucosa.d. Dorsal nerve of the penis or clitorisThe dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris runs anteriorly above the internal pudendal artery along the ischiopubic ramus deep to the perineal membrane. It supplies the corpus cavernosum and accompanies the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris between the layers of the suspensory ligament. In males, the dorsal nerve of the penis runs on the dorsum of the penis to end in the glans. In females the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is very small.",C

Therefore, they can donate and accept protons at various pH values and act as buffers over a broad pH spectrum. There is only one N-terminal amino group (pKa 9) and one C-terminal carboxyl group (pKa 3) per polypeptide chain. At physiologic pH, these groups would not be accepting or donating protons because the amino terminal group would always be protonated, and the carboxyl terminal carboxylic acid would always be deprotonated. Peptide bonds are not readily hydrolyzed, and such hydrolysis would not provide buffering action. Hydrogen bonds have no buffering capacity because the hydrogen in these bonds is not donated or accepted once the bond is formed.",B

"Factors affecting the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen are all of the following, EXCEPT:",pH,Temperature,"2,3-DPG",PCO2,"Three impoant conditions affect the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve: pH, the temperature, and the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG). The decrease in O2 affinity of hemoglobin when pH of blood falls is called the Bohr effect and is closely related to the fact that deoxyhemoglobin binds H+ more actively than does oxyhemoglobin. The pH of blood falls as its CO2 content increases, so that when the PCO2 rises. But CO2 does not change directly the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The greater affinity of fetal hemoglobin F than adult hemoglobin A for O2 facilitates the movement of O2 from the mother to the fetus. The cause of this greater affinity is the poor binding of 2,3-DPG by the g polypeptide chains that replace b chain in fetal hemoglobin. Some abnormal hemoglobins have high O2 affinity causes enough tissue hypoxia to stimulate increased red cell formation, with resulting polycythemia.

The intravesical pressure rises abruptly when the bladder volume is about?,400 ml,300 ml,200 ml,100 ml,"Micturition: A plot of intravesical pressure against the volume of fluid in the bladder is called a cystometrogram. The curve shows an initial slight rise in pressure when the first increments in volume are produced; a long, nearly flat segment as fuher increments are produced; and a sudden, sharp rise in pressure as the micturition reflex is triggered. These three components are sometimes called segments Ia, Ib, and II. The first urge to void is felt at a bladder volume of about 150 mL, and a marked sense of fullness at about 400 mL. The flatness of segment Ib is a manifestation of the law of Laplace. This law states that the pressure in a spherical viscus is equal to twice the wall tension divided by the radius. In the case of the bladder, the tension increases as the organ films, but so does the radius. Therefore, the pressure increase is slight until the organ is relatively full. >300 to 400 mL, collection of more urine in the bladder causes the pressure to rise rapidly.",A

White infracts are seen in which of the following,Kidney,Spleen,Hea,All the above,"Ref Robbins 8/e p128; 7/e p138 see explanations of earlier question White infarcts occur with aerial occlusions in solid organs with end-aerial circulations (e.g., hea, spleen, and kidney), and where tissue density limits the seepage of blood from adjoining patent vascular beds (Fig. 3-17, B). Infarcts tend to be wedge-shaped, with the occluded vessel at the apex and the organ periphery forming the base (Fig. 3-17); when the base is a serosal surface, there is often an overlying fibrinous exudate. Lateral margins may be irregular, reflecting flow from adjacent vessels. The margins of acute infarcts typically are indistinct and slightly hemorrhagic; with time, the edges become better defined by a narrow rim of hyperemia attributable to inflammation. Infarcts resulting from aerial occlusions in organs without a dual circulation typically become progressively paler and sharply defined with time (Fig. 3-17, B). By comparison, hemorrhagic infarcts are the rule in the lung and other spongy organs (Fig. 3-17, A).

Frame shift mutation does not effect complete amino acid sequence if it occurs in multiple of ?,I,2,3,None.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 3 Frame-shift mutation Frameshift mutationsQ occur due to inseion or deletionQ of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation.If I or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule.If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same. This is because the genetic code is read in form of triplets of nucleotides (i.e. codons).If one or two base pairs from the code are removed or inseed, the genetic code will be misread from that change onwards because genetic code is not punctate. Therefore the amino acid sequence translated from the change onwards will be completely changed.However if the removal/inseion happens in multiple of three, rest of the reading from does not change and hence the amino acid sequence will not change.",C

Final product in anaerobic glycolysis -,Pyruvate,Acetyl CoA,Lactate,Oxaloacetate,"Ans. is 'c' i.e.. Lactateo There are two types of glycolysis : -Aerobic glycolysis : - It occurs when oxygen is plentiful and the final product is pyruvate, i.e., final step is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (see the cycle above). Which is later converted to acetyl CoA by oxidative decarboxylation. There is net gain oflATPs (will be discussed later). Acetyl CoA enters TCA cycle.Anaerobic glycolysis : - It occurs in the absence of oxygen. The pyruvate is fermented (reduced) to lactate in single stageQ. The reoxidation of NADH (formed in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase step) by respiratory chain is prevented as same NADH is utilized at lactate dehydrogenase step. So. there is no net production of NADH. Thus, there is net gain of 2 ATP only. Unlike pyruvate which is converted to acetyl CoA to enter into krebs cycle, lactate cannot be further utilized by further metabolic pathways. Thus, lactate can be regareded as dead end in glycolysisQ. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in exercising skeletal muscle, RBCs, lens, some region of retina, renal medulla, testis and leucocytes.",C

Binding interferes with the progress of RNA polymerase, and blocks transcription of the structural genes.# This is an example of negative regulation.2) When only lactose is available (No glucose).# In this case, the lac operon is induced (turned on).# A small amount of lactose is converted to an isomer, allolactose. This compound is an inducer that binds to the repressor protein, changing its configuration so that it can no longer bind to the operator.# In absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase is active and sufficient quantitive of cAMP are made and bind to the CAP-binding site, causing RNA polymerase to more efficiently initiate transcription at the promoter site.# This is an eg. of positive regulation3) When both glucose and lactose are available -# In this case transcription of lac operon is negligible, even if lactose is present at a higher concentration.# Adenylyl cyclase is deactivated in the presence of glucose-a process known as catabolite repression, So no cAMP-CAP complex forms and the CAP binding site remains empty.# RNA polymerase is unable to effectively initiate the transcription, even though the repressor may not be bound to the operator region.",A
"All of the following neurotransmitters are excitatory and inhibitory in function, EXCEPT:",Glycine,Glutamine,Aspaate,NO,"Glycine has both excitatory and inhibitory effects in the CNS. When it binds to NMDA receptors, it makes them more sensitive to the actions of glutamate. It is also responsible in pa for direct inhibition, primarily in the brainstem and spinal cord.

The hanup disease causes the deficiency of,Thiamin,Riboflavin,Niacin,Biotin,"Pellagra is caused by the deficiency of tryptophan and niacin. Pellagra is characterized by photosensitive dermatitis. As the condition progresses, there is dementia and possibly diarrhea. Untreated pellagra is fatal. Although the nutritional etiology of pellagra is well established, and either tryptophan or niacin prevents or cures the disease, additional factors, including deficiency of riboflavin or vitamin B6, both of which are required for synthesis of nicotinamide from tryptophan, may be impoant. A number of genetic diseases that result in defects of tryptophan metabolism are associated with the development of pellagra, despite an apparently adequate intake of both tryptophan and niacin. Hanup disease is a rare genetic condition in which there is a defect of the membrane transpo mechanism for tryptophan, resulting in large losses as a result of intestinal malabsorption and failure of renal reabsorption. In carcinoid syndrome, there is a metastasis of a primary liver tumor of enterochromaffin cells, which synthesize 5-hydroxytryptamine. Overproduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine may account for as much as 60% of the body's tryptophan metabolism, causing pellagra because of the diversion away from NAD synthesis.

Immediate energy supply for muscle contraction -,GTP,ATP,Creatine phosphate,Fatty acid,"ATP followed by Creatine phosphate Source of energy for muscular activity o The immediate source of energy for all muscle contraction is ATP, followed immediately by creatine phosphate. o In stemous exercise ATP store is sufficient only for 1-2 seconds and creatine phosphate for another 5-7 seconds. o Thus, energy rich phosphagen stores (ATP and creatine phosphate) permit severe muscle contraction for 8-10 seconds only. o After this, energy is obtained from the metabolism of stored glycogen or from circulating glucose and free fatty- acids, depending upon the availability of oxygen. o Energy source during in exercise can be summarized by : - Short burst of intense activity (e.g., 100 meter sprint or weight lifting) : - All energy comes from ATP and creatine phosphate. Breakdow n of these compound is an anaerobic processes. Little longer intense exercise (e.g., 200 meter sprint or 100 meter swim)Besides ATP and creatine phosphate, glycogen is metabolised by anerobic glycolytic pathways to provide a ready source of energy. So, muscle work is anaerobic. Longer duration exercise (e.g., jogging, marathon run) : - The muscle work is aerobic and energy comes from aerobic utilization of glucose and free fatty acids. More glucose is utilized at the initial stage, but as the exercise is prolonged, free fatty acids become the predominant fuel.

They are gram negative organism. They possess pili on their surface, which facilitate adhesion of cocci to mucosal surface and promote virulence by inhibiting phagocytosis. Selective medium for their growth is Thayer - Main medium. Four types of colonies have been recognised. Type 1 and 2 are virulent and 3, 4 are non virulent cocci. This disease is acquired by sexual contact. They adhere to the mucosal surface and penetrate to the intrecellular spaces and reach the subepithelial connective tissue. In men it causes acute urethritis with mucopurulent discharge. Chronic urethritis leads to stricture formation. Infection spreads to periurethral tissues, causing abscess and multiple discharging sinuses (watercan perineum). Only non veneral infection is ophthalmia neonatorum. Gonococci produces beta lactamase, rendering penicillin treatment ineffective.

Slope of pressure volume curve of lung represents:,Compliance of lung,Conductance,Surface tension,Transpulmonary pressure,"Ans. a (Compliance of lung). (Ref. Ganong Physiology 23rd/ pg. 654-657; Figure 35-10)Lung compliance is an index of lung distensibility or the ease with which the lungs are expanded; thus, compliance is the inverse of elastic recoil. Compliance is defined as the ratio of change of lung volume to the change in pressure required to inflate the lung (dV/dP). Compliance decreases in patients with pulmonary edema or surfactant deficiency and increases when there is a loss of elastic fibers in the lungs, such as occurs in patients with emphysema and with aging.MECHANICS OF BREATHING - Compliance of the lungs & chest wall# Curve of airway pressure plotted against volume, is relaxation pressure curve of the total respiratory system.# The pressure is zero at a lung volume that corresponds to the volume of gas in the lungs at the end of quiet expiration (relaxation volume, which equals the functional residual capacity).# It is positive at greater volumes and negative at smaller volumes. The change in lung volume per unit change in the airway pressure (DV/DP) is the stretchability (compliance) of the lungs and chest wall.Q# It is normally measured in the pressure range where the relaxation pressure curve is steepest, and the normal value is approximately 0.2 L/cm H2O.# The curve is shifted downward and to the right (compliance is decreased) by pulmonary congestion and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease of unknown cause in which there is stiffening and scarring of the lung.# The curve is shifted upward and to the left (compliance is increased) in emphysema.# It should be noted that compliance is a static measure of lung and chest recoil.# Two major forces contribute to lung compliance:o tissue elastic forces ando surface tension forces.Q",A

Odd chain fatty acids can form glucose by which pathway?,By forming Propionyl CoA,By forming Glycerol,Acetyl CoA entering TCA cycle,By Lactic acid formation,"Ans: (a) By forming Propionyl CoARef: Harper, Illustrated Biochemistry, 30th edition, Page 225, 558; Styer Biochemistry, 7th edition, Page 650Fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are oxidized by the pathway of (3-oxidation, producing acetyl CoA (2C) until a three-carbon (propionyl-CoA) residue remains.End product of even chain FA oxidation-acetyl CoA(2C).End product of odd chain FA oxidation-acetyl CoA units + 1 propionyl CoA(3C).Propionyl CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA (steps mentioned below), a constituent of the citric acid cycle, which after few steps, enters in to gluconeogenesis.Only 2 enzymes in our body requires vit B as cofactor:Methyl malonyl CoA mutase (AKA methylmalonyl-CoA isomerase).Methionine synthase (Synthesis of Methionine by methylation of homocysteine).Hence, the propionyl residue from an odd-chain fatty acid is the only part of a fatty acid that is glucogenic.Even chain fatty acids cannot synthesize glucose, because PDH reaction is irreversible.Gluconeogenesis is glucose synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources like lactate, propionyl CoA and Glucogenic amino acids.

The most direct route to the rectouterine pouch is through the vaginal wall at the posterior vaginal fornix. It is unlikely that the pregnancy would have occurred in the vesicouterine space because the transfer of ova from the ovary to the fimbriae occurs on the posterior side of the broad ligament. Therefore, it would not be advisable to attempt initially to insert a needle into the vesicouterine space. Inserting a needle through the anterior fornix into the endocervical canal would lead one into the uterine cavity, with the probability of other undesirable consequences.

Number of ATP molecules and NADH formed in each cycle of glycolysis ?,"4 ATP, 2 NADH","2 ATP, 2 NADH","4 ATP, 4 NADH","2 ATP, 4 NADH","Ans. is 'a' i.e., 4 ATP, 2 NADH Enegetics of glvcolysis During glycolysis 2 ATP are utilized and 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. 2 reducing equalents NADH' are produced and reoxidized by electron transpo chain, to generata 5 ATP molecules (2.5 ATP per NADH' molecule). Thus total 9 ATP molecules are produced and 2 are utilized, i.e., There is net gain of 7 ATP molecules in aerobic glycolysis. In anaerobic conditions, the reoxidation of NADH by electron transpo chain is prevented and NADH gets reoxidized by conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Thus, in anaerobic glycolysis only 4 ATP are produced at substrate level. Therefore, there is net gain of 2 ATP molecules in anaerobic glycolysis. Note : - Previous calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH2 generates 2 ATPs. This will amount to a net generation of 8ATPs per glucose molecule during glycolysis. Recent experiments show that these old values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH2 produces 1.5 ATPs. Thus, net generation is only 7ATPs during glycolysis.",A

Increased blood glucose concentration is the primary controller of insulin secretion. Inside the beta cells, glucose is conveed to glucose-6-phosphate and later ATP is generated. This ATP closes ATP sensitive potassium channels, leading to rise in K+ and depolarisation. This in turn causes opening of voltage gated Ca2+ channels and influx of Ca+.

Which of the follow ing Physiological Function is mediated by Acetylcholine through Nicotinic receptors?,Inhibition of heart rate,Secretion of saliva,Contraction of pupils,Contraction of skeletal muscle,"(D) Contraction of skeletal muscle# Historically, Acetylcholine Receptors have been divided into two main types on the basis of their pharmacologic properties.> Muscarine, the alkaloid responsible for the toxicity of toadstools, has little effect on the receptors in autonomic ganglia but mimics the stimulatory action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle and glands. These actions of acetylcholine are therefore called muscarinic actions, and the receptors involved are muscarinic cholinergic receptors.> They are blocked by the drug atropine. In sympathetic ganglia, small amounts of acetylcholine stimulate postganglionic neurons and large amounts block transmission of impulses from pre- to postganglionic neurons. These actions are unaffected by atropine but mimicked by nicotine.> Consequently, these actions of acetylcholine are nicotinic actions and the receptors are nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Nicotinic receptors are subdivided into those found in muscle at neuromuscular junctions and those found in autonomic ganglia and the central nervous system. Both muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are found in large numbers in the brain.> The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are members of a superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that also includes the GABAA and glycine receptors and some of the glutamate receptors. They are made up of multiple subunits coded by different genes.> Each nicotinic cholinergic receptor is made up of five subunits that form a central channel which, when the receptor is activated, permits the passage of Na+ and other cations. The five subunits came from a menu of 16 known subunits, a1-a9, b2-b5, g, d, and e, coded by 16 different genes. Some of the receptors are homomeric, eg, those that contain five a7 subunits, but most are heteromeric.> The muscle type nicotinic receptor found in the fetus is made up of two a1 subunits, a b1 subunit, an a subunit, and a d subunit. In adult mammals, the d subunit is replaced by an z subunit, which decreases the channel open time but increases its conductance.> The nicotinic cholinergic receptors in autonomic ganglia are heteromers that usually contain a3 subunits in combination with others, and the nicotinic receptors in the brain are made up of many other subunits.> Many of the nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brain are located presynaptically on glutamine-secreting axon terminals, and they facilitate the release of this transmitter. However, others are postsynaptic. Some are located on structures other than neurons, and some seem to be free in the interstitial fluid, ie, they are perisynaptic in location.> There is a binding site for acetylcholine on each a subunit, and when an acetylcholine molecule binds to each of them, they induce a configurational change in the protein so that the channel opens. This increases the conductance of Na+ and other cations, and the resulting influx of Na+ produces a depolarizing potential.> A prominent feature of neuronal nicotinic cholinergic receptors is their high permeability to Ca2+, suggesting their involvement in synaptic facilitation and learning.> Muscarinic cholinergic receptors are very different from nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Five types, encoded by five separate genes, have been cloned. The exact status of M5 is uncertain, but the remaining four all are serpentine receptors coupled via G proteins to adenylyl cyclase, K+ channels, or phospholipase C.> The nomenclature of these receptors has not been standardized, but the receptor designated M1 is abundant in the brain.> The M2 receptor is found in the heart. The M4 receptor is found in pancreatic acinar and islet tissue, where it mediates increased secretion of pancreatic enzymes and insulin. The M3 and M4 receptors are both found in smooth muscle.",D

Drug resistance is not transmitted by -,HFr,Transposons,Plasmid,Chromosomes,Factor: The F factor is a tramsfer factor that contains the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of sex pilus and for self-transfer but is devoid of other identifiable genetic markers such as drug resistance. Cells carrying the F factor have no distinguishing feature other than their ability to mate with F - cells and render them F+. The F factor is actually an episode and has the ability to exist in some cells in the integrated data or inseed into the host chromosome; such cells are able to transfer the chromosomal gene to recipient cells with high frequency and are known as Hfr cells. Following conjugation with an Hfr cell an F- only rarely becomes F+ though it receives chromosomal genes from the donors.

Although Wilms tumors arising in this setting account for no more than 10% of cases, these syndromic tumors have provided impoant insight into the biology of this neoplasm. * The first group of patients has the WAGR syndrome, characterized by Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital anoma-lies, and mental retardation. Their lifetime risk of developing Wilms tumor is approximately 33%. Individuals with WAGR syndrome carry constitutional (germline) deletions of 11p13. Studies on these patients led to the identification of the first Wilms tumor-associated gene, WT1, and a contiguously deleted autosomal dominant gene for aniridia, PAX6, both located on chromosome 11p13. Patients with deletions restricted to PAX6, with normal WT1 function, develop sporadic aniridia, but they are not at increased risk for Wilms tumors.9 479-480",C

Most potent stimulus for bile secretion,Cholecystokin,Secretin,Bile acid,Bile salt,"The bile salts have a number of impoant actions: they reduce surface tension and, in conjunction with phospholipids and monoglycerides, are responsible for the emulsification of fat preparatory to its digestion and absorption in the small intestine. They are amphipathic, that is, they have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains; one surface of the molecule is hydrophilic because the polar peptide bond and the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are on that surface, whereas the other surface is hydrophobic. Therefore, the bile salts tend to form cylindrical disks called micelles. Their hydrophilic poions face out and their hydrophobic poions face in. Above a ceain concentration, called the critical micelle concentration, all bile salts added to a solution form micelles. Lipids collect in the micelles, with cholesterol in the hydrophobic center and amphipathic phospholipids and monoglycerides lined up with their hydrophilic heads on the outside and their hydrophobic tails in the center. The micelles play an impoant role in keeping lipids in solution and transpoing them to the brush border of the intestinal epithelial cells, where they are absorbed. Ninety to 95% of the bile salts are absorbed from the small intestine. Once they are deconjugated, they can be absorbed by nonionic diffusion, but most are absorbed in their conjugated forms from the terminal ileum (Figure 26-18) by an extremely efficient Na+-bile salt cotranspo system powered by basolateral Na+-K+ATPase. The remaining 5-10% of the bile salts enter the colon and are conveed to the salts of deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. Lithocholate is relatively insoluble and is mostly excreted in the stools; only 1% is absorbed. However, deoxycholate is absorbed. The absorbed bile salts are transpoed back to the liver in the poal vein and excreted in the bile (enterohepatic circulation). Those lost in the stool are replaced by synthesis in the liver; the normal rate of bile salt synthesis is 0.2 to 0.4 g/d. The total bile salt pool of approximately 3.5 g recycles repeatedly the enterohepatic circulation; it has been calculated that the entire pool recycles twice per meal and six to eight times per day. When bile is excluded from the intestine, up to 50% of ingested fat appears in the feces. A severe malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins also results. When bile salt reabsorption is prevented by resection of the terminal ileum or by disease in this poion of the small intestine, the amount of fat in the stools is also increased because when the enterohepatic circulation is interrupted, the liver cannot increase the rate of bile salt production to a sufficient degree to compensate for the loss.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:438,439,440",D

The ciliary body produces aqueous humor and is located in the posterior chamber. Increased production of fluid from this site would cause an increase in intraocular pressure if drainage is inadequate. The iridoscleral angle of the anterior chamber is the location of drainage of the aqueous humor; therefore, a blockage of drainage in this location can cause increased intraocular pressure. The pupil is the connection between the anterior and posterior chamber; a collection of fluid does not occur here, for this is simply an aperture to allow light onto the retina.

Primary link between citric acid cycle and urea cycle with,Malate,Fumarate,Succinate,Citrate,(Fumarate): (340-U.Satyanarayan 3rd) (145-Harper 28th)Integration between Urea cycle and Citric acid cycleUrea cycle is linked with citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) in three different ways. This is regarded as bicyclic integration between the two cycle1. The production of fumarate in urea cycle is the most important integrating point with TCA cycle fumarate is converted to malate and then to oxaloacetate in TCA cycle. Oxaloacetate undergoes transamination to produce aspartate which enters urea cycle. Here it combines with citrulline to produce arginosuccinate. Oxaloacetate is an important metabolite which can combine with acetyl COA to form citrate and get finally oxidized. Oxaloacetate can also serve as precursor for the synthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis)2. ATP (12) are generated in the TCA cycle while ATP (4) are utilized for the urea synthesis3. Citric acid cycle is an important metabolic pathway for the complete oxidation of various metabolites to CO2 and H2O. The CO2 liberated in TCA cycle (in the mitochondria) can be utilized in urea cycle.,B

Patients with decreased gastric acidity, sickle cell disease, defects in immunity, or children younger than 4 years have a more severe course of disease. Salmonella spp. are carried in nature by animal reservoirs such as poultry, tules, cattle, pigs, and sheep. The incubation period is 8-48 hours after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Chlamydia psittaci produces an interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by headache, backache, and a dry, hacking cough. A pale, macular rash is also found on the trunk (Horder's spots). Patients at risk include pet shop workers, pigeon handlers, and poultry workers. Entamoeba histolytica produces a diarrhea (frequently bloody or heme-positive), right lower quadrant crampy abdominal pain, and fever. Patients frequently have weight loss and anorexia. There is usually a history of travel outside the U.S. Most cases are chronic. Complications include liver abscesses. Staphylococcus aureus produces a self-limited gastroenteritis due to the production of preformed, heat-stable enterotoxins. The incubation period is 16 hours.

Conduction of nerve impulses although rapid, is much slower than electricity.2) All or none phenomenon :# The action potential is not graded. It is an all or none change. Under a given set of conditions, it has a fixed value. Either all of the action potential is seen or not at all.# If a stimulus of threshold strength is applied, an AP is produced further increase in strength or duration of stimulus does not produce any increase in amplitude or duration of AP.# On the other hand, if the stimulus is of subthreshold intensity, AP fails to occur.3) Membrane excitibility during an AP# An action potential is triggered only if the stimulus raises the membrane potential above firing level of - 55 mV. The minimum strength of stimulus that can trigger an action potential is called a ""threshold stimulus"".# During action potential, the excitibility of a neuron is reduced. Application of stimulus, whatever its strength, from the onset of deplorization till repolarization is about one-third complete (early part of repolarization) fails to produce any response. This period is called absolute refractory period.# Thereafter, In later part of repolarization till the onset of after depolarization, the membrane is in relative refractory period, i.e., a sufficiently high stimulus can elicit a response.# During after depolarization, the membrane is hyperexicitable; having just come out of the refractory period, the membrane is excitable and being closer to the firing level makes it hyperexciable.# During after-hyperpolarization, the membrane excitibility is low but slowly returns to normal.",B

Lipoprotein-associated with carrying cholesterol from periphery tissues to liver is,HDL,LDL,VLDL,IDL,"METABOLISM OF HDL Synthesis: HDL is synthesized in Liver cells and also in intestinal mucosal cells. (a) Hepatic HDL * Apo-A and apo-C are synthesized by polysomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). * They are assembled with lipids to form the nascent HDL which is released in the circulation. (b) Intestinal HDL * In a similar manner, apo-A is synthesized by polysomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). * It is assembled with lipids to form the ""nascent""- HDL which is released in circulation from intestinal mucosal cells. Difference of nascent intestinal HDL from ""nascent"" hepatic HDL * ""Nascent"" intestinal HDL contains only apo-A when it circulates, it acquires apo-C and apo-E. * ""Nascent""-Hepatic HDL, on the other hand, contains both apo-A and apo-C. Note: Apo-C and apo-E are only synthesized in liver and not in intestinal mucosal cells. Scavenging action of HDL: Glomset (1968) has suggested that HDL plays a major role in the removal of cholesterol from peripheral extrahepatic tissues and transpo of this cholesterol to the liver where it is fuher metabolized. This has been called as scavenging action of HDL (reverse cholesterol transpo). METABOLISM OF HDL HDL Receptor Proteins and HDL Cycle Two types of HDL receptor proteins haven been described involved in HDL metabolism. They are: 1. HDL receptor protein--SR-B1 2. ATP-binding cassette transpoer A1 Protein (ABCA1) 1. HDL receptor protein SR-B1 The class B scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) has been identified recently as HDL receptor with a dual role in HDL metabolism. * In the liver, and steroidogenic tissues, it binds HDL apo-A1 and cholesteryl ester is selectively delivered to the cells, although the paicle itself, including apo-A1, is not taken up. * In the tissues: On the other hands, SR-B1 mediates the acceptance of cholesterol from the cells by HDL, which then transpos it to the liver for excretion the bile (either as cholesterol or after conversion to bile acids), the process known as reverse cholesterol transpo. Nascent HDL: Nascent HDL is made up of a bilayer of PL and free cholesterol arranged in disc-like form called as discoid HDL containing apoproteins. Formation of HDL3 by LCAT: Lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase of plasma binds with nascent HDL discs and gets activated by A-1 and C-II apoproteins of HDL itself and transfers acyl groups from HDL-PL to the free cholesterol thus producing Lysophospholipids and cholesteryl-esters. Lysophospholipids thus formed are released from HDL to plasma where they bind to albumin and cholesteryl esters and transferred into the 'central core' of the HDL paicles. Thus by the above reactions 'Discoid HDL' is conveed to 'spherical' HDL which is called as HDL-3 paicle, which is bounded by a lipid layer with apoproteins and cholesteryl esters embedded in its core.

The Iodine is transported to the thyroid gland by:,Active transport,Passive transport,Diffusion,Pinycytosis,"(Active transport): Ref: 319-G, 314-SL (652- Ganong 23rd)* Iodine is transported actively from the blood in to the follicular cells against the electrochemical gradient (ACTIVE-TRANSPORT). This process by which the iodine is transported is called iodine trapping. A sodium- iodine symport pump called iodine pump transports iodine, along with sodium in to the follicular cells. From here, iodine is transported in to the follicular cavity by an iodide-cholride pump called pendrinPinocytosis - The substances with larger molecules cannot pass through the cell membrane either by active or by passive transport mechanism. Such substances are transported into the cell by a process called pinocytosis. The macromolecules like bacteria and antigens enter the cells by pinocytosis",A

Stability of alveoloi is maintained by:,Compliance of the lungs,Residual air in alveoli,Negative intrapleural pressure,Reduce surface tension by surfactant,"Reduce surface tension by surfactant Ganong writes -""The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipahnitoylphosphaticlylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. In spherical structures like the alveoli, the distending pressure equals two times the tension divided by the radius (P = 2T/r); if T is not reduced as r is reduced, the tension overcomes the distending pressure."" ""Pulmonary surfactant therefore helps stabilize the sizes of the alveoli and helps keep them open and available to paicipate in gas exchange."" -Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems By Lauralee Sherwood p477 There are two factors which prevent the alveolar collapse: Reduction of surface tension due to surfactant The surface tension of the alveolar lining fluid varies with surface area. This is because surfactant reduces surface tension in propoion to its surface concentration. Surfactant is insoluble in water and floats on the surface of the alveolar lining fluid. In larger alveoli the surfactant is more spread out (dilute) and the surface tension is higher. As the alveoli reduce in size during expiration the concentration of the surfactant increases and the more it reduces the surface tension. 2. Alveolar interdependence There is interaction between adjacent groups of alveoli. Therefore, collapsing alveoli pull on adjacent alveoli preventing fuher collapse. This is termed alveolar interdependence.",D

Transmission of R factor is by ?,Conjugation,Transduction,Transformation,Lysogenic conversion,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Conjugation Conjugation Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like connection between two cells. Conjugation is process where by a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium. Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid. This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self transfer. Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium. The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or feility factor). Plasmid may be R factor, which codes for transferrable multiple drug resistance. The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy - Recipient becomes donor and the donor retains its donor status.",A

Enzyme defect tested in Guthrie's test?,Phenyl alanine hydroxylase,Tyrosine transaminase,p- Hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase,Homogentisate oxidase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Phenyl alanine hydroxylase* Guthrie's test is done to detect Phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria is caused by a defect of phenylalanine hydroxylase.* It was devised by Dr Robert Guthrie after the birth of his own child with PKU.* It is based on the fact that an organism Bacillus subtilis needs phenyl ketone for its growth.* A small drop of blood is taken from the heel of a newborn and applied to a card. A punch-out dried disc from the card is then incubated on a petri dish plated with bacteria (Bacillus subtilis) in the presence of a growth inhibitor, B-2-thienyl-alanine. High levels of phenyl ketone in the blood sample overcome the inhibition, and allow the bacteria to grow. So, a colony count of the plate will give us an approximate concentration of phenyl ketone inthe blood.* However, this test has been replaced by HPLC with Tandem Mass spectrometry",A

Nerve depolarization is due to -,Opening of sodium channels,Opening of chloride channels,Opening of potassium channel s,Opening of calcium channels,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Opening of sodium channels Milk ejection reflexo Milk ejection is normally initiated by a neuroendocrine reflex.o The receptors involved are the touch receptors, which are plentiful in the breast-especially around the nipple,o Impulses generated in these receptors are relayed to the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei,o Discharge of the neurons causes secretion of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary.o Oxytocin causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells, smooth muscle - like cells that line the ducts of the breast,o This squeezes the milk out of the alveoli of the lactating breast into the large ducts (sinuses) and thence out of the nipple ready to flow into the mouth of the waiting infant,o In lactating women, genital stimulation and emotional stimuli also produce oxytocin secretion, sometimes causing milk to spurt from the breasts.Phases of Action Potentialo The action potential, which is recorded using an intracellular electrode, has following phases : -Resting stage : - This is the resting membrane potential before the action potential. At rest, membrane is said to be ""polarized"" because - 70 mV negative membrane potential (RMP) that is present. Strictly speaking, it is not a part of the action potential.Depolarization phase : - The potential shoots up to + 35 mV in less than a millisecond. It is due to opening of ""voltage gated"" Na' channels which causes influx of sodiumQ, so inside negative charge becomes positive. From - 70 mV to -55 mV (firing Ivel or threshold point) the voltage gated sodium channles open partially. This portion of AP (- 70 mV to -55 mV) is called ""prepotential"" or ""foot ofAP"". Once the threshold level (- 55 mV) is reached voltage gated Na-i- channels open completely and the potential shoots up suddenly. It is called depolarization, since it represents loss of the original polarity of cell membrane.Repolarization phase : - The potential drops to near resting level, i.e., reversal to original polarity (repolarization). At the start of repolarization (end of depolarization), Voltage - gated Na+ channels close andVoltage - gated K+ channels open which cause efflux of K+ out of the cellQ. So, inside positive charge once again becomes negative due to efflux of positive charge (K+).After depolarization : - The repolarization is very fast till 70% of repolarization has been acheived. After that it is slows down. This slowrer phase of repolarization is called 'after depolarization \After-hyperpolarization : - The intracellular negativity overshoots the normal RMP of - 70 mV to reach a more negative value of about - 75 mV and then slowly retruns to the normal RMP of - 70 mV.",A

Which one of the following causes a frameshift mutation?,Transition,Transversion,Deletion,Substitution of purines for pyrimidines,"Point mutations that are frameshift mutations put the normal reading frame out of register by one base pair. The inseion of an extra base pair or the deletion of one or more base pairs falls into this category. Transitions and transversions are not frameshift mutations; they are substitutions of one base pair for another. Substitutions are the most common type of mutation. In transitions, a purine is replaced by a purine or a pyrimidine by a pyrimidine. In transversions, a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine or vice versa. It has been suggested that transitions occur spontaneously owing to the tautomeric changes in base- hydrogen-bond locations. Transversions can be caused by defective DNA polymerases. Ref: Weil P.

Central Chemoreceptors are most sensitive to which of the following changes in blood?,|p CO2,|p CO2,|H +,|p O2,"Central chemoreceptors are stimulated mainly by the |H+ concentration caused by increased pCO2 levels. Since H+ cannot easily cross the blood brain barrier, increase in the blood H+ concentration have little effect in stimulating central chemo receptors. Increase in blood p CO2 causes CO2 to diffuse the blood brain barrier with ease where it reacts with water to form carbonic acid. This carbonic acid in turn dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate ions. This H+ ions then have a potent stimulatory effect on the central chemo receptors. This question asks about the changes in blood that stimulates the central chemo receptors. So the correct answer is |p CO2 levels as H+ concentration in blood has little effect in stimulating the central chemo receptors. Ref: Textbook Of Medical Physiology By Khurana, Page 458",A

(Ref: Harrison, Medicine, 16th ed., 2333)PHENYLKETONURIA# The hyperphenylalaninemias result from impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine.# The most common and clinically important is phenylketonuria (frequency 1:10,000), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an increased concentration of phenylalanine and its by-products in body fluids and by severe mental retardation if untreated in infancy.# It results from reduced activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (phenylketonuria type I).# The accumulation of phenylalanine inhibits the transport of other amino acids required for protein or neurotransmitter synthesis, reduces synthesis and increases degradation of myelin, and leads to inadequate formation of norepinephrine and serotonin.# Phenylalanine is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, a key enzyme in the pathway of melanin synthesis, and accounts for the hypopigmentation of hair and skin.# Untreated children with classic phenylketonuria are normal at birth, but fail to attain early developmental milestones, develop microcephaly, and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function.# Hyperactivity, seizures, and severe mental retardation are major clinical problems later in life.# Electroencephalographic abnormalities, ""mousy"" odour of skin, hair, and urine (due to phenylacetate accumulation);and a tendency to hypopigmentation and eczema complete the devastating clinical picture.# In contrast, affected children who are detected and treated at birth show none of these abnormalities.# To prevent mental retardation, diagnosis and initiation of dietary treatment of classic phenylketonuria must occur before the child is 3 weeks of age.# Dietary phenylalanine restriction is usually instituted if blood phenylalanine levels are 250 micromol/L (4 mg/dL).# Treatment consists of a special diet low in phenylalanine and supplemented with tyrosine, since tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.6# With therapy, plasma phenylalanine concentrations should be maintained between 120 and 360 micromol/L (2 and 6 mg/dL).# Dietary restriction should be continued and monitored indefinitely.# Some patients with milder forms of phenylketonuria (phenylalanine >120 pmol/L at presentation) show increased tolerance to dietary proteins and improved metabolic control when treated with tetrahydrobiopterin (20 mg/kg per day), an essential cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase.",A

A substance which binds to the enzyme other than catalytic site is -,Competitive inhibitor,None of the above,Reversible inhibitor,Non-competitive inhibitor,"Non-competitive inhibitor
o In this type of inhibition no competition occurs between substrate and inhibitor.
o Inhibitor is structurally different from substrate and binds to enzyme at a site other than the substrate binding (catalytic) site.
Occupancy of this site by the inhibitor alters the shape of the enzyme such that its catalytic activity is reduced or lost.
o The substrate is still able to bind the enzyme, but the enzyme cannot catalyze the reaction when inhibitor is bound.
o Thus, the non-competitive inhibitor does not block the active site of enzyme, but behaves as though it were removing active enzyme from the solution.
o Evidently, unlike competitive inhibition, increasing the substrate concentration does not reverse the inhibition,",D

Leptin is secreted by-,Ovaries,Adipose tissue,Liver,Hypothalamus,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Adipose tissue Leptin* Leptin is a protein hormone produced by fat cells of adipose tissue. It acts on hypothalamus to reduce food intake, decrease lipogenesis and increase lipolysis, thereby reducing the body fat stores.* The effect of leptin on appetite is mediated through a-MSH (a-melanocyte stimulating hormone), a proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derivative. Leptin acts by increasing the synthesis of POMC which is converted into a-MSH. a-MSH acts through melanocortin-4 receptors to depress appetite.* Leptin also inhibits the secretion of Agouti-related peptide (AgRP), a neuropeptide that increases food intake.* Plasma leptin levels are proportional to the amount of body fat and are therefore higher in women and obese individuals.* Leptin level is increased ini) Obesityiv) Insulinii) Emotional stressv) Dexamethasoneiii) Estrogen * Leptin level is decreased by:i) Sleep deprivationiii) Exerciseii) Testosterone (androgen)iv) Starvation",B

The amino acid which serves as a carrier of ammonia from skeletal muscle to liver is,Alanine,Methionine,Arginine,Glutamine,"GLUCOSE-ALANINE CYCLE 1. Skeletal muscle transpos NH3 to the Liver in the form of the amino acid 'alanine'. The alanine is formed in the muscle tissue by a transamination reaction between pyruvate (PA) and glutamate. 2. The alanine is transpoed through the bloodstream to the liver, where it reacts with a-ketoglutarate to reform Pyruvate and glutamate. This reaction is catalysed by alanine transaminase. 3. The nitrogen originating from the glutamate is processed by the urea cycle. 4. When the blood glucose is low, the Pyruvate resulting from alanine transamination is used to make glucose the gluconeogenesis pathway. 5. The glucose can be returned to the skeletal muscle to supply quick energy. Thus, the transpo of alanine from muscle to Liver results in a reciprocal transfer of glucose to muscle. The entire cyclical process is referred to as the ""glucose-alanine cycle"" (Fig. 27.5). Its impoance is propoional to the muscular activity of the organism. It is to be noted that active muscle tissue operates anaerobically, producing large quantities of Pyruvate (PA) and consuming large quantities of glucoseRef: M.N.

"A 2-year-old had been treated three times with ampicillin for acute otitis media. Fluid aspirated from his middle ear during placement of tympanostomy tubes grows Moraxella catarrhalis, which is resistant to ampicillin. Which enzyme is responsible for this resistance?",Acetyltransferase,b-Lactamase,Catalase,DNase,"Most isolates of Moraxella catarrhalis, a common cause of acute otitis media, produce b-lactamase (b) making them resistant to the penicillin. They are almost all susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracycline (contraindicated in a 2-year-old), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin/sulbactam. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (a) is responsible for naturally occurring chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria. Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (e) confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. Catalase (c) is an enzyme involved in the detoxification of the reactive oxygen species H2 O2 ; DNase (d) is an enzyme that destroys DNA. Both are produced by M. catarrhalis, but neither is involved in antibiotic resistance.",B

"If the head of the femur is dislocated postero-medially, compression of which nerve is likely to be a result?",Femoral,Lumbosacral trunk,Obturator,Sciatic,"The sciatic nerve is closely related to the posterior hip joint, which makes this nerve very vulnerable in cases where the femur is dislocated postero-medially. If the sciatic nerve was completely paralyzed, the compaments innervated by its two branches: the common fibular and tibial nerves, would lose function. This would mean that the hamstrings and all the muscles of below the knee would lose their innervation. (Luckily, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve is very rare). The hip joint is very stable, so it is difficult to dislocate the femur. Most dislocations occur when the hip is flexed and the thigh is adducted. In flexion, the joint capsule is lax, and the femoral head tends to dislocate posteriorly when forces drive the femur posteriorly. This means that the sciatic nerve will be very vulnerable when the femur is dislocated!The other nerves listed in the question are not closely related to the hip joint. The femoral nerve innervates the quadriceps and is on the anterior of the thigh. The lumbosacral trunk is located in the pelvis. The obturator nerve innervates the adductor compament, and is on the anteromedial side of the thigh. Although the superior gluteal nerve innervates muscles near the hip socket (gluteus medius, minimus, and tensor fasciae latae), it would not be damaged by a dislocated hip.",D

Hypercalcemia associated with malignancy is most often mediated by:,Parathyroid hormone (PTH),Parathyroid hormone related protein (PTHrP),Interleukin - 6 (IL-6).,Calcitonin,"PTHrp was discovered as a product of human cancers that are of squamous cell origin and that are associated with hypercalcemia. However, normal tissues also express this protein - skin keratinocytes, lactating mammary epithelium, placenta, and fetal parathyroid glands. The gene for PTHrp and for PTH is on paired chromosomes. PTHrp binds to PTH receptor; it exhibits most of the actions of PTH on bone and kidney. Hence, it produces hypercalcemia. One action of PTH NOT shared by PTHrp is: stimulation of renal 1-hydroxylase. Hence, patients with hypercalcemia caused by PTHrp do not have elevated 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. The most impoant physiological role of PTHrp is regulation of endochondral bone formation .",B
A sexually active 25-year-old man develops epididymitis and orchitis. Needle biopsy demonstrates a prominent leukocytic infiltrate with numerous neutrophils. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this man's infection?,Escherichia coli,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Pseudomonas sp,"Acute epididymitis and orchitis with prominent neutrophils in a sexually active male are most likely due to infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. N. gonorrhoeae can produce a nonspecific pattern of acute inflammation (nonspecific epididymitis and orchitis) or can be sufficiently severe as to cause frank abscesses within the epididymis. Escherichia coli is an impoant cause of nonspecific epididymitis and orchitis in children with congenital genitourinary abnormalities and in older men. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can cause tuberculosis of the epididymis and testes, characterized by granuloma formation. Pseudomonas sp. has been implicated as an impoant cause of nonspecific epididymitis and orchitis in older men. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Pa IX. Brief Summaries of Medically Impoant Organisms. In W.
