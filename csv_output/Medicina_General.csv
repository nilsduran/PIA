Acrodynia/Pink disease occurs in poisoning with,Mercury,Lead,Arsenic,Thallium,"MERCURY (QUICKSILVER) Chronic Poisoning (Hydrargyrism):- This may result from (1) continuous accidental absorption (2) excessive therapeutic use, (3) fromrecovery from a large dose, and ( 4) if ointment is used as external application for a long time. Chronic exposure leads to classic triad of gingivitis and salivation, tremors and neuropsychiatric changes. The symptoms are salivation, inflammation of gums and occasionally a blue line at their junction with teeth, sore mouth and throat, loosening of teeth , gastrointestinal disturbances, anaemia, anorexia, loss of weight and chronic inflammation of kidneys with progressive uraemia. Tremors (sometimes called Danbury tremors):- occur first in the hands, then progress to lips and tongue and finally involve arms and leg. The advanced condition is called hatter&;s shakes or* glass-blower&;s shakes, because they are common in persons working in glass-blowing and hat industries. The patient then becomes unable to dress himself. write legibly or walk Properly. The most severe form is known as concussio mercurialis, in which no activity is possible. Mercurial erethism:- is seen in persons working with mercury in minor manufacturing firms. This term is used to refer to the psychological effects of mercury toxicity. These include anxiety, depression, shyness, timidity, irritability, loss of confidence, mental depression, delusions and hallucinations, or suicidal melancholia, or manic depressive psychosis (mad hatter), emotional instability, loss of memory and insomnia. Mercurialentis:- is a peculiar eye change due to exposure to the vapour of mercury. It is due to brownish deposit of mercury through the cornea on the anterior lens capsule. Slit-lamp examination demonstrates a malt-brown reflex from the anterior lens capsule. It is bilateral and has no effect on visual acuity. Renal damage results in membranous glomerulonephritis with hyaline casts and fatty casts in the urine. Kidney is the primary target. Acrodynia or pink disease :- (because it is characterised by a generalised body rash) is thought to be an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction paicularly seen in children. This can be caused by Chronic mercury exposure in any form. The onset is insidious with anorexia, insomnia, sweating, skin Rash and photophobia. Hands and feet become puffy, Pinkish, painful, paraesthetic with peeling of skin. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-542,543",A

Metabolic acidosis and visual damage occurs in poisoning due to:,Methanol,Ethanol,Cocaine,Opium,"Ans: A (Methanol) Ref: The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology by KS Naravan Reddy. 29th edition. 2010. Pg: 521Explanation:Methyl alchohol (Methanol) PoisoningMethanol has a high toxicity in humans.The median lethal dose is typically 100 mLMethanol is toxic by two mechanisms.- Methanolcan be fatal due to its CNS depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning.- In a process of toxication. it is metabolized to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver.Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase <ADH> and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing the symptoms of hypoxia at the cellular level, and metabolic acidosis.Methanol poisoning can be treated with the antidotes ethanol or fomepizoleBoth drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition, so it is excreted by the kidneys rather than being transformed into toxic metabolites.Further treatment may include giving sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration can be used to remove methanol and formate from the blood.Folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate.The initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include:Central nervous system depressionHeadacheDizzinessNausealack of coordinationConfusionUnconsciousness and death (with large doses)Death due to respiratory failure.Physical examination may show TachypneaOphthalmologic examination may show dilated pupils with hyperemia of the optic disc and retinal edema.",A

Surgical scissors left in abdomen is covered under which doctrine -,Res ipsa loquitur,Medical maloccurrence,Therapeutic misadventure,Novus actus interveniens,"Res ipsa loquitur: means the thing or fact speaks for itself. Here the patient has to merely state the act of negligence. It must satisfy the conditions that in the absence of negligence, the injury would not have occurred ordinarily, the doctor had exclusive control over the injury-producing treatment or instrument and the patient was not guilty of contributory negligence. The case can be proved without medical evidence. Medical maloccurrence: in spite of good medical attention and care, an individual fails to respond properly or may suffer from adverse reactions of the drug. Therapeutic misadventure: is a case in which an individual has been injured or had died due to some unintentional act by a doctor or agent of the doctor or the hospital. eg: hypersensitivity reaction caused by penicillin, aspirin, etc. Novus actus interveniens: if the doctor is negligent, which results in a detion from the logical sequence of events, then the responsibility for the subsequent disability or death may pass from the original incident to the later negligent action of the doctor. eg: leaving of a swab or surgical instrument in the abdomen after the repair of an internal injury.

Sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animalis ?,Bestiality,Cunnilingus,Tribadism,Sin of gomorrah,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Bestiality Section 377 IPC defines unnatural sexual offences as sexual intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal and lays down punishment for the same. These offences are sodomy, buccal coitus, tribadism (lesbianism), and bestiality. Sodomy Sodomy is sexual intercourse through anus. It is of two types : Homosexual and Heterosexual. In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is known as active agent and the person, on whom the act is done, is known as passive agent. if the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is known as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile. Examination findings of sodomy are :- In active agent : (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis. In passive agent : Passive agent may be :? 1) Habitual : (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated anal opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening. 2) Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence of semen in anus is the only confirmatety evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior pa of anus (in sudden violence). Other unnatural sexual offences Bestiality : is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal. Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality) : Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia. Active paner is called dyke or butch and the passive agent is called femme. This is not an offence in India. o Buccal coitus (coitus per as/sin of gomorrah) : In this, the male organ is introduced into mouth, usually of a young child.

The most specific test for organophosphorus poisoning-,RBC cholinesterase level,Plasma cholinesterase level,RBC coproporphyrin levels,Measurement of organophosphorus seizure level,"Both RBC cholinesterase and plasma cholinesterase are measured in organophosphorus poisoning.
RBC cholinesterase represents the acetyl-cholinesterase found on RBC membranes, similar to that found in neuronal tissue. Thus, its measurement more accurately reflects nervous system organophosphorus acetyl cholinesterase inhibition.
Plasma cholinesterase is a liver acute-phase protein, circulates in the blood plasma. It is found in CNS white mater, pancreas and heart. It can be affected by many factors, including pregnancy, infection and medical illness. Additionally, a patient's level can vary up to 50% with repeated testing.
Thus, RBC cholinesterase is more accurate of the two measurements, but plasma cholinesterase is easier to assay and is more readily available.",A

True about antemortem wound is,No staining left after washing,No gaping,Uncoagulated blood,Arterial bleed,"Ans. d (Arterial bleed)The antemortem abrasions show signs of inflammation and repair and a little swelling is present in the area whereas these signs are absent in postmortem abrasions.As abrasions alone are not too significant; not much of importance is placed on them.The other part is that the ants attack the dead body and hence there may be additional injuries found in the form of abrasions besides those mentioned in the FIR. Thus there will be some difference between the two but this is not significant provided the additional abrasions are found in the areas described earlier (Post mortem) and thebody was examined after a lapse of time. Thus the characters of such abrasions should be noted and if found of PM nature, they should be ignored as they are of no value but if they are described as antemortem abrasions, the issue may be argued accordingly. Those points which cannot be argued out because the findings given are inadequate, such points may be elicited cunningly in scientific cross examination.",D

Amyl Nitrate is used as an antidote in..poisoning -,CO2,CO,Cyanide,Nitric acid,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

Instantaneous muscle rigidity after death without the period of primary relaxation of muscles is known as:,Rigor mortis,Cadaveric spasm,Algor mortis,Livor mortis,"Ans. B. Cadaveric spasm. (Ref. Reddy's FMT 25th/p.85; Parikh's textbook of FMT 6th/pg. 3.18)# Cadaveric spasm is instantaneous rigorcharacterized by the sudden development of rigidity without the phase of primary relaxation.CADAVERIC SPASMCadaveric spasm (Instantaneous rigor, cataleptic rigidity) is characterized by the sudden development of rigidity without the phase of primary relaxation, usually localized to muscles that have forcefully contracted perimortem.RIGOR MORTISOrdinarily, death is followed immediately by total muscular relaxation - primary muscular flaccidity - succeeded in turn by generalised muscular stiffening - rigor mortis. After a variable period of time rigor mortis passes off spontaneously to be followed by secondary muscular flaccidity.ALGOR MORTIS (BODY COOLING)This is the most useful single indicator of the time of death during the first 24 hours post mortem. Some writers would regard it as the only worthwhile corporal method.The use of body temperature estimations to assess time of death applies only to cool and temperate climates since in tropical regions there may be a minimal fall in body temperature post mortem and in some extreme climates, (e.g. central Australia) the body temperature may even rise after death.LIVOR MORTIS (HYPOSTASIS. POST MORTEM LIMDITY/SUGGELLATIONS)Lividity is a dark purple discolouration of the skin resulting from the gravitational pooling of blood in the veins and capillary beds of the dependent parts of the body following cessation of the circulation. The process begins immediately after the circulation stops, and in a person dying slowly with circulatory failure, it may be pronounced very shortly after death. Within about 30-60 minutes of death the blood in most corpses, dead from natural or non-natural causes, becomes permanently incoagulable. This is due to the release of fibrinolysins, especially from small calibre vessels, e.g. capillaries, and from serous surfaces, e.g. the pleura.",B
"Which of the following poisoning presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, Mees line on nails and myelosuppression: September 2011",Lead,Arsenic,Alcohol,Mercury,"Ans. B: Arsenic In chronic arsenic poisoning, a classical state of ill health results are represented by 4 stages. First stage of nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances (diarrhoea is common) Third stage (of skin rashes) shows white bands known as Mees line crossing the nail of fingers and toes In addition to this, there may be evidence of liver damage, kidney damage and bone marrow depression at some stage Arsenic poisoning Increased levels of the element arsenic in the body. Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme. Symptoms of arsenic poisoning include headache, confusion, convulsion, diarrhea, vomiting, and in severe case coma and death Routes of exposure include contaminated water, air, and food. Occupational exposure to arsenic may occur with copper or lead smelting and wood treatment and among workers involved in the production or application of pesticides Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches, confusion, severe diarrhea, and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation called leukonychia may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more convulsions. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver. Chronic arsenic exposure can remain in the body systems for a longer period of time than a shoer term or more isolated exposure and can be detected in a longer time frame after the introduction of the arsenic, impoant in trying to determine the source of the exposure. Hair is a potential bioindicator for arsenic exposure due to its ability to store trace elements from blood. Incorporated elements maintain their position during growth of hair. Thus for a temporal estimation of exposure, an assay of hair composition needs to be carried out with a single hair which is not possible with older techniques requiring homogenization and dissolution of several strands of hair. This type of biomonitoring has been achieved with newer microanalytical techniques like Synchroton radiation based X ray fluorescence (SXRF) spectroscopy and Micropaicle induced X ray emission (PIXE). Dimercaprol and dimercaptosuccinic acid are chelating agents which sequester the arsenic away from blood proteins and are used in treating acute arsenic poisoning. The most impoant side effect is hypeension. Dimercaprol is considerably more toxic than succimer",B

Which of the following is not true about dying declaration -,Recorded by executive magistrate,Can be recorded by a doctor,Patient should have a sound mind,Oath is administered,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Oath is administered Dying declaration* It is the written or verbal statement made by a person likely to die because of some unnatural act done on his body, narrating the circumstances or the conditions responsible for his present state of health or the cause and manner of likely unnatural death.* Ideally dying declaration should be recorded by executive or honorary magistrate, but can also be recorded by doctor, village head man, police or any other person, if there is no time to call a magistrate. Doctor has to certify the patient to be compos mentis (sound mind). It is recorded in presence of two disinterested witnesses. Relatives and police officers are not allowed to be present. No oath is administered.* It carries less weight than dying deposition as no cross-examination is possible. If the patient does not die after the recording of declaration, the dying declaration loses its importance since now he can be called to the court and his evidence can be recorded after cross-examination.FaeatureDying DeclarationDying DepositionOathNot administered because of belief that dying person tells the truth.AdministeredMode toDoctor, Village head man, police magistrate or any other person.MagistrateIn presence of2 disinterested witnessAccused or his lawyerCross examinationNot possibleCan be doneLegal valueCarries weightCarries more weight, because it is recorded by magistrate, in front of accused or his lawyer and has oppurtunity of cross ezamination.Legal value if victim survivesNot admitted but has corroborative value and the person is called to give evidence (Sec. 157IEA)Full legal value",D

Gettlers test is done for detecting death by:,Drowning,Hanging,Burns,Phosphorus poisoning,"Gettlers test is done for detecting death due to drowning. According to this test, if death occured in salt water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the left hea chambers when compared to right due to hemoconcentration. If death occured in fresh water, the blood chloride concentration was greater in the right hea chambers due to hemodilution. Diatom test can be used to differentiate between drowning and non drowning cases. According to this test if a person dies from drowning in water containing diatoms, it can be demonstrated in the lung parenchyma and in distant organs such as hea, brain, kidney and bone. Whereas if a dead body is immersed in water, diatoms can be demonstrated only in the lung parnchyma and not in other organs. Because diatoms reach the lungs by passive percolation but not to distant organs because of absent circulation.

Most common cause of death in drowning is:,Hypocapnia,Hypoxemia,Hypothermia,Hypoglycemia,"Ans) b (Hypoxemia) Ref: K.S. Narayan Reddy 21st EdnCommon cause of death in drowning is due to asphyxia. Asphyxia can lead to anoxia, hypoxia.Other causes include vagal inhibition, ventricular fibrillation, laryngeal spasm.A conscious victim will hold his or her breath and will try to access air, often resulting in panic, including rapid body movement. This uses up more oxygen in the blood stream and reduces the time to unconsciousness. The victim can voluntarily hold his or her breath for some time, but the breathing reflex will increase until the victim will try to breathe, even when submerged.The breathing reflex in the human body is weakly related to the amount of oxygen in the blood but strongly related to the amount of carbon dioxide. During apnea, the oxygen in the body is used by the cells, and excreted as carbon dioxide.Thus, the level of oxygen in the blood decreases and the level of carbon dioxide increases. Increasing carbon dioxide levels lead to a stronger and stronger breathing reflex, up to the breath-hold breakpoint, at which the victim can no longer voluntarily hold his or her breath. This typically occurs at an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 55 mm Hg, but may differ significantly from individual to individual and can be increased through training.In fresh water and brackish water drowning the aspirated water is rapidly absorbed from the alveoli into the circulation producing an expansion of blood volume,haemodilution and haemolysis.Circulatory overload, hyponatraemia and sodium/potassium imbalance together with myocardial hypoxia resulted in a dramatic collapse of systolic pressure quickly followed in the majority of cases by ventricular fibrillation.In salt water drowning the aspiration of water results in withdrawal of water from the pulmonary circulation into the alveolar spaces as a result of the osmotic differential while at the same time, electrolytes (sodium, chloride, magnesium) pass into the blood.There is haemo-concentration but not haemolysis and little change in the sodium/potassium balance. In both fresh water and salt water drowning there is terminal pulmonary oedema.",B
"In blast injury, what is the organ to be damaged first-",Tympanic membrane,Git,Liver,Lung,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Tympanic membraneBlast or shock waveo When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the environment in which blast occurs :-Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place.

Post mortem lividity is not seen in?,Drowning in well,Drowning in a fast flowing river,Postmortem submersion,Drowning in chlorinated swimming pool,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Drowning in a fast flowing river o Postmortem lividity does not develop in drowning in running water (due to constantly changing position of body) and areas of contact flattening (due to collapsed capillaries)o Postmortem staining has so many synomyms, i.e. livor mortis/post mortem lividity/hypostasis/cadaveric lividity/ vibices/suggilation/darkening of death.o It refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.o As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.o Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1. It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2. It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when purification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3. If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4. Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple. In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5. It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death :i) In supine : On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning : Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6. No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood :i) In supine : No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf - contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices.",B

Taking off ones clothes and running naked in a public race is called ?,Mooning,Exhibitionism,Voveyrism,Undinism,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Exhibitionism Incent means sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is closely related to him by blood. eg a daughter, granddaughter. Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These include :? a) Sadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's paner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc. b) Lust murder : In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. c) Necrophagia : (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure. d) Masochism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, toured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual paner. e) Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants. f) Fetishism : A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm. eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc. g) Transvestism = Fonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality. h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these pas with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public). i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294 IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine). j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom : Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman. k) Frotteurism : Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone. l) Undinism : In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex. m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual pa of either or is sexually ored.

Cyanide poisoning causes,Stagnant anoxia,Anemic anoxia,Histotoxic anoxia,Anoxic anoxia,"Anoxia According to Gordon (1944) the stoppage of vital functions depend upon tissue anoxia. Anoxia means ""lack of oxygen"". It may be: (1) Anoxic anoxia: In this type, oxygen cannot reach the blood, because of lack of oxygen in the lungs. This occurs: (a) from breathing in a contaminated atmosphere, e.g., from exposure to the fumes in wells and tanks, or from exposure to sewer gas, (b) from mechanical interference with the passage of air into or down the respiratory tract, e.g., in smothering, choking, hanging, strangulation, drowning, traumatic asphyxia and ceain forms of acute poisoning. (2) Anaemic anoxia: In this type, oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is reduced, e.g., acute massive haemorrhage, poisoning by carbon monoxide, chlorates, nitrates, coaltar derivatives. (3) Stagnant anoxia: In this type, impaired circulation results in a reduction of oxygen delivery to the tissues, e.g., hea failure, embolism and shock. ( 4) Histotoxic anoxia: In this type, the enzymatic processes by which the oxygen in the blood is used by the tissues are blocked, e.g., acute cyanide poisoning.

Which of the following is the site of action of strychnine poison for its toxicity?,Hea,Anterior horn cells,Posterior horn cells,All of the above,"Strychnine competitively blocks ventral horn motor neuron postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and prevents the effects of glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter released by postsynaptic inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord. Strychnine binds to the chloride ion channel, causing increased neuronal excitability and exaggerated reflex arcs. This results in generalized seizure-like contraction of skeletal muscles. Simultaneous contraction of opposing flexor and extensor muscles causes severe muscle injury, with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and, in some cases, acute renal failure. Ref: Nordt S.P. (2012).

Parkih's textbook of FMT, 6th ed., pg 4.173)External features of electrocution (high voltage electrical burns)# Evidence of fatal electrocution can vary widely at autopsy, including the possibility of no skin marks being found at all.# At the point of entry, firm contact with the electrical conductor results in the current passing through the skin, heating up the tissue fluids, producing steam and possibly splitting the epidermis or the epidermal-dermal junction. The result is the production of a raised blister, which collapses on cooling after the current is stopped- the so-called 'electrical mark'.# The entry mark in this case would appear as a raised grey or white ring with an umbilicated centre. If the initial contact is less firm, a spark may jump from the conductor to the skin, producing very high local temperatures, which melt a small area of keratin on the skin.# In these incidences, the entry lesion appears after cooling as a raised, hard brown nodule, and is termed a 'spark lesion'.# Surrounding the electric mark is also commonly found an 'areola' of blanched skin due to arteriolar spasm caused by the effects of the current on vessel walls.# In high-voltage bums, sparks may jump a significantly greater distance (several cms) giving multiple spark lesions and producing a 'crocodile skin' effect. Sometimes, minimal marks are found: there may be small white and flattened blisters, usually found on the palms of the hand, which are easily missed at autopsy.# If the current is allowed to continue passing through the body for a considerable length of time, extensive charring and damage to the skin and underlying tissues may be present at autopsy, resulting in 'electrical burns'.# Sometimes, extensive 'flash burns' may be evident on the victim as any other thermal burn, but these are often produced by current passing by the body as opposed to through the body.Internal appearances# Significant findings in the internal organs of electrocution fatalities are rare or often non-specific because the conductive electrolytes present in the internal tissues means that any current passing through them is usually diffused so that little thermal damage is produced. Non-specific findings have included epicardial petechiae in death by cardiac arrest, and pleural and intracerebral petechiae with congestion and cyanosis of the face and lungs in respiratory arrest.",B

The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired. But if the piece sink after pressure, no respiration has taken place. if some piece float while otherb sink, it mean feeble respiration taken place. Wredin&;s test: Before bih, the middle ear contain gelatinous embryonic connective tissue. with respiration the spincter at the pharyngesl end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in few hours to five weeks.",B

"""Tram line bruises"" are caused due to injuries caused by",Chemical irritants,Electrical burns,Iron rod,Radiation burns,"When a person is stuck with a cylindrical object such as iron bar, the bruise pattern formed is distinct. The skin surface is indented and blood vessels at the edges are ruptured. Blood is squeezed out of any vessels along the point of contact, but the vessels remain relatively intact (paicularly if the suppoing tissues are lax). When the impacting object is removed, blood flows back into the undamaged vessels, but leaks from the damaged ones. The resulting bruise is termed a 'tramline bruise' because it appears as a pale linear central area lined on either side by linear bruising.

A laceration on the scalp is mistaken for,Firearm wound,Incised wound,Stab wound,Contusion,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Incised wound LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture)* Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized portions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations arei) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed).ii) Site of injury is the site of impact.iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue.iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface.* There are following types of laceration: -1) Split laceration: Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound.2) Strech lacerations: Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound.3) Avulsion (shearing laceration): An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a portion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area).4) Tears: Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching.5) Cut laceration: Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument.",B

Immersion syndrome occurs due to ?,Vagal inhibition,Vagal Stimulation,Sympathetic stimulation,Sympathetic inhibition,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Vagal inhibition Types of drowning Drowning is classified as (1) typical and (2) atypical. 1. Typical drowning (wet drowning) Typical drowning refers to obstruction of air passages and lungs by inhalation of water or other fluid. Therefore it is also called wet drowning and findings offluid and froth are present in PM examination. Typical drowning may be :- Fresh water drowning : In fresh water drowning large quantities of water cross the alveolar membrane into circulation causing hypervolaemia and hemodilution. RBCs imbibe water and burst (hemolysis) with liberation of potossium. Therefore, hea is exposed to volume overload, potassium excess, sodium deficit (hyponatremia), and anoxia. Anoxia and hyperkalemia cause ventricular fibrillation and death in 4-5 minutes. Salt water drowning : Hypeonicity of inhaled water causes loss of fluid from circulation into the lungs giving rise fulminating pulmonary edema with progressive hypovolaemia, circulatary shock, and eventually cardiac standstill (asystole) with death in 8-12 minutes. 2. Atypical drowning It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :- Dry drowning : On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition) : Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypeension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state.

Longer rigor mortis occurs with -,Vegetable poisons,Strychnine,Opium,Septicemia,"Prolonged rigor mortis occurs with strychnine.
Note : There is controversy about the duration of rigor mortis in deaths due to strychnine poisoning. According to some textbooks, rigor mortis starts early and stays longer, while other textbooks says that it has rapid onset and passes of early.
Thus, i have to read so many textbooks for this and i came to the conclusion that each and every textbook is correct. Both can occur in strychnine poisoning :-


If death occurs with violent contractions (during convulsions) for some time prior to death, it causes complete exhaustion → Rapid onset and short duration of rigor mortis.
If death is almost instantaneous, with a very short convulsive phase, there is no exhaustion →3 Rapid onset and longer duration of rigor mortis.

Forensic investigators use luminol to detect trace amounts of blood at crime scenes, as it reacts with the iron in haemoglobin. Biologists use it in cellular assays to detectcopper, iron, and cyanides, as well as specific proteins by western blot. When luminol is sprayed evenly across an area, trace amounts of an activating oxidant make the luminol emit a blue glow that can be seen in a darkened room. The glow only lasts about 30 seconds, but investigators can document the effect with a long-exposure photograph. Crime scene investigators must apply it evenly to avoid misleading results, as blood traces appear more concentrated in areas that receive more spray. The intensity of the glow does not indicate the amount of blood or other activator present, but only shows the distribution of trace amounts in the area.",B

HCN causes -,Histotoxic anoxia by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase,Histotoxic anoxia by inhibiting succinyl oxidase,Cytotoxic anoxia by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase,Cytotoxide anoxia by inhibiting succinyl oxidase,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

Stomach and intestine Breslau's Second Life Test (Stomach Bowel test) Principle: It assumes that a live born child would respire and therefore would also swallow some air into the stomach and bowelQ. Thus detecting the presence of air in stomach and intestine (positive test) proves live bih (even in absence of positive hydrostatic lung test if there had been some obstruction in respiratory However, negative test (absence of air in stomach and bowel) does not always mean still-bih since air does not necessarily enter stomach in adequate amounts during act of breathing. Procedure: The stomach and intestine are removed separately after tying double ligature at each end, place them both in water. They float in water if respiration has taken place, otherwise they will sink No medicolegal value Because air may be swallowed by child in attempting to free the air passage of fluid obstruction in case of still-bih. It is useless in putrefaction Other Tests in Infanticide For Lungs Static test or Fodere's testa: Weight of lung before (30-40 g) and after 66 gm) is measured. The increase in weight of lung is due to increased blood flow Ploucquet's testa: Weight of lung is doubled after respiration (Before respiration-1/70 of body weight, after respiration-1/35 of body weight) Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test)a: It is based on a fact that on breathing, the volume of lungs is increased, which more than compensates the weight of additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is diminished. For Middle Ear Werdin's test: Before bih, the middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic connective tissue. With respiration, the sphincter at the pharyngeal end of eustachian tube relaxes and air replaces the gelatinous substance in few hours to five weeks. This is not reliable",D

Sexual asphyxia/ Asphyxiophilia is considered a sub-type of sexual masochism disorder. In this disorder, people restrict their breathing (paial asphyxiation) at or near the time of orgasm to enhance the experience. Typically, people use aicles of clothing (eg, scarves, underwear) as a ligature to choke themselves. The ligature is often suspended from an object in the room (eg, doorknob, bedpost). Loss of consciousness can occur rapidly because obstruction of venous return from the brain impairs cerebral perfusion even before hypoxia and hypercarbia become significant. People who asphyxiate themselves in such a way that the ligature does not release if they lose consciousness can inadveently have permanent brain damage or die.",A

Which of the following metals the physician has in his mind?",Iron,Barium,Mercury,Thallium,"The patient with a positive history of working in a factory and now having presented with the classical symptoms (excessive salivation, tremors, disturbed personality and blue lines on gums) points towards the diagnosis of chronic mercury poisoning. The mercury poisoning can occur from various mercuric compounds. They are Mercuric chloride, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric cyanide, Mercuric sulphide, Mercuric nitrite, Mercuric sulphate, Mercurous chloride, Sulphate of mercury, Ammoniomercuric chloride and organic compunds of mercury. Elemental mercury is found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, fluorescent light bulbs, older dental fillings and few medical equipments. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, disinfectants, folk culture medicines and red cinnabar mineral. Organic mercury is found in older germ-killers (antiseptics), thimerosal, fumes from burning coal and in a few fishes that have consumed organic mercury. Mercury poisoning can occur as acute poisoning or chronic poisoning. The mercuric ion tends to bind with the sulphydryl groups of cellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids and mitotic apparatus thus interferes with the cellular and enzymatic functions. Renal tubular function get affected and in the pas of the central nervous system that are mainly targeted are cerebellum, basal ganglia, temporal lobe and corpus callosum. In acute poisoning the symptoms are bronchitis, constriction in throat, hoarse voice, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, fibrosis, abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, blood stained diarrhea, glossitis, ulcerative gingivitis, renal tubular necrosis, cylinduria, uraemia and acidosis. Chronic mercury poisoning is also known as hydrargyrism. The common symptoms are sore mouth, gingivitis, salivation, formation of blue lines at the junction with teeth (Buonian line), Danbury tremors, Glass blower's shakes (hatter's shakes), Concussio mercurialis, Mercurial erethism, Mercuria lentis (brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule) and Acrodynia or pink disease.

Which a vehicular injury is not caused by direct contact of vehicle ?,Primary impact,Secondary impact,Secondary injury,Rolling over,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Secondary injury Pedestrian injuries Following patterns of injuries are seen :? 1) Primary impact injuries : It is caused due to initial impact between vehicle and pedestrian. The height of the pedestrian often determines the site of impact and injuries, for example, they are usually found on head in children and on the trunk and legs in adults. Overall, the most common site is leg (85%), followed by head (50-80%) > arms > pelvis > chest or abdomen > neck and spine. 2) Secondary impact injuries : These are due to subsequent impact with the same vehicle, as may result from being lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact:- Secondary impact injuries are also usually seen on the same side as the primary impact injuries (side facing the vehicle) when the body is thrown on the vehicle although they may be seen on other surfaces such as during ran over injuries. If the initial impact was below the centre of gravity (as occurs in adult and older child), it tends to lift the victim up onto bonnet/hood of vehicle (scooping up) or even on road behind the vehicle and cause severe head injuries, laceration (due to secondary impact or contact with windshield) and run over by passing vehicle. If the initial point of impact was at or above the centre of gravity (as occurs in children), he is directly thrown to ground (due to primary impact) and is run over by same car with consequent secondary impact under carriage injuries which may include burns from hot exhaust pipe and stains from grease oil etc. 3) Secondary injuries : These are caused by person violently falling on ground or on stationary object. These are found on pas opposite to primary impact or on head. Injuries due to contact with ground include abrasion and bruises over the face, hand, hips and legs, and laceration over the bony prominences. 4) Rolling/Runover (degloving injuries) : Caused by wheel of vehicle or rolling over the victim.

Destructive power of bullet is determined by:,Weight of bullet,Shape of bullet,Size of bullet,Velocity of bullet,"Velocity of bullet Repeat from May 09 Mechanics of Bullet Injury A bullet's ability to produce tissue injury depends on: Bullet velocity- A bullet's ability to injure is directly related to its kinetic energy at the moment of impact. Kinetic energy i.e. E = me /2 The kinetic energy is directly propoional to weight (mass) of the bullet and the square of its velocity. Thus a bullet traveling at twice the speed of a second bullet of equal weight and similar size and shape, possesses four times much energy and injuring power. Tissue density- The greater the tissue density, the greater is the amount of energy discharged by the bullet passing through it and thus greater the injury. Thus a bullet may cause slight damage to the soft tissue, but extensive damage to hard tissue such as bone. Hydrostatic force- Hydrostatic forces increase the impact of injury. When fluid distended hollow organs, (e.g. urine filled bladder, filled stomach, hea filled with blood in diastole) are hit by a bullet, extensive lacerations are produced due to the explosive displacement of the liquid in all directions.",D

Phossy jaw is caused by ?,White phosphorus,Red Phosphorus,Arsenic,Antimony,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., White Phosphorus Phossy jaw is caused by phosphorus poisoning. All phosphorus poisoning are caused by white (yellow) phosphorus (Red phosphorus is nontoxic). Phosphorus poisoning Phosphorus is a protoplasmic poison affecting cellular oxidation and causing anoxic necorbiosis, classically affecting liver. It increases fat deposition and inhibits glycogen deposition in liver. It is used in fire works (Diwali poisoning) and as rat poison. Lethal dose is 60-120 mg. Phosphorus occurs in two forms :? 1) White/yellow phosphorus : It is white, and becomes yellow on exposure to air. It is translucent, waxy, luminous and crystalline cylinders. It has garlic like odor. It is insoluble in water and luminous in dark. Its fumes show phosphorescence. 2) Red phosphorus : It is reddish brown, ine, odourless and tasteless. It is nontoxic (thus poisoning occurs only due to white phosphorus). It is put on the sides (striking surface) of match box (along with powdered galss). Acute poisoning It has following stages : i) 1st Stage (GI irritation) : There is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and garlic odor. This stage lasts for 8 hours to 3 days. ii) 2nd Stage (Asymptomatic) : This stage lasts for 3 days. iii) 3rd Stage : There is liver and kidney damage due to absorbed phosphorus. Initially liver is enlarged due to acute fatty infiltration. Later liver shruks due to necrosis, i.e. acute yellow atrophy. Chronic poisoning Toothache is the first symptom which is associated with loosening of teeth, necrosis of gums and osteomyelitis of jaw. Therefore chronic phosphorus poisoning is also know as phossy jaw (or glass jaw). Postmoem appearance There is garlic odor. Viscera and stool glow in dark (due to luminosity). To preserve luminosity, viscera are preserved in saturated saline solution. Rectified spirit is not used as it causes loss of luminosity.",A

Postmortem lividity does not occur in -,Drowning in well,Drowning in a fast flowing river,Postmortem submersion,Drowning in chlorinated swimming pool,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Drowning in a fast flowing river o Postmortem lividity does not develop in drowning in running water (due to constantly changing position of body) and areas of contact flattening (due to collapsed capillaries)o Postmortem staining has so many synomyms, i.e. livor mortis/post mortem lividity/hypostasis/cadaveric lividity/ vibices/suggilation/darkening of death.o It refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.o As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.o Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1. It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2. It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when purification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3. If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4. Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple. In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5. It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:i) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6. No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood:i) In supine: No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf - contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices.",B
Persistent contracted stage is seen in?,Rigor mortis,Algor mortis,Heat stiffening,Cold stiffening,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Heat stiffeningoRigor mortis in tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter.oAlgor mortis is cooling of the body after death. After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death.oHeat stiffening is permanent.oOn warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears.oGas (putrefactive) rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.Differential diagnosis of post mortem stiffening1. Rigor mortis#It is defined as contraction, stiffening, shortening and opacity of muscles after death. It is preceded by a period of relaxation. It occurs after molecular (cellular) death. In tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter. In temperate countries, it begins in 3-6 hours, takes further 2-3 hours to develop and lasts for 2-3 days.2. Heat stiffening#In body exposed to extensive heat (>65degC) there results stiffening and flexion of all joints, known as 'Pugilistic or boxers or defence posture', due to denaturation and coagulation of proteins. However, heat stiffening is permanent (unlike rigor mortis which passes off after few hours.)3. Cold stiffening#Due to exposure to freezing temperature, body becomes stiff due to freezing (solidification) of fats and body fluids. On warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears, differentiating it from rigor mortis.4. Putrefactive (gas) stiffening#During decomposition, body part becomes rigid because of collection of gases in subcutaneous tissues and the pressure exerted by these gases. It can be differentiated from rigor mortis as other signs of putrefaction are present and putrefactive rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.5. Cadaveric spasm (instantaneous rigor or cataleptic rigidity)#The muscles, which were in contraction or spasm at the time of death, continue to be in spasm even after death, without the stage of primary relaxation.",C

All are related to criminal responsibility of insame except -,Currens rule,Durhan rule,MeNaughten rule,Resp ispa loquitar,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Resp ispa ioquitar o Criminal responsibility of insane is judged by following rules :1. Mc Naughten rule (legal test or right or wrong test) :It states that an accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved that at the time of commiting the crime, person was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mind that he didn't know the nature and quality of act he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong i.e. a person is not responsible if he is not of sound mind.It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 IPC as - ""nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law"".2. Doctrine of partial responsibility - if a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions.3. Durban rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect.4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5. American law institute test-Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed.6.

Bitter almond smell found in poisoning due to -,Charas,Hydrocyanic acid,Opium,Oraganophosphorus,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

Stellate wound is produced with firearm in,Contact shot,Close shot,Range within 60 cm,Distant shot,"Stellate wound is a characteristic of a contact wound. Specific appearances of contact shot: Muzzle/Recoil imprint mark is regarded as a patterned abrasion/ intradermal contusion caused by the expansive power of the gases lifting the skin forcibly up against the muzzle.- Characteristic imprint marks can provide clues to the type of the firearm and its position at the time of discharge. Back spatter: In a contact shot, the muzzle blast and negative pressure in the barrel may suck blood, hair, fragments of tissues and cloth fibers back into the barrel. Blowback phenomenon: Cruciate, stellate or ragged laceration is seen, especially if there is a thick bone immediately under the skin, such as the skull. This occurs as a result of expansion of gases beneath the skin and their exit through the entry wound (in contact wounds).",A

Algor mois is ?,Rise of body temperature after death,Cooling of body,Persistent body spasm,None,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cooling of body ALGOR MOIS After death, dead body behaves like an ine substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, covection, radiation and evoporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body stas 1/2 to 1 hour after death. There are varying opinions about rate of cooling of dead body: i) Most widely accepted view is that the rate of cooling in india (tropical countries) is 0.5-0.7deg C/hour, so that body attains atmospheric temperature in 16-20 hours after death. In temperate climate, the rate of fall is about 1.5deg C/hour. ii) As per another view, cooling is faster in initial period, when the temprature difference between body and atmosphere is maximum ? First 30-45 minutes --> No temperature fall (isothermic phase). First 1-6 hours --4 1.5-2deg C/hour. 6-12 hours 0.9-1.2deg C/hour. After 12 hours ---> 0.4-0.6deg C/hour. iii) Rate of cooling is related to difference in temperature and its surroundings (environment). In the first 2 hours average rate fall of temperature is roughly half this difference. In next 2 hours the temperature fall is at half this rate and in subsequent 2 hours, at quaer this rate. iv) Most common site for recording temperature is the rectum. Thermameter is inseed in rectum around 8-10 cm for 2 minutes. Other sites for recording tempeure are nose, ear (external auditory meatus), vagina and under liver.

Which is not a feature of cocaine poisoning: September 2011,Hallucination,Agitation,Hypothermia,Stimulation of libido,"Ans. C: Hypothermia Cocaine when ingested results in hypehermia, hallucinations, euphoria and stimulation of libido Cocaine intoxication With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated hea rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis).

Least common organ affected in blast injury is -,Lung,Eardrum,Muscles,GIT damage,"Ans. is 'c' ie., Muscles * An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat.* Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors:-1) Blast or shock wave# When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion.# The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs:-i) Air blast (most common):* Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to airfilled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury.* Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.ii) Under water blast (explosion under water):* Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.iii) Solid blast:* Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place.* The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.2) Flame or hot gases# Burns or burning of body may occur.3) Flying missiles (debris)# Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.4) Anoxia# Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2",C

"Aconite poisoning causes all, EXCEPT:",Hypersalivation,Tingling and numbness,Increased BP,Chest pain,"Aconite poisoning is characterized by hypotension and hypeension. Tingling, numbness, hypersalivation and chest pain is usually seen in all cases of aconite poisoning. The aconite leaves when rubbed or handled on the skin, produces tingling and numbness. The eyes on exposed to pollen, becomes painful and swollen. It gives rise to gastro-intestinal symptoms like burning sensation of the mouth and stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and tingling sensation of the mouth, tongue and pharynx. The tingling and numbness then progresses all over the body. The general symptoms include pallor, giddiness, profuse sweating, headache and weakness. The neurological symptoms are dimness of vision, diplopia and hallucinations. The cardiovascular symptoms are hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia and AV block. Death occurs from paralysis of the cardiac centre and respiratory centre. Ref: The Essentials of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology By Dr. K. S. Narayan Reddy, 27th Edition, Pages 551-552.",C

Forced alkaline diuresis is indicated in which of the following: September 2011,Lead poisoning,Arsenic poisoning,Phenobarbitone poisoning,Alcohol poisoning,"Ans. C: Phenobarbitone poisoning Forced osmotic diuresis using intravenous chlohiazide and/ or mannitol results in considerable increase in the elimination rate of barbiturates Forced diuresis It is increased urine formation by diuretics and fluid It may enhance the excretion of ceain drugs in urine and is used to treat drug overdose or poisoning of these drugs and hemorrhagic cystitis Most of the drugs are either weak acids or weak bases. When urine is made alkaline, elimination of acidic drugs in the urine is increased. The converse applies for alkaline drugs. This method is only of therapeutic significance where the drug is excreted in active form in urine and where the pH of urine can be adjusted to levels above or below the pK value of the active form of drug. For acidic drugs, urine pH should be above the pK value of that drug, and converse for the basic drugs. It is because the ionization of acidic drug is increased in alkaline urine and ionized drugs cannot easily cross plasma membrane so cannot re-enter blood from kidney tubules. This method is ineffective for drugs which are strongly protein bound (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants) or which have a large apparent volume of distribution (e.g. paracetamol, tricyclic antidepressants). Forced alkaline diuresis has been used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone, while forced acid diuresis has been used to enhance the elimination of cocaine, amphetamine, quinine, quinidine, strychnine when poisoning by these drugs has occurred. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost impoance in this setting because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with alkalinization of the urine. For forced acid diuresis, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is used. Ammonium chloride has also been used for forced acid diuresis but it is a toxic compound. Forced alkaline diuresis is also recommended for rhabdomyolysis",C

Test used to detect blood group of blood stain: March 2007,Benzidine test,Takayama test,Luminol test,Absorption elution test,"Ans. D: Absorption elution test The Takayama Test is based on the reaction of pyridine with hemoglobin to form hemochromogen crystals. Takayama is a crystal test used for the confirmation of the presence of blood on samples. Benzidine test used to confirm the presence of blood - has been discontinued because the reagent is carcinogenic. It has largely been replaced by the Kastle-Meyer test, using a solution of phenolphthalein which turns pink in contact with even small traces of blood. The test works by detecting the presence of the enzyme peroxides in the blood. However, as this substance is also present in other biological materials, the Kastle-Meyer test is regarded as a screening procedure. It is highly sensitive, and positive reaction is judged presumptive of blood, and fuher confirmatory tests are carried out. Once a stain has been confirmed as blood it has to be determined whether it is human or animal. The precipitin test is used for this purpose. The precipitin test is sensitive, and will work on small traces of blood. The test is also known as the Uhlenbuth test. Spectrophotometric analysis of bloodstains allows them to be aged within the range of one day to three weeks. The Luminol test - The Luminol reacts with the iron complex in the blood's hemoglobin to produce a self-luminescence. The bloodstains literally glow in the dark with a faint bluish light. The most widely used method for finding invisible blood Blood group are determined in blood stains by: Latte's crust method Absorption-elution method Absorption-inhibition method Latex method Enzymological methods",D

The recommended treatment for suspected arsenic poisoning is,Parenteral administration of EDTA,Peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis,Dimercaprol,Parenteral administration of penicillamine,"The trivalent form of arsenite (arsenic, AsO2) has al high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and binds with great avidivty to lipoic acid, one of the five cofactors of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The most efficient way to remove this arsenite is by administering a competitive sulfhydryl compound, such as dimercaprol. Chelating agents such as EDT A, penicillamine, or deferoxamine will react with circulating metals and remove them from the body. Yet, they are less effective in competing with sulfhydryl groups than the mercaptans. Ref: Krishnan vij Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology; 5th ed; Page no: 465",C

Injuries in explosion occur due to four factorsBlast or shock waveWhen an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviomment in which blast occursAir blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid-'solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal. fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.Flame or hot gasesBums or burning of body may occur.Flying missiles (debris)Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.AnoxiaVarious gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2",B

Following is not true about adipocere formation ?,It is a modification of putrefaction,It is developed in presence of air,It occurs in dead bodies lying in water,Body has an offensive sweet smell,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., It is developed in presence of air Adipocere formation (saponification). Adipocere is a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs. Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or burned in damp lay soil. Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere. Adipocere formation stas in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical. Body is conveed into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible. Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shoest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 month's.

"In CO poisoning all of the following clinical features are seen, EXCEPT:",Cyanosis,Cerebral edema,Convulsions,Bradycardia,"Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odorless, tasteless, and non irritating gas produced by the incomplete combustion of any carbon-containing material. CO binds to hemoglobin with an affinity 250 times that of oxygen, resulting in reduced oxyhemoglobin saturation and decreased blood oxygen-carrying capacity. CO may also directly inhibit cytochrome oxidase, fuher disrupting cellular function, and it is known to bind to myoglobin, possibly contributing to impaired myocardial contractility. Symptoms of intoxication are predominantly in organs with high oxygen consumption, such as the brain and hea. The majority of patients describe headache, dizziness, and nausea. Patients with coronary disease may experience angina or myocardial infarction. With more severe exposures, impaired thinking, syncope, coma, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and death may occur. Cerebral edema (swelling of the brain) is also a common result of severe carbon monoxide poisoning. Survivors of serious poisoning may experience numerous ove neurologic sequelae consistent with a hypoxic-ischemic insult, ranging from gross deficits such as parkinsonism and a persistent vegetative state to subtler personality and memory disorders.

Bone pearl appearance is seen in -,Electrical bums,Hydrocution,Strangulation,Throttling,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Electrical burnsElectric burnso Electric bums are at times, also referred to as joule burns. Technically, joule bum is an endogenous bum, i.e. bums produced due to release of heat from the body, on application of electric current. Electric bums may be of following typesContact burns : Due to contact with live wire.Spark burns : Due to sparking of current, e.g. in loose electrical fitting.Flash burns : Caused on being near the main powrer line, without actual contact. Bums result due to arcing of current from these lines.o Characteristic features of electric burns areThere may be holes in clothes or shoes.There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric currentEntry wound : It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause bums over large areas of skin, i.e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment: green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode),Exit wound : It is like a laceration and is bleeding.Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping).Muscles show Zenker's degeneration.Causes of deatho Commonest cause of death is ventricular fibrillation.

Test performed to compare weight of lung to body weight is?,Ploucquet test,Fodere's test,Gettler's test,Raygaf s test,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ploucquet's Test Tests used in infanticide Ploucquet's test: o Weight of lung is measured in relation to body wieght. Before birth weight of lung is 1/70 of body weight and after respiration it becomes 1/35 of body weight due to increased blood flow in lung beds. Static test or Fodere's test: o The average weight of both lungs before respiration is 30-40 gm and after respiration is 60-70 cm. Hydrostatic test (Raygat's test, 1st life test): o The specific gravity of a non-respired lung is 1040-1050 and of a respired lung is 940-950, so, after respiration lung floats on water (specific gravity of water is 1000). o False positive hydrostatic test may occur (i.e.non-respired lung may float) in decomposition and in attempted artificial respiration. o False negative hydrostatic test (i.e. respired lung may sink down) may occur in atelectasis, pulmonary oedema, bronchopneumonia, and congenital syphylis. Breslau's second life test: o It assumes that a live born child would respire and therefore, would also swallow some air into the stomach and bowel. o Hence they float on water. This test is falsely positive in putrefaction (due to putrefied gases) or in cases of attempted artificial respiration. Werdin's test: o Before birth middle ear contains gelatinous embryonic tissue which is replaced by air after respiration.",A

( 4) Handling sharp instruments: Avoid accidental pricks and cuts from needles, scalpels, etc. If a cut is made in the rubber gloves or needle injury occurs they should be removed immediately and replaced with new ones. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Infection of AIDS can be acquired by transdermal inoculation through cuts and needle punctures. About 0.3 to 0.5% of individuals will become seropositive. Transmission rates from contaminated needle punctures or close contact are 10 to 30 times higher for serum hepatitis than for AIDS. The incident should be repoed to proper authority to get their blood check for HIV seropositivity. (5) Handling specimens for laboratory examination: Mucocutaneous contact with the body fluids, and aerosol inhalation should be avoided. They should be properly labelled andfilled with 10% formalin solution and should be handled with gloved hands. (6) Disposal of used instruments: They should be dipped in 20% glutaraldehyde (cidox) for half-an-hour, washed with soap or detergent and water, dried and then rinsed in methylated spirit and air dried. (7) All soiled gauze and cotton, etc. should be collected in a double plastic bag for incineration. (8) Laundry material, such as aprons, towels, etc. should be soaked in one percent bleach for half-an-hour, washed with detergent and hot water, and autoclaved. (9) Clean- up procedure: Wear new intact disposable gloves. Small spatters and spills of blood and other body fluids can be wiped up with disposable tissues o1* towels which are discarded in special bio-hazard bags and properly disposed. The autopsy table and floor should be cleaned with one percent bleach solution, followed by washing with soap and water. (10) Disinfectants: 1:10 dilution of common household bleach or a freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution are recommended. Liquid chemical germicides commonly used in health care facilities and laboratories are effective against HIV. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-121,122",A

Evidence not used in rape?,Semen in vagina,Semen on clothes,Presence of smega bacilli in vagina,Presence of smegma under prepuce,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Presence of smegma under prepuce Examination in a case of rape A. Examination of victim Victim cannot be examined without written informed consent. Informed written consent should be obtained if the age of victim is above 12 years. If she is less than 12 years of age or if she is mentally unsound, the written consent of parent/guardian should be taken (Sec. 90 IPC). Victim (female) should be examined by or under supervision of a female RMP (Sec. 53(2) CrPC). Finding which are suggestive of rape are :- Signs of struggle on clothes (tear, blood, semen, mud etc), body and genitals (abrasion, contusion, bites or nail marks etc). Presence of the semen in the vagina (proof of sexual intercourse). Presence of spermatozoa in the vagina. Locards principal of exchange states that whenever two bodies come in contact with each other, there is exchange of material between the two and so a criminal can be linked to crime. In case of rape, piece of cloth, button, hair, blood, saliva, semen or smegma from the accused may be found on the body of victim and conversly materials of victim may be found on the body of accused. Presence of smegma bacilli in vagina is suggestive of coitus. B.Examination of accused An accused can be examined even without his consent (Sec 53(A) CrPC). Findings may be Presence of torn frenulum is consistent with a recent intercourse. The presence of smegma under prepuce is inconsistent with recent intercoures as it gets rubbed off during sexual intercourse and may be deposited in vagina. It takes about 24 hours to accumulate.

Most common organ affected in underwater blast ?,Intestine,Liver,Spleen,Hea,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intestine The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine. Explosion injury An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factors :? 1) Blast or shock wave When an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviornment in which blast occurs :- Air blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other pas injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected. Under water blast (explosion under water): Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured. Solid blast : Explosive is detonated near a rigid/solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal; fracture of legs and veebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung. 2) Flame or hot gases Burns or burning of body may occur. 3) Flying missiles (debris) Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations. 4) Anoxia Various gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO,.",A

Rigor mortis in fetus is:,Usually not seen before 7 months,Seen in upper limb & not in lower limb,Seen in lower limb & not in upper limb,Established but too faint to be appreciated,"Ans: a (Usually not seen before 7 months)Ref: Krishan, Vij 4th ed., Pg. 1201. Rigor does not occur in foetus of less tha seven months, but is commonly found in still bom infants at full term. Intensity of rigor depends on the decedent's muscular development. The very young, very old, and debilitated have poorly developed rigor. Children who had died after chronic illness, who had mostly confined to bed for weeks or months, also showed frequently little or no postmortem stiffness because their musculature had faded away during that time. Some expert belive that the low degree of but perceptible stiffness as absence of rigor mortis.Variables affecting onset and duration of rigor:* Variables which accelerate the onset of rigor oExogenous heat, violent exertion prior to death, seizure activity, alkaloid poisoning.* Factors which delay the onset of rigor:a. Exogenous coldb. Exsanguination haemorrhagec. Asphyxial deathsd. Poisoning by arsenicConditions simulating rigor1. Cadaveric spasm: This is a rare form of muscular stiffening which occurs at the time of death. It usually affects groups of muscles in the arms.2. Heat stiffening: This process is seen in fire deaths and involves actual cooking of the muscle fibers. Because the fibers shorten, one sees a typical ""pugilistic"" appearance.2.

The most impoant sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method is:,Root transparency,Root attrition,Root resorption,Paradentosis,"Ans. a. Root transparency Gustafson's Method The age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues. AttritionQ Due to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age. It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness ParadentosisQ Regression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent pas of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off. Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis. Secondary DentinQ * It may develop from the walls within the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity. * First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity. Cementum Appositiondeg The cementum increases in thickness paicularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root. Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines. Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth. They can be seen on histological section. The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards. This is mainly applicable to infants. This is mainly applicable to infants. Root ResorptionQ It involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves. Absorption of the root stas first at the apex and extends upwards. It usually occurs in the late age. It may be due to pathological process. Transparency of the RootQ It is not seen until about 30 years of age. The canals in the dentin are at first wide. With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent. It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ.",A

With blood samples, a good HMWDNA recovery from all the bodies investigated was obtained during the first week following the death. In each case, the quality and quantity of the DNA were good enough to realizeDNA fingerprints with the SLP system (data not shown). In liver samples, only bodies of postmoem ages ranging from 1 to 7 days allowed us to obtain HMWDNA. HMWDNA was extracted from kidney samples up to one month after death, but the yield of DNA decreased rapidly, becoming very low beyond a period of one week. Past this period, we did not succeed in obtaining DNA fingerprints from DNA extracted. The extraction of DNA from lymph nodes was satisfactory up to one week. Over a postmoem period of 7 days, the DNA was degraded and unsuitable for blotting. HMWDNA was purified from spleen samples up to one week after death and the DNA present in hea tissue or in muscle cells was stable up to one month postmoem period, allowing us to perform DNA fingerprinting. Finally, out of all tissues tested, the brain coexappeared to be the most stable tissue for DNA recovery, even after long postmoem periods."" Ref:MEDSCAPE",B

Saturnine Gout is due to(2018),Chronic Arsenic Poisoning,Chronic Lead Poisoning,Chronic Mercury poisoning,Chronic Iron Poisoning,"Chronic lead Poisoning (plumbism; saturnism): Chronic poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg of lead. Signs and Symptoms : (1) Facial Pallor : The facial pallor paicularly about the mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign. It seems to be due to vasospasm. (2) Anaemia : There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased. The anaemia is due to inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin. 3 )Leadline : A stippled blue line, called Buonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near diy or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth. 4) Colic and Constipation : (5) Lead Palsy: There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are paicularly affected. The muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected) are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected. The paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles. Recovery may be complete but is usually slow. ( 6) Encephalopathy :*Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead. The symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage. Death occurs in about 25% cases. (7) Cardiovascular System and Kidneys : Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypeension and permanent aeriolar degeneration. Chronic aeriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur. (8) Reproductive System : Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and aboion are frequent. Aboion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months. (9) Other Systems : They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, veigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead paicles in the early phase of poisoning. Ref:- k.s.narayan reddy; pg num:- 544",B

The non-poisoning Salt of cyanide is -,Potassium cyanide,Hydrocyanic acid,Sodium cyanide,Potassium ferrocyanide,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Novus actus interveniens is related to?,Facts speaking for itself,Breaking of chain,Contributory negligence,Therapeutic misadventure,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Breaking of chain Novus Actus Interveniens:o A person is responsible for his actions and its consequences. This principle applies to cases of assault or accidental injuries. However, sometime such continuity of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i.e. ""novus actus intervenien "" (an unrelated action intervening).o For example, If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon.

The convulsions last for 30 seconds to 2 minute and are precipitated by slightest stimuli such as sudden noise, a current of air or gentle touching of patient. The convulsions are first clonic but eventually becomes tonic. In between the convulsions, the muscles are completely relaxed and it is an impoant diagnostic feature. * The convulsions are more marked in anti-gravity muscles and body arches in hyperextension position and lies on heel and head. This position of body is known as opisthotonos. It is most common position. However, at time, the body may bend forward and the condition is called as emprosthotonos. If body bends side wise (i.e. lateral bending), the condition is called as pleurothotonos. * Contraction of the muscles of face causes widening of the angle of mouth with creases appearing around eyelids. This condition is known as risus sardonicus. Also called as sardonic smile due to grimacing that occurred due to muscle contraction of face. * There is difficulty in breathing during convulsions due to contraction of chest muscles and diaphragm. * Patient remains conscious and maintains clear sensorium during and between convulsions. * There may be frothing at mouth and pupils are dilated * Prognosis is good if interval for appearance of convulsions increases and period of convulsion decreases.

There is reduced erythrocyte life span* Blood - there are immature red cells in circulation such as reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells. Basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia means presence of many dark coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells. The spots are aggregation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) due to inhibition of the enzyme pyrimidine-5' nucleotidase that normally eliminates degraded RNA.* Lead line (Buonian line) - a bluish line is present on gums. The line formation is due to lead sulphide. Lead sulphide is formed due to action of hydrogen sulphide gas, liberated from the decomposed food in the mouth, with lead.* Colic and constipation (dry belly ache) - Colic affects intestine, ureter or uterus. The attack of colic lasts for few minutes and is in form of severe, intermittent cramps.During colic, the abdominal wall is rigid and contracted. Constipation is associated with the colic.* Lead palsy - is a late phenomenon. The extensor muscles are paralyzed causing wrist drop or foot drop. It is motor type of paralysis.

The most important sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method is:,Root transparency,Root attrition,Root resorption,Paradentosis,"Ans. a. Root transparency (Ref: Reddy 33/e p70, 28/e p63-64)Root transparency is the most important sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method.Gustafson's MethodThe age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues.AttritionQDue to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age.It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness of the enamel.ParadentosisQRegression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent parts of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off.Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis.Secondary DentinQIt may develop from the walls w ithin the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity.First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity.This is partly due to ageing and partly due to pathological conditions like caries and paradentosis.Cementum AppositionQThe cementum increases in thickness particularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root.Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines.Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth.They can be seen on histological section.The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards.This is mainly applicable to infants.Root ResorptionQIt involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves.Absorption of the root starts first at the apex and extends upwards.It usually occurs in the late age.It may be due to pathological process.Transparency of the RootQIt is not seen until about 30 years of age.The canals in the dentin are at first wide.With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent.It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ.",A

"At autopsy, the cyanide poisoning case will show the following features, except -",Characteristic bitter lemon smell,Congested organs,The skin may be pinkish or cherry red,Erosion and haemorrhages in oesophagus and stomach,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

Duret haemorrhage is seen in:,Endocardium,Brain,Ear,Liver,"Ans: b (Brain)Ref: Reddy, 29th ed., Pg. 230Duret haemorrhages are small areas of bleeding in the ventral and paramedian parts of the upper brainstem.It is named for Henri Duret. They are secondary to raised intracranial pressure with formation of a transtentorial pressure cone involving the cerebral peduncles (crus cerebri) and other midbrain structures caused by raised pressure above the tentorium.Kernohan's notch is a groove in the cerebral peduncle that may be caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the incisura of the tentorium. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis is a false localizing sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcian herniation secondary to a supratentorial mass.The common causes are an acute haematoma, oedema following trauma, abscess, or tumour. The Duret haemorrhage is demonstrated at CT or MRI. It usually indicates a fatal outcome. The mechanism is uncertain, but is probably caused by the displacement of the brainstem stretching and lacerating pontine perforating branches of the basilar artery.",B
Latte's crust of blood stain is used to detect,Detection species,Secretor status,Nature of stain,Blood group,"Blood groups ABO, MNS and Rh are determined in a blood stain by (1) Latte&;s crust method. (2) Absorption- elution technique. (3) Absorption-inhibition. (4) Latex method. (5) Enzymological methods. TESTS FOR DETERMINING ABO GROUPING IN BLOOD STAINS : (1) TUBE METHOD : A drop of washed suspension of red cells is added to equal volumes of each of the antisera of A, B and 0 in separate tubes. The blood group can be identified when agglutination is seen by naked eye or microscope in the tubes. (2) Tile Method: A porcelian tile is used instead of tubes. (3) ABSORPTION -INHIBITION METHOD : The sample and antisera are allowed to react with each other for a longer period. ( 4) MIXED AGGLUTINATION TEST : The sample piece of stained cloth is cut into pieces of 2 to 3 mm and the fibres are separated and added to tubes along with antisera of A, B, 0 types. The group can be known by the antisera which clumped to the cloth fibres. (5) ABSORPTION-ELUTION TECHNIQUE: Test is similar to mixed agglutination, but the clumps are seen on the walls of the test tube and not on fibres. This test can be used for body tissues also. Blood stains can be typed for the presence of ABO agglutinogens by absorption-elution, absorption- inhibition, mixed agglutination or ELISA method, or for agglutinins by the Lattes crust method.

""Brain death"" has displaced ""cardiac death"" as the essential criterion; and the diagnosis must be made before there is organ death.The Declaration also states that ""If transplantation of an organ is onvolved, the decision that death exists should be made by one or more physicians; and the physicians determining the moment of death should in no way be immediately concerned with the performance of the transplant.""This makes for objectivity. But it is incorrect to say that ""death exists"" or refer to ""the moment of death"". The patient is not dead until after life suppo has been withdrawn.",A

Which of the following is present in post mortem staining?,Seen on dependent parts of body,Extravasation of blood from capillaries,Lividity is greatest on the pressure points,Develops rapidly in running water,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Seen on dependent parts of body * Postmortem staining refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.* As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.* Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1) It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2) It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when putrification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3) If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4) Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple.In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5) It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:i) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6) No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood:i) In supine: No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf ->> contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices.",A

Opisthotonus posture is caused by wof,Ricinus communis,Papaver somniferum,Coccaine,Strychnous nux vomica,"STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

For exmaple underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.Necrophilia:* In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies.* It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell, and coldness act as stimulants.* Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex.

There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",C

Casper's dictum is related to,Rate of putrefaction,Floatation of a dead body,Calculation of time since death,Identification of dead body,"PUTREFACTION IN WATER Casper dictum: It states that a body decomposes in air twice as rapidly as in water, and eight times as rapidly as in eah. The rate of putrefaction is slower in water than in air. Putrefaction is more rapid in warm, fresh water than in cold, salt water. It is more rapid in stagnant water than in running water. Putrefaction is delayed when a body is lying in deep water and is well protected by clothing, while it is rapid in a body lying in water contaminated with sewage. As the submerged cadavers float face down with the head lower than the trunk, gaseous distension and postmoem discolouration are first seen on the face and then spread to the neck, upper extremities, chest, abdomen and the lower extremities in that order. Fluid gravitation in the head ours marked decomposition. When the body is removed from the water, putrefaction is hastened as the tissues have absorbed much water.

It is an immunological test(serological examination). Principle: Blood serum contains proteins in colloidal suspension ,and when human serum is injected into an animal,the animal become immunised against these proteins and antibodies develop in its blood .If human serum is then brought into contact with this animal serum,the antibodies in the animal serum react with the proteins in the human serum and a visible precipitate forms. The antibodies causing this reaction are known as precipitins and the animal serum is known as antihumam precipitin serum.A rabbit or a fowl is injected with human blood every third day for 3 to 5 injections. after thuis animal is killed and the antiserum is collected. A suitable antiserum should react immmediately or within a minute on the 1:1000 dilution Application of the test: It is a specific protein test, and the reaction demonstrates the presence of albuminous substances obtained from any pa of human body. the origin of skin, flesh,bone or even secretions such as saliva ,milk and semen is determined by this test.",C

Which of the following is the first internal organ to putrefy?,Hea,Kidney,Brain,Prostrate,"Brain is the first organ to putrefy amongst the options provided. Putrefaction Review: Putrefaction is disintegration of body tissues after death produced by the action of bacteria and other microorganism thriving on the body. It represents the last stage in resolution of body from the inorganic to organic state. Putrefaction is the most absolute sign of death. Rate of Putrefaction significantly depends on the medium in which the body lies (Caper&;s Dictum) Caper&;s Dictum: Effect of medium (in which body lies) on rate of putrefaction Casper&;s dictum relates to the rate of putrefaction of a dead body and helps in estimation of time since death. Caper&;s dictum states that a body decomposes in air twice as rapidly as in water and eight times as rapidly in eah. Temperature being the same the ratio of rate of putrefaction of a dead body in water, air and buried in ground is 1:2:8 Putrefaction can be identified by both external and internal signs that often in a predictable sequence. First sign of Putrefaction (External) First Internal sign of Putrefaction Greenish discolouration of flank over cecum (right iliac fossa) is the first clinical sign of Putrefaction The greenish discolouration is due to formation of sulphamethemoglobin Typically Appears in 12-24 hours The first internal sign of putrefaction is Greenish discolouration on undersurface of liver (often the area of the liver in contact with the caecum) Putrefaction of internal organs typically proceeds in a predictable fashion depending on multiple factors such as Firmness, Moisture content, density, and/or Quantity of blood in organs. As a general rule, the organs show putrefactive changes in the following order(Order according to Reddy) Larynx & trachea Infant brain Stomach, Intestine, Spleen Liver, Lung Brain Hea Kidney, Bladder Prostate, Uterus (non-gravid) Skin, muscle, tendon Bone Organs to Putrefy early Mucosa of trachea and larynx Stomach and intestine Spleen Liver Brain Organs that Putrefy Late Esophagus, Diaphragnm, Hea Lungs Kidney Urinary bladder Uterus (Non-Gravid) Prostate Ref: APC Essentials of Forensic Medicine by Anil Aggarwal",C

Pugilistic attitude is seen in: March 2011,Burns,Electrocution,Drowning,Strangulation,"Ans. A: Burns The burnt body presents the so called attitude of defense, known as boxing attitude, pugilistic attitude or fenching posture Terminology commonly discussed in relation with thermal injuries in forensic pathology: 1. Cherry red lividity In individuals with a significant carboxyhemoglobin concentration in the blood (due to carbon monoxide exposure), the livor mois has a distinctive, bright, cherry red color. The affinity of carbon monoxide to bind to hemoglobin is 200-250% that of oxygen. Cyanide may also produce a bright red coloration of the blood and muscles of the body and has a characteristic bitter almond smell. 2. Epidural hematoma In burned bodies, epidural hematoma results from blood and marrow in the cancellous diploe of the skull boiling and being extruded by the intense heat, resulting in a brown, granular, and at times foamy or dried and flaky deposit in the epidural space. This is also a postmoem heat-related aifact and is easily distinguished from an antemoem epidural hematoma by the difference in color and texture. Fuhermore, antemoem hematomas are often associated with linear skull fractures, with injury to the middle meningeal aery. 3. Fire fractures Fire fractures are another postmoem heat-related aifact and should not be confused with antemoem injuries. Because of the extreme heat, the muscle, tendons, and soft tissue are charred, resulting in exposure of the underlying bones to heat, with resultant heat-induced fractures. Skull fractures are usually seen on the temporal bones, often radiating from a central point. The fractured edges are ragged and may cross suture lines, unlike antemoem fractures that usually terminate at suture lines. Additionally, these fractures may be of paial thickness, with exposure of the cancellous layer. 4. Lichtenberg figure, ferning, keraunopathy Keraunopathy is most generally the study of lightning-related injury, and the term is also used occasionally as synonymous with ferning, the arborizing pattern of skin discoloration seen on some bodies after a lightning strike. The finding can be seen on both living individuals surviving a lightning strike and those dying of it. The Lichtenberg figure is another term for this same finding. Lichtenberg figures, or ferning, on the human body can be transient, lasting hours to days, and their cause remains unclear. 5. Pugilistic attitude The burned body assumes what appears to be a boxer's stance. This is a postmoem aifact resulting from the effects of heat on the muscle protein: denaturation and dehydration. The flexors are bulkier than the extensors, and hence, the overall effect is one of contractures, with flexion at the elbows, wrists and knees. Often the joint spaces are exposed and the aiculating surfaces of the bones are charred. Pugilistic attitude as a result of heat-related contractures. In fire-related deaths, heat-induced contractures result in exposure of the peripheral joint spaces, with charring of the aiculating surface of the bones. 6. Skin splits Skin splits are usually seen on or near joint surfaces, the extensor surfaces of the extremities, and the head. These splits can extend to the underlying adipose and skeletal muscle, dependent on the intensity of the heat. These are also a postmoem aifact. The muscles split parallel to the long axes of the myofibers rather than across them. The soft-tissue splits may be full thickness, paicularly on the abdomen, resulting in charring of the exposed bowel surface. Skin and subcutaneous splits due to intense heat. 7. Soot Soot is an amorphous black material found in the airways (mouth, nares, trachea, bronchi) of individuals inhaling smoke during a fire. Its presence in the airways at autopsy indicates that the decedent was breathing and thus alive during the fire.",A

It generally incorporates a daily rate for each day the witness must attend in cou (with a one-day minimum), plus a travel allowance to allow the witness to get to the place of the hearing. Generally, conduct money must be delivered with the summons for it to have legal effect. Witnesses are generally entitled to additional conduct money if their attendance is required on more days than anticipated. Moreover, witnesses who are required to make an overnight stay to attend in cou on more than one day are generally entitled to an allowance for accommodation and meals. The rates for travel, daily attendance, accommodation and meals are generally set under a cou tariff, and are fixed for all witnesses. A witness may not refuse to appear merely because they believe the conduct money is insufficient to make up for their lost wages or actual travel expenses. Witnesses may be paid more, but the additional cost cannot be claimed against the losing pay - only the tariff amount can be recovered.

Rigor mois occurs due to: September 2008,Muscle of the body began to relax,Capillo-venous distension in the most dependent body pas,Muscle of the body began to stiffen,Mummification of the body tissues,"Ans. C: Muscle of the body began to stiffen A few hours after the death, the joints of the body stiffen and become locked in place. This stiffening is called rigor mois. Depending on temperature and other conditions, rigor mois lasts approximately 24- 48 hours in winter and 18-36 hours in summer. The phenomenon is caused by the skeletal muscles paially contracting. The muscles are unable to relax, so the joints become fixed in place Rigor mois can be used to help estimate time of death. The onset of rigor mois may range from 1-2 hours, depending on factors including temperature (rapid cooling of a body can inhibit rigor mois, but it occurs upon thawing). Maximum stiffness is reached around 12-24 hours post moem. It first stas in involuntary muscles (myocardium) Eyelids, neck and jaw muscles are affected first, with the rigor then spreading to other pas of the body. The joints are stiff but after some time general tissue decay and leaking of lysosomal intracellular digestive enzymes will cause the muscles to relax.",C

Which among the following finding is associated with Motorcyclist fracture?,Ring fracture,Sutural separation,Comminuted fracture of vault of skull,Fracture base of skull into anterior and posterior halves,"Motor cyclists fracture refers to fracture in which the base of the skull is divided into two halves each moving independently of each other like a hinge. In this, there is a transverse crack across the floor of the skull, crossing behind the greater wing of sphenoid bone, through the pituitary fossa to the opposite side. Another type of fracture seen following injury to motorcyclists is a ring fracture. Ring fracture around the foramen magnum is caused by an impact on the crown of the head. Tailgating or under running is seen in motorcyclists where a rider drives into the back of a truck or some other heavy vehicle. In such cases, motorcyclists head and shoulders are smashed against the tail board. Ref: Textbook of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology : Principles and Practice, 5/e By Krishan Vij page 300.",D

Marbling refers to,Pale look of the body,Vessels appearing as prominent lines,Greenish discoloration of the body,Degloving,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Vessels appearing as prominent lines * The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows:1) Colour changes# The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externallyand under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spread to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation ofsulph-meth-haemoglobin.# Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours.2) Formation of foul smelling gases# Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. S02, H2S, ammonia, methane and COv3) Effects of gases# Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs:i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth.ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrifactive blisters.iii) Emptying of heart due to pressure of gas.# In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmortem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmortem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time.4) Appearance of maggots# Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist parts of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc.# Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days.# Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death.# After further 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which convert into adult flies in next 3-5 days.# Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death.* Appearance of maggot determine the time since death.5) Other late changes# In 3-5 days: Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate.# In 7-12 days: Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs.# In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs.# Finally: Bones also decompose: Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years.6) Internal changes# Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver.# In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur.7) Floatation of body (if body is in water)# Floatation of body occurs due to accumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation.# Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter.# Factors affecting floatation are :i) Causing early floatation: Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water.ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still birth/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water.# Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air).",B

Pin point pupils are seen in all of the following conditions except: September 2005,Organophosphrous poisoning,Opiod poisoning,Cerebello pontine hemarroge,Datura poisoning,"Ans. D: Datura poisoning If the patient has bilateral pinpoint pupils consider the following possible etiologies: Opiate use/abuse/overdose such as Heroin, Fentanyl, Codeine, Methadone and Morphine stimulate the parasympathetic side of the autonomic nervous system and cause pupil constriction. Miosis in combination with depressed respirations are the hallmark signs of opiate overdose. Pontine Hemorrhage The pons is a knob-like structure located at the front of the brainstem. Intracranial hemorrhage in the area of the pons will typically cause bilateral pupil constriction. Intracranial hemorrhage can have both traumatic and atraumatic origins. Consider pontine hemorrhage in the presence of high mechanism head trauma and patients with a history of vascular disease, strokes and abnormal bleeding. Organophosphate / Chemical / Nerve Agent Exposure Organophosphate chemicals are the most common chemicals causing parasympathetic over-stimulation and, therefore, pinpoint pupils. These compounds are effective pesticides used in agriculture. They are widely used because they break down easily in the environment unlike their cousin DDT. Malathion and parathion are examples of organophosphate pesticides. These chemicals kill insects by disrupting their nervous system function. They can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled and ingested. Once absorbed they shut down acetylcholiesterase production and put the parasympathetic system into overdrive. This will create the classic SLUDGE presentation, characterized by excessive salivation, lacrimation (tears), urination, defecation and emesis. And two other telltale signs muscle cramps and pinpoint pupils. Pupils are widely dilated with loss of accommodation for near vision is seen in datura poisoning.",D
All tests are used for infanticide except-,Ploucquet test,Fodere's test,Gettler's test,Raygat's test,"Ref:Forensic medicine and toxicology (V.V.Pillay) 17th edition, page no.324 The Gettler&;s test or Cholride test is done by with drawing 10 ml of blood from each ventricle of the hea and subjecting in to estimation of chlorides. Normal value of chloride is 600mg% in both chambers. In sea water drowning, thre is said to be 30-40% increacse of chloride level in blood in left ventricle, while in fresh water drownin, the chloride get reduced by 505. this change is of course not evident by dry drowning. Ploucquet&;s Test:The blood flow in the lung beds is so increased after breathing that their weight is almost doubled, from 1/70 of the body weight before respiration to 1/35 after respiration. The increase in weight is not constant and is not a reliable indication of breathing. Fodere&;s test: The lung are ligated across their hila and separated. THe average weight of the both lungs before respiration varies from 30g to 40g, and after respiration from 60g to 66g. The increase in weight is due to the increased flow of blood. Raygat's test/hydrostatic test:The hydrostatic test is based on the principle that if the infant has breathed, the lung will float in water. each lung is cut into pieces and tested for floataion in water. A piece of liver is used as control. if the liver bit floats, the test has no meaning, it is clear that putrefaction has set in. If all the pieces of lung float, they are crushed under a weight and tested again. flaotion is positive when the baby has respired. But if the piece sink after pressure, no respiration has taken place. if some piece float while otherb sink, it mean feeble respiration taken place.",C

Arborescent burns are seen in: September 2009,Flame burns,Lightning stroke,Heat stroke,Electrocution,"Ans. B: Lightning stroke An almost pathognomonic cutaneous feature of lightning stroke is known as feathering/lightning prints/ Arborescent/ Filigree burns It comprises of linear, fernlike, superficial skin markings (also called keraunographic marks) that may disappear after 1-2 days. These cutaneous manifestations of lightning injury usually consist of erythematous streaks that do not blanch on diascopy. They are usually found over the shoulders or the flanks. Erythema begins to fade in 4-6 hours with no residual skin changes. This bizarre cutaneous manifestation is probably related to the flashover phenomenon, from the transmission of static electricity along the superficial vasculature. Recognition of this sign may save the life of an unaccompanied comatose patient and should signal the need for immediate resuscitation if a victim is not breathing and has no pulse. Joule burn (electric mark) is specific and diagnostic of contact with electricity and is found at the entry of the current.",B
Characteristic of incised wound are all except ?,Length of wound not correlated with weapon,Bleeding less than laceration,Hesitation cuts seen,Clean cut edges,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Bleeding less than laceration In incised wound, length of wound is longer than depth, bleeding is more as vessels are cut. There are clean cut edges and hesitation cuts are seen. Incised wound It is a clean cut through the tissues (usually, skin and subcutaneous tissue), caused by sharp-edged object, which is longer than its depth, when the weapon is struck or pressed and drawn across the body pa, i.e., there is pressure and friction. Examples of sharp edged object are knife, blade, razor, scalpel, sword, chopper etc. The characteristic features of incised wound are : Length is the greatest dimension (most impoant). Hair, hair bulb, nerve and vessels are cut bleeding is profuse as vessels are cut. Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines. Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut. Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation. Hesitation cuts (Tentative cuts or trial cuts) are characteristic features of suicidal attempt. Incised wound on nose, ear and genital are usually homicidal and are inflicted on account of jealously or revenge in case of adultery, causing disfiguration.",A

"Which metal results in Recurrent gouty attacks (""Saturnine Gout"") formation?",Cadmium,Lead,Beryllium,Mercury,"(B) Lead[?]LEAD is a heavy steel-grey metal & all it's salts are poisonous. Lead poisoning may be acute or chronic.oOne manifestation of chronic lead toxicity is the rheumatologic entity known as saturnine gout.oIllicitly distilled beverages may inadvertently contain harmful toxins, like metallic lead.oLead has been known to play a role in purine metabolism & renal insufficiency.CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF LEAD INTOXICATIONAcuteChronic*. GI effects-. colic, severe pain-. severe constipation*. Peripheral, central neuropathy*. Cardiac toxicity*. Acute encephalopathy*. Chronic nephropathy*. Acute nephropathy*. Saturnine gout*. In Children*. Reproductive effects*. Growth retardation*. Hypertension?*. Behavioural problems* Anemia[?]Chronic Lead Poisoning or Plumbism or Saturnism:oChronic lead poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg. of lead; Lead vapour is more dangerous than dust & it is a typical cumulative poison.[?]Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Lead Poisoning:oFacial Pallor: mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign due to vasospasm.oAnaemia: There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased.-Anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin.-Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism.-Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome.-Eosinophilia is more common than basophilic stippling. Porphyrins excreted in urine may be 500 micrograms per day.oLead Line: A stippled blue line, called Burtonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near dirty or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth.-A similar blue line may be seen in cases of poisoning by mercury, copper, bismuth, iron and silver.oColic and Constipation: It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe.-Individual attacks last only a few minutes, but may recur for several days or weeks. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur.oLead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases.-There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are particularly affected.-Muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected), are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected.-Paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles.-Recovery may be complete but is usually slow.oEncephalopathy: Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead.-Symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage.-Death occurs in about 25% cases.oCardiovascular System and Kidneys: Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypertension and permanent arteriolar degeneration. Chronic arteriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur.oReproductive System: Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenonhoea, I menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and abortion are, frequent. Abortion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months.oOther Systems: They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, vertigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead particles in the early phase of poisoning.",B

Which part is first involved by mummification?,Heart,Skin,Stomach,Muscles,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Skin Mummification* It is also a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of moisture. That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deserts, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil.* Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body parts like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation).* Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning favor mummification.* Medicolegal importance: (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

DNA is present in white blood cells of humans, but not red blood cells which lack nuclei. A dime-sized spot of blood, approximately 50 pi in volume, is enough DNA for a typical VNTR analysis.DNA from sperm heads is usually the most important source of DNA evidence for sexual assault cases. Five pi of semen contains approximately the same amount of DNA as 50 pi ofblood. Special extraction methods are required to release DNA from sperm heads.Saliva contains cellular material. DNA can be extracted from bite marks, cigarette butts, postage stamps on envelopes, and envelope flaps for DNA analysis. In fact, the ""Unabomber"" was convicted partially on DNA evidence from a letter-bomb he mailed that did not explode.The hair follicle at the base of human hairs contains cellular material rich in DNA. In order to be used for DNA analysis, the hair must have been pulled from the body -- hairs that have been broken off do not contain DNA.Any body tissue that has not been degraded is a potential source of DNA.Bone is one of the best sources of DNA from decomposed human remains.Like bones, teeth can also be an excellent source of DNA, long after the rest of the body has decomposed.Urine itself does not contain DNA, but it may contain epithelial cells, which do contain DNA. Most healthy individuals, however, do not excrete epithelial cells in their urine.",B

Algor mortis is -,Rise of body temperature after death,Cooling of body,Persistent body spasm,None,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cooling of body ALGOR MORTISo After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, covection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body,o Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death. There are varying opinions about rate of cooling of dead body:i) Most widely accepted view is that the rate of cooling in india (tropical countries) is 0.5-0.76 C/hour, so that body attains atmospheric temperature in 16-20 hours after death. In temperate climate, the rate of fall is about 1.5deg C/hour.As per another view, cooling is faster in initial period, when the temprature difference between body and atmosphere is maximum -First 30-45 minutes - No temperature fall (isothermic phase).First 1-6 hours - 1.5-2deg C/hour.6-12 hours - 0.9- 1.20 C/hour.After 12 hours - 0.4-0.60 C/hour.Rate of cooling is related to difference in temperature and its surroundings (environment). In the first 2 hours average rate fall of temperature is roughly half this difference. In next 2 hours the temperature fall is at half this rate and in subsequent 2 hours, at quarter this rate.Most common site for recording temperature is the rectum. Thermameter is inserted in rectum around 8-10 cm for 2 minutes. Other sites for recording temperture are nose, ear (external auditory meatus), vagina and under liver.o Medicolegal importance of algor mortis -It is a sign of death.Time since death may be determined and and algor mortis is the most important indicator to determine the time since death during first 24 hours.",B

Cyanide poisoning acts by -,Inhibiting DNA synthesis,Inhibiting enzymes of proteins synthesis,Inhibiting cellular respiration,Inhibiting protein break down,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin. Samples to be preserved for chemical analysis * Blood * Routine viscera * Lung * Brain * Hea * Spleen is considered as best specimen due to presence of more RBCs.

Rigor mortis in human body starts at,Upper limb,Face muscles,Neck muscles,Eyelids,"Ans. d (Eyelids)RIGOR MORTIS# Ordinarily, death is followed immediately by total muscular relaxation - primary muscular flaccidity - succeeded in turn by generalised muscular stiffening - rigor mortis.# After a variable period of time rigor mortis passes off spontaneously; followed by secondary muscular flaccidity.# The first investigation on rigor mortis is attributed to Nysten in 1811.# No measurable shortening of muscle occurs during rigor mortis unless the muscles are subjected to tension.# The view that the development of rigor mortis could produce significant movements of the body was promoted by Sommer, in about 1833, and the postulated movements became known as ""Sommer's movements"". For this reason, when a body is found in a certain position with rigor mortis fully developed, it cannot be assumed that the deceased necessarily died in that position.# Rigor involves voluntary and involuntary muscles.# Contraction of the arrectores pilorum muscles during rigor may result in ""goose-flesh"" or ""cutis anserina"". The phenomenon is commonly seen in cases of drowning where it is thought to result from an agonal contraction of the muscles.# Involvement of walls of seminal vesicles by rigor may lead to discharge of seminal fluid at the glans penis.# In individuals who have been exhausted or starved before death, the glycogen stores in muscle are low, so that rigor may develop rapidly.# Typically, rigor is first apparent in small muscles of eyelids, lower jaw and neck, followed by the limbs.# It is generally accepted that rigor mortis passes off in the same order in which it develops.# In temperate climates rigor will typically start to disappear at about 36-48 hours after death. However, if the environ- mental temperature is high then the development of putrefaction may completely displace rigor within 9-12 hours of death.# Accelerated putrefaction resulting from ante-mortem septicaemia may lead to a rapid displacement of rigor.# Exposure of a body to intense heat results in heat stiffening due to coagulation of the muscle proteins. Unlike rigor mortis, heat stiffening is associated with muscle shortening resulting in the characteristic pugilistic posture of burned bodies.# Freezing of a body will cause stiffening of the muscles, postponing the development of rigor which is said to developed as soon as thawing of the body permits.",D

Alkalinization of urine is done in which of the following drug poisoning? (),Amphetamine,Morphine,Phenobarbitone,Digoxin,"Most drugs taken in overdose are extensively detoxified by the liver to produce inactive metabolites which are voided in the urine. Sometimes hepatic degradation produces active metabolites, but the secondary compounds are then conveed to non-toxic derivatives. Under these circumstances, forced diuresis is inappropriate. The procedure should be undeaken only if the following conditions are satisfied: # A substantial propoion of the drug is excreted unchanged. # The drug is distributed mainly in the extracellular fluid. # The drug is minimally protein-bound. # Principle-- Most drugs are weak electrolytes and exist paly as undissociated molecules at physiological pH. The extent of ionisation is a function of the ionisation constant of the drug (Ka for both acids and bases), and the pH of the medium in which it is dissolved. Ionisation constants are usually expressed in the form of their negative logarithm, pKa. Hence the pKa scale is analogous to the pH notation : the stronger an acid the lower its pKa, and the stronger a base the higher its pKa. Thus when pKa = pH, the concentrations of ionised and non-ionised drugs are equal. Cell membranes are most permeable to substances that are lipid soluble and in the non-ionised, rather than the ionised form. Thus the rate of diffusion from the renal tubular lumen back into the circulation is decreased when a drug is maximally ionised. Because ionisation of acidic drugs is increased in an alkaline environment, and that of basic drugs is increased in an acid solution, manipulation of the urinary pH enhances renal excretion. # Forced alkaline diuresis : This is most useful in the case of phenobarbitone, lithium, and salicylates. Administer 1500 ml of fluid IV, in the first hour as follows : - 500 ml of 5% dextrose - 500 ml of 1.2 or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate - 500 ml of 5% dextrose. # Forced acid diuresis : Forced acid diuresis is no longer recommended for any drug or poison, including amphetamines, strychnine, quinine or phencyclidine.

Leading questions can be asked in which pa of interrogation: September 2011,Direct examination,Re-direct examination,Cross examination,Anytime during examination,"Ans. C: Cross examination In stage of direct examination/ examination in chief, no leading questions are allowed except in those cases in which the judge is satisfied that a witness is hostile (hostile witness is one who purposely makes statement contrary to facts) Leading examination are allowed in cross-examination At re-examination, leading questions are not allowed Leading question/ suggestive interrogation It is a question that suggests the answer or contains the information the examiner is looking for. For example, this question is leading: You were at Jacky's bar on the night of July 15, weren't you? It suggests that the witness was at Jacky's bar on the night in question. The same question in a non-leading form would be: Where were you on the night of July 15? This form of question does not suggest to the witness the answer the examiner hopes to elicit. Leading questions may often be answerable with a yes or no (though not all uyes-no questions are leading). Depending on the circumstances leading questions can be objectionable or proper. The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the pay conducting the examination. An examiner may generally ask leading questions of a hostile witness or on cross examination, but not on dire t examination. It is impoant to distinguish between leading questions and loaded questions: questions that are objectionable because they contain implicit assumptions. The classic example is: Have you stopped beating your wife? This type of question is not leading, as it does not suggest that the examiner expects any paicular answer. It is however objectionable because it assumes (among other things) that the witness (1) was married and (2) had in fact beaten his wife in the past, facts which (presumably) have not been established.",C

Neurotoxic It includes elapids, i.e. cobra, krait and coral snake. Krait is the most common poisonous snake in india. These have minimal reaction locally, but produce strong neurotoxicity. They act on motor nerve cells, resembling poisoning with curare. There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C.

Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). 2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). 3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. 4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). 5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). 6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B. Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. C. Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D. Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",D

Fatal dose of methanol is?,15 ml,150 ml,500 ml,650 ml,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 150 ml * Methanol is highly toxic alcohol. It is metabolized to formaldehyde (by alcohol dehydrogenase) and formic acid (by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase). It can be present in contaminated country liquor used to denature ethanol.* It is the accumulation of formic acid which causes toxic effects in methanol poisoning. Accumulation of formic acid results in lactic acidosis/high anion gap metabolic acidosis with low plasma bicarbonates, blindness due to retinal damage, papilledema and optic atrophy.* Symptoms of poisoning are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, confusion, headache, abdominal pain, respiratory depression, cyanosis, acute tubular necrosis, hypothermia, fixed dilated pupils, visual distrubance (blurring of vision; photophobia) and odor of spirit in breath. Fatal dose in adults is 60-240 ml in adults, but as little as 15 ml can cause blindness.* Methanol poisoning can be treated by supportive measures, gastric lavage and sodium bicarbonate (to treat acidosis) ethanol is useful because it competitively inhibits the conversion of methanol to formic acid. Fomepizole can also be used as it is a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. Folic acid or folinic acid enhance the metabolism of formic acid to C02.

Reliable method of identification of person is ?,Gustafson's method,Galton method,Scar,Anthropometry,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Galton method Galton method or Finger prints or dactylography is the best system of identification till date. The fingerprints are capable of endless variation so that there is one chance in sixty four billions of two persons having identical prints. Dactylography / Dermatoglvphics / Galton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). Inpractice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweatgland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very usefulwhen only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed.",B

Which of the gustafson's parameter is the most accurate ?,Attrition,Periodontosis,Root resorption,Transperency of the tooth,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Trnasperency of the tooth Age from teeth after 20 years Teeth eruption is useful for age estimation upto about 18 years, beyond which it is just a guess work. The methods used are :? A) Gustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel). Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent pa of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis). Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, sta from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde). Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root sta at apex and extend upward (may be pathological). Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria). B) Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency. Q Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at bih (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination. D) Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",D

Most common organ affected in u nderwater blast -,Intestine,Liver,Spleen,Heart,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intestine o The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine.Explosion injuryo An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factorsBlast or shock waveWhen an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviomment in which blast occursAir blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid-'solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal. fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.Flame or hot gasesBums or burning of body may occur.Flying missiles (debris)Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.AnoxiaVarious gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2",A

Death is unusual and may occur d/t hea failure. 4. Heat stroke - (heat hyperpyrexia, sub stroke) - It is due to impairment of body's heat regulating mechanism caused by failure of cutaneous circulation & sweating, following prolonged exposure to hot, humid conditions. - The onset is usually sudden with sudden collapse and loss of consciousness. Predominant symptoms may also be seen (i.e. headache, nausea, vomitting, dizziness, mental confusion, muscle cramps, excessive thirst, excessive desire to micturate) - The skin is dry, hot and flushed with complete absence of sweating - Body temperature rises as high as 43degC (hence k/a hyperpyrexia) when body temp. rises above 42degC vasodilation occurs with decrease in blood volume leading to circulatory collapse and cardiac failure. - Delirium and convulsions may precede death. - Moality rate in this condition is relatively high. - Fatal period varies from few minutes to 3 days.",C

Chronic exposure to cobalt in the form of inhalation results in hard metal lung disease, characterised by pulmonary fibrosis and an obstructive airway syndrome. It can induce or exacerbate asthma. 3. Regular consumption of beer to which cobalt chloride or sulfate has been added (to enhance foaming) over a period of time can result in cardiomyopathy, referred to as beer drinker's hea which carries a relatively high moality of nearly 50%. 4. Dermal contact can cause ""cobalt itch"" or ""carboloy-itch"" (an allergic erythematous papular eruption). Chronic exposure can cause nerve deafness and optic atrophy. 5. Ingestion of magnets can cause acute cobalt toxicity. 6. Cobalt exposure has also been linked to an increased risk of cancer.",A
Greenish discoloration of the body first seen in the right iliac fossa after death is due to formation of ?,Sulph hemoglobin,Meth hemoglobin,Sulph - meth hemoglobin,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Sulph - meth hemoglobin Signs of putrefaction The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows :? 1. Colour changes The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin. Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours. 2. Formation of foul smelling gases Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO, , H2S, ammonia, methane and CO2. 3. Effects of gases Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs : i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth. ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrefactive blisters. iii) Emptying of hea due to pressure of gas. In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmoem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmoem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time. 4. Appearance of maggots Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist pas of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After fuher 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which conve into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death. 5. Other late changes In 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate. In 7-12 days : Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs. In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs. Finally : Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years. 6. Internal changes Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver. In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur. 7. Floatation of body (if body is in water) Floatation of body occurs due to occumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :- i) Causing early.floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water. ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still bih/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water. Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air).",C
Discoloration after death is first seen in?,Dependent parts,Scalp,Face,Arms,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Dependent parts o It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:1) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.2) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.3) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.",A

Takayama test is to detect,Identification of source of hair,Nature of stain,Detection of species,Blood group,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Nature of stain * The examination of blood and blood stains is an important part of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are: (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)* To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used:1) Chemical tests# These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present.# This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases.# Thus these tests are based on H2O2 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are:i) Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.ii) Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.iii) Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.iv) Guaiacum test: Blue colour.v) Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.vi) Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.2) Microchemical tests# These tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals.# The tests are:1) Teichmann's haemin crystal test.2) Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.3) Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.3) Spetroscopy# It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.4) Microscopy# Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)* For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are:1) Precipitin test2) Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).3) Gel diffusion test.4) Double diffusion test.5) Precipitation electrophoresis.6) Latex agglutination test.7) Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood stain* These tests are:1) Immunological (serological): (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test.2) Enzymological methods.3) Latte's crust method.",B

Black foot disease is caused by,Arsenic,Cadmium,Lead,Mercury,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Arsenic Chronic arsenic exposure can cause 'black foot disease' a severe form of peripheral vascular disease, causing gangrene of lower limbs. Arsenic poisoning may be acute or chronic. Acute arsenic poisoning It can present in any of the two ways : Gastrointestinal type : It is the common form and resembles bacterial gastroenteritis (e.g. cholera). There is garlic adour with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and necrosis of intestinal mucosa. There is tenesmus and anal irritation. Dehydration may cause acute circulatory collapse, with hypotension, oliguria and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fulminant narcotic form : Large dose of arsenic is rapidly absorbed without producing GI symptoms. These are giddiness, headache, myalgia, formication, veigo and death in 2-3 hours. Postmoem appearance include : Red velvety mucosa of stomach and submucous petechial haemorrhage. Subendocardial petechial haemorrhage. Fatty degeneration of liver, kidney and hea. Chronic arsenic poisoning Chronic arsenic poisoning has four stages : First stage (nutritional and gastrointestinal disturbances) : The earliest sign is gradual emaciation. There is loss of appetite, nausea and intermittent vomiting and diarrhea. Second stage (catarrhal changes) : It resembles common cold, i.e. conjunctivitis, running nose and eyes, coughing etc. Third stage (skin rash) : There is classical 'rain drop pigmentation', i.e. patchy brown pigmentation of skin. At initial stages, there is a vesicular eruption which may resemble nettle rash. Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles occur. There are white transverse bands crossing the nails, known as Mee's line, and indicate periods of arrested growth due to interference with normal metabolism. There is alopecia and exfoliative dermatitis. Fouh stage (nervous disturbances) : There is sensory and motor (i.e. mixed) polyneuropathy, with painful paresthesia of hands and feet and muscle tenderness. There may be evidence of liver (fatty liver) and kidney damage and bone marrow suppression (causing anemia and other cytopenias). Hea may also be involved. Chronic arsenic exposure can also cause 'black foot disease' a severe form of peripheral vascular disease, causing gangrene of lower limbs. Arsenic is carcinogenic, can cause cancers of skin (squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma), lung, liver, bladder, kidney, larynx and lymphoid system (leukemia).",A

Age of a person from study of characteristics of teeth can be made by all of the following methods except -,Gustafson method,Mile method,Boyde method,Frame method,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Frame method Age from teeth after 20 yearso Teeth eruption is useful for age estimation upto about 18 years, beyond which it is just a guess work. The methods used areGustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues.1. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel).2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis).3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis.4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde).5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological).6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria).Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency.C) Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination.D) Stack's method : Age of infant can be known from height and weight of erupting teeth.",D

The major factor that influence the onset and duration of algor mois is,Muscle built of the person,Environmental temperature,Poisoning,Age,"Factors Affecting Algor Mois : i. Environmental temperature (major factor): Rate of fall of body temperature is directly propoional to the difference between the temperature of the dead body and the environmental temperature. ii. Air movement: Air movement over the surface of the dead body causes a quick fall of temperature due to increased evaporation of body fluids. iii. Humidity: Cooling is more rapid in a humid rather than in a dry atmosphere, since moist air is better conductor of heat. iv. Media of disposal: Cooling is earliest in water, and late in buried bodies. The ratio of the rates of fall of temperature in the three media, water:air: soil = 4:2:1. The rate is thus maximum in water, moderate in air and minimum in a buried body. v. Built of cadaver: Obese bodies cool slowly, and lean bodies rapidly, since fat is a bad conductor of heat. vi. Age and sex: Rate of loss of heat is more in children and the elderly, compared to adults because the surface area of the body is more in relation to the body volume. Females retain body heat for a comparatively longer period because of their subcutaneous fatty tissue. vii. Clothing or coverings of the body: A well-covered body retains heat for a longer period as compared to a naked or thinly clothed body, as clothes are bad conductors of heat.",B

Posthumous child is:,Child delivered after death of biological mother,Child delivered after death of biological father,Bom after death of parents,Has been abandoned by parents,"(B) Child delivered after death of biological father[?]POSTHUMOUS CHILD: A child born after the death of its fatheroMother being conceived by the said father.oLegal issues involved includes:1. Legitimacy, 2. Inheritance of property, 3. Compensation case for slander against the mother.[?]LEGITIMACY & PATERNITYoLegitimacy: It is the legal state of a person born in lawful marriage.oAccording to section S.112, I.E.A, if at all a person is born during the continuance of a legal marriage, or within 280 days after the dissolution of the marriage by divorce or death of the husband, his birth is presumed to be legitimate.oIllegitimate or Bastard Child: if it can be proved that the husband could not possibly be the father of child by producing evidence that the alleged father.oQuestion of legitimacy arises in the following conditions:1. Inheritance: Remember! A legitimate child only can inherit the property of his father & DNA fingerprinting will positively fix or exclude paternity.2. Supposititious or Fictitious Children: Whenever a woman may1. Pretend pregnancy & delivery & later produce a living child as her own2. She may substitute a male child for female child born of her3. For an abortion-These things are done for obtaining money or for the purpose of claiming property.-Other legal issues involved are blackmailing a man or bringing a charge of breech of promise of marriage against a man. In such cases, the woman should be examined for signs of pregnancy and delivery.-In these cases, medical evidence is useful only when the age of the supposititious child does not correspond to the date of the pretended delivery.-DNA fingerprinting will be conclusive.3. Paternity: Remember, that the question of paternity arises in contests (i) Over legitimacy, (ii) Posthumous births, or (iii) Supposititious children.-Paternity is determined from:-Parental likeness: Child may resemble father (in feature, figure, gesture & other personal peculiarities) - Regarded as corroborative evidence only.-Atavism: Child does not resemble its parents, but resembles grandparents. (Due to inheritance of characteristics & due to genes)-Developmental Defects: Like disease or deformities (transmitted from parents to children).-Blood Group Tests or Paternity Tests: Because, blood groups are transmitted from the parents to children-DNA fingerprintingImportant Terminology to be Remembered!oMantle Child: A child born out of wedlock and later legitimated when the parents get married, traditionally by standing under a cloak with the parents during the marriage ceremony.oNatural child: A child by birth as distinguished from an adopted child.oNeglected child: A child whose parents or legal custodians are unfit to care for him or her because of cruelty, immorality or incapacity.-Capacity in this context could be physical or economic.oLegal Problems Artificial Insemination:-No statutory law in India for artificial insemination.-Remember! Artificial insemination with the semen of the husband is justifiable and unobjectionable.-The following are the legal aspects of A.I.D. as applicable to India.1. Adultery: Donor and recipient cannot be held guilty of adultery in India, as S. 497, I.PC.2. Legitimacy: Husband is not the actual father of the child which is illegitimate & cannot inherit property3. Nullity of Marriage & Divorce: Mere Artificial insemination is not ground for nullity of marriage or divorce.4. Natural Birth: Artificial inseminated child remains illegitimate unless A.I. child is adopted, when there is a natural born child (remains legitimate)5. Unmarried Woman or Widow: May have a child from A.I. but that child would be illegitimate.6. Incest: Risk of incest between children born by A.I and children of donor (It is not an offence in India).oSurrogate Motherhood: Legal problems of Surrogate motherhood are similar to those of Artificial insemination donor.",B
Latte's crust of blood stain is used to detect ?,Nature of stain,Detection species,Blood group,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Blood group Blood and blood stains The examination of blood and blood stains is an impoant pa of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are : (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group. Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not) To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used : 1. Chemical tests These tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide conves colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are : Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour. Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test) : Deep permanganate colour. Leucomalachite green test : Bluish green or peacock blue colour. Guaiacum test : Blue colour. Ohotoludine test (kohn test) : Blue or green colour. Amidopyrine test : Purple colour. 2. Microchemical tests These tests are based on propey of haem pa of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are : Teichmann's haemin crystal test. Takayama hemochromogen crystal test. Luminal spray test : It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains. Spetroscopy It is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives give characteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope. 4. Microscopy Microscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains. Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal) For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are : Precipitin test Haemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test). Gel diffusion test. Double diffusion test. Precipitation electrophoresis. Latex agglutination test. Isoenzyme method (enzymological test). Detection of blood group of blood stain These tests are : Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutination test, (iv) latex test.

"If the hemoglobin is saturated with carbon monoxide, the hypoxia involved will be: March 2007",Hypoxic hypoxia,Stagnant hypoxia,Anaemic hypoxia,Histotoxic hypoxia,"Ans. C: Anaemic hypoxia When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it takes the place of oxygen in hemoglobin Levels of carbon monoxide bound in the blood can be determined by measuring carboxyhemoglobin, which is a stable complex of carbon monoxide and hemoglobin. The affinity between carbon monoxide and hemoglobin is 240 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen. CO binds to hemoglobin, producing carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. This inhibits the transpo, delivery, and utilization of oxygen. This causes hemoglobin to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. Levels of oxygen available for tissue use are decreased. This situation is described as CO shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Blood oxygen content is actually increased in the case of carbon monoxide poisoning; because all the oxygen is in the blood, none is being given to the tissues, and this causes anemic hypoxic. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin (reducing oxygen transpoation), myoglobin (decreasing its oxygen storage capacity), and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (inhibiting cellular respiration). Hallmark pathological change following CO poisoning is bilateral necrosis of the pallidum. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when conveed to carboxyhemoglobin, so a casualty of CO poisoning is described as looking pink-cheeked and healthy. The main medical treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is breathing 100% oxygen.",C

Treatment of choice for opioid poisoning is?,Oral naltrocene,IV Nalxone,Oral diazepam,Oral buprenorphine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., IV Naloxone Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into: -A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)o Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependenceo Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.(a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following:1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should he kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylate(b) Maintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria ' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of ex-opioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",B

WHO definition of abdominal obesity is ?,Waist - hip ratio > 0.80 in females,Waist - hip ratio > 0.85 in females,Waist - hip ratio > 0.90 in females,Waist - hip ratio > 0.95 in females,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Waist - hip ratio > 0.85 in females Assessment of obesity Following parameters are used to assess obesity :? 1) Skin fold thickness (SFT) Since it is most accessible, SFT is the most common method used to assess obesity. Measurements are taken at 4 sites : mid triceps (best site), biceps, subscapular and suprailiac regions. The sum of measurements _ 50 mm in girls and 240 mm in boys indicate obesity. At single mid triceps level (best site to measure SFT), thickness 18 mm in boys and 32 mm in girls indicate obesity. The instrument used to estimate SFT is Harpenden skin callipers. 2) Waist circumference (WC) and Waist / Hip ratio (WHR) These are good predictors for metabolic complications and risk of cardiovascular disease. The cut-off for waist circumference is 102 cms in boys (for India 90 cms) and 88 cms in girls (for India . 80 cms). WHR > 1.0 in men and > 0.85 in women indicates obesity and abdominal fat accumulation. 3) Waist-Height ratio (WHtR) It is the best indicator of cardiovascular risk. It is independent of age and sex. Cut-off value is 0.5. 4) Indices based on weight and/or height These are :? i) Body mass index (Qetelet's index) It is used internationally as reference standard for assessing the prevalence of obesity. It is dependent both on height and weight (has been explained earlier). ii) Ponderal index It is dependent both on height and weight. It is defined as height (cm) divided by cube root of weight (kg).",B

A rickshaw tyre passed on a 8 year old child. Tyre marks were found on the body. This is an exmaple of :,Percolated bruise,Imprint abrasion,Contusion,Patterned bruise,"Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury. Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. In abrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged. Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated with abrasions. In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also which are usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too. Also know? Abrasions are of following types Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents. Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'. 'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface. 3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impact with a rough object. The .former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligature mark, nail and Muir& mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries.",B

Bullet which is left inside the body for long is referred to as ?,Souvenir bullet,Tracer bullet,Tumbling bullet,Tandem bullet,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Souvenir bullet Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose. Varieties of bullets are :- Incendiary (igniting) bullet : The tip of bullet contains self igniting material e.g. barium nitrate and powdered aluminium and magnesium (in the past, phosphorus was used), so that it catches fire on hitting the target. It is used to cause fire in usually inflammable targets like fuel tanks (of air crafts etc). Explosive bullet : The tip contains a detonator or lead azide, so that the bullet explodes on hitting the target. Dum-dum bullet (expanding bullet): It is a jacketed bullet with is nose tip chiseled or cut off. It is designed to increase in diameter and expand upon striking the target, thus producing larger diameter wounds of limited penetration. Tandem bullet (Piggey tail bullet) : It is called one-behind-other bullet because two bullets are ejected one after the other, when first bullet failed to leave the burrel and is ejected by subsequently fired bullet. Therefore, both enter body through same enterance wound (some times, they may enter through different entries), but the wounds of exit are always two. Tandem (Duplex) caridge is one in which two bullets are present in same caridge. It is used in military rifles. Tracer bullet: It leaves a trace in atmosphere along the path so that a person (gunner) can observe the strike. Burning of barium nitrate produces flame and powdered magnesium along with strontium nitrate are added to give red color to the flame. Tumbling bullet : One that rotates in end on end during its motion. Yawning bullet : One which travels in an irregular fashion and causes a key hole entery wound. Yaw means detion between long axis of bullet and the axis of path of bullet. Souvenir bullet : A bullet left in body for long time and is surrounded by fibrous tissue. Frangile bullet : Designed to fragment upon impact. Mushrooming of bullet : A soft nose bullet, an hitting the target may get deformed to assume the shape of a mushroom.",A

Which of the following is not abrasion?,Graze,Scratches,Impact,Avulsion,"Ans. is d i.e., Avulsion Types of abrasion are : ? 1) Scratches (linear abrasion) : It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e.g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc. Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch. 2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion) : It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e.g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) : Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion) : It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface. It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",D

Sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animalis-,Bestiality,Cunnilingus,Tribadism,Sin ofgomorrah,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Bestiality o Section 377 IPC defines unnatural sexual offences as sexual intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal and lays down punishment for the same. These offences are sodomy, buccal coitus, tribadism (lesbianism), and bestiality'.Sodomyo Sodomy is sexual intercourse through anus. It is of two types : Homosexual and Heterosexual. In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is knowm as active agent and the person, on wrhom the act is done, is known as passive agent. If the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is knowTi as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile,o Examination findings of sodomy areIn active agent: (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis.In passive agent: Passive agent may beHabitual: (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated ana! opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening.Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence ofsemen in anus is the only confirmatery evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior part of anus (in sudden violence).Other unnatural sexual offenceso Bestiality: is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal.o Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality): Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia.

Killing of a 6 months old child by parents is known as -,Genocide,Infanticide,Neonatal homicide,Abortion,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Infanticide * Infanticide refers to killing a child after delivery, to till 1 year after birth. Infanticide in India is considered equivalent to murder and is tried under section 302IPC. Law considers every child as born dead and therefore in a case of infanticide, it has to be proved that the child was born alive and was then killed. Thus the first question in the investigation of a case of infanticide is, whether the child was still born or dead born or whether it was born live.* Still born : A still-born child is one which is born after 28 weeks of pregnancy and did not show sign of life after being completely born (i.e. he remains still -> so still birth). Child was alive in utero just before delivery but died during the process of birth.* Abortion refers to expulsion of the product of conception at any period of gestation before full term. Abortions may be1) Natural (spontaneous/accidental) abortion : Occurs naturally or spontaneously without any intervention.2) Artificial abortion : It occurs as results of direct interference with the pregnancy. Artificial abortion mayi) Legal (justifiable) abortion : It comes under medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) act.ii) Criminal abortion : It is illegal.",B

Brush burn is a type of?,Bruise,Contusion,Laceration,Abrasion,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Abrasion o Abrasion is a superficial injury involving superficial layer of epidermis and is caused by hard, blunt and rough object due to friction between skin and the object. Scab or crust is formed over exposed raw surface and most injuries heal without scar as they are superficial.o Age of abrasion can be calculated by following changes:-# Fresh:Reddish# 12-24 hours:Scab forms, which is red in colour# 2-3 days:Reddish brown Scab# 4-7 days:Abrasion starts healing (epithelization) from periphery# 7-10 days:Scab dries up and falls off# 10-12 days:Healing is complete (skin colour returns to normal)o Type of abrasion are:-1) Scratches (linear abrasion):# It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e.g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc.# Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch.2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion):# It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e.g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves.# A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash).# Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark.3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) :# Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer).# It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin.# Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks.4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion):# It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface.# It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",D

Brain death is said to occur if there is: March 2008,Absent spinal reflexes,Coical death following widespread brain injury,Absence of brainstem reflexes,Core temperature of the body is below 35 degree C,"Ans. C: Absence of brainstem reflexes Brainstem is responsible for the respiratory drive and mostly for the maintenance of BP. All motor outputs from the brain travel through the brainstem. Apa from smell and vision. All sensory traffic coming into the brain comes through the brainstem. The brainstem also mediates the cranial nerve reflexes. Hence a properly functioning brain stem is a precondition for full consciousness. Irreversible brain damage and loss of brain function, is evidenced by cessation of breathing and other vital reflexes (mediated by brain stem), unresponsiveness to stimuli, absence of muscle activity, and a flat electroencephalogram for a specific length of time.",C

Hemoperfusion with charcoal is useful in poisoning with which of the following?,Barbiturate poisoning,Methyl alcohol,Lithium,Ethylene glycol,"Hemoperfusion is used in poisoning with lipid soluble drugs such as barbiturates, glutethimide and theophylline. Hemoperfusion is the technique of passing blood through a bed of paicles contained within a device to which blood lines and a blood pump are attached. It differs from hemodialysis in that blood comes in direct contact with the membrane coated sorbent paicle and not a continuous dialysis membrane, from plasma pharesis in that no plasma is separated from blood. Clinical indications of hemoperfusion: Poisoning (drug and chemical exposure), hepatic failure (drug induced, fulminant hepatic failure), treatment of uremia and its complications (aluminium toxicity). Poisoning by water soluble drugs such as lithium and chemicals which cause acidosis (methanol, ethylene glycol, salicylate) are best treated with hemodialysis.

The test in which weight of lungs is compared with body wreight is/are: (PGI Dec 2008),Fodere'sTest,Ploucquet's Test,Raygat'sTest,Wredtn Test,"Ans: B (Ploucquet's Test) In Ploucquet test, wt of lung is compared with body wt before respiration & after respiration in live birth.Sings of Live birth - Tests UsedPloucquet's Test Q : The blood flow in the lung bed is so increased after breathing that their weight is almost doubled from 1/70 of the body weight before respiration to 1/35 after respiration. The increase in weight is not constant & is not a reliable indication of breathing.Foidere's Test or Static test Q: The lung are ligated across their hi la & separated. The average weight of both lungs before respiration are 30-40 gram & after respiration 60 to 66 gram. The increase in weight is due to increased flow of blood.Hydrostatic (or Raygafs) testQ: It is based on fact that on breathing, the volume of lung is increased, which more than compensates the weight of the additional blood, due to which their specific gravity is dimtnshed. The specific gravity of lung before respiration varies from 1040 to 1050 & after respiration about 940.This test is not necessary when-the foetus is monster, the foetus is macerated or mummified, the foetus is born before 180 days of gestation, the stomach contain milk & umblical cord has separated & a scar has formed.Wredin's testQ Change in Middle ear): With respiration air replaces the gelatinous substances, which found before birth, in few hours to five weeks.Breslau's second life test or stomach bowel test : If respiration takes place, stomach & intestine floats in water otherwise they sink. This is known as Breslau's second life test.Vagims Lfterinus : Child may breathe while it is in womb, after the rupture of the membrane.Vagitus vaginalis : Child may breathe while its head is in vagina.

Teeth bite marks are a type of: March 2011,Contusion,Pressure abrasion,Graze,Linear abrasion,"Ans. B: Pressure Abrasion Teeth marks in biting and ligature marks in hanging and strangulation are example of imprint, pressure or contact abrasion Abrasion It as also known as - Graze or Scratch or Impression. An abrasion is a superficial injury to the skin which involves the loss of superficial epithelial layer (Uppermost layers of the cells of skin) of skin. Abrasions are produced by ? - Blow - Fall on some rough and hard substance - Dragging as in vehicular accidents. - Scratching with finger nails, bites and thorns etc. - Friction on some hard substance. Pressure of rope or cord as is found in strangulation and hanging etc. - Rubbing. - Indenting of the objects. Varieties of Abrasions Scratches- They are due to a sharp or a pointed object pressing across the skin, moving the surface layers in front of it and causing the heaping up of layers of skin. Grazes- They are modified scratches. - In this, the broader surface of skin comes in contact with the uneven rough object. - In this, the depth may vary at different places. - The direction is indicated by presence of clean commencement and tag at the finishing end. Impact Abrasions/Pressure Abrasions - They are also known as ""Imprint abrasions"". - They are caused by the stamping of some object against the skin like radiators of cars in vehicular accidents or - They may be caused by pressure on the skin which is accompanied by movements as found in? Ligature in cases of hanging or strangulation. Injuries caused by lashes with whip Sites of Abrasions ? The abrasions resulting from friction against rough surface during a fall are generally found on the bony pas and are accompanied with contusions or lacerations The abrasions caused by finger nails are seen on the exposed of body like - Face near forearm, hands, thighs etc. They are cresentric in shape, when finger nails are used. Ecchymosis is a common accompaniment. The abrasions caused by teeth bite are elliptical or circular in shape and often present separate marks.

Incised looking laceration is seen at ?,Forehead,Hand,Thorax,Abdomen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture) Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized poions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are :? i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed). ii) Site of injury is the site of impact. iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue. iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface. There are following types of laceration : ? 1) Split laceration : Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound. 2) Strech lacerations : Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. 3) Avulsion (shearing laceration) : An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a poion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area). 4) ears : Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching. 5) Cut laceration : Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument.",A

This is so because action alobe doesnot amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and conse- quences of his conduct on that occasion. The lawr presumes such maturity in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation.

In civil cases, it is paid by the pay calling him, at the time of serving the summon. Judge decides the conduct money in civil case. The summon in civil case can be ignored if conduct money is not sanctioned or if the amount is less, and the witness can bring the fact to notice of judge. In criminal cases, no money is paid along with summon. The witness can ask for it, after giving evidence, but he should not insist if the cou is not willing to sanction, since otherwise he can be charged for contempt of cou. To an independent doctor it is always paid (known as bhatta), while the doctor in government service, can claim from his office. In case, two or more summons are received for the same date and time, the principles for preference of summon are: Criminal case is preferred over civil case. If both cases are criminal/civil, summon from higher cou is preferred. If both cases are criminal/civil and from cou of same status, summon received earlier is preferred.

Compound used as primer in weapon is,Potassium chlorate,Sulphur,Potassium nitrate,Nitrocellulose,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Potassium chlorate Cartridge (round)* Cartridge is the ammunition used in firearms. Cartridge consists of (i) Cartridge case, (ii) Propellant (gun powder), (iii) Projectile (missile) and (iv) Wads (only in shotguns.).1) Cartridge case# It is the outer shell or covering of the cartridge. In shotgun it is cylinderical. Base is of brass and rest of it is of cardboard or plastic. In rifled weapons, it is tapering and whole of it is made of brass or steel.# Center of base has percussion cap (detonator cap) which has sensitive composition, i.e. primer, consisting of potassium chlorate, antimony sulphide, mercury fulminate, barium nitrite, lead peroxide or tetrazene.# In all weapons, after firing, the cartridge case remains in the barrel and it is to be taken out manually (shotgun, revolvers, rifle) or it is ejected out automatically, e.g. in pistals.2) Propellent (gun powder)# It propels the projectile (missile) forward. It is composed of black powder or smokeless powder in the form of grains, pellets, thin cylindrical cords or flakes. Its ignition results in formation of expanding hot gases under pressure which (gas pressure) propels the projectile (missile) by providing it necessary muzzle velocity and striking energy.# The classical gun powder is known as black powder, consists of charcol (15%), Sulphur (10%), and potassium nitrate (75%). Depending on fineness, the black gun powder is designated as FG, FFG, FFFG. etc. (F = fineness). Pyrodex is another gun powder with same components, but with different ratios.# Black gun powder produces smoke, i.e. It is smoke producing powder. Smokeless powder, in addition to black powder, has nitrocellulose (single base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine (double base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine plus nitroguanidine (triple base). Semi smokeless powder has 80% black powder and 20% smokeless powder (nitrocellulose).3) Projectile (missile)# Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose.4) Wads# Wads are present only in the cartridge of a shot gun. Wad can be made of paper, left, card board, or plastic. These are circular disc of various thicknesses, used to adjust the contents of a shotgun cartridge.# Felt wad (wad made of felt) is imprignated with grease and this lubricates the bore (inside of barrel).",A

Which of the gustafson&;s parameter is the most accurate-,Attrition,Periodontosis,Root resorption,Transparency of the root,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Trnasperency of the tooth Age from teeth after 20 yearso Teeth eruption is useful for age estimation upto about 18 years, beyond which it is just a guess work. The methods used areGustafson's method ; Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues.Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel).Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis).Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis.Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde).Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological).Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria).Mile's method : Age can be knowm by changes of root transparency.C) Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line). With increase in age, more lines are added, study of which helps in age determination.D) Stack's method : Age of i nfant can be knowrn from height and weight of erupting teeth,",D

All are signs of somatic death except ?,Cessation of respiration,Cessation of hea,Non-responding muscles,No response to external stimuli,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Non-responding muscles Death denotes death of human being (46 IPC). It is defined as cessation of life or cesation to exist. Death is of two types (1) somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) and (2) molecular death (cellular death). Somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) It is the complete and irreversible stoppage of the circulation, respiration and brain functions (bishop's tripod of life). Somatic death is associated with immediate signs of death :? Permanent and complete cessation of function of brain and flat electric EEG with no response to external stimuli; i.e. brain death. Permanent and complete cessation of function of hea and flat ECG. Permanent and complete cessation of function of lungs. Somatic death is due to stopped aerobic processes. However, anaerobic enzymatic processes are still continuing, hence (i) muscles still respond to mechanical, electrical and thermal stimuli, (ii) pupils still respond to miotics and mydriatics. Molecular death (cellular death) It occurs after somatic death. It refers to death of all individual cells. It occurs when even anaerobic processes stop, due to non availability of ATP. At this stage : Muscles do not respond to stimuli. Pupils do not respond to stimuli or drugs. There are early signs and late signs of death : Early signs : Changes in skin and eye, cooling of the body, post-moem lividity, changes in muscles (e.g. primary relaxation, rigor mois). Late signs : Decomposition (putrefaction), adipocere fromation and mummification. 4. Molecular death of various organs occur at different intervals after somatic death : Nervous tissue --> After 5 minutes. Liver ---> After 15 minutes. Hea --> After 45 minutes. Kidney --> After 1 hours. Muscles --> After 3 hours. Cornea --> After 6 hours. Blood After 6 hours.",C
Basophilic stippling is seen which of the following cells,Eosinophils,RBC's,Basophils,Neutrophils,"LEAD Chronic Poisoning (plumbism; saturnism) Signs and Symptoms :- (1) Facial Pallor : The facial pallor paicularly about the mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign. It seems to be due to vasospasm. (2) Anaemia : There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased. The anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin. Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead- sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism. Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome. (3) Line : A stippled blue line, called Buonian line, is seen on the gums. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near diy or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth. (4) Colic and Constipation : It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur. (5) Lead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases. There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are paicularly affected. The muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected) are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected. The paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles. Recovery may be complete but is usually slow. ( 6) Encephalopathy : It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead. The symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage. Death occurs in about 25% cases. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-544,545",B

A: 0 The deciduous dentition is made up of central incisors, lateral incisors, canines, first molars, and secondary molars; there is one in each quadrant, making a total of four of each tooth. All of these are replaced with a permanent counterpa except for the first and second molars; they are replaced by premolars. The deciduous teeth will remain until the age of six. At that time, the permanent teeth sta to appear in the mouth resulting in mixed dentition. The erupting permanent teeth causes root resorption, where the permanent teeth push down on the roots of the deciduous teeth causing the roots to be dissolved and become absorbed by the forming permanent teeth. Mixed dentition is seen upto the age of 12 years and at 14 years there are 28 permanent teeth and no deciduous teeths.",A

Aluminium phosphide poisoning - all true except,subendocardial infarction,produces phosphine gas,oesophageal stricture,inhibits cytochrome a oxidase,"inhibits cytochrome a oxidase Aluminium phosphide produces phosphine gas on coming in contact with moisture which inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (and not cytochrome a oxidase). Sub-endocardial infarction and esophageal strictures both have been described with ALP poisoning (Ref: various journals on web) Aluminium phosphide poisoning It is one of the most common causes of acute poisoning in India. Acute aluminium phosphide (Celphos) poisoning is an extremely lethal poisoning. The absence of a specific antidote results in very high moality and the key to treatment lies in rapid decontamination and institution of resuscitative measures. Aluminium phosphide (A1P) is one of the most commonly used grain fumigants because of its propeies which are considered to be near ideal; it is toxic to all stages of insects, highly potent, does not affect seed bility, is free from toxic residues. After ingestion of aluminium phosphide, phosphine gas is released in the stomach which after absorption into the circulation results in early signs and symptoms. AlP causes widespread organ damage due to cellular hypoxia as a consequence of non-competitive inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase of the mitochondria. Organs with the greatest oxygen requirements appear to be especially sensitive to phosphine, including the brain, kidneys, hea, and liver. The initial symptoms after ingestion are retrosternal burning, epigastric pain and vomiting which are soon followed by development of hypotension which is the cardinal feature. Other common features are restlessness, tachypnoea, oliguria or anuria, jaundice, impaired sensorium and cardiac arrhythmias. Several EKG abnormalities have been described. These have been attributed to focal myocardial necrosis and changes in action membrane potential as result of alteration in permeability of Na+, Mg++ and Ca+ ions Diagnosis A positive history of ingestion is the basis of diagnosis in most cases. The presence of typical clinical features, garlicky (or decaying fish) odour from the mouth and highly variable arrhythmias in a young patient with shock and no previous history of cardiac disease points towards aluminium phosphide poisoning. Confirmation can be done by the Silver Nitrate Test. In this test, 5 ml of gastric aspirate and 15 ml of water are put in a flask and the mouth of the flask is covered by filter paper impregnated with 0.1N silver nitrate. The flask is heated at 50 o C for 15 to 20 min. If phosphine is present the filter paper turns black. However the most specific and sensitive method for detecting the presence of P1-13 in blood/air is gas chromatography. (Vies Jansen A, Thrane KE. Gas chromatographic determination of PH3 in ambient air. Analysis 1978;103:1195-8.) Management The management continues to be unsatisfactory as there is no specific antidote and remains suppoive only. The most impoant factor for success is resuscitation of shock and institution of suppoive measures as soon as possible. To reduce the absorption of phosphine, gastric lavage with potassium permanganate (1:10,000) is done. Permanganate is used as it oxidizes PH3 to form non-toxic phosphate. This is followed by a slurry of activated charcoal (approximately 100 gin) given through a nasogastric tube. A cathaic (liquid paraffin) is given to accelerate the excretion of aluminium phosphide and phosphine. Antacids and proton pump blockers are added for symptomatic relief.",D

Greenish discolouration at putrefaction is due to-,MetHb,Sulph-meth Hb,Deoxy Hb,Carboxy Hb,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Sulph-meth Hb Signs of putrefactiono The signs and effects of putrefaction are as followsColour changesThe earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin,Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours.Formation of foul smelling gasesDue to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO., H^S, ammonia, methane and CO,.Effects of gasesBloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs :i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth.ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrifactive blisters,iii) Emptying of heart due to pressure of gas.In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmortem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmortem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity ) may occur at this time.Appearance of maggotsFlies lay their eggs in wrounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist parts of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1 -2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After further 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which convert into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death.Other late changesIn 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate.In 7-12 days: Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs.In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs.Finally: Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years.Internal changesLiver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or Swiss cheese or honeycombed liver.In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur.Floatation of body (if body is in water)Floatation of body occurs due to accumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases.

Tentative cuts are seen in: September 2011,Homicidal death,Suicidal death,Accidental death,Hanging,"Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds.",B

Most common finger print type is -,Loops,Whorls,Composite,Arches,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Loops Dactylography / Dermatoglvphies Gabon system / Finger printso Finger prints are present from birth both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin.o Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirety alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins,o The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing.o Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern.o It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8-16 (Reddy) / 16-20 (Seth, Simpson) points offine comparison are accepted as proof of identity.o Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments of fingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9-18 pores,o Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface. But these manners do not destroy finger prints permanently unless true skin is completely destroyed.",A

Bullet which is left inside the body for long is referred to as -,Souvenir bullet,Tracer bullet,Tumbling bullet,Tandem bullet,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Souvenir bullet o Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose. Varieties of bullets are :-Incendiary (igniting) bullet: The tip of bullet contains self igniting material e.g. barium nitrate and powdered aluminium and magnesium (in the past, phosphorus was used), so that it catches fire on hitting the target. It is used to cause fire in usually inflammable targets like fuel tanks (of air crafts etc).Explosive bullet: The tip contains a detonator or lead azide, so that the bullet explodes on hitting the target.Dum-dum bullet (expanding bullet) : It is a jacketed bullet with is nose tip chiseled or cut off. It is designed to increase in diameter and expand upon striking the target, thus producing larger diameter wounds of limited penetration.Tandem bullet (Piggey tail bullet) : It is called one-behind-other bullet because two bullets are ejected one after the other, when first bullet failed to leave the burrel and is ejected by subsequently fired bullet. Therefore, both enter body through same enterance wound (some times, they may enter through different entries), but the wounds of exit are always two.o Tandem (Duplex) cartridge is one in which two bullets are present in same cartridge. It is used in military rifles.Tracer bullet: It leaves a trace in atmosphere along the path so that a person (gunner) can observ e the strike. Burning of barium nitrate produces flame and powdered magnesium along with strontium nitrate are added to give red color to the flame.Tumbling bullet: One that rotates in end on end during its motion.Yawning bullet: One which travels in an irregular fashion and causes a key hole entery wound. Yaw means deviation between long axis of bullet and the axis of path of bullet.Souvenir bullet: A bullet left in body for long time and is surrounded by fibrous tissue.Frangite bullet: Designed to fragment upon impact.Mushrooming of bullet: A soft nose bullet, an hitting the target may get deformed to assume the shape of a mushroom.",A

Spalding sign is seen in ?,Drowning,Mummification,Maceration,Starvation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Maceration Dead born : A deadborn child is one which has died in utero and shows one of the following signs after it is completely born :? 1) Rigor mois : Rigor mois may occur in dead fetus before bih or at bih. 2) Maceration : Maceration is a process of aseptic autolysis. It occurs when a dead fetus remains in the uterus for 3-4 days surrounded by liquor amnii but with exclusion of air. Skin slippage is the earliest sign (occurs within 12 hours). There is gas in the great vessels and chambers of hea (Robe's sign). Except for lung and uterus, which remain unchanged for a long time, all other organs become soft, oedematous and loose there morphology. The one impoant radiological sign suggestive of maceration is 'Spaulding's sign' i.e. skull bones override each other. The smell is somewhat rancid. 3) Putrefaction (decomposition) : If the membranes are ruptured after death of fetus and air gains entry into liquor amnii, fetus undergoes putrefaction instead of maceration. Body is greenish, foul smelling and bloated. 4) Mummification : It results when there is deficient blood supply, scanty liquor and no air enters uterus.

"In autopsy, preservative used for vitreous is",Phenol,Xylol,Flouride,HCL,"Vitreous humor is the preferred specimen for postmoem confirmation of alcohol ingestion, since postmoem formation of ethanol does not occur to significant extent in vitreous, and hence useful even in decomposing bodies. It is recommended that this specimen is included routinely in sudden death investigations. In known diabetics, it is always wise to check the postmoem vitreous glucose level, even when there seems to be some other plausible cause of death. A high vitreous glucose level (> 200 mg/dl or so) is likely reflective of hyperglycaemia. Vitreous humor is preserved using sodium fluoride (10 mg/ml).

Prolonging a person's life through technological means is known as,Dysthanasia,Novus actus interveniens,Euthanasia,Orthotanasia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Dysthanasia * In medicine, dysthanasia means ""bad death"" and is considered a common fault of modern medicine: Dysthanasia occurs when a person who is dying has their biological life extended through technological means without regard to the person's quality of life.* Dysthanasia is the term for futile or useless treatment, which does not benefit a terminal patient. It is a process through which one merely extends the dying process and not life per se. Consequently, patients have a prolonged and slow death, frequently accompanied by suffering, pain and anguish. When one invests in healing a patient who has no chance of cure, s/he is actually undermining the person's dignity. Advanced measures and their limits should be assessed to benefit the patient and not to hold science as an end in itself.* Euthanasia is currently conceptualized as an action that aims to end the life of a human being taking into account humanistic considerations in relation to the person or society; it is unethical and illegal in Brazil. Nurses should be aware of their ethical code, which clearly prohibits (article 29): ""Promoting euthanasia or participating in practice intended to facilitate a patient's death"".* Orthotanasia refers to the art of promoting a humane and correct death, not subjecting patients to misthanasia or dysthanasia and not abbreviating death either, that is, subjecting them to euthanasia. Its great challenge is to enable terminal patients to keep their dignity, where there is a commitment to the well being of patients in the final phase of a disease.",A

Most common finger print type is ?,Loops,Whorls,Composite,Arches,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Loops Dactylography / DermatogIvphics / Calton system / Finger prints Finger prints are present from bih both on epidermis and dermis, remain constant through out life and can't be altered without destroying true skin. Finger print pattern is absolutely individual i.e. no two hands are entirely alike, not even identical twins. That's why, it is best (most sensitive and most specific) and most reliable method of identification (Quetelet's rule of biological variation). DNA finger printing may be same in monozygotic twins. The pattern is neither inherited nor identical in any two persons. So the paternity cannot be proved through finger print patterns. However, paternity can be proved by DNA finger printing. Loops (67% most common) > whorls (25%) > arches (7%) > composite (2% least common) are four main types of pattern. It is accepted that chances of 2 finger prints matching 16 ridge characteristic are infinitely small (Parikh's). In practice 8 - 16 (Reddy) / 16 - 20 (Seth, Simpson) points of fine comparision are accepted as proof of identity. Locard's poroscopy method is study of microscopic pores, formed by mouths of ducts of subepidermal sweat gland present on ridges of fingers. These pores are permanent, remain un changed during life and are very useful when only fragments offingerprints are available. Each milimeter contains 9 - 18 pores. Criminals may attempt to multilate finger prints by applying CO2 snow, corrosive agents, burns or eroding against hard surface.

"A 39 year old carpenter has taken two bottles of liquor from the local shop. After about and hour, he develops confusion, vomiting and blurring of vision. He has been brought to the emergency depament. He should be given:",Naloxone,Diazepam,Flumazenil,Ethyl alcohol,"The clinical features, especially ocular features like blurring of vision are suggestive of methyl alcohol poisoning. Moreover, Methyl alcohol is commonly used to adulterate ethyl alcohol. Impoant facts related to Methanol poisoning: 1) Cheap liquor is commonly adulterated by Methanol which leads to toxicity after consumption by poor people. Adulteration with Methanol is done because it is presumed to give the kick effect earlier with a smaller dose. Methanol is cheap and easily available. 2) Methanol as such is not a toxic agent. Methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde (by alcohol dehydrogenase) and then to formic acid (by aldehyde dehydrogenase), and these metabolites of methanol are responsible for retinal toxicity as well as metabolic acidosis. 3) Ethanol or 4 methyl pyrazole (fomepizole) are used for the treatment of methanol poisoning. They preferentially compete with methyl alcohol for the same enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and prevents the metabolism of methanol which is then excreted unchanged in the urine.",D

Modification of putrefaction in excess of moisture such as bodies as bodies immersed in water (or damp graves and wet vaults) - Adipocere Formationn (Saponification): Transformation of fatty tissue into yellowish white greasy wax like substance (Grave Wax). Typically occurs from hydrolysis of fat with the release of fatty acids which being acidic inhibit putrefactive bacteria. - Emits a Sweetish Rancid odour when adiopocere is established (Late stages): A penetrating Ammonica odour is typical in the early stages. Modification of Putrefaction in a dry environment with no or minimal moisture (hot and dry environment like desses or inside a chimney. - Mummification: Results from drying or dehydration of tissues (instead of liquefying putrefaction).

Best site of blood sample collection in autopsy is,Femoral vein,Hea,Visceral blood,IVC,"The hea is contracted and the chambers are empty when death has occurred from anaemia, but chambers contain blood when death occurs due to asthenia. After death, reduction of oxygen causes capillary dialtation which is followed by stasis of blood in the dilated capillaries and venules. This causes impaired venous return.As a result of which there is raised venous pressure resulting in over distension and rupture of capillaries and venules. This causes congestion and petechia haemorrhages.Haemorrhages are found in the substance of viscera. Postmoem, the blood is fluid and dark,because of increased amount of carbon dioxide. The large veins are full of blood. Hence the femoral vein is the best site of sample collection in autopsy, whereas the viscera are fully congested. Postmoem fluidity of the blood is assessed.

Bullet marking indicates -,Type of weapon,Type of wound,Range of firing,Severity of tissue damage,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Type of weapon o The kind of firearm weapon which fired the shot can be determined by -1) Size, shape, composition and primary or secondary marking of bullet.2) Appearance of wound.o Primary markings (class characteristics or bare codes):# These markings result during passage of bullet through barrel and depend on design, dimensions and manufacturing specifications of weapon. So they are most useful in identifying make and model (class) of weapon. Features noted include1) Calibers and type.2) Number and width of lands and grooves.3) Direction and rate of twist of rifling.4) Pitch (angle of spiral) of rifling.o Secondary markings (individual or accidental characteristics/Bullet finger print):# Irregularities on the inner surface of barrel due to accidental manufacturing defects or sticking of particles of prior fired bullets (later is known as metallic fouling) also produce grooving (marking) on surface of bullet. These secondary individual (or accidental) markings are specific for that particular weapon and used to exclude it from all others (bullet fingerpringing). These are more pronounced on lead bullet (which may even sometimes carry weaving pattern of cloth) and jacketed bullet.o The bullet found in body or crime scene is called crime (exhibit) bullet. It is compared under microscope with test bullet fired from suspected weapon. Using same type and brand of ammunition, the suspected weapon is fired into a box filled with cotton waste (bullet traps), a sand bag, bag of rags, oiled saw, dust, blocks of ice, water tank (bullet recovery tank) or against white bloating paper.",A

Latte's crust of blood stain is used to detect -,Nature of stain,Detection species,Blood group,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Blood groupBlood and blood stainso The examination of blood and blood stains is an important part of crime detection. The points that are usually required to be determined regarding stains are : (1) nature of stain (whether the stains is blood or not); (2) the species (human or animal) from which the blood has come from; and (3) blood group.Nature of stain (whether the stain is blood or not)o To determine the nature of stain, following tests are used :Chemical testsThese tests are based on the peroxidase activity of haematin, which is, derived from oxidation of haem of haemoglobin or methemoglobin, present. This enzyme, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide converts colourless salts into coloured bases. Thus these tests are based on H202 and peroxidase enzyme. Tests are :Benzidine test: Greenish blue colour.Phenolphthalein test (kastle myere test): Deep permanganate colour.Leucomalachite green test: Bluish green or peacock blue colour.Guaiacum test: Blue colour.Orthotoludine test (kohn test): Blue or green colour.Amidopyrine test: Purple colour.Microchemical testsThese tests are based on property of haem part of hemoglobin to form characteristic coloured crystals. The tests are :Teichmann's haemin crystal test.Takayama hemochromogen crystal test.Luminal spray test: It is especially useful in old obscure blood stains.SpetroscopyIt is most delicate and reliable test. It is based on the principle that hemoglobin and its derivatives givecharacteristic absorption bands when viewed through a spectroscope.MicroscopyMicroscopic examination of RBCs is possible only in fresh stains.Detection of species (whether the blood has come from human or animal)o For detection of species, serological (immunological) tests are used. These tests are :Precipitin testHaemaglutination inhibition test (antiglobulin consumption test or absorption inhibition test).Gel diffusion test.Double diffusion test.Precipitation electrophoresis.Latex agglutination test.Isoenzyme method (enzymological test).Detection of blood group of blood staino These tests are :Immunological (serological) : (i) aborption-elution test, (ii) absorption-inhibition test, (iii) mixed agglutinationtest, (iv) latex test.Enzymological methods.Latte fs crust method.",C

CO affinity to Hb_____ compared to O2 is,50 times,100 times,150 times,>200 times,"(D) >200 times# CARBON MONOXIDE is a common cause of accidental and suicidal poisoning. Its affinity for hemoglobin is 250 times greaterthan that of 02- It therefore binds to hemoglobin and reduces the 02-carrying capacity of blood.> The symptoms of poisoning are due to tissue hypoxia; they progress from headache and fatigue to confusion, syncope, tachycardia, coma, convulsions, shock, respiratory depression, and cardiovascular collapse.> Carboxyhemoglobin levels below 15% rarely produce symptoms; above 40%, symptoms become severe. Treatment includes establishment of an airway, supportive therapy, and administration of 100% O2.> Sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide are mucous membrane and respiratory irritants. Methane is a simple asphyxiant.> PATHOPHYSIOLOGYFig: Carbon monoxide shifts the oxygen-haemoglobin saturation curve to the left and changes it to a more hyperbolic shape. Less oxygen is available for the tissues. Shown is the oxygen diffusion gradient difference at 50% saturation> Carbon monoxide has 210 times greater affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen. A small environmental concentration will thus cause toxic levels of carboxyhaemoglobin.> After the carbon monoxide has selectively bound to haemoglobin the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve of the remaining oxyhaemoglobin shifts to the left, reducing oxygen release.> The affinity of carbon monoxide for myoglobin is even greater than for haemoglobin. Bindin g to cardiac myoglobin causes myocardial depression, hypotension and arrhythmias.> Cardiac decompensation results in further tissue hypoxia and is ultimately the cause of death.> Carbon monoxide has a predilection for 'watershed' areas of the brain where there is a meagre blood supply.> Basal ganglia, with their high oxygen consumption, are most often affected. Other commonly affected areas are the cerebral white matter, hippocampus and cerebellum.",D

Investigation of Offences on Human Body by Apurba Nandy p48Two types of marks are seen on the surface of the bullet and help in identification of the firearm used.Primary markings (Class characteristics):In all rifled firearms, the bullet is slightly larger than the barrel, and as the bullet passes through the barrel, its sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel. These are k/a primary markings.Primary markings or Class characteristics include- caliber number of lands and grooves {these 2 terms used in describing the rifling found inside the barrel of a firearm. The word lands refers to the raised portion of the rifling, and the grooves refers to the lower portion of the rifling.) direction of the twist of rifling rate of twist of the rifling width of the land and groovesPrimary markings help in identifying the make and model of the firearm used.Secondary markings (individual or accidental characteristics):These markings are caused by irregularities on the inner surface of the barrel which are specific for that particular weapon. These irregularities are produced by the sticking of the particles of the bullet to the bore when shots are fired (this is k/a metallic fouling). Individual characteristics also result accidentally during the manufacturing process.Secondary markings help iii identifying the specific gun from which the bullet was fired.",A

"Urinary alkalization increases urine elimination of all the following drugs, except: Odisha 11",Salicylate,Methotrexate,Amphetamine,Phenobarbital,Ans. Amphetamine,C
Forced dieresis with acidification or alkalinization of urine is a common method for elimination of ceain poisons/drugs from the body. The elimination of which of the following drugs is commonly enhanced by alkaline dieresis -,Amphetamines,Phenobarbitone,Phencyclidine,Theophylline,"Most drugs taken in overdose are extensively detoxified by the liver to produce inactive metabolites which are voided in the urine. Sometimes hepatic degradation produces active metabolites, but the secondary compounds are then conveed to non-toxic derivatives. Under these circumstances, forced diuresis is inappropriate. The procedure should be undeaken only if the following conditions are satisfied: # A substantial propoion of the drug is excreted unchanged. # The drug is distributed mainly in the extracellular fluid. # The drug is minimally protein-bound. # Principle-- Most drugs are weak electrolytes and exist paly as undissociated molecules at physiological pH. The extent of ionisation is a function of the ionisation constant of the drug (Ka for both acids and bases), and the pH of the medium in which it is dissolved. Ionisation constants are usually expressed in the form of their negative logarithm, pKa. Hence the pKa scale is analogous to the pH notation : the stronger an acid the lower its pKa, and the stronger a base the higher its pKa. Thus when pKa = pH, the concentrations of ionised and non-ionised drugs are equal. Cell membranes are most permeable to substances that are lipid soluble and in the non-ionised, rather than the ionised form. Thus the rate of diffusion from the renal tubular lumen back into the circulation is decreased when a drug is maximally ionised. Because ionisation of acidic drugs is increased in an alkaline environment, and that of basic drugs is increased in an acid solution, manipulation of the urinary pH enhances renal excretion. # Forced alkaline diuresis : This is most useful in the case of phenobarbitone, lithium, and salicylates. Administer 1500 ml of fluid IV, in the first hour as follows : - 500 ml of 5% dextrose - 500 ml of 1.2 or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate - 500 ml of 5% dextrose. # Forced acid diuresis : Forced acid diuresis is no longer recommended for any drug or poison, including amphetamines, strychnine, quinine or phencyclidine.

Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1991 Mar: 164(3): 797- 800. & http://www2. marshfieldclinic.org/wissp/commonly.htmExplanation:* It is generally impossible to collect blood or to culture tissue from a macerated stillborn fetus. Accurate genotyping of such a fetus may. however, be critical for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and appropriate genetic counselling.It is particularly important to sample fetal placenta under those circumstances since these cells tend to survive longer after fetal death.Placental tissue is an ideal sampling site in a macerated fetus.Maceration:It is a process of aseptic autolysis.This occurs when the dead fetus remains in utero for about 3-4 days surrounded by amniotic fluid without air.Signs of maceration are not seen if child is born within 24 hours after death.If air enters the amniotic fluid after the death of fetus, putrefaction occurs instead of maceration.The earliest sign of maceration - Skin slippage (Seen after 12 hours of death of child).Spalding's Sign:Loss of alignment and overriding of the bones of the cranial vault occurs due to shrinkage of the cerebrum after death of the fetus.In early stage, there is only loss of alignment without overriding.This sign develops earlier with vertex presentation.",B

Best bone of the following to assess the age of a person between 20-50 years is,Skull,Ribs,Sternum,Pubic symphysis,"Age changes at pubic symphysis The changes in the pubic symphysis are the best criteria to assess the age from third to fifth decade. The changes occurs on three components: dorsal surface, ventral surface, and margin. At the age of about 20 years, there is formation of horizontal ridges of bone on the aicular surface which first stas on the upper poion of the ventral surface and extends to the dorsal surface. This is called billowing. At about 25-35 years, the surface becomes granular and the ventral nd dorsal margins are well defined. A rim formation stas from the dorsal surface extends to the ventral surface. At about 35 -45 years, the upper and lower end will be raised and also the ventral margin by bony extension which is called lipping and the beaded rim development will be complete on all around the margins of the aicular surface. By 45-55 years, the beaded rim stas breaking. By 55-65 years the breakdown of the rim is more and by the end of seventh decade the breakdown of the rim will be complete.

Immersion syndrome is also called as -,Hydrocution,Wet drowning,Dry drowning,Secondary drowning,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hydrocutiono Immersion syndrome - is also called as hydrocution or submersion inhibition or vagal inhibition.Atypical drowning# It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form offroth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :Dry drowning: On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm.Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition): Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium.Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state.Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome): In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis.

"In civil negligence, onus of proof lies on:",Judicial first degree magistrate,Police not below the level of sub inspector,Doctor,Patient,"D i.e. Patient In case of malpractice, punishment is given by civil or criminal couQ (depending on type of negligence). Generally, the innocence of doctor is assumed and in cases where negligence is alleged, the plantiff (complainant, patient) has to establish the guilt. The patient is expected to prove that the defendant (doctor) was negligent; there fore the onus (responsibility) of proof lies on patient. But when the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor (ie thing speaks for itself) is applied such as in case of surgery on wrong patient / side / organ etc, the doctor will have to prove that what has happened is not due to his negligenceQ. This means onus of proof lies on patient in negligence (all civil & most criminal case) except in cases where doctrine of res ipsa loquitor appliesQ. Therapeutic misadventure (mischance / disaster / accident) is death or injury of a patient due to some unintentional act by doctor /nurse /hospitalQ during treatment (therapeutic), diagnosis (diagnostic) or experimental study. It provides defence against neglince because a doctor can't be held responsible for injuries resulting from adverse reaction of drug. However, the doctor must warn patient about possible side effects (eg death during surgery or transfusion). And ignorance of the possibility of reaction to drug prescribed to patient amounts to negligence (ie it is not 100% = absolute defence). At times it is not possible to explain every thing to the patient (who may be scared of procedure). Under such circumstances doctor can reveal the details to any one of close relatives of patient. This is called doctrine of therapeutic privilege. Doctrine of emergency says that doctor can provide the treatment without taking prior consent from a patient who is gravely sick, (critically ill), unconscious, or not able to understand the suggestion, or when mentally ill (IPC section 92). In emergency situation involving children, when their parents are not available, a/t doctrine of locoparentis, consent can be obtained from accompanying person (eg teacher or relative). On ceain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient might suffer severe injuries or permanent deformity. This is k/a medical maloccurance, inevitable act or Act of God. If doctor proves this before cou, it will be an absolute defence against malpractice. Free (charity) treatment of patient does not give doctor immunity (defence) against negligenceQ. Whereas judgemental (diagnostic) error, therapeutic misadventure, medical maloccurance, calculated risk doctrine, contributory negligence (on pa of patient), product liability, and res judicata (complain already tried once in cou) provide defenses to a doctor against charges of negligence. Law does not consider doctrine of contributory negligence & consent in charges of criminal negligence; whereas these provide defence in civil negligence.",D

Me Naughten's rule is?,Person is not responsible if he is not of a sound mind,Person is held responsible even if he is not of sound mind,Person is always held responsible,Any of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Person is not responsible if he is not of a sound mind o According to Me Naughtcn's rule, a person is not responsible for his act, if has unsound mind at the time of act.o The criminal responsibility of an insane is judged as per the following rules :1) MC Naughten rule (legal test or right or wrong test):# Accused danieal MC Nauthten (probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and having persecutory delusions) shot Sir Peel's private secretory, Edward Drummond, mistaking him for the prime minister Sir Robert Peel. He was found not guilty on grounds of insanity. The answers given by panel of 14 judges to house of lords to clarify the legal position (on 19 june 1843) as known as MC Naughten rule.# It states that an accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved that at the time of commiting the crime, person was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mind that he didn't know the nature and quality of act he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong i.e. a person is not responsible if he is not of sound mind.# It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 IPC as - ""nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law"".# The primary defect is that the criteria for deciding insanity is purely intellectual (reason based). And there is no place for delusional beliefs, hallucinations, emotional and volitional factors and the ability of an individual to control the impulses. This is because the abnormality of mind (term used in this rule) is a legal and not a psychiatric concept and is concerned with the mind (i.e. reason, memory and understanding) not with the brain.# Clearly proved (term) means that the mental abnormality had a direct causal relation to the offence (i.e. it would not have occurred in absence of mental abnormality).# Crime consists of actus reus (i.e. guilty act) and mens rea (wrong intention). So if at the time of crime, the accused had the capacity to know that his act was wrong, he will be fully responsible, even if he was mentally ill, and unable to refrain from doing the act at that time.# If an accused commits a crime under the influence of delusion, he is j udged as if the delusionary facts were real. So if due to an insane delusion, a person kills a man in self defence (thinking that he is attempting to kill him or thinking that he is a wild animal) or as a part of job (thinking that he is a state executioner and has to execute the victim) he has no criminal responsibility and is exempt from punishment. But due to an insane delusion, if a person thinks that another person has caused a serious injury to his fortune and character and kills him, he becomes responsible as under the law no one can kill a person in revenge.2) Doctrine of partial responsbility# If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsessional states or depressions.3) Durban rule# Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect.4) Currens rule# A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirments of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5) American law institute test# Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed.6) Norwegion system# No defendent considered insane or unconscious at the time of offence, may be punished.",A

It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 1PC as - ""nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law"". 2. Doctrine of paial responsibility - If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only paially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsession states or depressions. 3. Durhan rule- Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect. 4. Currens rule- A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirements of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect. 5. American law institute test-Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed. 6.

"In civil negligence, onus of proof lies on",Judicial first degree magistrate,Police not below the level of sub inspector,Doctor,Patient,"Patient [Ref- Reddy's Forensic 29/e p30; Parikh 6/e p1.441 ""Generally speaking, it is for the patient in an action for negligence to establish the guilt of the doctor, whose innocence is otherwise assumed.""- Parikh However, in cases where the rule of res ipso loguitur is applied, the patient need not prove negligence. Res ipso loquitur means that ""the thing or fact speaks for itself."" The patient has to merely state what according to him was the act of negligence. The 3 essential conditions considered necessary for res ipsa loquitur are: The nature of injury suggests by common knowledge or expe evidence that without negligence it does not occur. The patient must not contribute to his own injury The doctor had exclusive control over the injury producing instrument or treatment. Professional negligence Professional negligence is defined as absence of reasonable care and skill, or wilful negligence of a medical practioner in the treatment of a patient, which causes bodily injury or death of the patient. The word negligence is defined as the omission to do something (act of omission) which a reasonable person would do, or doing something (act of commission) which a reasonable person would not do. To prove an act of negligence the onus lies on the patient (or his relative if the patient has died). Following conditions must be proved by the patient (4Ds): Duty- the doctor (defendant) owed him a duty of care. Dereliction- the doctor failed to perfonn that duty. Damage- the patient suffered actual damage due to negligence of the doctor. iv. Direct causation- the doctor's negligence directly led to the damage without any other intervening cause. Professional negligence can be of 2 types: Civil negligence and Criminal negligence. Civil negligence Civil negligence arises - when a patient (or his relative, in case of patient's death) files suit in a civil cou to get compensation from his doctor for the injury or death of the patient due to doctor's negligence. - a doctor files civil suit to get fees from his patient, who refuses to pay alleging negligence. Criminal negligence Criminal negligence arises when the degree of negligence is so grave that it goes beyond matters of comensation. Case is filed in a criminal cou. Criminal negligence occurs when the doctor shows gross lack of competence, or gross inaction, gross recklessness, gross negligence in selection and application of remedies. It involves extreme depaure from the ordinary standard of care. Criminal negligence cases are very rare. Note that- A doctor will not be criminally liable if a patient dies due to an error of judgement or carelessness or want of due caution, though lie can be liable to pay compensation. Examples of criminal negligence? - Amputation of wrong limb or digit or of the wrong patient. - Leaving instruments, tubes, sponges or swabs within the body. - Gross mismanagement under the influence of alcohol or drugs - Performing criminal aboion - Administration of a wrong substance into the eye causing loss of vision. - Giving wrong or infected blood. - Gangrene after too tight plastering. Note that? Even if a doctor is negligent, a patient is not entitled for any compensation if no damage has occurred. An error in diagnosis or treatment is not negligence provided proper care and skill has been exercised. Contributory negligence is not a defence in criminal negligence. (Contributory negligence is any negligence on the pa of the patient or his attendant, which along with the doctor's negligence, contributed to the injury) Criminal negligence cases are dealt under I.P.C. section 304A.",D
IPC 82 states that: child cannot be punished under what age -,5yrs,8yrs,7yrs,lOyrs,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., 7yrs o Section 82 I.P.C.: Criminal responsibility is any act which is done by a child under seven years of age is not an offence.Section of IPCRelated with82A child under the age of seven is incapable of committing an offence. This is so because action alobe does not amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The law presumes such maturity' in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation. Only, a guardian can give such consent.87A person under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent, whether express or implied, to suffer any harm which may result from an act no intended or not known to cause death or grievous hurt e.g. consent for a wrestling contest.84Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is uncapable of knowing the nature of act (i.e. it is wrong or contrary to law).85,86Drunkness and criminal responsibilityQ",C

Adipocere formation is seen in?,Dead body exposed to air,"Dead body buried in damp, clay soil",Burial dry hot air,All of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dead body buried in damp, clay soil Adipocere formation (saponification)o Adipocere is a modification ofputrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs.o Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or hurried in damp lay soil.o Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere.o Adipocere formation starts in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical.o Body is converted into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible.o Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shortest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 months.o Medicolegal importance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

Nysten&;s rule is related to,Order of appearance of post moem caloricity,Time since death,Order of appearance of decomposition,Order of appearance of rigor mois,"The Order of Appearance of Rigor All muscles of the body, both voluntary and involuntary are affected. It does not sta in all muscles simultaneously (Nysten&;s rule). It first appears in involuntary muscles; the myocardium becomes rigid in an hour. It begins in the eyelids, neck and lower jaw and passes upwards to the muscles of the face, and downwards to the muscles of the chest, upper limbs, abdomen and lower limbs and lastly in the fingers and toes. In individual limbs, it usually progresses from above downwards. Such a sequence is not constant, symmetrical or regular. In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Shapiro (1950) suggests that rigor mois does not follow the anatomical sequence usually described. He suggests that as rigor mois is a physicochemical process, it is most likely to develop simultaneously in all the muscles, although the changes are more easily first detected in the smaller masses than in the larger. The proximo-distal progression is more apparent than real, for the sequence is determined by the bulk and kind of muscle involved. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-161",D
