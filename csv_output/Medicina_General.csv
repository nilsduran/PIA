"A 55 year old man who has been on bed rest for the past 10 days, complains of sudden onset breathlessness and chest pain. His chest X-ray is normal. Which of the following is the next investigation of choice for making the diagnosis?",Echocardiography,Pulmonary aeriography,Lung ventilation-perfusion scan,Pulmonary venous angiography,"This patient who was bedridden for 10 days is at high risk of developing deep venous thrombosis. Since he has developed chest pain and breathlessness and his chest x ray is appearing normal he has most likely developed pulmonary embolism. The next best investigation for this patient would be ventilation perfusion scan. Cases of high clinical probability combined with a high probability V/Q scan are viually diagnostic of Pulmonary Embolism (Philip A Karla 3rd edition). Lung scanning is a second-line diagnostic test for PE, used mostly for patients who cannot tolerate intravenous contrast. Perfusion scan is done by injecting small paiculate aggregates of albumin labeled with a gamma-emitting radionuclide. Ventilation scans, are obtained using radiolabelled inhaled gas such as xenon or krypton. When the V/P scan shows 2 or more segmental perfusion defects in presence of normal ventilation it is said to e a high probability scan. The diagnosis of PE is about 90% ceain in patients with high-probability scans. Ref: Harrisons Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Chapter 262",C

Hyperventilation can provoke the following,Tonic-clonic seizures,Simple paial seizures,Complex paial seizures,Absence seizures,"The electrophysiologic hallmark of typical absence seizures is a generalized, symmetric, 3-Hz spike-and-wave discharge that begins and ends suddenly, superimposed on a normal EEG background.In tonic-clonic seizures, The EEG during the tonic phase of the seizure shows a progressive increase in generalized low-voltage fast activity, followed by generalized high-amplitude, polyspike discharges. In the clonic phase, the high-amplitude activity is typically interrupted by slow waves to create a spike-and-wave pattern. The postictal EEG shows diffuse slowing that gradually recovers as the patient awakens.Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG.Ref: Harrison 19e 2543",D

Endemic Disease' means that a disease -,Occurs clearly in excess of normal expectancy,Is constantly present in a given population group,Exhibits seasonal pattern,Is prevalent among animals,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Is Consistantly present in a given population group Endemic disease o It refers to constant presence of a disease or infectious agent within a given geographic area or population group, without impoation from outsite.o In other words ""Endemicity is defined as the usual or expected frequency of the disease within a given geographic area or population group"".What does expected frequency (usual frequency) meano Expected frequency --> The number (range) of cases of a disease that one would expect to occur in a given popuation group if population and environmental conditions are stable.o Expected frequency (normal expectancy) is derived by looking at average of number of cases of the disease in previous 3 -- 5 years in that geographical area.Other terms related to endemic disease : -i) Hyperendemic -p The disease is constantly present at a high incidence and/or prevalence rate and effects all age group equally.ii) Haloendemic --> A high level of infection begining early in life and affecting most of the child population, leading to a state of equilibrium such that adult population shows evidence of disease much less commonly than to the children, as in case of malaria",B
A study revealed lesser incidence of carcinoma colon in pure vegetarians than non-vegetarians by which it was concluded that b-carotene is protective against cancer. This may not be true because the vegetarian subjects may be consuming high fibre diet which is protective against cancer. This is an example of:,Multifactorial causation,Causal association,Confounding factor,Common association,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Confounding factor In an epidemiological study, in addition to the exposures that the study is investigating, there may be other factors that is associated with the exposure and independently affects the risk of developing disease. If the prevalence of these other factors differ between groups being compared, they will distort the observed association between the disease and exposure under study. These distorting factors are called confounding factors or variables. In the study given, protective factor is being studied. But as high fibre content of vegetarian food is protective against CA colon, it can confound or distort the observed protective role of b-carotene present in vegetarian food. Thus this is an example of confounding factor. Causal association: There are 2 types- 1. One to one causal relationship - Two variables are causally related if a change in one variable is followed by a change in the other. So when the disease is present, the factor must also be present. In the given study causative factor is not being studied rather preventive factor is being studied.Multifactorial causation - There can be multiple factors acting independently or cumulatively to produce a disease (non-communicable). As stated above causal factors are not being observed in this study so both causal association and multifactorial causation are ruled out.Common association is not an epidemiological term, it is just a casual term.",C

"The ""sick cell syndrome"" is characterized by-",Hyponatremia,Hypernatremia,Hypokalemia,Hyperkalemia,"Sick cell syndrome is a medical condition characterised by reduced functioning of the cellular Na+/K+ pump, which is responsible for maintaining the internal ion homeostasis. The clinical result is a rise in blood K+ level and drop of blood Na+ levels Hyponatraemia Hyponatraemia is defined as a serum Na <135 mmol/L. It is a common electrolyte abnormality with many potential underlying causes, as summarised in Box 14.10. Pathophysiology In all cases, hyponatraemia is caused by greater retention of water relative to sodium. The causes are best categorised according to associated changes in the ECF volume (Box 14.10). Hyponatraemia with hypovolaemia In this situation there is depletion of sodium and water but the sodium deficit exceeds the water deficit, causing hypovolaemia and hyponatraemia (see Box 14.3). The cause of sodium loss is usually apparent and common examples are shown in Box 14.10. Hyponatraemia with euvolaemia In this situation there are no major disturbances of body sodium content and the patient is clinically euvolaemic. Excess body water may be the result of abnormally high intake, either orally (primary polydipsia) or as a result of medically infused fluids (as intravenous dextrose solutions, or by absorption of sodium-free bladder irrigation fluid after prostatectomy). Water retention also occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or vasopressin (SIADH). In this condition, an endogenous source of vasopressin (either cerebral or tumour-derived) promotes water retention by the kidney in the absence of an appropriate physiological stimulus (Box 14.11). The clinical diagnosis requires the patient to be euvolaemic, with no evidence of cardiac, renal or hepatic disease potentially associated with hyponatraemia. Other non-osmotic stimuli that cause release of vasopressin (pain, stress, nausea) should also be excluded. Suppoive laboratory findings are shown in Box 14.11. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 357",A

Conclusive test for semen,Florence test,Acid phosphatase test,Barberio test,Phenolphthalein test,"The Acid Phosphatase Test: The prostatic secretion element of seminal fluid contains 500 to 1000 times greater acid phosphatase than any other body fluid. Undiluted semen has an acid phosphatase activity of 340 to 360 Bodanskyunits or 2500 to 3500 Angstrom units per ml. The concentration of acid phosphatase gradually falls with time in vaginal secretions, and positive reactions are found for periods of thiysix hours, with gradual disappearance in 72 hrs. Five to ten ml of normal saline solution is placed in the vagina with a syringe. The fluid is then removed and placed in a sealed tube and refrigerated for enzyme examination. Concentration in excess of hundred Bodansky units with or without motile sperms indicate that ejaculation occurred within twelve hours of examination. Dried seminal stains which have not undergone putrefaction retain acid phosphatase activity for weeks or months, although enzymatic activity decreases slowly with time. This test is conclusive in the absence of demonstrable sperms or in aspermia. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-434,435",B

Coomb's + ve Hemolytic Anaemia is seen in all except -,Alcoholic cirrhosis,Chronic active hepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Coombs test (also known as antiglobulin test or AGT) is either of two clinical blood tests used in immunohematology and immunology. The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT). The direct Coombs test detects antibodies that are stuck to the surface of the red blood cells. Since these antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells, a person can be anemic and this test can help clarify the condition. The indirect Coombs detects antibodies that are floating freely in the blood.. These antibiodies could act against ceain red blood cells and the test can be done to diagnose reactions to a blood transfusion The direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia--that is, a condition where the immune system breaks down red blood cells, leading to anemia. The direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells. To perform the test, a blood sample is taken and the red blood cells are washed (removing the patient's own plasma and unbound antibodies from the red blood cells) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (""Coombs reagent""). If the red cells then agglutinate, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies or complement proteins are bound to the surface of red blood cells and may be causing destruction of those cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing prior to a blood transfusion. The test detects antibodies against foreign red blood cells. In this case, serum is extracted from a blood sample taken from the patient. The serum is incubated with foreign red blood cells of known antigenicity. Finally, anti-human globulin is added. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive Coombs positive seen in hepatitis, haemolytic anemias ,biliary cirrhosis,cholangitis,blood transfusions, transplantation Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 763",A

Which of the following statement about astrocytoma is false,Low grade tumors are more common in children,These are mostly infratentorial in children,Pilocytic astrocytoma is most common childhood brain tumor,There are more common in males than females,"Astrocytomas are a type of cancer of the brain. They originate in a paicular kind of glial cells, star-shaped brain cells in the cerebrum called astrocytes. This type of tumor does not usually spread outside the brain and spinal cord and it does not usually affect other organs Narrow zones of infiltration (mostly noninvasive tumors; e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma), that often are clearly outlined on diagnostic images Diffuse zones of infiltration (e.g., high-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma), that share various features, including the ability to arise at any location in the central nervous system, but with a preference for the cerebral hemispheres; they occur usually in adults, and have an intrinsic tendency to progress to more advanced grades Astrocytoma causes regional effects by compression, invasion, and destruction of brain parenchyma, aerial and venous hypoxia, competition for nutrients, release of metabolic end products (e.g., free radicals, altered electrolytes, neurotransmitters), and release and recruitment of cellular mediators (e.g., cytokines) that disrupt normal parenchymal function.[Secondary clinical sequelae may be caused by elevated intracranial pressure attributable to direct mass effect, increased blood volume, or increased cerebrospinal fluid volume. Molecular alterations A genome-wide pattern of DNA copy-number alterations (CNAs) has been uncovered, which is correlated with a patient's survival and response to treatment. This pattern identifies among glioblastoma as well as lower-grade astrocytoma patients a subtype, where the CNA genotype is correlated with an approximately one-year survival phenotype.

Which of the following is not an accepted method of randomization-,Computer drawn randomization,Odd/even day hospital admission,Lottery,Random number table,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Odd/even day hospital admission Methods of Randomization o Randomization is accomplished in a number of classic ways 1. Lottery method Suppose 10 patients are to be put in a control group or the trial group out of 100 available. The serial numbers of patients are noted on 100 cards and then shuffled well. The cards are drawn one by one and thus patients are allocated into trial and control groups. 2. Table of Random Numbers Published tables of Random numbers are used. This is considered to be the best method of randomization. A computer program is used for randomization o Randomization methods , which may at first seem reasonable (odd-even day randomization or daytime-nighttime convenience randomization), may actually suppo bias, paicularly if the study is open-label or the operator or subject are not blinded as to the nature of the intervention. For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they ""just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation.""

Drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis in meningococcal meningitis is ?,Tetracycline,Rifampicin,Streptomycin,Erythromycin,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Rifampicin Meningococcal meningitis is the only type of bacterial meningitis that occurs in epidemic form. o Close contacts of index case (such as other household member, infants in day-care centers, or military recrutis) are at increased risk for developing meningococcal disease. casual contacts such as schoolmates do not appear to be at increased risk. Chemoprophylaxis is indicated only for close contacts. Sulfonamides, once widely employed in chemoprophylaxis, should no longer be used for that purpose because approximately 25% of meningococcal isolates are now resistant to sulfonamide. Rifampicin is the drug of choice to accomplish prophylaxis in close contacts. The recommended dose in adults is either 600 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 days or 600 mg orally once daily for 4 days (total 4 doses). Other drugs for chemoprophylaxis are ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin, minocycline.",B

All the following are manifestations of CMV infection following Lung transplant Except,Bronchiolitis obliterans,CMV syndrome,CMV retinitis,Esophagitis,"CMV is a common and dangerous DNA virus in transplant recipients. It does not generally appear until the end of the first posttransplant month. Patients at highest risk for severe CMV disease are those without anti-CMV antibodies who receive a graft from a CMV antibody-positive donor (15% moality).Early diagnosis in a febrile patient with clinical suspicion of CMV disease can be made by determining CMV viral load in the blood. A rise in IgM antibodies to CMV is also diagnostic. Tissue invasion of CMV is common in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. CMV retinopathy occurs late in the course, if untreated. Valganciclovir is a cost-effective and bioavailable oral form of ganciclovir that has been proved effective in both prophylaxis and treatment of CMV disease.Reference: Harrison; 19th edition; Page no: 1831",D

Major risk factor for development of lung abscess is:,Pneumonia,Aspiration,Lung cancer,Tuberculosis,"The major risk factor for primary lung abscesses is aspiration. Patients at particular risk for aspirationsuch as those with altered mental status, alcoholism, drug overdose, seizures, bulbar dysfunction, prior cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events, or neuromuscular disease, are most commonly affected. 

Lung abscesses are usually characterized as either primary (~80% of cases) or secondary. 
Primary lung abscesses usually arise from aspiration, are often caused principally by anaerobic bacteria, and occur in the absence of an underlying pulmonary or systemic condition. 
Secondary lung abscesses arise in the setting of an underlying condition, such as a post obstructive process  (e.g., a bronchial foreign body or tumour) or a systemic process (e.g., HIV infection or another immunocompromising condition). 
Lung abscesses can also be characterized as acute (<4–6 weeks in duration) or chronic (~40% of cases).

Fibreoptic scopes are sterilized by,Glutaraldehyde,Ethylene oxide,Autoclaving,Alcohol,"Ans. a (Glutaraldehyde). (Ananthnarayan, Microbioloyg, 4th ed., 32)SterilisationSterilisation by steam (Autoclave)Sterilisation by hot airSterilisation by ethylene oxideSterilization by low-temperature steam and formal dehydeSterilisation by irradiation- Vegetative bacteria, including tuberculosis, and viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV and heat-resistant spores, including C.tetani and C.perfringens, are killed.- Combination of pressure, temperature and time with the moist heat is important: 134degC (30 lb/in.2) for a hold time of 3 minutes; 121degC (15 lb/in.2) for a hold time of 15 minutes;- Monitoring=Steam penetration/Bowie - Dick test and chemical indicators, for example Brownes tubes or impregnated tapes, are used to ensure that errors. Biological indicators are not appropriate.- Inefficient compared with moist steam sterilisation, but it has ability to treat solid non- aqueous liquids grease/ ointments and to process closed (airtight) containers.- Lack of corrosion may be important, particularly with instruments with fine cutting edges such as ophthalmic instruments.- It cannot be used for substances such as rubber, plastics and IV fluids which are denatured.- ETO is highly penetrative non- corrosive broad- spectrum cidal gas.- It is utilised for heat-sensitive -materials including electrical equipment.- It is not recommended for ventilator respiratory equipment or soiled instruments because organic debris, including serum, has a marked adverse effect.This uses a combination of dried saturated steam and formaldehyde, with the main advantage being that sterilisation is achieved at a low temperature (73degC) and the method is so suitable for heat-sensitive materials and items of equipment with integral plastic components.- It is not recommended for sealed, oily items or those with retained air.- Some plastics and fabrics absorb formal-dehyde, releasing this in a delayed manner which may cause hypersensitivity to the users.- This employs gamma rays or accelerated electrons.- It is an industrial process and is appropriate to the sterilisation of large batches of similar products, such as syringes, catheters and IV cannulas.- Irradiation dose in excess of 25 kGy is accepted as providing adequate sterility assurance.DisinfectionDisinfection with low-temperature steam:- Typical conditions include exposure to dry saturated steam at a temperature of 73degC for a period of 20 minutes at a pressure below atmospheric. Useful for dealing with dirty returns from OT/clinics which may be contaminated with bodily secretions and microorganisms. Following this instruments must be cleaned.Disinfection with boiling water:- Uses soft water at 100()C at normal pressure for 5min. Instruments must be thoroughly cleaned before utilised.Disinfection with formaldehyde:- Formaldehyde gas is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. This process utilises a cabinet which is airtight and circulates gaseous formaldehyde up to 50degC.Disinfection with glutaraldehyde:A 2 % solution of glutaraldehyde is effective against most bacteria, viruses, including hepatitis B and C and HIV, and is a high-level disinfection particularly useful for the decontamination of flexible endoscopes.",A

Vitamin E causes,Hemorrhagic stroke,Cardiac failure,Ataxia,Megalablastic anemia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ataxia Vitamin E (tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant propeies; It protects cell membranes from oxidation and destruction. Vitamin E is found in a variety of food including oils, meat, eggs, and leafy vegatables. There are multiple forms and isomers of tocopherol and the related compounds, tocotrienols. The current evidence the primary bioactive form of Vitamin E is alfa-tocopherol. Serum vitamin E levels are strongly influenced by concentration of serum lipids, and do not accurately reflect tissue vitamin levels. Effective vitamin E levels are calculated as the ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol per gram total lipids. Absorption of dietary vitamin E requires effective pancreatic exocrine function and fat absorption, unless provided in a synthetic water-soluble form. Vitamin Vitamin E deficiency is uncommon in humans except in special circumstances. This is due to the abundance of tocopherols in the diet.",C

Most common site of primary impact injury topedestrians in a motor vehicle accident is...,Abdoemn,Legs,Head,Chest,"legs Three types of injuries are seen in pedestrians in a motor vehicles injury. 1. Primary impact injuries (the first pa struck) - These injuries are caused by the first impact between the vehicle and the pedestrian. 2. Secondary impact injuries (fuher injuries by the same vehicle) - These injuries are d/t subsequent impact with the same vehicle, for eg. the pedestrian may be lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact. 3. Secondary injuries (sometimes also called teiary injuries) - These are the injuries caused d/t the victim falling on the ground or other stationary object. In primary impact injuries, the site and nature of injuries depend on the height of the pedestrian and upon the position of the person in relation to the vehicle when struck, i.e. whether crossing the road from one side to the other walking with or against the traffic. The injuries also depend upon the relative heights of various pas of the vehicle, i.e. bumper, radiator, fenders. In a typical case, the victim is struck by the front of the vehicle. An adult usually sustains injuries on the legs and a child on the head. Fracture of the tibia and, fibula of one or both legs is k/a bumper fracture. - The fracture is usually spiral or wedge shaped. The base of the triangular fragment of bone indicates the site of the impact and the apex points in the direction in which the vehicle was travelling. - In a bumber fracture, the distance from the heel to the ,fracture sire gives information regarding height of the bumper and whether brakes were applied or not. When brakes are applied before the accident, the legs are injured at a lower level. (The .front bumber tends to rise during acceleration and dip under braking. If the pedestrian is hit from the side, there may be unilateral fracture of the nearest leg. If the pedestrian is facing the vehicle. he may sustain intra-abdominal injuries and/or injuries to the chest wall and thoracic contents. Sometimes the pelvis is fractured.",B

By reducing production of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors allow blood vessels to widen, which lowers blood pressure and improves hea output. The available ACE inhibitors include benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril. Side effects -- In some patients, ACE inhibitors cause a persistent dry hacking cough that is reversible when the medication is stopped. Less common side effects include dry mouth, nausea, rash, muscle pain, or occasionally, kidney dysfunction and elevated blood potassium. A potentially serious complication of ACE inhibitors is angioedema, which occurs in 0.1 to 0.7 percent of people. People with angioedema rapidly (minutes to hours after taking the medication) develop swelling of the lips, tongue, and throat, which can interfere with breathing. These symptoms are a medical emergency, and the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued. oral enalapril may also be used in young hypeensives who presents with ususually high levels of blood pressure to overcome the end stage damages that can happen. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2057",C

Prolonging a person's life through technological means is known as,Dysthanasia,Novus actus interveniens,Euthanasia,Orthotanasia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Dysthanasia * In medicine, dysthanasia means ""bad death"" and is considered a common fault of modern medicine: Dysthanasia occurs when a person who is dying has their biological life extended through technological means without regard to the person's quality of life.* Dysthanasia is the term for futile or useless treatment, which does not benefit a terminal patient. It is a process through which one merely extends the dying process and not life per se. Consequently, patients have a prolonged and slow death, frequently accompanied by suffering, pain and anguish. When one invests in healing a patient who has no chance of cure, s/he is actually undermining the person's dignity. Advanced measures and their limits should be assessed to benefit the patient and not to hold science as an end in itself.* Euthanasia is currently conceptualized as an action that aims to end the life of a human being taking into account humanistic considerations in relation to the person or society; it is unethical and illegal in Brazil. Nurses should be aware of their ethical code, which clearly prohibits (article 29): ""Promoting euthanasia or participating in practice intended to facilitate a patient's death"".* Orthotanasia refers to the art of promoting a humane and correct death, not subjecting patients to misthanasia or dysthanasia and not abbreviating death either, that is, subjecting them to euthanasia. Its great challenge is to enable terminal patients to keep their dignity, where there is a commitment to the well being of patients in the final phase of a disease.",A

Bupropion and varenicilineMost effective medications for smoking cessationNicotine replacementBupropionVareniclineo Transdermal nicotine patch o Nicotine gum o Nicotine lozenge o Nicotine inhaler o Nicotine nasal spray Nicotine replacement therapyo The goal of nicotine replacement therapy is to provide nicotine to a smoker without using tobacco, thereby relieving nicotine withdraw l symptoms as the smoker breaks the behaviour of cigarette smoking.o The use of nicotine replacement therapy in place of cigarette avoids exposure to carbon monoxide that reduces oxygen delivery to oxidant gases that are atherogenic and to tars that are carcinogenic.There are different types of nicotine replacement products e.g.Nicotine patch - transdermallyNasal spray - nasal mucosaNicotine chewing gum, lozenge or inhaler - oral mucosao Nicotine replacement products differ in their pharmacokinetics and delivery of nicotine to circulation# But no product delivers nicotine as rapidely as cigarette smoking, a factor that contributes specifically to dependence producing properties of cigarettes.Bupropiono It is believed to act by enhancing central nervous system noradrenergic and dopaminergic release,o It is given as sustained release formulation.o The sustained release bupropion takes five to seven days to reach steady state blood levels. Therefore it is started one week before a smoker s target quit date,o Bupropion monotherapy doubles the likelihood of smoking cessation compared to placebo.Varenicilineo Vareniciline is a partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor that appears to produce the reinforcing effects of nicotine and leads to nicotine dependence.It aids smoking cessation in two ways# Firstly, as a partial agonist it binds to and produces the partial stimulation of the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor thereby reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawl.# Secondly since vareniciline binds to the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor subunit with high affinity it blocks the nicotine in tobacco smoking from binding to the receptor.; there ????",B
Probability samplings are all except,Simple random sampling,Systematic random sampling,Cluster sampling,Quota sampling,"SAMPLING When a large propoion of individuals or items or units have to be studied, we take a sample. It is easier and more economical to study the sample than the whole population or universe. Great care therefore is taken in obtaining a sample. It is impoant to ensure that the group of people or items included in the sample are representative of the whole population to be studied Sampling Methods The following three methods are most commonly used : (1) Simple random sample : This is done by assigning a number to each of the units (the individuals or households) in the sampling frame. A table of random numbers is then used to determine which units are to be included in the sample. Random numbers are a haphazard collection of ceain numbers, arranged in a cunning manner to eliminate personal selection of unconscious bias in taking out the sample. With this procedure, the sample is drawn in such a way that each unit has an equal chance of being drawn in the sample. This technique provides the greatest number of possible samples. (2) Systematic random sample : This is done by picking every 5th or 10th unit at regular intervals. For example, to carry out a filaria survey in a town, we take 10 per cent sample. The houses are numbered first. Then a number is selected at random between 1and10 (say four). Then every 10th number is selected from that point on 4, 14, 24, 34, etc. By this method, each unit in the sampling frame would have the same chance of being selected, but the number of possible samples is greatly reduced. (3) Stratified random sample : The sample is deliberately drawn in a systematic way so that each poion of the sample represents a corresponding strata of the universe. This method is paicularly useful where one is interested in analysing the data by a ceain characteristic of the population, viz. Hindus, Christians, Muslims, age-groups etc. as we know these groups are not equally distributed in the population. It is useful to note at this stage that Greek letters are usually used to refer to population characteristics : mean (u), standard detion (cr), and Roman letters to indicate sample characteristics: mean ( x), standard detion (s).

The bicycle ergometer or the treadmill is currently used for most exercise testing programs. There are various exercise protocols such as the Bruce protocol or the Naughton protocol to assess effo tolerance. In all these protocols the subject is made to exercise in stages of increasing workloads until the end points are achieved. During exercise, various parameters like occurrence of symptoms, fluctuations in blood pressure changes in the ST segment, and changes in cardiac rate and rhythm are closely monitored. Although the stress test is fairly safe, it has to be done only under close medical supervision. Currently the main indications for stress testing are: 1. As a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of symptoms like effo induced chest pain, or palpitation. 2. To assess the prognosis and in the risk stratification of patients with coronary aery disease, either after acute events like myocardial infarction or angina, or after therapeutic interventions like coronary angioplasty or by pass surgery. 3. To assess the functional capacity in patients with ischemic hea disease, valvular hea disease, cardiomyopathy and patients undergoing cardiac surgery. 4. As a screening test for ischemic hea disease in subjects with an intermediate or high probability for the disease. The test is considered positive if there is flat or down sloping ST segment depression of 1 mm or more, ST segment elevation, inversion of U waves, fall in blood pressure and ischemic symptoms associated with ECG changes. Standard contraindications to exercise testing include acute myocardial infarction, high risk unstable angina pectoris, severe aoic stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, acute pulmonary embolism or infarction, acute myocarditis or pericarditis, aoic dissection, uncontrolled severe systemic hypeension > 200/100 mm Hg, high grade hea blocks, uncontrolled symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, any acute systemic illness or an unwilling patient. The indications to terminate exercise testing includes inappropriate drop in blood pressure or deceleration of the hea rate with increasing workload and exercise, moderate to severe angina, sustained VT, ST depression more than 3 mm or ST elevation in non Q leads, hypeensive response > 250/115 mm Hg, patient exhaustion, fatigue, leg cramps or claudication pain and subject's desire to stop the test. Exercise stress testing has a sensitivity of about 80 to 85% and a specificity of 85 to 90% for the diagnosis of coronary aery disease.

Old men with BP 210/110mm Hg are classified as sever hypertension. This type of data is -,Categorical,Numerical,Quantitative,Continuous,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Categorical o This question is tricky one -# Blood pressure itself is a continuous quantitative data.# But, classification into sever hypertension (wether severe hypertension is present or not) is qualitative (categorical) data.)Statistical datao There are basically two types of variables and they yeild two types of data.i) Categorial (qualitative) variable - yields non numerical (qualitative) data.ii) Numerical (quantitative) variable - Yields numerical (quantitative) data.i) Categorial (qualitative)o Categorial variables yield data in categories i.e., data may be divided into groups,o There is no numerical value - Variable can not be measured directly.o For example response to such question as ""what is your sex"" or ""Do you own a Car"" - The answer will be either a category (male or female) or yes/No - No numerical valueso Examples of categorial variables - Race, Sex, Blood group, Pesence of diabetes, obesity, type of anemia.o Qualitative data are measured on nominal and ordinal scales.ii) Numerical (quantitative)o Numerical variables yield data in numerical form - Variable can be measured directlyo For example response to such question ""How tall are you"" answer may be 4 feet, 5 feet, 5.5 feet.., numerical value.o Quantitative data can be further divided into : -a) Discrete variable# Discrete variable is one that cannot take on all values within the limits of the variable.# For example, response to a five-point rating scale can only take on the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.o The variable cannot have value 1.7.# So, discrete variable has few possible numericle values and no in-between values.# Discrete variable has no unit.# Far example - Number of children in a family, no offamily member; no of patients in a hospital.b) Continuous variable# Variables that can take on any numerical value are called continuous variable.# For example height of a person can be 5 feets, 5.2 feets, 5.5 feets, 6 feets.# So, continuous variable has a unit e.g., Kg, feets.# Examples - Weight, height, mid-arm circumference, blood sugar level, body mass index, serum cholesterol level, hemoglobin level, Bone density measurements, pulse rate, Body temperature.o Quantitative (numerical) data are measured on interval and ratio scales.Following important points require specific mention here : -o Though qualitative (categorial) data do not have numerical value, some times numerical value is used to classify the limit of qualitative data. For example : -1) All low birth weight children will have birth weight less than 2500 gm. So,a) Birth weight (which may be 2200 gm, 2500 gm, 2600 gm) is a continuous variable.b) Low birth weight (< 2500 gm) is a qualitative data because either a newborn have low birth weight or not.2) Blood cholesterol level (which may be 70, 80, 90, 200 mg/dl) is a quantitative variable but when it comes high or low blood cholesterol level, it becomes qualitative variable because a preson may either have low or high cholesterol level.3) Similarly blood sugar level is quantitative variable, while high or low blood sugar (presence or absence of diabetes) is a qualitative variable.4) Blood hemoglobin is a quantitative variable, while high or low hemoglobin (Presence or absence of anemia) is a qualitative variable.Note:o Pulse rate (PR) is considered as a continuous variable.o Immediately question comes to mind that how can pulse rate be a continues variable when pulse rate can only be 70/71... beats per minute but not in between value (70.1, 70.5 ...). However, this is only true when we count pulse for only 1 minute.o In other scenario, if the pulse rate is counted for 3 minutes and it comes 216, then the pulse rate will be 72.3 beats per minute - Therefore, pulse rate is considered as a continuous variable.",A

True about global warming is,CO2 is the major greenhouse gas,Stratosphere ozone layer is harmful,CFC increases stratosphere ozone layer,Kyoto protocol called for 20% reduction in greenhouse effect.,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. C02 is the major greenhouse gas CO2 and water vapour are the two most important and major greenhouse gases.Global warming is a vast topic to be discussed in detail here. So we will deal with it briefly in context of the given options.Global warming:Global warming is the increase in the temperature of earth's near-surface air and oceans.The global surface temperature has increased approximately 0.6 degC (1.3 degF) since the mid 20th century.This increase in temperature is caused by increasing concentration of greenhouse gases.Effects of global warmingWarming is expected to affect the Arctic most, and would be associated with continuing retreat of glaciers, permafrost and sea ice.Rising of sea levelExpansion of subtropical desertsChanges in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (like flood, storm etc.)Species extinctionsChanges in agricultural yield.Greenhouse gasesIn order, Earth's most abundant greenhouse gases are -Water vapour =60-70%Carbon dioxide = 55% (option a)Atmospheric methaneNitrous oxideOzoneChlorofluorocarbons (CFC)The main sources of greenhouse gases d/t human activity areBurning of fossil fuels & deforestation - | CO2Enteric fermentation in ruminant animals, paddy rice farming and covered vented garbage landfill emissions, drilling for oil and natural gas- | methane.Use of CFCs in refrigerator & use of CFC & halons in fire suppression systems.Use of fertilizers in agriculture | N2O.Greenhouse effect'Greenhouse effect' is the heating of the Earth d/t presence of greenhouse gases.It is named this way because of a similar effect produced by the glass panes of a green house.The shorter wavelength radiation from sun, is absorbed by the surface of the earth, causing it to worm. Part of the absorbed energy is then re-radiated back to atmosphere as long wave infrared radiation.The greenhouse gases selectively transmit the infrared waves, allowing some to pass through into space and some are absorbed. The absorbed waves are re-emitted downward, causing the lower atmosphere to warm.The greenhouse effect is essential for living beings on earth, as it makes the earth warm enough to live. (Without the greenhouse effect the earth surface would be 33 degC colder than at present!!!)But it is the 'enhanced' greenhouse effect due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases that is causing global warming.The clouds are the major non-gas contributor to the Earth's greenhouse effect.Ozone layers of atmosphereStratosphereIt is the highest level of ozone.It is spread b/w 10 km and 50 km above the Earth surfaceIt contains 90% of ozone of the atmosphereStratosphere is beneficial as it filters out the harmful ultraviolet rays from sun (option b)TroposphereIt is the lower most atmospheric layer extending from the surface to 10 km (18 km at poles).The troposphere contains ~ 80% mass of atmosphere.The ozone present in this layer is an atmospheric pollutant & also produces greenhouse effect.In recent decades the amount of ozone in the stratosphere has been declining mostly because of emissions of CFCs and similar chlorinated & brominated organic molecules (option c)Kyoto protocol:It is a protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).Aim is to stabilising greenhouse gas concentration to fight global warming.The protocol was initially adopted on 11th Dec 1997 in Kyoto, Japan & entered into force on 16th Feb 2005. By Nov 2009, 187 states have signed the protocol.Under this protocol 37 industrialised countries commit to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 5.2% from the 1990 level by 2008-2012(option d).Rest of the member countries have given general commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission.Also knowGlobal dimming, in simple words, is a phenomenon which produces forces opposite to global warming. Global dimming causes the amount of sun's rays reaching the earth's atmosphere to reduce & causes a drop of temperatures around the globe. It is thought to have been caused by an increase in atmospheric aerosols in the atmosphere due to human action.",A

The most important sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method is:,Root transparency,Root attrition,Root resorption,Paradentosis,"Ans. a. Root transparency (Ref: Reddy 33/e p70, 28/e p63-64)Root transparency is the most important sign of age determination as per Gustafson's method.Gustafson's MethodThe age estimation of adult over 21 years depends on the physiologic age changes in each of the dental tissues.AttritionQDue to wear and tear from mastication, occlusal (upper) surface of the teeth is destroyed gradually; first involving the enamel, then dentin, and at last, pulp is exposed in the old age.It depends on the functional use of the teeth and also up on the hardness of the enamel.ParadentosisQRegression of the gums and periodontal tissues surrounding the teeth takes place in the advancing age, gradually exposing the necks and adjacent parts of the roots, due to which the teeth become loose and fall off.Poor oral hygiene increases paradentosis.Secondary DentinQIt may develop from the walls w ithin the pulp cavity, and decrease the size of the cavity.First it is deposited at the pulp chamber and gradually extends downwards to the apex, and may completely fill the pulp cavity.This is partly due to ageing and partly due to pathological conditions like caries and paradentosis.Cementum AppositionQThe cementum increases in thickness particularly due to changes in the tooth position, especially near the end of the root.Secondary cementum is slowly and continuously deposited throughout life and forms incremental lines.Incremental lines (devised by Boyde) appear as cross-striations on the enamel of teeth due to cementum apposition, and are thought to represent daily increments of growth.They can be seen on histological section.The age can be calculated by counting the number of lines from the neonatal line onwards.This is mainly applicable to infants.Root ResorptionQIt involves both cementum and dentin, which show characteristically sharp grooves.Absorption of the root starts first at the apex and extends upwards.It usually occurs in the late age.It may be due to pathological process.Transparency of the RootQIt is not seen until about 30 years of age.The canals in the dentin are at first wide.With age they are filled by mineral, so that they become invisible and the dentin becomes transparent.It is the most reliable of all criteriaQ.",A

Meningitis (Ref: Ananthanarayan 8/e p331)Meningitis is not caused by non-typable Hib.'Diseases due to H. influenza may be considered under two groups, invasive and noninvasive.In the first group, the bacillus acts as a primary pathogen, causing acute invasive infections. The bacilli spread through blood, being protected from phagocytes by their capsule. Haemophilus meningitis is the most important infection in this group, others being laryngoepiglottits, conjunctivitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, arthritis, endocarditis and pericarditis. These infections are usually seen in children and are caused by the capsulated strains, type b accounting for most cases. In the second group, the bacillus spreads by local invasion along mucosal surfaces and causes secondary or superadded infections, usually of the respiratory tract. These include otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. These are usually seen in adults and are often caused the non-capsulated strains.

Which of the following investigation is used in the detection and confirmation of HIV ?,Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR),Reverse Transcriptase-PCR,Real Time PCR,Mimic PCR,"Amount of virion packaged HIV 1 RNA in the peripheral blood is an impoant measure of disease activity and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. This genomic viral RNA can be measured by -PCR. HIV1 RNA detection assays are highly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of HIV1 infection. PCR is extremely sensitive but cross contamination can occur. The standard blood screening test for HIV infection is the ELISA. The most commonly used confirmatory test is the Western blot. Western blot demonstrates antibodies to products of all three of the major genes of HIV (gag, pol, and env). The CD4+T cell count is the laboratory test generally accepted as the best indicator of the immediate state of immunologic competence of the patient with HIV infection. The hallmark of HIV disease progression is decline in the absolute number and percentage of CD4 T lymphocytes and an increasing percentage of CD8 T lymphocytes. In the early weeks after acute HIV infection acquired by high-risk behaviors, HIV antibody may be absent. Most patients will seroconve by 6 weeks.

Herpes zoster may involve the eyelid when the first or second branch of the fifth cranial nerve is affected. Prompt treatment with an antiviral such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir shortens symptomatic illness and decreases the chance of post-zoster neuralgia. Impetigo is a cellulitis caused by group A-hemolytic streptococci. It often involves the face and can occur after an abrasion of the skin. Its distribution is not dermatomal, and it rarely causes severe pain. Chickenpox produces vesicles in various stages of development that are diffuse and produce more pruritus than pain. Coxsackievirus can produce a morbilliform vesiculopustular rash, often with a haemorrhagic component and with lesions of the throat, palms, and soles.

Nicotinamide is an essential pa of the two pyridine nucleotides, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), which play a key role as hydrogen acceptors and donors for many enzymes. Niacin can be synthesised in the body in limited amounts from the amino acid tryptophan. Deficiency - pellagra Pellagra was formerly endemic among poor people who subsisted chiefly on maize, which contains niacytin, a form of niacin that the body is unable to utilise. Pellagra can develop in only 8 weeks in individuals eating diets that are very deficient in niacin and tryptophan. It remains a problem in pas of Africa, and is occasionally seen in alcoholics and in patients with chronic small intestinal disease in developed countries. Pellagra can occur in Hanup's disease, a genetic disorder characterised by impaired absorption of several amino acids, including tryptophan. It is also seen occasionally in carcinoid syndrome (p. 678), when tryptophan is consumed in the excessive production of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Pellagra has been called the disease of the three Ds: * Dermatitis. Characteristically, there is erythema resembling severe sunburn, appearing symmetrically over the pas of the body exposed to sunlight, paicularly the limbs and especially on the neck but not the face (Casal's necklace, Fig. 19.13). The skin lesions may progress to vesiculation, cracking, exudation and secondary infection. * Diarrhoea. This is often associated with anorexia, nausea, glossitis and dysphagia, reflecting the presence of a non-infective inflammation that extends throughout the gastrointestinal tract. * Dementia. In severe deficiency, delirium occurs acutely and dementia develops in chronic cases. Treatment is with nicotinamide, given in a dose of 100 mg 3 times daily orally or parenterally. The response is usually rapid. Within 24 hours the erythema diminishes, the diarrhoea ceases and a striking improvement occurs in the patient's mental state. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 98e",D

Plain film of the knee shows linear calcification of the articular cartilage without destructive change. Definitive diagnosis is best made by which of the following?",Serum uric acid,Serum calcium,Arthrocentesis and identification of positively birefringent rhomboid crystals,Rheumatoid factor,"Acute monoarticular arthritis in association with linear calcification of the cartilage of the knee (chondrocalcinosis) suggests the diagnosis of pseudogout, a form of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPDD) disease. In its acute manifestation, the disease resembles gout. Positively birefringent crystals (looking blue when parallel to the axis of the red compensator on a polarizing microscope) can be demonstrated in joint fluid, although careful search is sometimes necessary. Serum uric acid and calcium levels are normal, as are rheumatoid factor and ANA. Pseudogout is about half as common as gout but becomes more common after the age of 65. CPPDD disease is diagnosed in symptomatic patients by characteristic x-ray findings and crystals in synovial fluid. Pseudogout is treated with NSAIDs, colchicine, or steroids. Arthrocentesis and drainage with intra-articular steroid administration is also an effective treatment. Linear calcifications or chondrocalcinosis are often found in the joints of elderly patients who do not have symptomatic joint problems; such patients do not require treatment.",C

Claviceps fusiformis is responsible for,Neurolatyrism,Ergotism,Epidemic dropsy,Endemic ascites,"Ergot Unlike Aspergillus, ergot is not a storage fungus, but a field fungus. Foodgrains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat have a tendency to get infested during the flowering stages by the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea). Fungus grows as a blackish mass and the seeds become black and irregular and are harvested along with food grains. Consumption of ergot infested grain leads to ergotism. Sporadic outbreaks of ergot poisoning in human population have been repoed from time to time in areas where bajra is consumed as a staple. The symptoms are acute but rarelyfatal and include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness and drowsiness extending sometimes for periods upto 24 to 48 hours after the ingestion of ergoty grain. In chronic cases, painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries have been repoed. However, the long-term effects of consuming small amounts of the Toxin are not known. A disquieting feature is that the recently introduced high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to infestation. Ergot-infested grains can be easily removed by floating them in 20 per cent salt water. They can also be removed by hand-picking or air floatation. The upper safe limit for the ergot alkaloids has been estimated to be 0.05 mg per 100 grams of the food material. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 694",B

Mendelson's syndrome refers fo-,Aspiration of gastric content,Rupture of bronchial tuberculoma.,Transient pneumonitis of allergic origin,Tracheal compression due to nodal enlargement,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Aspiration of gastric contentso Mendelson 's syndrome is chemical pneumonitis caused by aspiration of gastric contents during anaesthesia.Classification of aspiration pneumoniao Aspiration pneumonia is characterized by:o The character of the inoculum, pathogenesis of the pulmonary conditions, presentation, and management guidelines. All these features assist in distinguishing clinical syndromes within the category of aspiration pneumonia.o The three syndromes that are most frequently seen clinically and best studied are -# Chemical pneumonitis,# Bacterial infection, and# Airway obstruction.Chemical pneumonitiso The term chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of substances that are toxic to the lower airways, independent of bacterial infection.o The prototype and best studied clinical example is chemical pneumonitis associated with the aspiration of gastric acid first described by Mendelson and sometimes referred to as Mendelson's syndrome.The production of chemical pneumonitiso Require an inoculum that has a pH of < 2-5 and that is relatively large (usually I to 4 mL/kg).o This would translate to an inoculum of at least 25 mL of gastric acid in adult humans. It is probable that smaller volumes produce a more subtle process that either escapes clinical detection or causes a less fulminant form of pneumonitis.o The clinical observation that patients with esophageal or gastric reflux experience frequent bouts of recurrent pneumonitis, often accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis, supports this concept.Clinical featureso The following clinical features should raise the possibility of chemical pneumonitis# Abrupt onset of symptoms with prominent dyspnea# Fever, which is usually low grade# Cyanosis and diffuse crackles on lung auscultation# Severe hypoxemia and infiltrates on chest imaging involving dependent pulmonary segments. The dependent lobes in the upright position are the lower lobes. However, aspiration that occurs while patients are in the recumbent position may result in infection in the superior segments of the lower lobes and the posterior segments of the upper lobes.",A

What is false in relation to Carey Coombs Murmur?,Delayed Diastolic Murmur,Seen in Rheumatic Fever,Associated with AR,Low pitched Murmur,"In rheumatic carditis, the mitral valve is involved three times as frequently as the aoic valve. Therefore, mitral murmurs are more common. Mitral regurgitation is the most common finding. Mitral valvulitis during an episode of acute rheumatic fever can frequently cause sho mid-diastolic rumble, heard over the apical area. This is called the Carey Coombs murmur, and its presence almost ceainly confirms mitral valvulitis. Carey Coombs murmur may occur in association with the murmur of mitral regurgitation.Carey Coombs murmur is a soft, low-pitched murmur.Carey Coombs murmur is not due to mitral stenosis. It probably represents turbulence from minute vegetations on the mitral valve surface and from stiffening of the valve itself.This rumble, especially in children or in the presence of fever and anemia, can be introduced by an S3 rather than by an OS.Aoic insufficiency can be auscultated with aoic valvulitis.Ref: Hurst's ""The Hea"" 13/e p301, 882, 1688",C

Randomization is done in clinical trials to:,Avoid selection bias inside the study group,To avoid bias from general population,To eliminate comparability,Option not recalled,Ans. A. Avoid selection bias inside the study groupExplanationRandomization is a statistical procedure by which participants are allocated to study and control groups in a Randomized control trail.Randomization is the heart of a control trial. It ensures investigator has no control over allocation process and thus eliminates selection bias and thus every individual gets equal chance of being allocated to either of the groups.By definition distortions that result from procedures used to select subjects and from factors that influence participation in the study is called selection bias.The estimated effect of cigarette smoking on heart disease will be biased if study participants are volunteers and the decision to volunteer is affected by smoking status.,A

Albright's syndrome includes all except -,Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia,Precocious pubey in girls,Patchy pigmentation,Pseudo hypoparathyroidism,"cCune-Albright syndrome is a disorder that affects the bones, skin, and several hormone-producing (endocrine) tissues. People with McCune-Albright syndrome develop areas of abnormal scar-like (fibrous) tissue in their bones, a condition called polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Polyostotic means the abnormal areas (lesions) may occur in many bones; often they are confined to one side of the body. Replacement of bone with fibrous tissue may lead to fractures, uneven growth, and deformity. When lesions occur in the bones of the skull and jaw it can result in uneven (asymmetric) growth of the face. Asymmetry may also occur in the long bones; uneven growth of leg bones may cause limping. Abnormal curvature of the spine may also occur. In addition to bone abnormalities, affected individuals usually have light brown patches of skin called cafe-au-lait spots, which may be present from bih . Girls with McCune-Albright syndrome may reach pubey early. These girls often have menstrual bleeding by age 2. This early onset of menstruation is believed to be caused by excess estrogen, About 50 percent of affected individuals produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (hypehyroidism), resulting in a fast hea rate, high blood pressure, weight loss, tremors, sweating, and other symptoms. Excess growth hormone secretion may also lead to increased expansion of the fibrous dysplasia in the bones, most visibly in the skul Rarely, affected individuals develop Cushing syndrome and it causes weight gain in the face and upper body, slowed growth in children, fragile skin, fatigue, and other health problems. In people with McCune-Albright syndrome, Cushing syndrome occurs only before age 2 . Ref - <a style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"" href=""",C

Decreased activity of type I 5'-monodeiodinase could lead to which physiologic effects,Increased plasma triiodothyronine (T3),Increased plasma reverse T3,Decreased plasma thyroxine T4,Increased TSH,"Type I 5'-monodeiodinase is the enzyme responsible for the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), primarily in liver and kidney. This enzyme also paicipates in the breakdown of reverse T3 (rT3) by conveing it to 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Decreased activity of type I 5'-monodeiodinase will, therefore, decrease plasma levels of T3 and increase plasma levels of rT3 (by decreasing its breakdown). Type II 5'-monodeiodinase is present in the anterior pituitary and central nervous system. Conversion of T 4 to T 3 within the anterior pituitary by this enzyme is responsible for normal feedback inhibition of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. With decreased type, I 5'-monodeiodinase activity, plasma levels ofT4 and TSH usually stay within normal limits because the type II enzyme continues to ensure normal feedback inhibition by anterior pituitary T 3.

All are true about emphysema except:,Cyanosis,Barrel-shaped chest,Associated with smoking,Type 1 respiratory failure,"OPTION A) CLINICAL FEATURE OF EMPHYSEMA SYMPTOMS; The three most common symptoms in COPD are cough, sputum production, and exeional dyspnea. Activities involving significant arm work, paicularly at or above shoulder level, are paicularly difficult for many patients with COPD . the principal feature is worsening dyspnea on exeion with increasing intrusion on the ability to perform vocational or avocational activities. In the most advanced stages- patients are breathless doing simple activities of daily living. CLINICAL FEATURE OF COPD - EMPHYSEMA The classic presentation of emphysema with no ""bronchitic"" component. Patients barrel-chested and dyspneic, with prolonged expiration, sitting forward in a hunched-over position. In these patients, air space enlargement is severe and diffusing capacity is low. Dyspnea and hyperventilation are prominent, so that until very late in the disease, gas exchange is adequate and blood gas values are relatively normal. Because of prominent dyspnea and adequate oxygenation of hemoglobin, these patients sometimes are sometimes called ""pink puffers."" CHRONIC BRONCHITIS -emphysema with pronounced chronic bronchitis and a history of recurrent infections. Dyspnea usually is less prominent, and in the absence of increased respiratory drive the patient retains carbon dioxide, becoming hypoxic and often cyanotic .such patients tend to be obese--hence the designation ""blue bloaters."" OPTION 2) ON PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Early stages of COPD, patients usually have an entirely normal physical examination. More severe disease, the physical examination - prolonged expiratory phase and may include expiratory wheezing. Signs of hyperinflation 1) barrel chest and enlarged lung volumes with poor diaphragmatic excursion as assessed by percussion. 2)Patients with severe airflow obstruction -use of accessory muscles of respiration, sitting in the characteristic ""tripod"" position to facilitate the actions of the sternocleidomastoid, scalene, and intercostal muscles. 3 CYANOSIS if emphysema with chronic bronchitis Patients may develop cyanosis, visible in the lips and nail beds. 4) SIGN OF ADVANCED COPD cachexia ,significant weight loss, bitemporal wasting, anddiffuse loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is seen in the following conditions except-,Hemolysis,Gilbe syndrome,Crigler-Najjar syndrome,Dubin-Johnson syndrome,"Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism . It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Ref Davidson 23e p897",B

Disorders of Hemoglobin Methemoglobinemia:Methemoglobin is generated by oxidation of the heme iron moieties to the ferric state, causing a characteristic bluish-brown muddy color resembling cyanosis. Methemoglobin has such high oxygen affinity that virtually no oxygen is delivered.Hypotension is seen in methemoglobinemia due to hemolysisMethemoglobin should be suspected in patients with hypoxic symptoms who appear cyanotic but have a Pa02 sufficiently high that hemoglobin should be fully saturated with oxygen.A history of nitrite or other oxidant ingestions may not always be available; some exposures may be unapparent to the patient, and others may result from suicide attempts.The characteristic muddy appearance of freshly drawn blood can be a critical clue.The best diagnostic test is methemoglobin assay, which is usually available on an emergency basis.Methemoglobinemia often causes symptoms of cerebral ischemia at levels >15%; levels >60% are usually lethal.Intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of methylene blue is effective emergency therapy. Milder cases and follow-up of severe cases can be treated orally with methylene blue (60 mg three to four times each day) or ascorbic acid (300-600 mg/d).(Same features can be seen in hypovolemic shock, hemorrhagic and cardiogenic shock but what catches the answer is presence of central cyanosis and presence of chocolate color blood)",A

Which test is not useful in a patient with history of syncopal attack,Electrophyciological test,Table tilt test,PET scan,Holter monitoring,"positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has enhanced the detection of localized infections and of occult neoplasms and lymphomasPET scanning appears to be superior to other forms of nuclear imaging. The FDG used in PET scans accumulates in tumors and at sites of inflammation and has even been shown to accumulate reliably at sites of vasculitis. Where available, FDG PET scanning should therefore be chosen over 67 Ga scanning in the diagnosis of FUO.PET scans using fluorodopa demonstrate diminished striatal dopamine formation and storage. In addition to hypometabolism in the putamen, severe caudate involvement on PET scanning distinguishes PSP from Parkinson's disease .PET scanning attempts to identify sites of malignancy based on glucose metabolism by measuring the uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose F18. Rapidly dividing cells, presumably in the lung tumors, will preferentially take up 18 F-FDG and appear as a ""hot spot."" To date, PET has been used for staging and detection of metastases in lung cancer and in the detection of nodules >15 mm in diameter.

Immersion syndrome is also called as -,Hydrocution,Wet drowning,Dry drowning,Secondary drowning,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hydrocutiono Immersion syndrome - is also called as hydrocution or submersion inhibition or vagal inhibition.Atypical drowning# It refers to drowning in which even after submersion of body in water, little or no water anters respiratory passages and lungs. Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form offroth and oedema aquosum of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be :Dry drowning: On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm.Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition): Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium.Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state.Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome): In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis. The death occurs due to combined effect of cerebral hypoxia, pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonitis, electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis.",A

The typical presentation is as illustrated in the question stem. The deficiency may involve either or both IgG2 and IgG3 with or without IgG4 deficiency. (IgG1 is the major form, and its deficiency leads to a deficiency of total IgG, and so, by definition, it is not considered a ""subclass"" deficiency.)

True about Dextrain -,Cause Rouleaux formation,Impair factor VIIIO function,Sugar level,) Improve microcirculation,"The reversible aggregation of human red blood cells (RBC) continues to be of interest in the field of hemorheology because RBC aggregation is a major determinant of the in vitro rheological propeies of blood. Enhanced aggregation increases low shear blood viscosity and the degree of non-Newtonian behavior (1,2). In addition, the in vivo flow dynamics and flow resistance of blood are influenced by RBC aggregation (3), and marked increases of RBC aggregation have been observed in several diseases associated with vascular disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypeension). Measures of RBC aggregation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are commonly used as diagnostic tests and as one index to the efficacy of therapy. For example, ESR is measured during drug therapy for rheumatoid ahritis, and has been shown to be normalized by improved glycemic control in diabetes (4). There is now general agreement regarding the correlations between elevated levels of fibrinogen or other large plasma proteins and enhanced RBC aggregation, and the effects of molecular mass and concentration for neutral polymers have been repoed (5). However, the specific mechanisms involved in RBC aggregation have not been fully elucidated, and thus it is not yet possible to fully understand the relations between pathology and altered RBC aggregation. RBC form multicell linear or branched aggregates in vitro when they are suspended in either plasma or solutions containing large polymers (e.g., dextran >=40 kDa); RBC aggregates also form in vivo in regions of low flow or stasis and, hence, in regions of low shear. These linear forms are often termed rouleaux because they resemble a stack of coins. It is impoant to note that RBC aggregation is a reversible process, with aggregates dispersed by mechanical or fluid flow forces and then reforming when the forces are removed. Conversely, RBC agglutination and blood coagulation are irreversible processes due to either protein polymerization or strong antigen-antibody attractive forces. RBC aggregation is primarily determined by the type and concentration of polymers in solution or the plasma level of large proteins and by RBC aggregability (i.e., the intrinsic cell characteristics affecting RBC aggregation) In blood, the protein fibrinogen is a primary determinant of blood viscosity due to its strong tendency to increase both plasma viscosity and RBC aggregation In the past, most repos have primarily examined the ability of plasma proteins to promote aggregation; for example, higher fibrinogen levels have been linked to elevated blood viscosities in hypeensive patients Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1079",A

Radiography ofthe forearm revealed interosseous membrane calcification and radiography ofthe spine revealed a rugger-jersey appearance (striated pattern of increased density in the upper and lower zones of the veebrae). The probable diagnosis is",Silicosis,Fluorosis,Vitamin B toxicity,Hypercalcinosis,"Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease caused by excessive accumulation of fluoride in the bones. In advanced cases, skeletal fluorosis causes painful damage to bones and joints. Symptoms are mainly promoted in the bone structure. Due to a high fluoride concentration in the body, the bone is hardened and thus less elastic, resulting in an increased frequency of fractures. Other symptoms include thickening of the bone structure and accumulation of bone tissue, which both contribute to impaired joint mobility. Ligaments and cailage can become ossified. Most patients suffering from skeletal fluorosis show side effects from the high fluoride dose such as ruptures of the stomach lining and nausea. Fluoride can also damage the parathyroid glands, leading to hyperparathyroidism, the uncontrolled secretion of parathyroid hormones. These hormones regulate calcium concentration in the body. An elevated parathyroid hormone concentration results in a depletion of calcium in bone structures and thus a higher calcium concentration in the blood. As a result, bone flexibility decreases making the bone more susceptible to fractures Mechanism of action The best way to view the mechanism of action by which fluorine breaks down bones and causes skeletal fluorosis is in a stepwise fashion. Fluoride enters the body by two paths: Ingestion or respiration. Both paths lead to corrosion of exposed tissue in high concentrations. Since the most likely form of fluoride to enter the body is hydrogen fluoride (HF) gas, this is what stas the process. Exposed tissues will be utilized by HF in neutralization reactions. This will leave F- free to pass fuher into the body. It reacts with the concentrated HCl in the stomach to form the weak acid, HF. This compound is then absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and passes into the liver the poal vein. Since elemental F is one of the strongest oxidizers currently known, the anion F- is immune to phase 1 metabolic reactions, which are generally oxidation reactions, in the liver. These reactions are the body's first line of defense to biotransform harmful compounds into something more hydrophilic and more easily excreted. The HF is now free to pass into the blood stream and be distributed to all tissues including bones. Bones are largely composed of Ca compounds, paicularly carbonated hydroxyapatite (Ca 5(PO 4) 3(OH)); the reaction of Ca2+ ions and HF forms an insoluble salt, CaF 2. This salt must be cleared by the body, which concomitantly leaches out some of the calcium that would be pa of the bone matrix. This process results in increased density, but decreased strength in bones As of now, there are no established treatments for skeletal fluorosis patients. However, it is reversible in some cases, depending on the progression of the disease. If fluorine intake is stopped, the amount in bone will decrease and be excreted urine. However, it is a very slow process to eliminate the fluorine from the body completely. Minimal results are seen in patients. Treatment of side effects is also very difficult. For example, a patient with a bone fracture cannot be treated according to standard procedures, because the bone is very brittle. In this case, recovery will take a very long time and a pristine healing cannot be guaranteed. However, fuher fluorosis can be prevented by drinking defluoridated water. It is recently suggested that drinking of defluoridated water from the ''calcium amended-hydroxyapatite'' defluoridation method may help in the fluorosis reversal. Defluoridated water from this suggested method provides calcium-enriched alkaline drinking water as generally fluoride contaminated water has a low amount of calcium mineral and drinking alkaline water helps in eliminating the toxic fluoride from the body Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 715",B

Sjogren's syndrome classically presents with keratoconjunctivitis (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth, often resulting in dental caries and fissures in the oral mucosa). These symptoms are due to autoimmune involvement with subsequent scarring of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Parotid gland enlargement is common, as is vasculitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, hyperviscosity syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma is not related to the presence of dental caries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Abdominal pain, hematuria, renal failure, hypeension, and leukocytosis may occur.

Oral polio vaccine was developed by -,Louis Pasteur,Albe Sabin,Jonas Salk,None,"<p>OPV/ Sabin vaccine Live attenuated . Developed by Albe sabin. Contains type 1,2 and 3 viruses grown in primary monkey kidney/human diploid cell culture. Administration:- WHO programme on immunisation (EPI) and the national immunisation program in India recommend a primary course of 3 doses of vaccine with 1 month interval commencing at 6 weeks. It is recommended that a dose of OPV is required to be given to all children delivered in the hospital before discharge. Very impoant to complete vaccination before 6 months before most cases occur between 6 months- 3 years. Dose -2 drops Immunity:- prevents paralysis and intestinal reinfection. Thus limits virus transmission in community . The vaccine progeny excreted in faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunised persons may therefore become immunised. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemic . Advantages:- Antibodies quickly produced and therefore helps to control epidemic. Induces both humoral and intestinal immunity. Easy to administer. Complication:- Vaccine associated paralytic polio in recipients of vaccine and their contacts . Contraindications:- Immunocompromised. Malignancy . Leukemia. Storage-Requires to be stored and transpoed at sub zero temperature,unless stabilized. Problems with OPV:- 1. Instability of vaccine at high temperatures. 2. Frequent vaccine failures. 3. Small residual neurovirulence.

"Which of the following is more likely to occur in salt water, rather than fresh water drowning?",Volume overload,Faster death,Hemolytic anemia,Hypervolemia,"Salt water drowning results in faster death than fresh water drowning. Salt water causes an osmotic shift of water into the alveolar spaces, with subsequent impaired oxygenation/ventilation and death (usually within 6 to 7 minutes). Patients have hypovolemia from these osmotic movements of fluid, and hemolysis is not a significant feature. As it enters the lungs, fresh water destroys surfactant activity, leading to alveolar collapse and intrapulmonary shunting (perfusion without ventilation). Water is reabsorbed into the vascular system, producing volume overload with subsequent hyponatremia and hemolysis of red blood cells.

Second National Family Health Survey was done in the year?,1992-93,1998-99,2005-2006,2008-2009,"The second National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2), conducted in 1998-99, is another impoant step to strengthen the database fuher for implementation of the Reproductive and Child Health approach adopted by India after the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. The second National Family Health Survey is the outcome of collaborative effos of many organizations. The International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) was designated as the nodal agency for this project by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Government of India, New Delhi. The project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with additional suppo from UNICEF. Technical guidance was provided by Macro International and the East-West Center, USA. Responsibility for data collection was entrusted to 13 reputed organizations in India, including some Population Research Centres. As in the earlier survey, the principal objective of NFHS-2 is to provide state and national estimates of feility, the practice of family planning, infant and child moality, maternal and child health and the utilization of health services provided to mothers and children. In addition, the survey includes information on the quality of health and family welfare services and provides indicators of the status of women, women's reproductive health, and domestic violence. Another feature of NFHS-2 is measurement of the nutritional status of women. Height and weight measurements, which were available only for young children in the earlier survey, were extended to cover all eligible women in NFHS-2. In addition, ever-married women and their children below age three had their blood tested for the level of haemoglobin, using the HemoCue instrument. Through these blood tests, for the first time the survey provides information on the prevalence of anaemia throughout India. In two metropolitan cities, Delhi and Mumbai, a fuher test was done for children below age three to measure the lead content in their blood. The survey also measured the extent to which households in India use cooking salt that has been foified with iodine. The survey covers a representative sample of about 91,000 ever-married women age 15-49 from 26 states in India who were covered in two phases, the first staing in November 1998 and the second in March 1999. The survey provides state-level estimates of demographic and health parameters as well as data on various socioeconomic and programmatic dimensions, which are critical for bringing about the desired change in demographic and health parameters. One impoant feature of NFHS-2 is the data on the nutritional status of women and children collected by carrying out blood tests for haemoglobin levels in addition to the measurement of their height and weight.

Examination of victim Victim cannot be examined without written informed consent. Informed written consent should be obtained if the age of victim is above 12 years. If she is less than 12 years of age or if she is mentally unsound, the written consent of parent/guardian should be taken (Sec. 90 IPC). Victim (female) should be examined by or under supervision of a female RMP (Sec. 53(2) CrPC). Finding which are suggestive of rape are :- Signs of struggle on clothes (tear, blood, semen, mud etc), body and genitals (abrasion, contusion, bites or nail marks etc). Presence of the semen in the vagina (proof of sexual intercourse). Presence of spermatozoa in the vagina. Locards principal of exchange states that whenever two bodies come in contact with each other, there is exchange of material between the two and so a criminal can be linked to crime. In case of rape, piece of cloth, button, hair, blood, saliva, semen or smegma from the accused may be found on the body of victim and conversly materials of victim may be found on the body of accused. Presence of smegma bacilli in vagina is suggestive of coitus. B.Examination of accused An accused can be examined even without his consent (Sec 53(A) CrPC). Findings may be Presence of torn frenulum is consistent with a recent intercourse. The presence of smegma under prepuce is inconsistent with recent intercoures as it gets rubbed off during sexual intercourse and may be deposited in vagina. It takes about 24 hours to accumulate.

"An 80-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis due to a urinary tract infection. While in the ICU she develops atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is treated with a loading dose of amiodarone. She converts to sinus rhythm and is sent home on amiodarone to prevent recurrences of atrial fibrillation. In the following weeks she develops increasing fatigue, dry skin, and constipation and her internist finds her TSH to be 25. She is in sinus rhythm. What is the best approach in this situation?",Stop the amiodarone and follow the TSH and the clinical response.,Start low dose levothyroxine and repeat TSH in 6 weeks.,Start a beta-blocker and begin weaning off the amiodarone.,Check for anti-TPO antibodies to help guide your decision.,"Amiodarone is a widely used antiarrhythmic drug. It is related structurally to thyroid hormone and is stored in adipose tissue. The drug has a high iodine content as well. Taking amiodarone on an ongoing basis can lead to hypothyroidism by inhibiting deiodinase activity and by acting as a direct antagonist to T4 . In some cases, amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism resolves within a few months; however, in many, especially when accompanying anti-TPO antibodies are present, treatment with levothyroxine is needed. This can be easily monitored and adjusted. While answer a is a consideration, the patient likely needs the amiodarone given her tendency toward paroxysms of atrial fibrillation and the attendant risk of stroke. While starting a beta-blocker may prevent episodes of rapid ventricular response, this decision would be made with the help of her cardiologist, which is not mentioned. Anti-TPO antibodies increase the risk of hypothyroidism but are not necessary to guide therapy in this patient. Although prednisone may be used for treatment of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, this patient has hypothyroidism, and prednisone is not indicated.",B

"A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following arterial blood gas analysis report: pH is 7.12 , PCO2 is 18 mm Hg HCO3– is 12 mmol/L. The resulting acid-base abnormality can be best labelled",Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis,"First step

Determine whether it is acidosis or alkalosis
Low pH (7.2) means that it is acidosis

Second step

Observe HCO3-/ CO2 to determine the cause of acidosis or a decrease in pH
Decreased PCO2 means respiratory alkalosis
Decreased HCO3- means metabolic acidosis
The abnormality which is in sync with the change in pH, i.e., the abnormality which is causing acidosis is decreased HCO3- So, the primary abnormality in the case is metabolic acidosis

Third step

The third step requires determining whether the patient's compensation is appropriate or not.
Refer to the table
Change in HCO3- →12 mmol / L
Expected change in PCO2 → 1.25 x 12 mmol =15 for 12 mmol change in HCO3-
 (PaCO2 is expected to decrease 1.25 mm Hg for each mmol/L decrease in HCO3-)
Thus, the decrease in PCO2 is more than the expected. This suggests that there must be coexisting respiratory alkalosis, which causes more than the expected decrease in PCO2.",A

There are many situations, in medical and public health organisations, where medical social workers are being employed, e.g., hospitals, tuberculosis clinics, family planning clinics, cancer control centres, mental health, maternal and child welfare, school and university health services. The medical social worker forms a link between the institution where he is employed and the community. The principal work of the medical social worker is to visit the family and probe into the personal, economic and social causes of illness and collect social history of the patient with a view to supplement the medical history. The medical social worker also tries to secure help to the patient through the *community resources. In chronic disabling illnesses like tuberculosis, leprosy and poliomyelitis, the medical social worker helps in the rehabilitation of the patient. The medical social worker is now recognized as anessential professional colleague of the doctor in the analysis and correction of the social and emotional factors and is increasingly relied upon for supplying information that is of fundamental impoance in formulating the complete diagnosis and in directing the treatment of many patients. A medical social worker bears the same relationship to the effectiveness of social medicine, as does the nurse to clinical medicine. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 723",B

In the absence of symptoms or findings to suggest one of the other conditions, laboratory tests that show a mild anemia, a positive HLA-B27 (present in 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis), an elevated sedimentation rate, and symmetrical sacroiliitis on x-ray would all be very supportive of the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. The prognosis in ankylosing spondylitis is generally good, with only 6% dying of the disease itself. While pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung disease can occur, they are rarely a cause of death (cervical fracture, heart block, and amyloidosis are leading causes of death as a result of ankylosing spondylitis).

It involves preventing the emergence and spread of CHD risk factors and life-styles that have not yet appeared or become endemic. This applies to developing countries in paicular. These countries should seek to preserve their traditional eating patterns and life- styles associated with low levels of CHD risk factors. Since the aetiology of CHD is multifactorial the approach to prevention should be multifactorial aimed at controlling or modifying as many risk factors as possible. The aim should be to change the community as a whole, not the individual subjects living in it. Several well-planned risk factor intervention trials (e.g., The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) in the US , The Stanford Hea Disease Prevention Programme in California, and The Noh Kerelia Project in Finland have demonstrated that primary prevention can achieve substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary hea disease.

Historically, the literature has supported the notion of a spinal cord ""watershed zone"" of ischemic vulnerability centered at the mid-thoracic level (T4 to T6 level). This assumption was based largely on anatomic studies and case reports describing the relative hypovascularity of the midthoracic region from approximately T4 to T8. Because of the anatomic distribution of the spinal cord arteries with the relative paucity of radicular arteries in the thoracic region, the midthoracic level (T4 to T8) has been recognized as the ischemic watershed zone of the spinal cord.",B

Which of the following tests is used to distinguish Primary Hyperparathyroidsm from Familial Benign Hypercalcemia:,Serum PTH Levels,Srum Calcium levels,Urinary Calcium levels,Serum Phosphorus levels,"Answer is C (Urinary Calcium levels): Estimation of urinary calcium excretion is the most impoant test to distinguish Familial Benign Hypercalcemia from Primary Hyperparathyroidism. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (also called familial Benign Hypercalcemia) overlaps mild cases of Primary Hyperparathyroidism biochemically, hormonally and clinically. PTH Concentrations do not distinguish the two disorders. Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (also called Familial Benign Hypercalcemia) is typically associated with decreased excretion of calcium in urine while calcium excretion in urine is increased in Primary Hyperparathyroidism. Increased excretion of calcium can be estimated by 24-hour urinary calcium excretion or by the calcium creatinine clearance ratio both of which are typically decreased in Familial Benign Hypercalcemia",C

Main period of communicability of whooping cough -,Incubation period,Paroxysmal stage,Catarrhal stage,Convalescent stage,"<p> Peussis/Whooping cough:- An acute infectious disease ,usually of young children, caused by B.peussis. Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as ""Hundred day cough"". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated. Incubation period-7-14 days , but not more than 3 weeks. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.167}</p>",C
Feature of septicshockis-,Acute tubular necrosis,Acute coical necrosis,Acute glomerulonephritis,Acute papillary damage,"Septic shock The hallmark of septic shock is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance that occurs despite increased levels of vasopressor catecholamines. Before this vasodilatory phase, many patients experience a period during which oxygen delivery to tissues is compromised by myocardial depression, hypovolemia, and other factors. During this ""hypodynamic"" period, the blood lactate concentration is elevated and central venous oxygen saturation LOW. Fluid administration is usually followed by the hyperdynamic, vasodilatory phase during which cardiac output is normal (or even high) and oxygen consumption declines despite adequate oxygen delivery. The blood lactate level may be normal or increased, and normalization of central venous oxygen saturation may reflect either improved oxygen delivery or left-to-right shunting. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2228",A

The underlying defect is a decrease in the number of available acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at NMJs due to an antibody-mediated autoimmune attack. If weakness remains restricted to the EOMs for 3 years, it is likely that it will not become generalized, and these patients are said to have ocular MG. The limb weakness in MG is often proximal and may be asymmetric. Despite the muscle weakness, deep tendon reflexes are preserved. If ventilatory weakness becomes requires respiratory assistance, the patient is said to be in crisis.

Which of the following statement is true about NetProtein Utilization?,It is the ratio of energy from protein to total energy in diet,It is the ratio of total nitrogen retained by total nitrogen intake multiplied by 100,It is the amount of one amino acid per gram of a protein divided by the amount of same amino acid per gram of egg protein,If the NPU is high the amount of protein,"It is the ratio of total nitrogen retained by total nitrogen intake multiplied by 100/Ref. Park 20/e, p 549 (19/e p503)1 Repeat from Nov 08 Net Protein Utilization (NPU): NPU is a method of assessing protein quality. It is the ratio of amino acid conveed to proteins to the ratio of amino acids supplied. Experimentally, this value can be determined by determining dietary protein intake and then measuring nitrogen excretion. One formula for NPU is: NPU = Nitrogen retained by the body/ Nitrogen intake X 100 As a value, NPU can range from 1 to 0, with a value of 1 indicating 100% utilization of dietary nitrogen as protein and a value of 0 an indication that none of the nitrogen supplied was conveed to protein. Ceain foodstuffs, such as eggs or milk, rate as I on an NPU cha. The NPU gives a more complete expression of protein quality than the amino acid score. The protein requirement varies with the NPU of dietary protein. If NPU is high, the protein requirement is low and vice versa. Amino acid score: Other method of assessing protein quality is amino acid score. Amino acid score is a measure of the concentration of each essential amino acid in the test protein expressed as a percentage of that amino acid in the reference protein (usually egg protein) Amino acid score Number of mg of one amino acid per g of protein/Number of mg of the same amino acid per g of egg protein X 100 Also Know Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS): Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score is a method of evaluating the protein quality based on the amino acid requirements of humans. It has been adopted by FAO/WHO as the preferred method for the measurement of the protein quality in human nutrition. The method is based on comparison of the concentration of the first limiting essential amino acid in the test protein with the concentration of that amino acid in a reference (scoring) pattern. This scoring pattern is derived from the essential amino acid requirements of the preschool-age child. The chemical score obtained in this way is corrected for true fecal digestibility of the test protein. A PDCAAS value of 1 is the highest, and 0 the lowest as the table demonstrates the ratings of common foods below. - whey 1.0 - egg white 1.0 - asein 1.0 - milk 1.0 The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) is superior to other methods for evaluating the protein quality of food proteins for humans because it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements of a 2- to 5-year old child (the most demanding age group), adjusted for digestibility. PDCAAS is based on a food protein's amino acid content, its true digestibility, and its ability to supply indispensable amino acids in amounts adequate to meet the amino acid requirements of a 2- to 5-year old child, the age group used as the standard",B

Most dangerous dehydration is-,Hyponatremic,Hypernatremic,Isonatremic,Non-diarrhoel cause,"Hypernatraemia Hypernatraemia is defined as existing when the serum Na is >145 mmol/L. Pathophysiology Hypernatraemia occurs due to inadequate concentration of the urine in the face of restricted water intake. This can arise because of failure to generate an adequate medullary concentration gradient in the kidney due to low GFR or loop diuretic therapy, but more commonly is caused by failure of the vasopressin system. This can occur because of pituitary damage (cranial diabetes insipidus ) or because the collecting duct cells are unable to respond to circulating vasopressin concentrations in the face of restricted water intake (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Whatever the underlying cause, sustained or severe hypernatraemia generally reflects an impaired thirst mechanism or responsiveness to thirst. Clinical features Patients with hypernatraemia generally have reduced cerebral function, either as a primary problem or as a consequence of the hypernatraemia itself, which results in dehydration of neurons and brain shrinkage. In the presence of an intact thirst mechanism and preserved capacity to obtain and ingest water, hypernatraemia may not progress very far. If adequate wateris not obtained, dizziness, delirium, weakness and, ultimately, coma and death can result. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 360",B

The resistance to flexion suddenly collapses, and the arm flexes.Continued passive flexion stretches the muscle again, and the sequence is repeated.This sequence of resistance followed by a 'give' when a limb is moved passively is known as the clasp-knife effect because of its resemblance to the closing of a pocket knife.It is also known as lengthening reaction because it is the response of a spastic muscle to lengthening.

Conversely, in thalassemia, which is a disorder of globin synthesis, the number of RBC s produced is normal, but the cells are smaller and more fragile. Therefore, the RBC count is normal, but the MCV is low, so the index will be less than 13.o In practice, the Mentzer index is not a reliable indicator and should not, by itself, be used to differentiate the two conditions.IndexFormulaValue for iron deficiency anemiaValue for beta thalassemiaMentzer indexMCV/RBC count> 13< 13Shine and Lai indexMCV2 x MCH x 0.01> 1530< 1530England and Fraser indexMCV - RBC - (5 x Hb) - 5.19>0<0Srivastava indexMCH,'RBC> 3.8<3.8Green and king indexMCV2 x RDW x Hb/100>65< 65Red cell distribution width indexMCV x RDW/RBC>220<220",A

Citrate is generally tolerated better than sodium bicarbonate and can be given as the potassium or sodium salt, depending on the severity of hypokalemia. In patients who present later with kidney stones. large fluid intake and sufficient alkali to restore normal acid-basebalance, correct the hypocitraturia and reduce hypercalciuria, thereby inhibiting the formation of new stones Treatment of Type 2 (Proximal) A It is difficult to restore normal acid-base balance in patients with proximal A despite large amounts of alkali. This is the case because they continue to waste bicarbonate (fractional excretion >15%) until the serum level falls below a threshold, usually about 15-17 mmol/L, at which time bicarbonate is completely reabsorbed distally and the urine is maximally acidified with pH <5.5. When the serum bicarbonate concentration is raised above the threshold with alkali therapy, bicarbonate wasting recurs and causes hypokalemia as potassium is secreted to maintain luminal electroneutrality. Thus, treatment of pA requires 5-15 mmol/kg per day of bicarbonate together with supplemental potassium",C

A patient presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and presence of urobilinogen in urine. Which amongst the following is the least likely diagnosis:,Hemolytic jaundice,Crigler Najjar syndrome,Gilbe's syndrome,Dubin Johnson syndrome,Answer is D (Dubin Johnson Syndrome) Dubin Johnson syndrome is associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia & not unconjugated hjperbilirubinemia. Dubin Johnson Syndrome results from a hereditary defect in excretion of conjugated bilirubin across the canalicular membrane and leads to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Dubin Johnson syndrome is an inherited disorder charachterized by defective excretion of conjugated bilirubin from hepatocytes into biliary canaliculi. It thus presents with a clinical picture similar to obstructive jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and absence of urobilinogen in urine. Hemolytic Anemia typically presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urinary urobilinogens. Gilbes syndrome and Cri2ler Najjar syndrome also present with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Urinary Urobilinogens are however not elevated in these conditions.

Achondroplasia is a single gene mutation disorder caused by mutations in the FGFR3 gene on chromosome4. Two different mutations in the FGFR3 gene cause more than 99 per cent of cases of achondroplasia. It is a dominant genetic disease so only one copy of the FGFR3 gene needs to be mutated for symptoms to develop Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

Treatment of type I tyrosinemia is -,Niiisinone,No treatment,Symptomatic,Vitamin B complex,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Nitisinoneo Tyrosine is an aromatic amino acid important in the synthesis of thyroid hormone, catecholamines, and melanin. Impaired caiabolism of tyrosine is a feature of several acquired and genetic disorders that may result in elevated plasma tyrosine concentrations.Tyrosine metabolismo Tyrosine degradation is catalyzed by a series of five enzymatic reactions thatyiel acetaacetate, which is ketogenic, and the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, which is glucogenic.o The hepatocvte and renal proximal tubules are the only two cell types that express the complete pathway and contain sufficient quantities of all enzymes required for tyrosine catabolism.o Four autosomal recessive disorders result from deficiencies in specific enzymes in the tyrosine catabolic pathway.Hereditary tyrosinemia (HT) types 1,2, and 3,Alkaptonuria (AKU).o Except for AKU, these disorders result in elevated blood tyrosine levels.Hvpertvrosinemiao Normal plasma tyrosine concentration are 30 to 120 micromol/L.o Values > 200 micromol/L are considered elevated.o However, clinical manifestations typically do not become apparent until plasma levels exceed 500 micromol/L.Hereditary Tyrosinemia type 1o Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, also known as hepatorenal tyrosinemia, is the most severe disorder of tyrosine metabolism.o HT1 is caused by deficiency-1 of fumarydacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme in the pathway of tyrosine catabolism.o Fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), the substrate for FAH in the tyrosine pathway, accumulates in FAH-deficient hepatocytes and proximal renal tubular cells, resulting in liver and kidney damage.HT1 managemento Dietary treatment, consisting of foods with low or absent phenylalanine, tyrosine, methionine, and restriction of natural protein, results in decreased tyrosine levels.o However, this approach does not stop the production of SA, prevent the pregression of liver or renal disease, or reduce the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma or neurologic abnormalities.o The medical treatment of choice is nits inone, formerly known as NTBC, which inhibits 4-OH phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), an early step in the tyrosine degradation pathway. This treatment reduces metabolic flow through the pathway and limits formation of the toxic compounds FAA and SA.Clinical manifestations of enzyme deficiencies in tyrosine catabolismDefective enzymeTyrosine aminotransferase4-hydroxy-phenylpyruvateHomogentisate dioxygenaseMaley1acetoacetate isomeraseFumarylacetoace-tate hydrolaseDisease name(s)Tyrosinemia type 11 Oculocutaneous tyrosinemia Richner-Hanhardt syndromeTyrosinemia type IIIAlkaptonuriaNo human patients describedTyrosinemia type I Hepatorenal tyrosinemiaElevated blood tyrosine+++++o?++Corneal ulcers++++/-o?oHyperkeratosis+++/-o?oMental retardation+/-+/-o?oArthritisoo+++?oLiver failureooo?+++Renal fanconi syndromeooo?++",A

Bacillus anthracis -,Produces an endotoxin,Produces terminal bulging spores,Is an anaerobic organism,Capsule is demonstrated by M'Fadyyean's reaction,"Anthrax is an endemic zoonosis in many countries; it causes human disease following inoculation of the spores of Bacillus anthracis. B. anthracis was the first bacterial pathogen described by Koch and the model pathogen for 'Koch's postulates' (see Box 6.1, p. 100). It is a Gram-positive organism with a central spore. The spores can survive for years in soil. Infection is commonly acquired from contact with animals, paicularly herbivores. The ease of production of B. anthracis spores makes this infection a candidate for biological warfare or bioterrorism. B. anthracis produces a number of toxins that mediate the clinical features of disease. The simple polychrome methylene blue (PMB) staining procedure for blood or tissue smears from dead animals (M'Fadyean reaction) established in 1903 remained accepted as a highly reliable, rapid diagnostic test for anthrax for six decades while that disease was still common in livestock throughout the world. Improvements in disease control led to anthrax becoming rare in industrialized countries and less frequent in developing countries with the result that quality controlled, commercially produced PMB became hard to obtain by the 1980s. Mixed results with alternative methylene blue-based stains then led to diagnosis failures, confusion among practitioners and mistrust of this procedure as a reliable test for anthrax. We now repo that, for laboratories needing a reliable M'Fadyean stain at sho notice, the best approach is to have available commercially pure azure B ready to constitute into a solution of 0.03 g azure B in 3 ml of 95% ethanol or methanol to which is then added 10 ml of 0.01% KOH (0.23% final azure B concentration) and which can then be used immediately and through to the end of the tests. Stored in the dark at room temperature, the shelf life is at least 12 months. Smears should be fixed with ethanol or methanol (95-100%), not by heat, and the stain left for 5 min before washing off for optimum effect. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1078",D

Gestational hypehyroidism occurs due to,Beta HCG from placenta,Trans-placental transfer of TSH,TPO antibodies,Anti thyroglobulin antibody,"A common cause of overactive thyroid in pregnant women is Graves' disease. This disease occurs when your immune system becomes overactive and forms antibodies (immune proteins) that attack the thyroid. This causes the gland to enlarge and make too much thyroid hormone. Most women with Graves' disease find out they have it and get treatment before they become pregnant. Women with severe nausea and vomiting or those expecting twins may develop temporary hypehyroidism. Called transient gestational thyrotoxicosis, this hypehyroidism is due to high levels of a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG.

Which drug is not used in SIADH:,Fludrocoisone,Demeclocycline,Desmopressin,Hypeonic saline,"Answer is C (Desmopressin) : Desmopressin has no role in the management of SIADH. In Acute SIADH, the keystone of treatment is to restrict total fluid intake to less than the sum total of insensible losses and urinary output. If more rapid correction of hyponatremia is desired, the fluid restriction can be supplemented by intravenous infusion of hypeonic saline. In chronic SIADH, the hyponatremia can be minimized by treatment with demeclocycline or fludrocoisone.",C

"According to the 2010 ACLS Guidelines by AHA, which of the following pharmacological agents is not used in the management of cardiac arrest :",Epinephrine,Vasopressin,Atropine,Amiadorone,"Answer is C (Atropine) The use of Atropine for cardiac arrest (PEA / Asystole) has been removed from the ACLS 2010 Guidelines / Algorithm due to lack of any evidence showing therapeutic benefit. The primary Pharmacological agents included in the ACLS Algorithm for management of cardiac arrest include Epinephrine, Vasopressin and Amiodarone. The primary goal of pharmacologic therapy is to assist the achievement and maintenance of spontaneous circulation. The mainstay of pharmacologic interventions is vasopressor agents. Epinephrine ( I mg) is recommended by IV or the intraosseous (10) route every 3 to 5 minutes during resuscitative effos until spontaneous circulation is restored. If IV/10 access cannot be established, epinephrine can be administered an endotracheal tube at a higher dose (2 to 2.5mg). Vasopressin (40 mg iv/I0) could be substituted for the first or second dose of epinephrine if desired. The preferred antiarrhythmic agent for resuscitation is Amiodarone. Amiodarone is recommended in patients with VF/VT that does not respond to CPR, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy. (first dose; 300mg 1V/I0; second dose; 150mg IV/10). It should be noted that The use of atropine far PEA/Asystole was recently removed from the ACLS algorithm. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine administration of sodium bicarbonate during resuscitation. First dose; 300 mg bolus second dose; 150 mg Lidocaine is not pa of the ACLS 2010 Algorithm but may be used. The AHA recommends its administration after epinephrine; vasopressin and Amiodarone have been tried. But in clinical studies Lidocaine has not been demonstrated to improve rates of ROSC and hospital admission compared with Amiodarone. It is given in a bolus of ling/kg. A second loading dose of I mg/kg can be given in 10-15 minutes alter the first one. ACLS: Pharmacological agents Medications that have been changed Atropine: deleted from pulseless arrest algorithm Sodium Bicarbonate: Routine use not recommended Calcium: Routine administration for treatment of cardiac arrest not recommended Medications that have remained unchanged Epinephrine: dose, interval unchanged Vasopressin: dose, use unchanged Amiodarone: dose, indications unchanged Lidocaine: dose, indications unchanged",C

Number of family member is a-,Qualitative variable,Discrete variable,Continuous variable,Categorial variable,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Discrete variable o Number of family members has numerical value --> 2, 3, 5, 7. o But it cannot have in-between value e.g., 2.5, 3.2. o So, it is a quantitative (numerical) discrete variable. Following impoant points require specific mention here : ? o Though qualitative (categorial) data do not have numerical value, some times numerical value is used to classify the limit of qualitative data. For example : - 1)All low bih weight children will have bih weight less than 2500 gm. So, a) Bih weight (which may be 2200 gm, 2500 gm, 2600 gm) is a continuous variable. b)Low bih weight (< 2500 gm) is a qualitative data because either a newborn have low bih weight or not. 2) Blood cholesterol level (which may be 70, 80, 90, 200 mg/dl) is a quantitative variable but when it comes high or low blood cholesterol level, it becomes qualitative variable because a preson may either have low or high cholesterol level. 3) Similarly blood sugar level is quantitative variable, while high or low blood sugar (presence or absence of diabetes) is a qualitative variable. 4) Blood hemoglobin is a quantitative variable, while high or low hemoglobin (Presence or absence of anemia) is a qualitative variable. Note: o Pulse rate (PR) is considered as a continuous variable. o Immediately question comes to mind that how can pulse rate be a continues variable when pulse rate can only be 70/71... beats per minute but not in between value (70.1, 70.5 ...). However, this is only true when we count pulse for only 1 minute. In other scenario, if the pulse rate is counted for 3 minutes and it comes 216, then the pulse rate will be 72.3 beats per minute ---> Therefore, pulse rate is considered as a continuous variable. o If you still have doubt, read following statement?

However, rate of fetal loss is increased (approximately two- to threefold) in women with SLE.> Fetal demise is higher in mothers with high disease activity, antiphospholipid antibodies, and/or nephritis.> Suppression of disease activity can be achieved by administration of systemic glucocorticoids.> A placental enzyme, 11--dehydrogenase 2, deactivates glucocorticoids; it is more effective in deactivating prednisone and prednisolone than the fluorinated glucocorticoids dexamethasone and betamethasone.> Therefore, maternal SLE should be controlled with prednisone/prednisolone at the lowest effective doses for the shortest time required.> Adverse effects of prenatal glucocorticoid exposure (primarily betamethasone) on offspring may include low birth weight, developmental abnormalities in the CNS, and predilection toward adult metabolic syndrome.> In SLE patients with aPL (on at least two occasions) and prior fetal losses, treatment with heparin (standard or low-molecular- weight) plus low-dose aspirin has been shown in prospective controlled trials to increase significantly the proportion of live births.> An additional potential problem for the fetus is the presence of antibodies to Ro, sometimes associated with neonatal lupus consisting of rash and congenital heart block.> The latter can be life-threatening; therefore the presence of anti-Ro requires vigilant monitoring of fetal heart rates with prompt intervention (delivery if possible) if distress occurs.> Women with SLE usually tolerate pregnancy without disease flares.> However, a small proportion develops severe flares requiring aggressive glucocorticoid therapy or early delivery.> Poor maternal outcomes are highest in women with active nephritis or irreversible organ damage in kidneys, brain, or heart.",B
Which of the following is seen in pneumothorax,Over expanded chest wall,Reduced concentration of surfactant,More negative itrapleural pressure,Increased lung compliance,"Ans. b. Reduced concentration of surfactant Pneumothorax decreases the quantity of surfactant in the collapsed lung. Over expanded chest wall is characteristically seen in conditions where the lung loses its elasticity, such as in emphysema, and the natural tendency of the chest wall to recoil towards the outside, causes an over expanded chest. In pneumothorax, intra-pleural pressure equilibrates with the ambient barometric pressure and the lung's natural recoil tendency causes it to collapse.

Signs of chronic liver failure are all except -,Subcutaneous nodules,Palmer erythema,Spider nevi,Testicular atropy,"Pathophysiology Any cause of liver damage can produce acute liver failure, provided it is sufficiently severe . Acute viral hepatitis is the most common cause worldwide, whereas paracetamol toxicity is the most frequent cause in the UK. Acute liver failure occurs occasionally with other drugs, or from Amanita phalloides (mushroom) poisoning, in pregnancy, in Wilson's disease, following shock and, rarely, in extensive malignant disease of the liver. In 10% of cases, the cause of acute liver failure remains unknown and these patients are often labelled as having 'non-A-E viral hepatitis' or 'cryptogenic' acute liver failure Clinical assessment Cerebral disturbance (hepatic encephalopathy and/or cerebral oedema) is the cardinal manifestation of acute liver failure, but in the early stages this can be mild and episodic, and so its absence does not exclude a significant acute liver injury. The initial clinical features are often subtle and include reduced aleness and poor concentration, progressing through behavioural abnormalities, such as restlessness and aggressive outbursts, to drowsiness and coma . Cerebral oedema may occur due to increased intracranial pressure, causing unequal or abnormally reacting pupils, fixed pupils, hypeensive episodes, bradycardia, hyperventilation, profuse sweating, local or general myoclonus, focal fits or decerebrate posturing. Papilloedema occurs rarely and is a late sign. More general symptoms include weakness, nausea and vomiting. Right hypochondrial discomfo is an occasional feature. The patient may be jaundiced but jaundice may not be present at the outset (e.g. in paracetamol overdose), and there are a number of exceptions, including Reye's syndrome, in which jaundice is rare. Occasionally, death may occur in fulminant cases of acute liver failure before jaundice develops. Fetor hepaticus can be present. The liver is usually of normal size but later becomes smaller. Clinical grading of Clinical signs Grade 1 Poor concentration, slurred speech, slow mentation, disordered sleep rhythm Grade 2 Drowsy but easily rousable, occasional aggressive behaviour, lethargic Grade 3 Marked delirium, drowsy, sleepy but responds to pain and voice, gross disorientation Grade 4 Unresponsive to voice, may or may not respond to painful stimuli, unconscious Ref Davidson edition23rd pg857",A

Poor prognostic factor in a patient with pancreatitis includes-,"Leucocytosis>20,000/|iL",Elevated serum amylase,Eevated serum lipase,Diastolic BP>90 mm Hg,"Clinical features The typical presentation is with severe, constant upper abdominal pain, of increasing intensity over 15-60 minutes, which radiates to the back. Nausea and vomiting are common. There is marked epigastric tenderness, but in the early stages (and in contrast to a perforated peptic ulcer), guarding and rebound tenderness are absent because the inflammation is principally retroperitoneal. Bowel sounds become quiet or absent as paralytic ileus develops. In severe cases, the patient becomes hypoxic and develops hypovolaemic shock with oliguria. Discoloration of the flanks (Grey Turner's sign) or the periumbilical region (Cullen's sign) is a feature of severe pancreatitis with haemorrhage. The differential diagnosis includes a perforated viscus, acute cholecystitis and myocardial infarction. A collection of fluid and debris may develop in the lesser sac, following inflammatory rupture of the pancreatic duct; this is known as a pancreatic fluid collection. It is initially contained within a poorly defined, fragile wall of granulation tissue, which matures over a 6-week period to form a fibrous capsule . pseudocysts' are common and usually asymptomatic, resolving as the pancreatitis recovers. Pseudocysts greater than 6 cm in diameter seldom disappear spontaneously and can cause constant abdominal pain and compress or erode surrounding structures, including blood vessels, to form pseudoaneurysms. Large pseudocysts can be detected clinically as a palpable abdominal mass. Pancreatic ascites occurs when fluid leaks from a disrupted pancreatic duct into the peritoneal cavity. Leakage into the thoracic cavity can result in a pleural effusion or a pleuro-pancreatic fistula. Investigations The diagnosis is based on raised serum amylase or lipase concentrations and ultrasound or CT evidence of pancreatic swelling. Plain X-rays should be taken to exclude other diagnoses, such as perforation or obstruction, and to identify pulmonary complications. Amylase is efficiently excreted by the kidneys and concentrations may have returned to normal if measured 24-48 hours after the onset of pancreatitis. A persistently elevated serum amylase concentration suggests pseudocyst formation. Peritoneal amylase concentrations are massively elevated in pancreatic ascites. Serum amylase concentrations are also elevated (but less so) in intestinal ischaemia, perforated peptic ulcer and ruptured ovarian cyst, while the salivary isoenzyme of amylase is elevated in parotitis. If available, serum lipase measurements are preferable to amylase, as they have greater diagnostic accuracy for acute pancreatitis. Ultrasound scanning can confirm the diagnosis, although in the earlier stages the gland may not be grossly swollen. The ultrasound scan is also useful because it may show gallstones, biliary obstruction or pseudocyst formation. Contrast-enhanced pancreatic CT performed 6-10 days after admission can be useful in assessing bility of the pancreas if persisting organ failure, sepsis or clinical deterioration is present, since these features may indicate that pancreatic necrosis has occurred. Necrotising pancreatitis is associated with decreased pancreatic enhancement on CT, following intravenous injection of contrast material. The presence of gas within necrotic material suggests infection and impending abscess formation, in which case percutaneous aspiration of material for bacterial culture should be carried out and appropriate antibiotics prescribed. Involvement of the colon, blood vessels and other adjacent structures by the inflammatory process is best seen by CT. Ceain investigations stratify the severity of acute pancreatitis and have impoant prognostic value at the time of presentation . In addition, serial assessment of CRP is a useful indicator of progress. A peak CRP of >210 mg/L in the first 4 days predicts severe acute pancreatitis with 80% accuracy. It is woh noting that the serum amylase concentration has no prognostic value. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 839",A

The most readily detected clinical sign of hypermagnesemia is-,Drowsiness,Hypotension,Cerebellar ataxia,Disappearance of deep tendon reflexes,"Hypermagnesaemia This is a much less common abnormality than hypomagnesaemia. Predisposing conditions include acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and adrenocoical insufficiency. The condition is generally precipitated in patients at risk from an increased intake of magnesium, or from the use of magnesium-containing medications, such as antacids, laxatives and enemas. Clinical features include bradycardia, hypotension, reduced consciousness and respiratory depression. Disappearance of deep tendon reflexes Management involves ceasing all magnesium-containing drugs and reducing dietary magnesium intake, improving renal function if possible, and promoting urinary magnesium excretion using a loop diuretic with intravenous hydration, if residual renal function allows. Calcium gluconate may be given intravenously to ameliorate cardiac effects. Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 368",D

Thus, i have to read so many textbooks for this and i came to the conclusion that each and every textbook is correct. Both can occur in strychnine poisoning :-


If death occurs with violent contractions (during convulsions) for some time prior to death, it causes complete exhaustion → Rapid onset and short duration of rigor mortis.
If death is almost instantaneous, with a very short convulsive phase, there is no exhaustion →3 Rapid onset and longer duration of rigor mortis.

The regional aerial resistance of the mesentery and kidney vessels is reduced by,Dopamine,Dobutamine,Nor adrenaline,Isoprenaline,"In hyperdynamic sepsis, the peripheral aeriolar tone and BP are low but the cardiac output is often high; therefore the vasoconstrictor noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is appropriate to restore BP, usually at the price of some reduction in cardiac output.In most cases, a vasoconstrictor such as noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is necessary to increase SVR and BP, while an inotrope (dobutamine) may be necessary to maintain cardiac output. In the later stages of severe sepsis, the essential problem is at the microcirculatory level. Oxygen uptake and utilisation are impaired due to failure of the regional distribution of flow and direct cellular toxicity despite adequate global oxygen delivery.

A: Anopheles Mosquito larvae have a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large thorax and a segmented abdomen. They have no legs. In contrast to other mosquitoes, Anopheles larvae lack a respiratory siphon and for this reason position themselves so that their body is parallel to the surface of the water. Larvae breathe through spiracles located on the 8th abdominal segment and therefore must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms in the surface microlayer. They dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either by jerky movements of the entire body or through propulsion with the mouth brushes.",A

In which pa of the body a lesser impact causes maximum bruise?",Face,Sole,Back,Palm,"If the pa is vascular and loose, such as face, vulva, scrotum a slight degree of violence may cause a large bruise because there is sufficient space for blood to accumulate. If the tissues are strongly suppoed, and contain firm fibrous tissues and covered by thick dermis, such as abdomen, back, scalp, palms and soles, a blow of moderate violence may produce a comparatively small bruise.

"A patient presents with haemoptysis, copious sputum and tram lines (abnormal air bronchogram) pattern on the chest X ray. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lung abscess,Pulmonary embolism with infarction,Bronchiectasis,Carcinoma of lung,"Bronchiectasis:
The most common clinical presentation is a persistent productive cough with ongoing production of thick, tenacious sputum. Physical findings often include crackles and wheezing on lung auscultation, and some patients with bronchiectasis exhibit clubbing of the digits. Mild to moderate airflow obstruction is often detected on pulmonary function tests, overlapping with that seen at presentation with other conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The diagnosis is usually based on presentation with a persistent chronic cough and sputum production accompanied by consistent radiographic features. Although chest radiographs lack sensitivity, the presence of “tram tracks” indicating dilated airways is consistent with bronchiectasis. Chest CT is more specific for bronchiectasis and is the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis. CT findings include airway dilation (detected as parallel “tram  tracks” or as the “signet-ring sign”) — a cross-sectional area of the airway with a diameter at least 1.5 times that of the adjacent vessel), lack of bronchial tapering (including the presence of tubular structures within 1 cm from the pleural surface), bronchial wall thickening in dilated airways, inspissated secretions (e.g., the “tree-in-bud” pattern), or  cysts emanating from the bronchial wall (especially pronounced in cystic bronchiectasis).",C

They are a common occurrence in renal failure and are seen in l/3rd patients of renal failure.Pathophysiology of Half and half nailThey are also called Lindsay's nailTheir pathogenesis is not clearly understood.Two mechanisms have been proposed.increased melanin depositionthe proximal half of the nail appears white because of the edema associated with dilated capillary network According to Oxford text book of clinical nephrology 2nd/e chapter 11.3.11. ""The so called ""half-and half nail"" in typical of uremia the distal portion of each nail bed is red, pink or brown, occupies 20-60 percent of the total nail length, and always sharply demarcated, the proximal portion has dull whitish ground glass appearance.When pressure is applied, the discoloration does not fade completely. This change can affect single nails, or all the nails, or all the nails of the hand or feet or both. Half and half nail often begins before dialysis. It occurs in 15-50% of patients on regular dialysis.The histology of the nail plate itself shows no change and it contains no melanin, the number of capillaries under the nail plate is increased, with remarkable thickening of the capillary walls.The increase in capillary density of the nail bed might account for the band.The disorder in probably partially reversible.

Ventricular aneurysm has one of the following characteristic features,Persistent ST segment elevation,Persistent ST segment depression,Left bundle branch block,Right bundle branch block,"A left ventricular aneurysm can be diagnosed on ECG when there is persistent ST segment elevation occurring 6 weeks after a known transmural myocardial infarction (usually an anterior MI). Without knowing the past medical history, the ECG changes of an aneurysm may mimic an acute anterior MI. With an anterior or apical aneurysm, the persistent ST elevation is in lead V1 and V2 with associated Q waves indicating the old anterior MI. In an inferior aneurysm it would be in lead II, III and aVF, although this is less common. The only way to be sure that the ECG changes present are from an LV aneurysm (not ST elevation from an acute MI) is to have the patient's history of a prior MI and cardiac imaging to document the presence of an aneurysm.

Mutation is seen in ?,Polio virus,Influenza virus,Mumps virus,Measles virus,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Influenza virus A unique feature of the influenza virus is its ability to undergo antigenic variations. Antigenic variability is highest in influenza virus Type A and less in Type B, while it has not been demonstrated in type C. Surface antigens hemagglutinin and neurominidase, undergo independent antigenic variations which may be of Two types. 1) Antigenic drift Antigenic change is gradual over a period of time The new antigens, though different from the previous antigens, arc yet related to them. Antigenic drift involves point mutation in the gene owing to selection pressure by immunity in the host population Antigenic drift accounts for the periodic epidemics of influenza. Occurs every 2-3 years in case of Influenza A and every 4-7 years in case of Influenza-B 2) Antigenic shift An abrupt, drastic, discontinuous variation in the antigenic structure. Result from genetic recombination of human with animal or an virus. Accounts for the major epidemics or pandemics. Occurs every 10-15 years. Occurs in influenza 'A' only",B

The usually pattern is an ascending paralysis and cranial nerve involvement is common.o The acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies are classified under the eponym Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).o GBS is an acute monophasic paralyzing illness, usually provoked by a preceding infection.o Guillain Barre syndrome is thought to result from an immune response to preceeding infection that cross reactss to peripheral nerve.o The triggerring events for GBS is# Campylobacter jejuni (most common)# Cytomegalovirus# Epstein Barr virus# HIVOt her trigering events: -# Immunisation# Surgery# Trauma# Bone marrow transplantationo Historically, the GuiUain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was considered a single disorder:o It now is recoginized as a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms.o The major forms are : -# Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP).# The Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS).# Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN)# Acute sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (AMSAN),Each form of GBS has distinguishing clinical, pathophysiologic and pathologic feature.Pathogenesiso One proposed mechanism for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is that an antecedent infection evokes an immune response, which in turn cross-reacts with peripheral nerve components because of the sharing of cross-reactive epitopes ""molecular mimicry ""o The end result is an acute polyneuropathy.o This immune response is directed towards the mvelin or the axon ofperipheral nerve.o Immune reactions directed against epitopes in Schwann cell surface membrane or myelin cause acute inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (AIDP).o The pathology is that of multifocal inflammatory demyelination starting at the level of the nerve roots.o The earliest changes are frequently seen at the nodes of Ranvier.o Both the cellular and humoral immune responses participate in the process.o Invasion by activated T-cell is followed by macrophage-mediated demyelination with evidence of complement and immunoglobulin deposition on myelin and Schwann cell.o No specific myelin antigen have been identified.Symptomso The major clinical manifestations are motor manifestations i.e., weakness that evolves more or less symmetrically over a period of several days.o Weakness usually begins in the lower extremities and progressively involves the trunk, the upper limbs and finally the bulbar muscles a pattern known as landry ascending paralysisQ,o Proximal and distal muscles are involved relatively symmetricallyQ but asymmetry is seen in 9% of patientso Deep tendon reflexes usually disappearQ.o The weakness progresses in about 5% of patient to total motor paralysisQ with respiratory failureQ within few days.o Cranial nerve involvement can occur0.# The most common cranial nerve to be involved is facial nerveQ.

Which of the following is not used for investigation 1 of fat malabsorption:,13C Trioctanoin,13C Triolein,13C Tripalmitin,13C Triclosan,"Answer is D (13C Triclosan) Triclosan is not used for the evaluation of fat malabsorption. Triclosan is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in numerous consumer products, including soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent and the risk of antibacterial resistance remains controversial. Breath tests using 13 C-marked triglycerides are based on the principle that intestinal triglyceride absorption requires prior hydrolysis by lipase to produce free fatty acids and monoacylglycerol. These metabolites are incorporated into micelles, absorbed, resynthesized and transpoed to the liver. Lipolytic hepatic enzymes subsequently release 13 C-marked fatty acids. These undergo Beta-oxidation which results in formation of 13 CO2 that is absorbed into the bloodstream, transpoed to the lung and exhaled. The increase in 13 CO2 concentration in breath thus correlates with intestinal lipid digestion and absorption. 13C-marked triglycerides are nonradioactive and can be applied safely and repeatedly, also to children and pregnant women. Initially focused on investigating infants and pregnant women with their paicularly high risks of being exposed to energy rich radiation, breath tests using the stable isotope 13C instead of its radioactive counterpa 14C, nowadays have replaced 14C-breath tests almost completely.

Which of these does not cause crescentric glomerulonephrits -,Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis,Alpo syndrome,Goodpasture syndrome,Henoch schonlein purpura,"Alpo's syndrome A number of uncommon diseases may involve the glomerulus in childhood but the most impoant one affecting adults is Alpo's syndrome. Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder . Mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM . Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities. Angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may slow but not prevent loss of kidney function. Patients with Alpo's syndrome are good candidates for renal replacement therapy (R), as they are young and usually otherwise healthy. They can develop an immune response to the normal collagen antigens present in the GBM of the donor kidney and, in a small minority, anti-GBM disease develops and destroys the allograft Ref Harrison20th edition pg 297",B

Destructive power of bullet is determined by:,Weight of bullet,Shape of bullet,Size of bullet,Velocity of bullet,"Velocity of bullet Repeat from May 09 Mechanics of Bullet Injury A bullet's ability to produce tissue injury depends on: Bullet velocity- A bullet's ability to injure is directly related to its kinetic energy at the moment of impact. Kinetic energy i.e. E = me /2 The kinetic energy is directly propoional to weight (mass) of the bullet and the square of its velocity. Thus a bullet traveling at twice the speed of a second bullet of equal weight and similar size and shape, possesses four times much energy and injuring power. Tissue density- The greater the tissue density, the greater is the amount of energy discharged by the bullet passing through it and thus greater the injury. Thus a bullet may cause slight damage to the soft tissue, but extensive damage to hard tissue such as bone. Hydrostatic force- Hydrostatic forces increase the impact of injury. When fluid distended hollow organs, (e.g. urine filled bladder, filled stomach, hea filled with blood in diastole) are hit by a bullet, extensive lacerations are produced due to the explosive displacement of the liquid in all directions.",D

– Pearson’s Correlation coefficient:
– Spearman’s Rank Correlation coefficient

Coefficient of determination:

– Is the percentage of variation in a variable that is explained by one or more of the others
– Is generally obtained in a regression setup
– Coefficient of determination = (Correlation coefficient)2 = r2
In the given question, a cardiologist found a highly significant correlation coefficient (r = 0.90, p= 0.01) between the systolic blood pressure values and serum cholesterol values of the patients attending his clinic, Since r = + 0.90 (p = 0.01; implies significant relationship), it means there is a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and serum cholesterol (SC); therefore as SBP increases, SC will also increase and vice-versa. Thus, a patient with a high level of systolic BP is also likely to have a high level of serum cholesterol AND a patient with a low level of systolic BP is also likely to have a low level of serum cholesterol. Since r = + 0.9; Coefficient of determination = r2 = (0.9)2 = 0.81 Interpretation of r2: 0.81 or 81% of variation in systolic blood pressure among patients can be explained by their serum cholesterol values and vice-versa.",A

Transmission rate of HIV by needlestick injury in health professionals is,0.30%,1%,5%,10%,"AUTOPSY OF A CASE OF AIDS AND INFECTIONS Universal Work Precautions: (1) All infected bodies should be wrapped and tied in double layer tough plastic bag, with a red colour tag mentioning ""Biologically Hazardous"". The label should mention the name, age, sex, registration number, etc. (2) Workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis or external injury should not handle AIDS victims. (3) Proper protective clothing, full sleeves overalls instead of simple surgical gowns, water-proof plastic apron, head cap, face mask, goggles if eye glasses are not worn, double gloves (heavy autopsy gloves over surgical gloves), waterproof rubber gumboots of knee length with shoe covers. A plastic visor will protect eyes and mucosal surfaces from splash injury. A high efficiency paiculate air- filled respirator or a powered air-purifying respirator should be worn. ( 4) Handling sharp instruments: Avoid accidental pricks and cuts from needles, scalpels, etc. If a cut is made in the rubber gloves or needle injury occurs they should be removed immediately and replaced with new ones. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughly if contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Infection of AIDS can be acquired by transdermal inoculation through cuts and needle punctures. About 0.3 to 0.5% of individuals will become seropositive. Transmission rates from contaminated needle punctures or close contact are 10 to 30 times higher for serum hepatitis than for AIDS. The incident should be repoed to proper authority to get their blood check for HIV seropositivity. (5) Handling specimens for laboratory examination: Mucocutaneous contact with the body fluids, and aerosol inhalation should be avoided. They should be properly labelled andfilled with 10% formalin solution and should be handled with gloved hands. (6) Disposal of used instruments: They should be dipped in 20% glutaraldehyde (cidox) for half-an-hour, washed with soap or detergent and water, dried and then rinsed in methylated spirit and air dried. (7) All soiled gauze and cotton, etc. should be collected in a double plastic bag for incineration. (8) Laundry material, such as aprons, towels, etc. should be soaked in one percent bleach for half-an-hour, washed with detergent and hot water, and autoclaved. (9) Clean- up procedure: Wear new intact disposable gloves. Small spatters and spills of blood and other body fluids can be wiped up with disposable tissues o1* towels which are discarded in special bio-hazard bags and properly disposed. The autopsy table and floor should be cleaned with one percent bleach solution, followed by washing with soap and water. (10) Disinfectants: 1:10 dilution of common household bleach or a freshly prepared sodium hypochlorite solution are recommended.

High calcium intake leads to:,Milk-Alkali syndrome,Cardiomyopathy,Osteoporosis,Osteopetrosis,"Ans. a. Milk-Alkali syndrome (Ref: Harrison 19/e 2479, 18/e p3I10)High calcium intake leads to Milk-Alkali syndrome.'The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonate. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damage. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stopped.'Milk-Alkali SyndromeThe milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonateQ.It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease.For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome.Several clinical presentations-acute, subacute, and chronic-have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failureQ.The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damageQ.The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stoppedQ.Individual susceptibility is dependent on the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake.Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes > 2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals.Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water.These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion.Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia.The cycle of mild hypercalcemia - bicarbonate retention - alkalosis - renal calcium retention - severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingestedQ.",A

Note : Heparin induced Thrombocytopenia is more commonly associated with Thrombosis than Bleeding Heparin induced Thrombocytopenia is more commonly associated with Thrombosis than Bleeding Heparin induced thrombocytopenia should be included in the differential diagnosis of conditions that produce thrombosis despite thrombocytopenia. Despite thrombocytopenia bleeding is rare in HIT. On the contrary HIT is more related to thrombosis, which often leads to initial recognition of this condition (HIT). `Thrombosis often leads to initial recognition of HIT. Bleeding is rare despite thrombocytopenia' - Essentials of Emergency Medicine (2006)/286 Thrombocytopenia with Thrombosis DIC TTP HUS HIT Thrombosis in Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia is caused by the generation of prothrombotic platelet micropaicles that promote thrombin generation. HIT is an antibody - mediated process that is triggered by antibodies directed against neoantigens on PF4 that are exposed when heparin binds to this protein. These antibodies (usually IgG type) bind simultaneously to heparin PF4 complex and to platelet Fc receptors. Such binding activates the platelets and generates platelet micropaicles. Circulating micropaicles are prothrombotic because they express anionic phospholipids on their surface and can bind clotting factors and promote thrombin generation.

Cause of thick pancreatic secretions in cystic fibrosis?,Overproduction of mucin,Failure to clear mucin due to epithelial dysfunction,Defect in chloride channel leading to water reabsoption,Defect in sodium channel leading to water reabsorption,"CF occurs because of mutations in the gene that makes a protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator). A person with CF produces abnormal CFTR protein -- or no CFTR protein at all, which causes the body to make thick, sticky mucus instead of the thin, watery kind. This blockage causes a drop in the amount of digestive enzymes the pancreas puts out. Because of this, a child with CF has trouble absorbing fats, some proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The problems with the pancreas can get very severe.

Treatment of choice of kawasaki disease?,Intravenous immunoglobulin,Steroids,Dapsone,Methotrexate,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intravenous immunoglobulin Kawasaki disease formerly called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is the most common vasculitides of childhood.It is typically a self-limited condition with fever and manifestation of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy.However, cardiovascular complications particularly coronary artery (CA) aneurysms which lead to occlusion and ischemia may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality.The frequency of coronary artery aneurysm development and associated mortality and morbidity have been dramatically decreased as a result of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG)QThis therapy is most effective for preventing coronary artery abnormalities, but the benefit in children who have already developed coronary artery aneurysms are more equivocal. Thus expeditious diagnosis and timely treatment are critical to achieve the optimal clinical outcome.All children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease are treated at the time of diagnosis.The recommended initial therapy includes: -Intravenous immunoglobulin administered as single infection andAspirinIntravenous immunoglobulinSince the first report of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy, randomized controlled studies and meta analyses have confirmed that IVIG plus aspirin compared to aspirin alone reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysm.Although aspirin does not appear to affect aneurysm formation all trials of IVIG treatment have included aspirin as well since it was treatment of choice at the time IVIG was introduced.The mechanism of beneficial effect of IVIG remains unknown.IVIG appears to have a generalized anti-inflammatory effect with reduction of fever and acute markers of inflammation.Possible mechanisms for these actions are cytokine level and production, neutralizing bacterial super antigens.Treatment of Kawasaki diseaseAcute stageIntravenous immunoglobulin with aspirin.Convalescent stageAspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally until 6-8 week illness onset.Long-term therapy for those with coronary abnormalitiesAspirin 3-5 mg/kg once daily orally+- dipyridamole 4-6 mg/kg/24 hr, divided in two-three doses orally.Acute coronary thrombosisPrompt fibrinolytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase or urokinase under supervision of cardiologist",A

The type of Diphtheria with highest mortality is,Pharyngeal,Nasal,Laryngeal,Conjuntival,"Clinical manifestations of diphtheria 
1. Faucial (tonsillo pharyngeal) diphtheria

It is the commonest type of diphtherial infection.
Incubation period is 2-5 days.
Patients present with malaise, sore throat and moderate fever.
A thick adherent pseudomnembrane (gray or white) is present on one or both tonsils or adjacent pharynx.
Dislodging the membrane is likely to cause bleeding.
A small percentage of patients present with massive swelling of the tonsils and uvula with cervical lymphadenopathy (bull neck) and severe toxemia → Malignant diphtheria.
Systemic toxicity (toxemia) is usually most severe when pseudomembrane extends from tonsil and pharynx (faucial diphtheria) to adjacent areas.

2. Laryngeal diphtheria

Presents as hoarseness and cough.
It is the most severe form of respiratory diphtheria.
Trocheostomy may be required.

3.Nasal diphtheria

Presents with unilateral or bilateral nasal discharge.

The skin surface is indented and blood vessels at the edges are ruptured. Blood is squeezed out of any vessels along the point of contact, but the vessels remain relatively intact (paicularly if the suppoing tissues are lax). When the impacting object is removed, blood flows back into the undamaged vessels, but leaks from the damaged ones. The resulting bruise is termed a 'tramline bruise' because it appears as a pale linear central area lined on either side by linear bruising.

"All are true regarding Early Post-cibal syndrome, except",Distension of abdomen,Managed conservatively,Hypermotility of intestine is common,Surgery is usually indicated,"Early dumping takes place 15-30 min after meals and consists of crampy abdominal discomfo, nausea, diarrhea, belching, tachycardia, palpitations, diaphoresis, light-headedness, and, rarely, syncope. These signs and symptoms arise from the rapid emptying of hyperosmolar gastric contents into the small intestine, resulting in a fluid shift into the gut lumen with plasma volume contraction and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neurotensin, motilin) is also theorized to play a role in early dumping . Treatment Dietary modification is the cornerstone of therapy for patients with dumping syndrome. Small, multiple (six) meals devoid of simple carbohydrates coupled with elimination of liquids during meals is impoant. Antidiarrheals and anticholinergic agents are complementary to diet. Guar and pectin, which increase the viscosity of intraluminal contents, may be beneficial in more symptomatic individuals. Acarbose, an a-glucosidase inhibitor that delays digestion of ingested carbohydrates, has also been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of the late phases of dumping. The somatostatin analogue octreotide has been successful in diet-refractory cases. This drug is administered subcutaneously (50 mg tid), titrated according to clinical response. A long-acting depot formulation of octreotide can be administered once every 28 days and provides symptom relief comparable to the sho-acting agent. In addition, patient weight gain and quality of life appear to be superior with the long-acting form. Ref - Harrison's internal medicine 20e pg 2237",D

APUD tumors are thought to have a common derivation from neural crest and neuroectoderm, thus the appellation, neuroendocrine tumors. However, there are some APUD tumors of endodermal origin. These tumors have dense core neurosecretory granules present on electron microscopy. Tumors involving these cells can be adenomas or carcinomas. They are characterized by the production of various polypeptide hormones that have either a local paracrine effect (e.g., bombesin, vaso intestinal peptide or a more generalized effect.

So, they are not used now. Two safe and effective vaccines are now licensed and available : - 1.The Vi polysachharide vaccine It is composed of purified Vi capsular polysaccharide from the Ty2 strain of S.Typhi. It is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Only one dose is required. The vaccine confers protection 7 days after injection. To maintain protection, re-vaccination is recommended every 3 years. The vaccine is licensed for individuals aged 2 years. - It does not elicit immune response in children < 2 years. The vaccine is stable for 6 months at 37deg C and for 2 years at 20degC. The recommended storage temprature is 2-8degC. The Vi polysaccharide vaccine can be co-administered with other vaccines relevant for international travellers-such as yellow fever and hepatitis A Acyclovir is given to prevent the development of systemic disease in varicella infected immunosuppresed patients & can halt the progression of zoster in adults. Varicella zoster immunoglobulin given within 72 hrs of exposure can prevent chicken pox and is recommended in exposed immunocompromised persons. A live attenuated varicella vaccine is recommended for children between 12-18 months. It is effective even if given within 3-5 days after exposure. 2.The Ty 21a oral vaccine It is an orally administered, live attenuated Ty2 strain of S.Typhi in which multiple genes (including for Vi Capsular polysaccharide) have been mutated chemically. This lyophilized vaccine is available in 2 preparations : ? 1. Enteric coated capsules - Used for travellers to developing countries. It is used in individuals 5 years of age. 2.Liquid suspension - Used by public health programmes for young children in developing countries. It can be administered from the age of 2 years. Vaccine is administered on 1, 3 and 5the day, i.e., a 3-dose regimen is recommended. Vaccine confers protection 7 days after the last dose. The recommendation is to repeat this series (3 doses) every 3 years for people living in endemic areas, and every year for individuals travelling from non-endemic to endemic countries. Ty 21 a requires storage at 2-8degC, it retains potency for approximately 14 days at 25degC. Proguanil and antibacterial drugs should be stopped from 3 days before until 3 days after giving Ty 21 a, as these drugs may harm live bacteria. The vaccine is not efficacious if administered at the time of ongoing diarrhea. Avoided during diarrhoea as efficacy will reduce. Can be given to HIV +ve, asymptomatic persons with CD4 cell count of > 200/mm3 Well tolerated and has low rates of adverse events. Not recommended in congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, acute febrile illness, acute intestinal infection and in patients on antimitotic drugs May be given simultaneously with live vaccines of polio, cholera, yellow fever and MMR.",A

"A 73-year-old man with history of hypertension and osteoarthritis is evaluated for gradually increasing dyspnea over the preceding 6 weeks. He takes metoprolol for hypertension and naproxen for the arthritis. He has occasionally awakened in the night with mild dyspnea relieved by sitting up but has not noticed edema. Physical examination shows BP of 148/94, HR 96, and RR 16. O2 saturation is 92%. Neck veins show the jugular column 7 cm above the sternal angle. Lung examination reveals mild basilar crackles but no wheezing. Cardiac examination shows sustained apex impulse, S4 gallop, and no murmur. There is no peripheral edema. ECG shows stable left ventricular hypertrophy; no Q waves are seen. Chest x-ray shows increased interstitial markings and some cephalization of flow to the upper lobe vessels. The cardiac silhouette is boot-shaped, but there is no definite cardiomegaly. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular hypertrophy and LV ejection fraction of 55% (normal 50%-70%). What is the likely pathogenesis of this patient's dyspnea?",Increased metabolic demands leading to high-output heart failure (HF),Occult coronary artery disease with dyspnea as an angina equivalent,Impaired diastolic relaxation and filling,Interstitial lung disease (ILD) mimicking pulmonary vascular congestion,"The most likely explanation for this patient's presentation is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), also known as diastolic dysfunction. As many as 50% of patients presenting with definite HF (Heart failure) will have an ejection fraction above 50%. HFPEF is more common in the elderly, in women, and those with conditions (especially hypertension) that lead to LV hypertrophy. Often the echocardiogram will show evidence of impaired relaxation or increased stiffness of the LV (the latter often suggested by decreased flow across the MV during atrial systole, giving the so-called reversed e/a flow ratio). Tachycardia, by decreasing diastolic filling time, will often worsen HF symptoms in diastolic dysfunction. As opposed to systolic HF, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated long-term survival benefit. Management focuses on controlling BP, preventing tachycardia, and treating pulmonary and peripheral fluid overload with diuretics; so many of the modalities used in systolic HF are also employed in HFPEF, just without proof of survival benefit.High output HF due to an AV fistula, Paget disease, or hyperthyroidism can mimic diastolic HF, but the patient usually has evidence of a hyperdynamic circulation (tachycardia, wide pulse pressure, hyperdynamic precordium). Occult CAD should be considered in patients with exertional dyspnea (which can be an angina equivalent), but this patient's rest symptoms and pulmonary vascular congestion would be unusual. In HF due to coronary artery disease, there is almost always evidence of prior MI or ischemic change on ECG. Nevertheless, a stress test is often obtained in patients with unexplained HF to rule out this possibility. Interstitial lung disease can cause rales and interstitial changes on CXR but would not explain the cephalization of flow nor the elevated venous pressure. Measuring B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) will resolve the issue in equivocal cases; BNP will be elevated in HF and normal or minimally elevated in ILD. Anemia can cause fatigue and exertional dyspnea and, rarely, even overt HF, but to cause HF the anemia would have to be very severe (usually Hb 7 g/dL or below) and should be apparent from the physical examination. In addition, severe anemia would usually cause evidence of hyperdynamic circulation as seen in high-output HF.",C

All of the following can lead to .sudden death except: September 2008,Massive MI,Atrial flutter,Ventricular fibrillation,Massive pulmonary emboli,"Ans. B: Atrial flutter Sudden death is not directly associated with atrial flutter. However, in individuals with a pre-existing accessory conduction pathway, such as the bundle of Kent in Wolff-ParkinsonWhite syndrome, the accessory pathway may conduct activity from the atria to the ventricles at a rate that the AV node would usually block. Bypassing the AV node, the atrial rate of 300 beats/ minute may lead to a ventricular rate of 300 beats/ minute (1:1 conduction). Even if the ventricles are able to sustain a cardiac output at such a high rates, 1:1 flutter with time may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, causing hemodynamic collapse and death.",B

Increased PT is seen with -,Warfarin administration,Heparin administration,Factor 8 deficiency,Factor 9 deficiency,"The formation of a clot in the body is a complex process that involves multiple substances called clotting factors. Warfarin decreases the body's ability to form blood clots by blocking the formation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Vitamin K is needed to make clotting factors and prevent bleeding. Therefore, by giving a medication that blocks the clotting factors, your body can stop harmful clots from forming and prevent clots from getting larger. The goal of warfarin therapy is to decrease the clotting tendency of blood, not to prevent clotting completely. Therefore, the effect of warfarin must be monitored carefully with blood testing. On the basis of the results of the blood test, your daily dose of warfarin will be adjusted to keep your clotting time within a target range. The blood test used to measure the time it takes for blood to clot is referred to as a prothrombin time test, or protime (PT). The PT is repoed as the International Normalized Ratio (INR). The INR is a standardized way of expressing the PT value. The INR ensures that PT results obtained by different laboratories can be compared. It is impoant to monitor the INR (at least once a month and sometimes as often as twice weekly) to make sure that the level of warfarin remains in the effective range. If the INR is too low, blood clots will not be prevented, but if the INR is too high, there is an increased risk of bleeding. This is why those who take warfarin must have their blood tested so frequently. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg963",A

What is/are the probable diagnosis,Celiac disease,Pancreatitis,Blind loop syndrome,Heal disease,"Coeliac disease or celiac disease is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine.Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite and among children failure to grow normally. This often begins between six months and two years of age. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any pa of the body or no obvious symptoms.Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;however, it may develop at any age.It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others. The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, and greasy stool (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children. Fuher, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue or anaemia. Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after staing a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease which they had mistakenly ignored.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DR4 occurs in about 70% of patients with rheumatoid ahritis HLA DR4 encoded in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on,Chromosome 6,Chromsome 9,Chromosome 18,Choromosome 22,"Rheumatoid ahritis (RA) is a common form of inflammatory ahritis, occurring throughout the world and in all ethnic groups. The prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8-1.0% in Europe and the Indian subcontinent, with a female-to-male ratio of 3 : 1. The prevalence is lower in South-east Asia (0.4%). The highest prevalence in the world is in Pima Indians (5%). It is a chronic disease characterised by a clinical course of exacerbations and remissions . RA is a complex disease with both genetic and environmental components. The impoance of genetic factors is demonstrated by higher concordance of RA in monozygotic (12-15%) compared with dizygotic twins (3%), and an increased frequency of disease in first-degree relatives of patients. Genome-wide association studies have detected nearly 100 loci that are associated with the risk of developing RA. The strongest association is with variants in the HLA region. Recent studies have shown that the association with HLA is determined by variations in three amino acids in the HLA-DRb1 molecule (positions 11, 71 and 74) and single variants HLA-B (at position 9) and HLA-DPb1 (at position . The HLA locus is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6 and covers a 7.6 Mb region that contains over 250 highly polymorphic genes. The region is organized in three sub-regions: class I, class II and class III, which all have different functions. Both class I and II regions encode for glycoproteins that are expressed as cell surface receptors, whereas the class III region contains genes that encode for a variety of secreted immune system proteins, including complement factors and cytokines. The class I region encodes for three main subsets of HLA molecules; HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C. Class I HLA molecules are composed of an HLA-coded heavy a-chain and an invariant light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (b2m), which is essential for functional expression of the HLA molecule at the cell surface. The a-chain is folded to form a peptide-binding cleft that is ""closed"" and can accommodate sho antigenic peptides, typically 8-10 amino acids long. These class I molecules are expressed on all nucleated cells and specialize in presentation of intracellular antigens, including viral antigens, to cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. Genes in the class II region encode for HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ molecules as well as a few other related proteins. Class II HLA molecules are composed of an a-chain and a b-chain, both coded by the HLA class II region. Unlike the class I molecules, the peptide-binding cleft of class II molecules are ""open"" which allows the accommodation of larger peptides of 15-20 amino acids long. Class II molecules are initially expressed on the cell surface of immune cells, in paicular antigen presenting cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells, as well as B cells and activated T cells. These molecules present antigens from outside the cell to (CD4+) T cells which in turn stimulate B cells to produce antibodies towards that specific antigen. This results in an antigen specific immune response. After activation of the immune system, the HLA class II molecules can be expressed on other cells. Ref - pubmed.com , Davidsons 23e p1044",A

The acid base status of a patient reveals a pH=7.46 and pCO2=30 mm Hg. The patient has a paially compensated primary-,Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic alkalosis,Respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis,"Respiratory alkalosis Respiratory alkalosis develops when there is a period of sustained hyperventilation, resulting in a reduction of PCO2 and increase in plasma pH. If the condition is sustained, renal compensation occurs, such that tubular acid secretion is reduced and the plasma bicarbonate falls. Respiratory alkalosis is usually of sho duration, occurring in anxiety states or as the result of over-vigorous assisted ventilation. It can be prolonged in the context of pregnancy, pulmonary embolism, chronic liver disease, and ingestion of ceain drugs such as salicylates that directly stimulate the respiratory centre in the brainstem. Clinical features are those of the underlying cause but agitation associated with perioral and digital tingling may also occur, as alkalosis promotes the binding of calcium to albumin, resulting in a reduction in ionised calcium concentrations. In severe cases, Trousseau's sign and Chvostek's sign may be positive, and tetany or seizures may develop (p. 663).

"In a patient with wide-complex tachycardia, the presence of all of the following in the ECG indicates ventricular tachycardia except-",Atrioventricular dissociation,Fusion beats,Typical right bundle branch block,Capture beats,"Absence of a ""RS complex,"" Concordance of QRS simply means ""all up"" or ""all down. right bundle branch block (RBBB) is a hea block in the right bundle branch of the electrical conduction system During a right bundle branch block, the right ventricle is not directly activated by impulses travelling through the right bundle branch. The left ventricle however, is still normally activated by the left bundle branch. These impulses are then able to travel through the myocardium of the left ventricle to the right ventricle and depolarize the right ventricle this way. As conduction through the myocardium is slower than conduction through the Bundle of His-Purkinje fibres, the QRS complex is seen to be widened. The QRS complex often shows an extra deflection that reflects the rapid depolarisation of the left ventricle followed by the slower depolarisation of the right ventricle. The criteria to diagnose a right bundle branch block on the electrocardiogram: The hea rhythm must originate above the ventricles (i.e., sinoatrial node, atria or atrioventricular node) to activate the conduction system at the correct point. The QRS duration must be more than 100 ms (incomplete block) or more than 120 ms (complete block). There should be a terminal R wave in lead V1 (often called ""R prime,"" and denoted by R, rR', rsR', rSR', or qR). There must be a prolonged S wave in leads I and V6 (sometimes referred to as a ""slurred"" S wave). The T wave should be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. This is known as appropriate T wave discordance with bundle branch block. A concordant T wave may suggest ischemia or myocardial infarction Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1456",C

Iodised salt was first staed in which country,India,UK,Switzerland,Germany,"Iodized salt The iodization of salt is now the most widely used prophylactic public health measure against endemic goitre. In India the level of iodization is fixed under the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act and is not less than 30 ppm at the production point, and not less than 15 ppm of iodine at the consumer level. Iodized salns most economical, convenient and effective means of mass prophylaxis inendemic areas. Under the national IDD control activities, the Government of India proposed to completely replace common salt with iodized salt in a phased manner. The National Institute of Nutrition at Hyderabad has come out with a new product, common salt foified with iron and iodine. Community trials have been launched to examine the efficacy of the ""two-in-one"" salt. Iodized oil : Another method which has demonstrated its efficacy for controlling goitre is intramuscular injection of iodized oil (mostly poppy-seed oil). Scientists at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad have now successfully developed a process to produce iodized oil in safflower or safola oil. The advantage of the injection procedure is that an average dose of 1 ml will provide protection for about 4 years. Although more expensive than iodated salt, this method has the advantage that it can be applied rapidly and in places where iodization of salt is not feasible or iodated salt is in sho supply. However, the difficulty with. this procedure is one of logistics, i.e., in reaching every victim or potential victim of !DD for the injection, which means that this approach is less practicable. . Iodized oil, oral : The oral administration of iodine as iodized oil or as sodium iodate tablets, is technically simpler than the injection method. Limited research has found that these procedures are effective against goitre but more costly than intramuscular injections. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 681",A

Anti-Hu paraneoplastic neuropathy manifests as,motor neuronopathy,sensory neuronopathy,motor sensory neuronopathy,acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,"ANTI-Hu PARANEOPLASTIC NEUROPATHY This uncommon immune-mediated disorder manifests as a sensory neuronopathy (i.e., selective damage to sensory nerve bodies in dorsal root ganglia). The onset is often asymmetric with dysesthesias and sensory loss in the limbs that soon progress to affect all limbs, the torso, and the face. Marked sensory ataxia, pseudoathetosis, and inability to walk, stand, or even sit unsuppoed are frequent features and are secondary to the extensive deafferentation. Subacute sensory neuronopathy may be idiopathic, but more than half of cases are paraneoplastic, primarily related to lung cancer, and most of those are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Diagnosis of the underlying SCLC requires awareness of the association, testing for the paraneoplastic antibody, and often positron emission tomography (PET) scanning for the tumor. The target antigens are a family of RNA-binding proteins (HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1) that in normal tissues are only expressed by neurons. The same proteins are usually expressed by SCLC, triggering in some patients an immune response characterized by antibodies and cytotoxic T cells that cross-react with the Hu proteins of the dorsal root ganglion neurons, resulting in immune-mediated neuronal destruction",B

A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following aerial blood gas analysis repo : pH = 7.12 : pCO2 18mmHg; HCO3= 12mmol/L. The resulting acid base abnormality can be best labeled as :,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis,"Answer is A (Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis): With pH < 7.35 (7.12) acidosis is confirmed. Abbnormal CO2 with change in opposite to expected. (acidosis should have increased CO2) indicates that the change in compensatory (compensatory respiratory alkalosis), Decreased bicarbonates with change in keeping with change in pH suggests that the problem is metabolic. Thus the whole picture represents metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Explanation : Acid base disorders needlessly, confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. pH < 7.35 is acidosis ; pH > 7.45 is alkalosis 1deg change in HCO3 is termed as metabolic (Normal HCO3- = 22 - 30 meq/l) if change in HCO3- is in keeping with the pH (i.e. if there is acidosis and HCO3- decreased) the problem is a Metabolic one. If change in HCO3 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and HCO3"" is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic. 1deg change is CO2 is termed as respiratory (Normal pCO2 = 35 - 45 mmHg) If change in CO2 is in keeping with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory If change in CO2 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory. the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory.

Measure of communicability of a disease,Case fatality rate,Secondary attack rate,Sullivan index,Incubation period,"Secondary attack rate : SAR is defined as “the number of exposed persons developing the disease within the range of incubation period, following exposure to primary case. SAR = No of exposed persons developing disease within the range of the incubation period ——(Total number of exposed/susceptible contact) x 100
The important features of SAR are:-

The primary case is excluded from both the numerator and denominator.
Denominator is restricted to susceptible contacts of primary case.
In denominator, person should be susceptible → Immune person (to disease) are not susceptible to develop the disease, So they are excluded.
Disease should develop within the range of incubation period.

SAR is an important measure of communicability. Higher secondary attack rate means, more numbers of susceptible contacts are developing the disease after exposure to primary case.
So, higher the SAR higher is the communicability (infectiousness) of disease.",B

"A person found some correlation between dietary factors and a disease; he did this by collecting data from the food manufacturers and hospitals respectively, such a study is?",Ecological,Cross sectional,Psephological study,Experimental study,"Ecological study . Observational studies allow nature to take its own course; the investigator measures but does not intervene. Descriptive studies are those that investigate the distribution of disease in a population Analytical studies analyse the relationship between the disease and the causative factors. Experimental or interventional studies involve an active attempt to change a disease determinant or the progress of a disease (similar in design to experiments in other sciences) Descriptive studies Descriptive studies are usually the first phase of an epidemiological investigation. These studies are concerned with observing the distribution of disease or health-related characteristics in human population and identify the characteristics with which the disease in question seems to be associated. These studies provide clues to disease etiology and help in formulation of an etiological hypothesis. Case repo - the simplest of the descriptive studies is the case repo, which is often seen in medical journals and describes an unusual feature or unusual association between the disease and some exposure factor. Case series - a case series is a sequence of case repos with common elements such as similar clinical features and suspected common exposures. They can be valuable early evidence for association between exposures and diseases which can be studied in more detail subsequently; however as they lack a control (comparison) group, the case series can result in false leads, wasted energy & resources. Cross-sectional or Prevalence study - in cross-sectional studies, we 'survey' several individuals at one point in time and collect information on health status, health-related behaviours, and other exposure factors. In this way we can estimate the burden of disease in a group of individuals and try to estimate whether a paicular exposure is linked to a disease or health outcome. Ecological or correlational study - an ecological or correlational study is one in which the unit of analysis is an aggregate of individuals and information is collected on this group rather than on individual members. The association between a summary measure of disease and a summary measure of exposure is studied. E.g., There is a positive correlation between fat consumption and breast cancer across many nations. Conclusion: Fat consumption is a risk factor for breast cancer. An error of reasoning (Ecological Fallacy) occurs when conclusions are drawn about individuals from data that are associated with groups, as relationships observed for groups may not necessarily hold for individuals. In the above example, it is not possible to infer that the women with breast cancer actually had a high fat consumption. Analytical studies Analytical studies are the second major type of epidemiological studies. In contrast to descriptive studies that look at the entire population, in analytical studies the subject of interest is the individual within the population. The object is not to formulate, but to test hypotheses. Case Control - Sometimes it is necessary to study individuals in whom a disease has already occurred in order to find out whether these individuals had been exposed to a paicular risk factor. This is called a case control study. The cases are compared to a group of individuals who do not have the disease in question and the same information on risk factors is collected from both groups. By doing this, we may be able to find out if a paicular risk factor is more common among the cases than controls and therefore suggest an association between the risk factor and disease. Coho study - In a coho study, a group exposed to a paicular factor and another group not exposed to this factor are followed up over time to determine occurrence of disease. The incidence of disease in the exposed group is compared to the incidence of disease in the unexposed group. This is called the relative risk and it allows us to make a judgment on whether the exposure factor and the disease are causally linked.",A

Time difference between screening test and standard test is known as -,Lead time,Generation time,CIP,Lag time,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Lead time o In respect to screening test and diagnostic test, a disease passes through following phase, sequentially. i) Disease onset --> Disease process just staed. ii) First possible point of diagnosis The earliest point in disease process where a diagnosis can be made, i.e., before this point diagnosis can not be made by any test. iii) Final critical point of diagnosis --> The point after which even diagnosis and treatment will not change the outcome. iv)Usual time of diagnosis --> Time in disease process when most of the people are diagnosed by usual diagnostic procedure (not screening test). o So, by screening, the intention is to diagnosis the disease between : ? i) First possible point Before that diagnosis cannot made by any test. ii) Final critical point After that treatment will not change the outcome. o The time period between these two points is called screening time and all screening tests are aimed to detect the disease during this period. Lead time o The lead time is the time period between diagnosis by early detection (i.e., earliest point of diagnosis by screening test) and diagnosis by standard diagnostic tests. o Lead time is the advantage gained by screening. Implications of lead time & Screening time o If the person is diagnosed in screening time (from first possible point to final critical point), the outcome can be improved/changed by early treatment. o If the person is diagnosed after screening time (after final critical point), the outcome will not change even with treatment. o So, though the lead time is the advantage gained by screening, only the earlier poion of lead time, i.e., screening time is impoant for screening tests. o For example if the usual outcome of a disease is death (without any intervention). Following may occur : - i) Person is diagnosed before final critical point in screening time ---> Person may survive or death may be postponed by treatment (outcome is altered/improved). ii) Person is diagnosed after final critical point, even if in lead time (i.e., poion of lead time after screening time) ----> Person will die even with treatment, at the same time (the time of death without any intervention). iii) Screening is not useful for the diseases, which do not have lead time (screening time is a poion of lead time) --> Because there is nothing to be gained by screening as the disease will be diagnosed at the usual time of diagnosis (as by standard diagnostic tests).",A

"All the following features our ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia, except -",Fusion beats,Extreme left axis detion,Very broad QRS complexes,Response to carotid sinus massage,"Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a hea attack, especially if they have weak hea muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (""twisting of the spikes""). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",C

"A previously healthy and active 72-year-old woman presents to your office with a complaint of stiffness and pain in her neck and shoulders. The symptoms are much worse in the morning and improve throughout the day. The pain affects the soft tissues and does not appear localized to the shoulder or hip joints. She denies headache or jaw claudication. Physical examination is unrevealing; there is no inflammatory synovitis, muscle tenderness, or skin rash. Muscle strength is normal in the deltoid and iliopsoas muscle groups. She has normal range of motion of the shoulder and hip joints. Laboratory studies reveal an elevated ESR of 92 mm/h and a mild normocytic anemia. Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?",Empiric trial of prednisone 15 mg daily,Graded exercise regimen,MRI of bilateral shoulders,Trapezius muscle biopsy,"The patient has PMR. A relatively common disease of the elderly, PMR presents as morning stiffness and pain in the shoulders, neck, and hip girdle. Diagnosis is mainly clinical; improvement of symptoms throughout the day and an absence of joint findings on physical examination provide clues to the diagnosis. Most patients have a markedly elevated ESR. PMR overlaps with giant cell (temporal) arteritis, so it is worthwhile to ask about symptoms of headache or jaw claudication. In the absence of symptoms or signs of temporal arteritis, no additional testing is indicated, and the diagnosis is presumptively confirmed by prompt response to moderate dose steroids (10-20 mg prednisone per day). Patients with occult temporal arteritis will not usually respond to modest doses of prednisone. Caution must be taken in tapering the steroids as patients with PMR frequently relapse upon discontinuation of treatment. A graded exercise regimen (answer b) would be an appropriate treatment option for fibromyalgia, but fibromyalgia rarely begins at age 72 and does not cause elevation of the ESR. MRI of the upper torso may show inflammation of the bursa and shoulder joint synovium, but this patient does not have localized tenderness in these structures. Muscle biopsy (answer d) is indicated in polymyositis or inclusion body myositis, but this patient does not have muscle weakness. Temporal artery biopsy (answer e) should be performed in patients suspected of having giant cell arteritis. Our patient, however, denies symptoms consistent with arterial involvement. If the patient does not respond to treatment with modest dose steroids, stronger consideration should be given to ""blind"" temporal artery biopsy.",A

The version related to histamine is due to an allergic reaction to agents such as insect bites, foods, or medications. The version related to bradykinin may occur due to an inherited problem known as C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, medications known as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors, or a lymphoproliferative disorder. Effos to protect the airway may include intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Histamine-related angioedema can be treated with antihistamines, coicosteroids, and epinephrine.In those with bradykinin-related disease a C1 esterase inhibitor, ecallantide, or icatibant may be used.Fresh frozen plasma may be used insteadIn the United States the disease affects about 100,000 people a year.

The drugs not used for treatment of osteoporosis are-,Biphosphonates,Steroids,Denosumab,Calciam,", Ans. is 'b' i.e., Steroids Management of osteoporosisNon trharmacolosical therapyo Calcium and vitamin D supplementationo Important additional lifestyle measures includeExerciseSmoking cessationAvoidance o f heavy alcoholCounselling on fall preventionPharmacologic therapyEstrogenso A large body of clinical trial data indicates that various types of estrogens (conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol, estrone, esterified estrogens, eihinylestradiol and mestranol) reduce bone turnover, prevent bone loss and induce small increase in bone mass of spine, hip and total body.o The effect of estrogen are seen in women with natural or surgical menopause and in late menopausal women.Biphosphonate (Alendronate, risedronate, ibandronaie, Zoledronic acid)o First line therapy1 because of their efficacy, favourable cost and availability of the long term data.o Atendronate or risedronate are preferred.Denosumabo An alternative for patient who cannot tolerate biphosphonate or who have difficulty with dosing requirements and have impaired renal function.o Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against RANKL that reduces osteoclastogenesis.o RANKL is a member of TNF superfamily of ligands and receptors and is essential for the function of bone resorbing osteoclasts.o RANKL accelarates osteoclastogenesis when it binds to its receptor RANK.o Denosumab improve bone mineral density and reduce the incidence of new verierbral hip and non vertebral fractures by acting against RANKL.Raloxifeno Raloxifen is given for patients who cannot tolerate or are not candidates for any biphosphonates.o Raloxifen and tamoxifen are tissue selective estrogen receptor modulator.o Their characteristic feature is that they do not have pure agonist or antagonistic action on estrogen receptors.o SERMS are ""selective"" that means SERM blocks estrogen in some tissues and activates estrogen action in others.o Raloxifen increases bone mineral density and reduces the risk of vertebral fractures.o Raloxifen also appears to lower the risk of breast cancer and itdoes not stimulate endometrial hyperplasia or vaginal bleeding.o Tamoxifen is another SERM used primarily for the prevention and management of breast cancer. It is not typically used for osteoporosis but postmenopausal women who are receiving treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer are probably receiving bone protection.o Raloxifen is considered the first line drug for t/t of osteoprosis. However, it is somewhat less effective than estrogen and biphosphonates.Parathyroid hormone therapyo PTH therapy is suggested for patients with severe ostoporosis who are unable to tolerate any of the available biphosphonates or to those who continue to have fractures even after one year of biphosphonate therapy.o Parathyroid hormone seems an unlikely candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis because of its well described deleterious effect on bone. However, intermittent administration of recombinant human PTH stimulates bone formation more than resorption and is effective for fracture reduction.Exogenous vitamin Ko Exogenous vitamin K is required for the carboxylation of osteocalcin which in turn allows osteocalcin to bind to hydroxyapatite mineral.o A vitamine K2 preparation (menatetrone) is widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis in Japan.Strontium renelateo Strontium ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be moderately antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in hone formation.o Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by : -Decreasing the rate of bone resorption fantiresorptive therapy)Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy)o Since bone remodelling is a coupled process antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD.o Thus strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation.o Strontium ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of bone decay but also acts on bone formation preventing the growth of new bone.",B

A patient presents with recurrent episodes of sharp pain over his right cheek that is precipitated on chewing. Between attacks patients is otherwise normal. The most probable diagnosis is -,Preherpetic neuralgia,Trigeminal neuralgia,Mumps,Thalamic syndrome,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Trigeminal Neuralgia Epidemiologyo TN is a rare condition that affects women more than men.o The incidence increases gradually with age: most idiopathic cases begin after age 50.Etiology and pathogenesiso Most cases of TNare caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve root, usually within a few millimeters of entry into the pons (the root entry zone).o Compression by an aberrant loop of an artery or vein is thought to account for 80 to 90 percent of cases.o Idiopathic TN or TN caused by a vascular compression is considered classic TN.o Other causes of TN via nerve compression include vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma), meningioma, epidermoid or other cyst, or, rarely, a saccular aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation.Classificationo In the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), TN is divided into classic (or classical) trigeminal neuralgia caused by neurovascular compression and painful trigeminal neuropathy caused by a number of other conditions.Trigeminal neuralgia||ClassicPainful trigeminalo Classic TN encompasses both idiopathic TN c cases and those related to vascular compression.o Painful trigeminal neurooathv is caused by lesions other than vascular compression:# The rationale is as follows.# Painfid trigeminal neuropathy attributed to acute herpes zoster.# The ICHD-3 acknowledges that TN found to be related to compression of the trigeminal nerve by a vascular loop, as demonstrated by surgery\ should strictly be regarded as secondary.# Postherpetic trigeminal neuropathy# Painful posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy# Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to multiple sclerosis plaque# However, most patients do not have surgery, and it is often uncertain as to whether they have primary or secondary neuralgia.# Painful trigeminal neuropathy attributed to space-occupying lesion# For this reason, the ICHD-3 uses the term""classical'' instead of ""primary"" for patients with a typical history of TN who have a presumed or demonstrated vascular source of compression as the cause.# Painfid trigeminal neuropathy'attributed to other disorderClinical featureso TN is defined clinically by paroxysmal, stereotyped attacks of usually intense, sharp, superficial, or stabbing pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve.o The pain of TN tends to occur in paroxysms and is maximal at or near onset.o Facial muscle spasms can be seen with severe pain.#This finding gave rise to the older term for this disorder, ""tic douloureux""o The pain is often described as electric, shock-like or stabbing.o It usually lasts from one to several seconds, but may occur repetitively.o A refractory' period of several minutes during which a paroxysm cannot be provoked is common.o Some patients with longstanding TN may have continuous dull pain that is present between paroxysms of pain.o Unlike some other facial pain syndromes, TN typically does not awaken patients at night,o TN is typically unilateral.#Occasionally the pain is bilateral though rarely on both sides simultaneously.o The distribution of pain most often involves the V2 and/or V3 subdivisions of the trigeminal nerve.o Trigger zones in the distribution of the affected nerve may be present and are often located near the midline. Lightly touching these zones often triggers an attach leading patients to protect these areas.# Other triggers of TN paroxysms include chewing, talking, brushing teeth, cold air smiling, and/or grimacing.o Autonomic symptoms, usually mild or moderate, can occur in association with attacks ofTNin the VI trigeminal distribution, including lacrimation, conjunctival injection, and rhinorrhea.Diagnosiso The diagnosis of TN is based upon the characteristic clinical features described above, primarily paroxysms of pain in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.o Once the diagnosis of TN is suspected on clinical grounds, a search for secondary causes should be undertaken.Diagnostic criteria for trigerm in at neuralgiao The International Classification ofHeadache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria for classic TN are as follows:A)At least three attacks of unilateral facial pain fulfilling criteria B and CA) Occurring in one or more divisions of the trigeminal ner\>e, with no radiation beyond the trigeminal distributionA) Pain has at least three of the following four characteristics:# Recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a fraction of a second to two minutes.# Severe intensity.# Electric shock-like, shooting, stabbing, or sharp in quality.# At least three attacks precipitated by innocuous stimuli to the affected side of the face (some attacks may be, or appear to be, spontaneous).D) No clinically evident neurologic deficit.E) Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.",B

Amplifier host for Japanese encephalitis is: September 2011,Man,Pig,Donkey,Culex mosquito,"Ans. B: Pig In Japanese encephalitis, pigs are the amplifier host (they themselves didn't manifest ove symptoms but circulate the virus) Japanese encephalitis/ Japanese B encephalitis The Japanese encephalitis virus is a virus from the family Flaviviridae. Domestic pigs and wild birds (herons) are reservoirs of the virus; transmission to humans may cause severe symptoms. One of the most impoant vectors of this disease is the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus. This disease is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Far East. Japanese encephalitis has an incubation period of 5 to 15 days and the vast majority of infections are asymptomatic Only 1 in 250 infections develop into encephalitis. Severe rigors mark the onset of this disease in humans. Fever, headache and malaise are other non-specific symptoms of this disease which may last for a period of between 1 and 6 days. Signs which develop during the acute encephalitic stage include neck rigidity, cachexia, hemiparesis, convulsions and a raised body temperature between 38 and 41 degrees Celsius. Moality of this disease varies but is generally much higher in children. Increased microglial activation following JEV infection has been found to influence the outcome of viral pathogenesis. Activated microglia secrete cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), which can cause toxic effects in the brain. Additionally, other soluble factors such as neurotoxins, excitatory neurotransmitters, prostaglandin, reactive oxygen, and nitrogen species are secreted by activated microglia. The causative agent Japanese encephalitis virus is an enveloped virus of the genus flavivirus and is closely related to the West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope (E) protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus to the inside of the cell. Japanese Encephalitis is diagnosed by detection of antibodies in serum and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) by IgM capture ELISA. Viral antigen can also be shown in tissues by indirect fluorescent antibody staining.",B

Dyslipidemia associated with alcohol consumption-,Decreased HDL,Increased HDL,Decreased triglycerase,Decreased lipoprotein,"Dyslipidemia is an abnormal amount of lipids (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol and/or fat phospholipids) in the blood. In developed countries, most dyslipidemias are hyperlipidemias; that is, an elevation of lipids in the blood. This is often due to diet and lifestyle. Prolonged elevation of insulin levels can also lead to dyslipidemia. Likewise, increased levels of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) may cause dyslipidemia. The most common conditions that were felt to be contributing to dyslipidemia were excessive alcohol intake (10 percent) and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (8 percent). Hyperlipidemia in association with insulin resistance is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides, or both) or a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level. Lifestyle, genetics, disorders (such as low thyroid hormone levels or kidney disease), drugs, or a combination can contribute. Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 838",B

Management of cerebral malaria
Antimalarial treatment

In cerebral malaria rapidly acting parenteral drugs should be given. Quinine is the drug of choice.

Fluid balance

Following admission patient should be rehydrated to a CVP of approximately 5 cm

Hypoglycemia

Slow intravenous injection of 50% dextrose water

Lactic acidosis

Hypovolemia should be corrected first

Acute renal failure

Fluid should be restricted to replace insensible losses only. Dialysis should be started early when there is evidence of multiple organ dysfunction.

Acute pulmonary edema

They should be nursed upright and given oxygen and the right-sided filling pressure should be reduced

Bleeding

Less than 5% of patients of cerebral malaria develop D.I.C. These patients should be given a fresh blood transfusion and vitamin K.

Hemoglobin does not bind with:,Oxygen,Carbon dioxide,Carbon monoxide,HCN,"Hemoglobin Combines Reversibly With Oxygen.
Carbon monoxide (CO) combines with hemoglobin at the same point on the hemoglobin molecule as does O2 ; it can therefore  displace  O2   from  the  hemoglobin.
CO2   reacts  directly  with  amine  radicals  of  the hemoglobin  molecule  to  form  the  compound  carbaminohemoglobin  (CO2 Hgb).  
This  combination  of  CO2   and hemoglobin  is  a  reversible  reaction  that  occurs  with  a  loose  bond,  so  the  CO2   is  easily  released  into  the alveoli, where the PCO2  is lower than in the pulmonary capillaries.

Journal Source: Ann Hematol. 2000 May;79(5):272-4. Authors: Jain P, Kumar R, Gujral S, Kumar A, Singh A, Jain Y, Dubey S, Anand M, Arya LS. A four-year-old boy presented with marked peripheral blood eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count of 54 x 10(9)/1), features of hypereosinophilic syndrome, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-L2), the latter characterized by the presence of granular blasts. Blasts were negative for myeloperoxidase, non-specific esterase, acid phosphatase, periodic-acid Schiff stain, and toluidine blue. They exhibited an early pre-B immunophenotype (TdT, CD19, CDIO, CD20 and CD22 positive) and stained negative for T (CD7, CD2, CD5 and CD3) and myeloid markers (MPO, CD33 and CD13). Chromosomal analysis revealed a normal karyotype. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first repo of the coexistence of granular ALL and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Why Hypereosinophillic Syndrome Option A Explanation Idiopathic hypereosinophillic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by extremely high levels of peripheral blood eosinophil counts. (80% of (70 x 109) Leucocytes were eosinophils in this patient) Clinical picture of dry cough, dyspnea, wheezing etc is fuher suggestive of HES. This is differentiated from eosinophillic leukaemia by the absence of eosinophilic blast cells.

Vancomycin + ceftriaxone (Ref: Harrison 19/e p889, 18/e p3416)Antimicrobial therapy of pneumococcal meningitis is initiated with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefepime) and vancomycin.""Antimicrobial therapy of pneumococcal meningitis is initiated with a cephalosporin (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or cefepime) and vancomycin. For S. pneumoniae meningitis, an isolate of S. pneumoniae is considered to be susceptible to penicillin with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) <0.06 mg/mL, to have intermediate resistance when the MIC is 0.1 -1.0 mg/mL, and to be highly resistant when the MIC >1.0 mg/mL. Isolates of S. pneumoniae that have cephalosporin MICs <_0.5 mg/mL are considered sensitive to the cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefepime). Those with MICs of 1 mg/mL are considered to have intermediate resistance, and those with MICs >_2 mg/mL are considered resistant. For meningitis due to pneumococci, with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone MICs <0.5 mg/mL, treatment with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone is usually adequate. For MIC >1 mg/mL, vancomycin is the antibiotic of choice; Rifampin can be added to vancomycin for its synergistic effect but is inadequate as monotherapy because resistance develops rapidly when it is used alone.""- Harrison 18/e p3416""A 2-week course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy is recommended for pneumococcal meningitis.""- Harrison 18/e p3416""Patients with penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae who do not respond to intravenous vancomycin atone may benefit from the addition of intraventricular vancomycin.

A patient with previously normal haemoglobin suffered a sudden massive acute hemorrhage. He is most likely to show all of the following except:,High reticulocyte count,High neutrophil count,High packed cell volume,Low mean corpuscular volume,"Ans. c. High packed cell volume Packed cell volume Packed cell volume (PCV) or hematocrit determines the percentage of red blood cells in the plasma. Decrease in hematocrit PCV in the early hours after acute hemorrhage is usually the result of volume resuscitation rather than ongoing blood loss. The body adjusts to severe hemorrhage by expanding the circulating volume at the expense of extravascular fluid. However, within several hours after hemorrhage plasma volume begins to increase due to shift of interstitial fluid into vascular space RBCs cannot be replaced quickly as the bone marrow takes approximately ten days to produce mature RBCs. As a result PCV done several hours after bleeding episode will show more accurate picture of the hematocrit (Le. decreased PCV).

A young patient presents with a systolic murmur at the apex. The murmur increases on both handgrip and Valsalva maneuver. Which of the following conditions is most likely?,ASD,Aoic stenosis,MVP,VSD,"Handgrip and Valsalva maneuver may increase the intensity of the murmur of MVP. Whenever a murmur increases with Valsalva, think HOCM and MVP. Valsalva decreases ventricular filling and leads to a narrower HOCM outlet. So, HOCM murmur becomes louder. Valsalva also allows more laxity in the chordae tendinae due to the less ventricular filling. This allows the mitral valve prolapsed and its murmur to become more prominent. In a case of aoic stenosis, when the Valsalva is performed, there is less volume in ventricle to be ejected. Hence the flow across the AS is less. So it softens. When the Valsalva is performed in a case of MR, backflow in MR ( without MVP ) is less. So it softens. Ref: Harrison; 20th edition",C

It comprises: Undernutrition, Overnitrition, Imbalance and Specific deficiency. Main victims are children under 15 years. Children under 5 years are hit the hardest. Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition.

Age under which child is considered incapable of committing an offence is -,3 years,7 years,14 years,18 years,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 7 yearsCriminal responsibility and relevant sections under IPCSection of IPCRelated with82A child under the age ofseven is incapable of committing an offence. This is so because action alobe doesnot amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and conse- quences of his conduct on that occasion. The lawr presumes such maturity in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation.

The most probable diagnosis is:,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Migraine,Cluster Headache,Posterior fossa tumor,"Ans: A (Subarachnoid hemorrhage) Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 18th editionExplanation:Subarachnoid HemorrhageExcluding head trauma, the most common cause of S AH is rupture of a saccular aneurysm.Other causes include bleeding from a vascular malformation (arteriovenous malformation or dural arterial-venous listula)Saccular (""Berry"") Aneurysm2% of adults harbor intracranial aneurysmsThe three most common locations are theTerminal internal carotid arteryMiddle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcationTop of the basilar artery.Mycotic aneurysms are usually located distal to the first bifurcation of major arteries of the circle of Willis.Most result from infected emboli due to bacterial endocarditis causing septic degeneration of arteries and subsequent dilation and rupture.PathophysiologySaccular aneurysms occur at the bifurcations of the large- to medium-sized intracranial arteriesRupture is into the subarachnoid space in the basal cisterns and often into the parenchyma of the adjacent brain.Approximately 85% of aneurysms occur in the anterior circulation, mostly on the circle of Willis.About 20%' of patients have multiple aneurysms, many at mirror sites bilaterally.Clinical ManifestationsMost unruptured intracranial aneurysms are completely asymptomatic.At the moment of aneurysmal rupture w ith major SAH, the ICP suddenly rises.This may account for the sudden transient loss of consciousness that occurs in nearly half of patients.Sudden loss of consciousness may be preceded by a brief moment of excruciating headache, but most patients first complain of headache upon regaining consciousness.Severe headache associated with exertion is the presenting complaint. The patient often calls the headache ''the worst headache of my life '; however, the most important characteristic is sudden onset.The headache is usually generalized, often with neck stiffness, and vomiting is common.Sudden headache in the absence of focal neurologic symptoms is the hallmark of aneurysmal rupture.Focal deficits can occur rarely.Anterior communicating artery or MCA bifurcation aneurysms may bleed enough to produce mass effect. The deficits that result can include hemiparesis, aphasia, and abulia.A third cranial nerve palsy, particularly when associated with pupillary dilation, loss of ipsilateral (but retained contralateral) light reflex, and focal pain above or behind the eye, may occur with an expanding aneurysm at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the internal carotid artery.A sixth nerve palsy may indicate an aneury sm in the cavernous sinus, and visual field defects can occur with an expanding supraclinoid carotid or anterior cerebral artery aneurysm.Occipital and posterior cervical pain may signal a posterior inferior cerebellar artery or anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm.Pain in or behind the eye and in the low temple can occur with an expanding MCA aneurysm.",A

Differentiating features between Pre-renal and Intrinsic ARF Prerenal Azotemia is the most common form of ARF and is caused by renal hypoperfusion either from generalized hypovolemia or from altered renal hemodynamics resulting in hypoperfusion By definition Renal parenchymal tissue is not damaged in prerenal ARF and prerenal ARF is rapidly reversible upon correction of the primary hemodynamic abnormality Analysis of urine and blood biochemistry provides several useful 'Renal failure Indices' to distinguish prerenal ARF from intrinsic ARF (Ischemic /Nephrotoxic ARF),C
Which part is first involved by mummification?,Heart,Skin,Stomach,Muscles,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Skin Mummification* It is also a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of moisture. That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deserts, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil.* Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body parts like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation).* Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning favor mummification.* Medicolegal importance: (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

Most common presentation of sick euthyroid syndrome is?,"Low T3, high T4, varible TSH",Low T3 levels with normal T4 and TSH level,"Low T3, Low T4, High TSH","Low T3, Low T4, Low TSH","Any acute, severe illness can cause abnormalities of circulating TSH or thyroid hormone levels in the absence of underlying thyroid disease, making these measurements potentially misleading. The major cause of these hormonal changes is the release of cytokines such as IL-6. This is called Sick Euthyroid Syndrome (Nonthyroidal illness).The most common hormone pattern in sick euthyroid syndrome (SES) is a decrease in total and unbound T3 levels (low T3 syndrome) with normal levels of T4 and TSH. The magnitude of the fall in T3 correlates with the severity of the illness.T4 conversion to T3 peripheral 5' (outer ring) deiodination is impaired, leading to increased reverse T3 (rT3). Since rT3 is metabolized by 5' deiodination, its clearance is also reduced. Thus, decreased clearance rather than increased production is the major basis for increased rT3.

Which of the following is used as emergency contraceptive,MALA N,0.75mg LNG,Copper T,All of the above,"Postcoital Contraception (Interceptives) Postcoital contraceptive agent interferes with postovulatory events leading to pregnancy and is therefore known as interceptive. It is also known as 'emergency contraception' method used to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of a condom during coitus taking place around ovulation. It is used in misplaced IUCD and missed pill. These postcoital methods should be used mainly as 'back-up' methods in these conditions and not as a regular contraceptive technique as an ongoing method following every act of sexual intercourse. The preparations available include: Two tablets of relatively high doses of combined pill (Ovran/Eugynon 50), containing 100 mcg EE2 and 1 mg norethisterone, or 500 mcg LNG, taken within 72 h of inter- course followed by two tablets taken 12 h later (Yuzpe and Lancee, 1977). Failure rate--3.2 per 100 woman years. Mode of action. The hormones may delay ovulation if taken soon after intercourse, cause corpus luteolysis, and bring about cervical mucus changes and endometrial atrophy. Levonorgestrel (LNG). Prostinar tablet contains 0.75 mg LNG. One tablet should be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse and another 12 h later. Alternately, two tablets can be taken as a single dose. The failure rate is 1.1%. The tablets can be offered up to 120 h but its efficacy de- creases with the longer coital-drug interval. LNG prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency). The period may come earlier or delayed. Side effects are those of progestogens. The hormone is not teratogenic in case pregnancy does occur but risk of ectopic pregnancy remains. Advantages It has no oestrogen and its associated side effects. It can be offered to hypeensive, cardiac and diabetic woman. It can be offered to a lactating woman. It can be given as late as 120 h after the unprotected intercourse. Single-dose therapy is an advantage. Contraindicated in liver disease, contains lactate, so allergy to galactose. The drug is also contraindicated in a woman with history of thrombophlebitis and migraine. RU 486 (Mifepristone) RU 486 is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It does not prevent feilization but by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium, it causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and prevents implantation. It is not teratogenic. A single dose of 25-50 mg is effective in preventing pregnancy in 99.1% cases (failure rate 0.9%). It causes delayed menstruation. Ectopic pregnancy is not avoided. The drug is expensive as compared to LNG. Ulipristal. Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, attaches to progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, prevents implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. Two per cent pregnancy rate is repoed. Side effects are headache and mood changes. Centchroman. Two tablets (60 mg) taken twice in 24 h within 24 h of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% women. GnRH Agonists Daily administration of GnRH agonist (buserelin) prevents ovulation. The drug is on trial for its contraceptive effect. Very expensive--has to be given by subcutaneous injection. Prostaglandin Self-administered vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin following an unprotected intercourse, by viue of its luteolytic effect on the ovary and its increased motility effect on fallopian tubes and the uterus, prevents implantation and brings about menstruation. Its specific role as contraceptive is however yet to be established. Copper T IUCD. Inseed within 5 days of intercourse can prevent implantation of a feilized ovum. Advantages of Copper T as emergency contraception are: It can be inseed as late as 5 days after the unprotected Intercourse. It is cheap. Failure rate is 0.1%. It can remain as ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years. Ref: Shaw textbook of gynecology 16th edition Pgno : 269",D

Approximately one-third of the world's population have serological evidence of past or current infection with hepatitis B and approximately 350-400 million people are chronic HBsAg carriers. Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection (Box 22.36). Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: * Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. * Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. * Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular , haemolysis carcinoma, usually after decades of infection (Fig. 22.25). Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases (Box 22.37); these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune- tolerant' phase Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 875",A

"Which is not true of malaria Eradication programmea) Started in 1953b) Modified plan started in 1970c) Incidence was 2 million cases in 1958d) Incidence decreased to 50,000 in 1961",ab,a,ad,bc,"National anti-malaria Programme 

The Programme began initially as National Malaria control Programme in 1953.
Because of the spectacular success achieved in the control of malaria, the control programme, was converted into an eradication programe in 1958 with the object of eradicating malaria once and for all from the country.
The programme went on well for sometimes.
The incidence of malaria declined from 75 million cases and 8 lakhs death in 1953 to about 1-2 million cases and no death in 1972.
But thereafter the programme suffered serious set backs.
There was a sharp increase in malaria incidence, in 1976, there were 6.47 million cases with 59 deaths.
The Govt of India in 1977 evolved a ""Modified plan of operation"" based on ""effective control"" rather than eradication.
The plan has since been implemented and the incidence of malaria began to decline.
However, there was gradual, increased in falciparum malaria incidence.
Hence a programme for containment of P.falciparum was also launched within the NMEP.

Note : Option 'c & d' were given in 19th/e. of Park : -
""The incidence of malaria had declined sharply from 75 million cases in 1953 to 2 million cases in 1958"".
""The annual incidence of malaria cases in India escalated from 50000 in 1961, to a Peak of 6.4 million cases in 1976"".
Strategic Action plan for malaria control in India (2007-2012)


Malaria control is now incorporated into the health service delivery programmes under the umbrella of NRHM.
The strategies of National malaria control programme are as follows : -

Malaria Control strategies
The strategies for prevention and control of malaria and its transmission are-:
1. Surveillance and case management

Case detection (passive and active).
Early diagnosis and complete treatment.
Sentinel surveillance.

2. Integrated vector management (IVM)

Indoor residual spray (IRS).
Insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs)/ Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs).
Antilarval measures including source reduction.

3. Epidemic preparadness and early response
4. Supportive interventions

Capacity building

which one of the following is not the appropriate treatment of hypehyroidism due to subacute thyroiditis?,Propylthiouracil,Suppoive treatment,Subtotal thyroidectomy,beta blockers,"Subacute thyroiditis is a self-limited thyroid condition associated with a triphasic clinical course of hypehyroidism, hypothyroidism, and return to normal thyroid function. Subacute thyroiditis may be responsible for 15-20% of patients presenting with thyrotoxicosis and 10% of patients presenting with hypothyroidism . Recognizing this condition is impoant; because it is self-limiting, no specific treatment, such as antithyroid or thyroid hormone replacement therapy, is necessary in most patients. In some cases antithyroids are used to allete the symptoms . In general, the following three forms of subacute thyroiditis are recognized: Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painful or de Quervain thyroiditis Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis - Also known as subacute painless thyroiditis Subacute postpaum thyroiditis Treatment The treatment of subacute thyroiditis is generally suppoive to reduce the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis and to control neck pain in the setting of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Because no new hormone is being made, antithyroid medications are not effective in these conditions. Although the abnormal thyroid levels are temporary, emotional suppo is often necessary. Patients are often dehydrated from thyrotoxicosis; encourage all patients to drink 6-8 cups per day of noncaffeinated fluids. Surgical care is almost never recommended for subacute thyroiditis. In rare cases, surgery is recommended for patients who have frequent recurrences of thyrotoxicosis from subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis or recurrent pain from subacute granulomatous thyroiditis Ref - harrison internal medicine 20e p2708-2709",D

In 5% of patients, symptoms begin after age 40. The initial symptom is usually dull pain, insidious in onset, felt deep in the lower lumbar or gluteal region, accompanied by low-back morning stiffness of up to a few hours' duration that improves with activity and returns following inactivity. Within a few months, the pain has usually become persistent and bilateral. Nocturnal exacerbation of pain often forces the patient to rise and move around. In some patients, bony tenderness (presumably reflecting enthesitis or osteitis) may accompany back pain or stiffness, whereas in others it may be the predominant complaint. Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels. Hip and shoulder (""root"" joint) ahritis is considered pa of axial disease. Hip ahritis occurs in 25-35% of patients. Shoulder involvement may be at least as common, but is usually less symptomatic. Severe isolated hip ahritis or bonychest pain may be the presenting complaint, and symptomatic hipdisease can dominate the clinical picture. Ahritis of peripheral joints other than the hips and shoulders, usually asymmetric, may occur at any point in the disease course.

Following are features of Paget's disease except -,Deformity of bones,Secondary osteosarcoma,Lowered serum alkaline phosphatase,Increased Urinary excretion of hydroxyproline,"Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a common condition characterised by focal areas of increased and disorgan ised bone remodelling. It mostly affects the axial skele ton, and bones that are commonly involved include the pelvis, femur, tibia, lumbar spine, skull and scapula. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-Diseases of bone The primary abnormality is increased osteoclastic bone resorption, accompanied by marrow fibrosis, increased vascularity of bone and increased osteoblast activity. Bone in PDB is architecturally abnormal and has reduced mechanical strength. Osteoclasts in PDB are increased in number, are unusually large and contain characteristic nuclear inclusion bodies. Genetic factors are impoant and mutations in the SQSTM1 gene are a common cause of classical PDB. The presence of nuclear inclusion bodies in osteoclasts has fuelled speculation that PDB might be caused by a slow virus infection with measles or distemper but the evidence is conflicting. Biomechani cal factors may help determine the pattern of involve ment, since PDB often stas at sites of muscle inseions into bone and, in some cases, localises to bones or limbs that have been subjected to repetitive trauma or overuse. Involvement of subchondral bone can compromise the joint and predispose to OA ('Pagetic ahropathy'). CLINICAL FEATURES -The classic presentation is with bone pain, deformity, deafness and pathological fractures, but many patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed from an abnormal Xray or blood test performed for another reason. Cli nical signs include bone deformity and expansion, increased warmth over affected bones, and pathological fracture. Bone deformity is most evident in weight bearing bones such as the femur and tibia, but when the skull is affected the patient may complain that hats no longer fit due to cranial enlargement. Neurological problems, such as deafness, cranial nerve defects, nerve root pain, spinal cord compression and spinal stenosis, are recognised complications due to enlargement of affected bones and encroachment upon the spinal cord and nerve foraminae. Surprisingly, deafness seldom results from compression of the auditory nerve, but is conductive due to osteosclerosis of the temporal bone. The increased vascularity of Pagetic bone makes opera tive procedures difficult and, in extreme cases, can precipitate highoutput cardiac failure in elderly patients with limited cardiac reserve. Osteosarcoma is a rare but serious complication that presents with subacute onset of increasing pain and swelling of an affected site. INVESTIGATIONS -The characteristic features are an elevated serum ALP and bone expansion on Xray, with alternating areas of radiolucency and osteosclerosis (Fig. 25.57B). ALP is normal in about 5% of cases, usually because of mono stotic involvement. Radionuclide bone scanning is useful to define the presence and extent of disease (Fig. 25.57A). If the bone scan is positive, Xrays should be taken of an affected bone to confirm the diagnosis. Bone biopsy is not usually required but may help to exclude osteo sclerotic metastases in cases of diagnostic unceainty. MANAGEMENT-The main indication for treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is bone pain thought to be due to increased metabolic activity (Box 25.82). It is often difficult to dif ferentiate this from pain due to complications such as bone deformity, nerve compression symptoms and OA. If there is doubt, it can be wohwhile giving a therapeu tic trial of antiresorptive therapy to determine whether the symptoms improve. A positive response indicates that the pain was due to increased metabolic activity. The aminobisphosphonates pamidronate, zoledronate and risedronate are more effective than simple bisphos phonates such as etidronate and tiludronate at suppress ing bone turnover in PDB, but their effects on pain are similar. Although bisphosphonates suppress bone turn over in PDB, there is no evidence to show that they alter the natural history or prevent complications. Calcitonin can be used as an alternative but is less convenient to administer and more expensive. Repeated courses of bisphosphonates or calcitonin can be given if symptoms recur. If symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy, it is likely that the pain is due to a complication of the disease and this should be managed according to the principles described on page 1085.

Which of the following is an example of disorders of sex chromosomes,Marfan's syndrome,Testicular feminization syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Down's syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is an impoant genetic cause of reduced spermatogenesis and male infeility. In some patients the testicular tubules are totally atrophied and replaced by pink, hyaline, collagenous ghosts. In others, apparently normal tubules are interspersed with atrophic tubules. In some patients all tubules are primitive and appear embryonic, consisting of cords of cells that never developed a lumen or progressed to mature spermatogenesis. Leydig cells appear prominent, as a result of the atrophy and crowding of the tubules and elevation of gonadotropin concentrations. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome have a higher risk for breast cancer (20 times more common than in normal males), extragonadal germ cell tumors, and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The classic pattern of Klinefelter syndrome is associated with a 47,XXY karyotype (90% of cases). This complement of chromosomes results from nondisjunction during the meiotic divisions in the germ cells of one of the parents. Maternal and paternal nondisjunction at the first meiotic division are roughly equally involved. There is no phenotypic difference between those who receive the extra X chromosome from their father and those who receive it from their mother. Maternal age is increased in the cases associated with errors in oogenesis. In addition to this classic karyotype, approximately 15% of patients with Klinefelter syndrome have been found to have a variety of mosaic patterns, most of them being 46,XY/47,XXY.Other patterns are 47,XXY/48,XXXY and variations on this theme. As is the case with normal females, all but one X chromosome undergoes inactivation in patients with Klinefelter syndrome. Why then, do the patients with this disorder have hypogonadism and associated features? The explanation for this lies in genes on the X chromosome that escape lyonization and in the pattern of X inactivation. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 165",C
Consider susceptibility to the following pulmonary pathogens- 1. M. tuberculosis 2. P. aeruginosa 3. S. aureus 4. Nocardia sp. Which of the above is/are associated with long-term glucocoicoid therapy?,3 only,1 and 4,2 and 3,"2,3 and 4","Pathology and pathogenesis M. bovis infection arises mainly drinking non-sterilised milk from infected cows. M. tuberculosis is spread by the inhalation of aerosolised droplet nuclei from other infected patients. Once inhaled, the organisms lodge in the alveoli and initiate the recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes. Macrophages undergo transformation into epithelioid and Langhans cells, which aggregate with the lymphocytes to form the classical tuberculous granuloma . Numerous granulomas aggregate to form a primary lesion or 'Ghon focus' (a pale yellow, caseous nodule, usually a few millimetres to 1-2 cm in diameter), which is characteristically situated in the periphery of the lung. Spreadof organisms to the hilar lymph nodes is followed by a similar pathological reaction, and the combination of the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes is referred to as the 'primary complex of Ranke'. Reparative processes encase the primary complex in a fibrous capsule, limiting the spread of bacilli. If no fuher complications ensue, this lesion eventually calcifies and is clearly seen on a chest X-ray. Lymphatic or haematogenous spread may occur before immunity is established, however, seeding secondary foci in other organs, including lymph nodes, serous membranes, meninges, bones, liver, kidneys and lungs, which may lie dormant for years. The only clue that infection has occurred may be the appearance of a cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to tuberculin, demonstrated by tuberculin skin testing or an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA): so-called latent TB . If these reparative processes fail, primary progressive disease ensues . The estimated lifetime risk of developing disease after primary infection is 10%, with roughly half of this risk occurring in the first 2 years after infection. Glucocoicoids reduce inflammation and limit tissue damage; they are currently recommended when treating pericardial or meningeal disease, and in children with endobronchial disease. They may confer benefit in TB of the ureter, pleural effusions and extensive pulmonary disease, and can suppress hypersensitivity drug reactions. Surgery should be considered in cases complicated by massive haemoptysis, loculated empyema, constrictive pericarditis, lymph node suppuration, and spinal disease with cord compression, but usually only after a full p aregenosa,s aureus, Nocardia sps course of antituberculosis treatment.

Benzathine pencillin treatment in RHD is,Primary prevention,Secondary prevention,Primordial prevention,Teiary prevention,"SECONDARY PREVENTION of Rheumatic hea disease Secondary prevention (i.e., the prevention of recurrences of RF) is a more practicable approach, especially in developing countries. It consists in identifying those who have had RF and giving them one intramuscular injection of benzathine benzyl penicillin (1.2 million units in adults and 600,000 units in children) at intervals of 3 weeks. This must be continued for at least 5 years or until the child reaches 18 years whichever is later. For patients with carditis (mild mitral regurgitation or healed carditis) the treatment should continue for 10 years after the last attack, or at least until 25 years of age, which ever is longer. More severe valvular disease or post-valve surgery cases need life-long treatment. This prevents streptococcal sore throat and therefore recurrence of RF and RHD. However, the crucial problem is one of patient compliance as penicillin prophylaxis is a long-term affair. Studies have shown that secondary prevention is feasible, inexpensive and cost-effective, when implemented through primary health care systems Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 402",B

A concept directed against prevention of risk factors of coronary aery disease is -,Primordial prevention,Secondary prevention,Health education,Primary prevention,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Primordial prevention o Primordial prevention is a type of primary prevention. o In both primordial prevention and primary prevention, action is taken prior to the onset of disease. o The difference between the two is ? a Primordial prevention -4 action is taken prior to emergence of risk factor. In other words Primordial prevention is defined as prevention of risk factor themselves. Primary prevention --> action is taken after emergence of risk factor, but before the onset of disease. o Example :- If a person is having habit of smoking and he has not developed any smoking related disease, e.g. CHD. Then withdrawing the habit of smoking is primary prevention. Discouragment of adopting smoking (in a person who never smokes) is primordial prevention.",A

Uremic complications typically arise during which of the following phases of Renal Failure:,Initiation,Maintenance,Diuretic Phase,Recovery Phase,"Answer is B (Maintenance) Uremic complications and Electrolyte imbalance typically arise during the Maintenance Phase of Acute Renal Failure (Also known as Oliguric Phase). Maintenance phase refers to the phase of Renal Failure in which the renal injury becomes established. It is also known as the Oliguric Phase. During this phase the GFR and Urine output progressively decrease until they stabilize at their lowest. Fluid retention gives rise to edema, water intoxication, and pulmonary congestion if the period of oliguria is prolonged. Hypeension frequently develops during this phase. Uremic complications and Electrolyte imbalance typically arise during this phase. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CR) or Dialysis should be initiated in this phase. The oliguric-anuric phase generally lasts 10 to 14 days but can last for several more. The longer the patient remains in this phase, the poorer the prognosis for a return to normal renal function.",B

Best bone of the following to assess the age of a person between 20-50 years is,Skull,Ribs,Sternum,Pubic symphysis,"Age changes at pubic symphysis The changes in the pubic symphysis are the best criteria to assess the age from third to fifth decade. The changes occurs on three components: dorsal surface, ventral surface, and margin. At the age of about 20 years, there is formation of horizontal ridges of bone on the aicular surface which first stas on the upper poion of the ventral surface and extends to the dorsal surface. This is called billowing. At about 25-35 years, the surface becomes granular and the ventral nd dorsal margins are well defined. A rim formation stas from the dorsal surface extends to the ventral surface. At about 35 -45 years, the upper and lower end will be raised and also the ventral margin by bony extension which is called lipping and the beaded rim development will be complete on all around the margins of the aicular surface. By 45-55 years, the beaded rim stas breaking. By 55-65 years the breakdown of the rim is more and by the end of seventh decade the breakdown of the rim will be complete.

Which of the following causes of diarrhoea decreases after prolonged fasting,Osmotic diarrhoea,Bloody diarrhoea,Infective diarrhoea,Secretory diarrhoea,"Acute diarrhoea This is extremely common and is usually caused by faecal-oral transmission of bacteria or their toxins, viruses or parasites . Infective diarrhoea is usually sho-lived and patients who present with a history of diarrhoea lasting more than 10 days rarely have an infective cause. A variety of drugs, including antibiotics, cytotoxic drugs, PPIs and NSAIDs, may be responsible. Chronic or relapsing diarrhoea The most common cause is irritable bowel syndrome , which can present with increased frequency of defecation and loose, watery or pellety stools. Diarrhoea rarely occurs at night and is most severe before and after breakfast. At other times, the patient is constipated and there are other characteristic symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. The stool often contains mucus but never blood, and 24-hour stool volume is less than 200 g. Chronic diarrhoea can be categorised as being caused by disease of the colon or small bowel, or to malabsorption . Clinical presentation, examination of the stool, routine blood tests and imaging reveal a diagnosis in many cases. A series of negative investigations usually implies irritable bowel syndrome but some patients clearly have organic disease and need more extensive investigations. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 783",A

Disecting hematoma is a clinical complication occurring in,Turner's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Down syndrome,Marfan syndrome,"Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues, manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes, and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheritance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin- 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix. These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromosomes 15q21.1 and 5q23.31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administration of antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 144",D

Health promotion comes under: March 2013 (e),Primary level of prevention,Secondary level of prevention,Teiary level of prevention,Primordial prevention,"Ans. A i.e. Primary level of prevention Primary Prevention It is used before the person gets the disease. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary Prevention Secondary prevention is used: -- After the disease has occurred, but -- Before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Teiary Prevention Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called ""complications."") - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention.

Eaton Lambe syndrome is associated with,Anti P/Q antibody,Anti HU antibody,Anti Jo 1 antibody,Large cell carcinoma,"Lambe-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs. In normal neuromuscular function, a nerve impulse is carried down the axon (the long projection of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse is transferred to the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts. In LEMS, antibodies against VGCC, paicularly the P/Q-type VGCC, decrease the amount of calcium that can enter the nerve ending, hence less acetylcholine can be released from the neuromuscular junction. Apa from skeletal muscle, the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMSP/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are also found in the cerebellum, explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind paicularly to the pa of the receptor known as the ""domain III S5-S6 linker peptide"".Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs.Some have antibodies that bind synaptotagmin, the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion.Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the M1 subtype of the acetylcholine receptor; their presence may paicipate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx anti p/Q antibodies are produced against voltage gated channels mainly P/Q voltage gates Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 567",A

Nysten&;s rule is related to,Order of appearance of post moem caloricity,Time since death,Order of appearance of decomposition,Order of appearance of rigor mois,"The Order of Appearance of Rigor All muscles of the body, both voluntary and involuntary are affected. It does not sta in all muscles simultaneously (Nysten&;s rule). It first appears in involuntary muscles; the myocardium becomes rigid in an hour. It begins in the eyelids, neck and lower jaw and passes upwards to the muscles of the face, and downwards to the muscles of the chest, upper limbs, abdomen and lower limbs and lastly in the fingers and toes. In individual limbs, it usually progresses from above downwards. Such a sequence is not constant, symmetrical or regular. In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Shapiro (1950) suggests that rigor mois does not follow the anatomical sequence usually described. He suggests that as rigor mois is a physicochemical process, it is most likely to develop simultaneously in all the muscles, although the changes are more easily first detected in the smaller masses than in the larger. The proximo-distal progression is more apparent than real, for the sequence is determined by the bulk and kind of muscle involved. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-161",D

Gradient in pulmonary aery wedge pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure is seen in,Aoic regurgitation,Constrictive pericarditis,Left atrial myxoma,Pulmonary thromboembolism,Answer is C (Left atrial myxoma) An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle such as atrial myxoma. Pulmonary aery wedge pressure represents Left atrial pressure. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure represents Left ventricular pressure. Gradient between Left atrial pressure (PCWP) and Left ventricular pressure during diastole: Normally there is no gradient during diastole as both pressures are equal. An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle. This may thus be seen in obstructive lesions between Left atria and ventricle such as : Mitral stcnosis Atrial myxomas,C
High calcium intake leads to,Milk-Alkali syndrome,Cardiomyopathy,Osteoporosis,Osteopetrosis,"Ans. a. Milk-Alkali syndrome The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonate. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damage. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stopped.' Milk-Alkali Syndrome The milk-alkali syndrome is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonateQ. It is much less frequent since proton-pump inhibitors and other treatments became available for peptic ulcer disease. For a time, the increased use of calcium carbonate in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism led to reappearance of the syndrome. Several clinical presentations-acute, subacute, and chronic-have been described, all of which feature hypercalcemia, alkalosis, and renal failureQ. The chronic form of the disease, termed Burnett's syndrome, is associated with irreversible renal damageQ. The acute syndromes reverse if the excess calcium and absorbable alkali are stoppedQ. Individual susceptibility is dependent on the fractional calcium absorption as a function of calcium intake. Some individuals absorb a high fraction of calcium, even with intakes >2 g of elemental calcium per day, instead of reducing calcium absorption with high intake, as occurs in most normal individuals. Development of hypercalcemia causes increased sodium excretion and some depletion of total-body water. These phenomena and perhaps some suppression of endogenous PTH secretion due to mild hypercalcemia lead to increased bicarbonate resorption and to alkalosis in the face of continued calcium carbonate ingestion Alkalosis per se selectively enhances calcium resorption in the distal nephron, thus aggravating the hypercalcemia. The cycle of mild hypercalcemia -4 bicarbonate retention alkalosis renal calcium retention -4 severe hypercalcemia perpetuates and aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis as long as calcium and absorbable alkali are ingestedQ.",A

Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual cuailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Milk pasteurization can be tested by -,Ohotolidine test,Phosphatase test,Nitric acid test,Acid chromatin test,"<p> Pasteurization of milk:- Heating of milk to such temperatures and for such periods of time as are required to destroy any pathogens that may be present while causing minimal changes in the composition, flavour and nutritive value. Methods of pasteurisation:- 1. Holder method- milk is kept at 63-66 deg C for at least 30 minutes and then quickly cooled to 5 deg C. 2. HTST method- high temperature and sho time method. Very large quantities of milk can be pasteurized by this method. 3. UHT method- ultra high temperature method. Pasteurization kills 90% of bacteria in milk including the more heat resistant tubercle bacillus and Q fever organism. But it will not kill thermoduric bacteria or bacterial spores. Despite pasteurization, bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. Hygienically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8-12 hours at 18 deg C. Tests of pasteurized milk:- 1. Phosphatase test 2. Standard plate count 3.

The average age at onset is 70, with a female-to-male ratio of about 3 : 1. The overall prevalence is about 20 per 100 000 in those over the age of 50 years. Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery. On fundoscopy, the optic disc may appear pale and swollen with haemorrhages, but these changes may take 24-36 hours to develop and the fundi may initially appear normal. Rarely, neurological involvement may occur, with transient ischaemic attacks, brainstem infarcts and hemiparesis. In GCA, constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, malaise and night sweats, are common. With PMR, there may be stiffness and painful restriction of active shoulder movements on waking.

In a population to prevent coronary artery disease changing harmful lifestyles by education is referred to as:,High risk strategy,Primary prevention,Secondary prevention,Tertiary prevention,"Ans. (b) Primary preventionLEVELS OF PREVENTION:* Primordial Level of Prevention: Is primary prevention (see below) in purest sense- It is the prevention of the emergence or development of risk factors in countries or population groups in which they have not yet appeared- Modes of Intervention:1. Individual Education2. Mass Education- Primordial Level is Best level of prevention for Non-communicable diseases* Primary Level of Prevention:- It is the action taken prior to onset of disease, which removes the possibility that a disease will ever occur- Modes of Intervention:1. Health Promotion: Is targeted at strengthening the host through a variety of approaches/interventions, e.g. Health Education, Environmental modifications, Nutritional interventions, Lifestyle and behavioral changes2. Specific Protection: Is targeting the prevention of disease through a specific intervention- Primary level of prevention is applied when 'risk factors are present, but disease has not yet taken place'- It signifies 'intervention in the Pre-pathogenesis Phase of a disease/ health problem'* Secondary Level of Prevention:- It halts the progress of disease at its' incipient stage and prevents complications- Modes of Intervention:1. Early Diagnosis: Detection of disturbances while biochemical, functional and morphological changes are still reversible or prior to occurrence of manifest signs and symptoms2. Treatment: Shortens period of communicability, reduces mortality and prevents occurrence of further cases (secondary cases) or any long-term disability- Secondary level of prevention is applied when disease has possibly set in: It attempts to arrest the disease process, seek unrecognized disease and treat it before irreversibility and reverse communicability of infectious diseases- National Health Programs by Govt, of India mostly operate at Secondary level of prevention- Secondary prevention is an imperfect tool in control of transmission of disease: It is more expensive and less effective than primary prevention- It is an important level of prevention for diseases like Tuberculosis, Leprosy and STDs* Tertiary Level of Prevention:- Is applied when disease has advanced beyond early stages: It aims to reduce or limit impairments and disabilities, minimize suffering caused by existing departures from good health- Modes of Intervention:1. Disability Limitation: It 'prevents the transition of disease from impairment to handicap'2. Rehabilitation: Training and retraining of an individual to the highest possible level of functional ability; It can be medical, vocational, social or psychological- Tertiary level of prevention signifies 'intervention in late pathogenesis phase'ALSO REMEMBER* All Vaccines (including Anti-rabies vaccine): Specific Protection mode of intervention, Primary Level of prevention* Screening is predominantly Secondary Level of Prevention with some component of Primary Prevention also",B

B: Paralysis of the lower half of face on the opposite sideCentral facial palsy is a symptom or finding characterized by paralysis of the lower half of one side of the face.It usually results from damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve.The facial motor nucleus has dorsal and ventral divisions that contain lower motor neurons supplying the muscles of the upper and lower face, respectively.The dorsal division receives bilateral upper motor neuron input (ie, from both sides of the brain).The ventral division receives only contralateral input (ie, from the opposite side of the brain).Thus, lesions of the coicobulbar tract between the cerebral coex and the facial motor nucleus destroy or reduce input to the ventral division, but ipsilateral input (ie, from the same side) to the dorsal division is retained. As a result, central facial palsy (damage to upper motor neurons of the facial nerve) is characterized by hemiparalysis or hemiparesis of the contralateral muscles of facial expression, but not the muscles of the forehead.",B

"All of the following are true about break point chlorination, except –",Free chlorine is released in water after break point chlorination,"Chlorine demand is the amount needed to kill bacteria, oxidize organic matter and neutralize ammonia",1 ppm free chlorine should be present in water after break point has reached,Contact period of 1 hour is necessary,"Principles of chlorination                                                                               

Water should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.
The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water.
The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If further chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water.
The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria and virus.
The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5mg/i for one hour. This free residual chlorine provides margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination.
The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of .5 mg/L constitutes the correct does of chlorine to be applied.
It is worth noting here that recommended residual chlorine level for drinking water is 0.5 mg/ litre, while for swimming pool sanitation it is 1.0 mg/ litre and for water bodies & post disaster it is 0.7 mg/litre",C

Broad casts seen in cases of -,Advanced renal failure,Hypotention,Severe hydronephrosis,Renal pappilary necrosis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Advanced renal failure Casts* Urinary casts are formed only in the distal convoluted tubuleQ (DCT) or the collecting ductR (distal nephron).* The proximal convoluted tubule and loop of henle are not the locations for cast formation.* Casts are formed through the solidification of materials in the tubules of nephrons.* Later the material is flushed out of the kidney upon the production of more urine leaving a small solidified microscopic cylinder that can also contain what ever other materials that might be within the tubules of the kidneys at the time of cast formation.* The microscopic detection of various types of casts can often be helpful diagnostic tool in the study of various types of renal diseases.Urinary casts and their characteristic featuresHvaline casts* These are the most common type of casts and they can be found in normal urine samples.* They consists almost entirely of Tamm Horsfall protein.* Zero-to Two hyaline casts per low power field is considered normal.* Increased numbers of Hyaline casts can occur with exercise, heat exposure, dehydration, fever, congestive heart failure and diuretic.Renal tubular epithelial cell casts* These casts results when the epithelial cells of the renal tubules are being excreted along with the casts.* These are rarer casts, can in theory indicate a serious situation involving the possible breaking down of the lining of the renal tubules themselves.* Renal tubular epithelial casts are most suggestive of tubular injury as in acute tubular necrosis.* They are also found in other disorders including eclampsia, heavy metal poisoning, ethyleneglycol intoxication (most of these cases lead to acute tubular necrosis).Granular casts* These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non pathological condition.* Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were within them are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogen or immune complexes within the cast upon formation.* They can be further divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts.* Fine granular casts can appear in non pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases.* They are common in renal parenchymal disease.Broad casts* These casts originate from dilated chronically damaged tubules or the collecting ducts therefore thev are called renal failure casts.* These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis.* Broad casts are two to six times the size of other types of casts.* Broad casts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure.Waxv casts* Waxy casts are cylinders of smooth highly refractive material.* Waxy aists are seen in final stages of degeneration of fine granular casts. Since the granules need time to degrade, this implies nephron obstruction.* Waxy casts are seen in chronic renal diseases associated with renal failure seen in diabetic nephropathy, malignant hypertension, glomerulonephritis.",A

Ideal screening test should be,Safe,Reliable,Valid,All of the above,"The criteria for screening are based on two consideration :

Disease to be screened, and
Screening test to be applied.

A) Disease to be screened

The disease should be an important health problem with a recognizable latent or asymptomatic stage.
There should be a test (screening test) which can detect the disease prior to clinical stage, with also availability of a diagnostic (confirmatory) test.
There should be an effective treatment which should reduce morbidity and mortality if started early. B) Screening test to be applied
The screening test to be applied should fulfil following criteria 1) Acceptibility

The test should be acceptable to the people whom it is aimed. 2) Repeatability (reliability)
The test must give consistent results when it is repeated more than once on the same individual under same condition, i.e. results of test must by precise (exact).
Thus, repeatability is also known as precision, reliability or reproducibility. 3) Validity (accuracy)
It refers to what extent the test accurately measures which is purports to measure.
Validity has two componens : i) Sensitivity ii) Specificity.

Most common type of shock is-,Cardiogenic,Vagal,Neurogenic,Distributive,"Cardiogenic shock (CS) is characterized by systemic hypoperfusion due to severe depression of the cardiac index and sustained systolic aerial hypotension (<90 mmHg) despite an elevated filling pressure . It is associated with in-hospital moality rates >50%. . Circulatory failure based on cardiac dysfunction may be caused by primary myocardial failure, most commonly secondary to acute myocardial infarction (MI ), and less frequently by cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, cardiac tamponade, or critical valvular hea disease.Most patients have continuing chest pain and dyspnea and appear pale, apprehensive, and diaphoretic. Mentation may be altered, with somnolence, confusion, and agitation. The pulse is typically weak and rapid, often in the range of 90-110 beats/min, or severe bradycardia due to high-grade hea block may be present. Systolic blood pressure is reduced (<90 mmHg) with a narrow pulse pressure (<30 mmHg), but occasionally BP may be maintained by very high systemic vascular resistance. Tachypnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, and jugular venous distention may be present. The precordium is typically quiet, with a weak apical pulse. S 1 is usually soft, and an S 3 gallop may be audible. Acute, severe MR and VSR usually are associated with characteristic systolic murmurs Rales are audible in most patients with LV failure causing CS.

Clinical features The female lays ova around the anus, causing intense itching, especially at night. The ova are often carried to the mouth on the fingers and so reinfection or human-to-human infection occurs . In females, the genitalia may be involved. The adult worms may be seen moving on the buttocks or in the stool. Investigations Ova are detected in stool samples or by applying the adhesive surface of cellophane tape to the perianal skin in the morning. This is then examined on a glass slide under the microscope. A perianal swab, moistened with saline, also allows diagnosis. Management A single dose of mebendazole (100 mg), albendazole (400 mg), pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg) or piperazine (4 g) treats infection and is repeated after 2 weeks to control auto-reinfection. If infection recurs in a family, each member should be treated. All nightclothes and bed linen are laundered during treatment. Fingernails must be kept sho and hands washed carefully before meals.

Which of the following method of assessment of quality of proteins gives complete assessment of protein quality?,Biological value,Net protein utilization,Digestibility co-efficient,Amino acid score,"Ans. B. Net protein utilization. (Ref. Park's Textbook of PSM 22nd/pg. 588)Discussion:The quality of protein is assese23d by comparison to the reference protein which is usually egg protein.Two methods of ass of protein quality are amino acid score and Net Protein Utilization.# Amino acid score- measure of the concentration of each essential amino acid in the test protein expressed as % of that amino acid in the reference protein.# Net Protein Utilization- it is a product of digestibility coefficient and biological value divided by 100. The NPU gives a more complete expression of protein quality than amino acid score. NPU = N retained by the body/N intake x 100. In calculating protein quality, 1 gm of protein is assumed to be equvivalent to 6.25 g of N. If NPU is low, the protein req is high and vice versa. The NPU of the protein of Indian diets varies between 50-80.",B

Which of the following pulmonary symptoms dont have the corresponding not pulmonary association?,Cyanosis.Anxiety,Wheezing-CHF,Tachypnoea-Acidosis,Chest pain-pericarditis,"Cyanosis is the bluish or purplish discolouration of the skin or mucous membranes due to the tissues near the skin surface having low oxygen saturation. Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke&;s work,it is classically described as occurring if 5.0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin or greater is present. This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of aerial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on aerial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis Approach to diagnosis: Inquire about duration (cyanosis since bih suggests congenital hea disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins). Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis. Check for nail clubbing: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital hea disease and occasionally pulmonary disease. If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.

Factitious disorder by proxy is a condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates symptoms in a person who is in their care. Munchausen syndrome is an older term for Factitious disorder. People with this condition may produce symptoms by contaminating urine samples, taking hallucinogens, injecting themselves with bacteria to produce infections, and other such similar behaviour. They might be motivated to perpetrate factitious disorders either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver to gain any variety of benefits including attention, nurturance, sympathy, and leniency that are unobtainable any other way. Somatoform disorders are characterised by multiple somatic complaints. Conversion disorder is a condition in which you show psychological stress in physical ways. The condition was so named to describe a health problem that starts as a mental or emotional crisis -- a scary or stressful incident of some kind -- and converts to a physical problem. Malingering is a medical term that refers to fabricating or exaggerating the symptoms of mental or physical disorders for a variety of ""secondary gain"" motives, which may include financial compensation (often tied to fraud); avoiding school, work or military service; obtaining drugs; getting lighter criminal sentences; or simply to attract attention or sympathy. Dissociation is an altered state of consciousness characterized by partial or complete disruption of the normal integration of a person's normal conscious or psychological functioning.

Presence of splenomegaly eliminates aplastic anemia & ITP as the possibilities and hemolysis does not explain the low WBC and platelet count in the patient. Leukemia: Although leukemia usually presents with an elevated WBC count the presence of Pancytopenia and 6% blasts in peripheral blood is enough to suppo the diagnosis of aleukemic leukemia. Some patients with aleukemic leukemia present with pancytopenia without circulating blasts. The diagnosis of leukemia in such patients should however be ideally made only once, a marrow blast count is done and it comes out to be > 30%. Presence of splenomegaly eliminates aplastic anemia & ITP as the possibilities. - Splenomegaly & Lymphadenopathy are extremely uncommon in ITP & their presence should lead one to consider other possible diagnosis. - Splenomegaly is characteristically absent in aplastic anemia and if present the diagnosis of aplastic anemia should be seriously questioned. - Hemolvsis does not explain the low WBC platelet count in the patient.",A

Thiazides cause more profound hypokalemia than loop diuretics. MUST KNOW: Mechanisms of hypokalemia in diuretic use: Increases distal tubular Na+ delivery and distal tubular flow rate in addition to secondary hyperaldosteronism. Thiazides have an effect on plasma K+ concentration greater than that of loop diuretics. It is due to thiazide-associated hypocalciuria versus the hypercalciuria seen with loop diuretics. It reduces the lumen-negative potential difference and attenuating distal K+ excretion. ALSO NOTE: High doses of penicillin-related antibiotics (nafcillin, dicloxacillin, ticarcillin, oxacillin, and carbenicillin) can increase K+ excretion.

Acidosis can result in fatal rhythm disturbance.Diagnosis:The diagnosis of DKA can be made by finding elevated blood glucose, increased serum levels of acetoacetate, acetone, and hydroxybutyrate, metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate and low blood pH), and increased anion gap (sodium-).DKA is managed with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement.Normal saline should be given in high volume with insulin replacement.Bolus with 5-10 units of regular insulin. Acutely, DKA is associated with hyperkalemia. The total body level of potassium is depleted because of the urinary loss of potassium. As soon as the potassium level falls to <5 mEq/L, potassium replacement should be given.Fig. 5: Pathophysiology of DKAClinical points in the management of DKABegin management with IV insulin, and then switch to subcutaneous insulin when the anion gap normalizes and serum bicarbonate levels are normal.Do not stop the IV insulin before starting subcutaneous insulin; instead, overlap them both for 6-8 hours.Add 5% dextrose to the normal saline as blood glucose reaches 200-250 mg/dL, and continue IV insulin until the anion gap normalizes.",C

"A symmetric high-voltage, triphasic slow wave pattern is seen on EEG in the following -",Hepatic encephalopathy,Uremic encephalopathy,Hypoxic encephalopathy,Hypercarbic encephalopathy,"Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease. As it progresses, delirium is followed by coma. Simple delirium needs to be differentiated from delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy, and coma from subdural haematoma, which can occur in alcoholics after a fall . Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. The degree of encephalopathy can be graded from 1 to 4, depending on these features, and this is useful in assessing response to therapy . When an episode develops acutely, a precipitating factor may be found . The earliest features are very Some degree of liver failure is a key factor, as poosystemic shunting of blood alone hardly ever causes encephalopathy. The 'neurotoxins' causing encephalopathy are unknown but are thought to be mainly nitrogenous substances produced in the gut, at least in pa by bacterial action. These substances are normally metabolised by the healthy liver and excluded from the systemic circulation. Ammonia has traditionally been considered an impoant factor. Recent interest has focused on g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a mediator, along with octopamine, amino acids, mercaptans and fatty acids that can act as neurotransmitters. The brain in cirrhosis may also be sensitised to other factors, such as drugs that can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy .

Blood volume may be normal, reduced or increased. Renal sodium and causes venous thrombosis retention is an early and universal feature;. The diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome all affect the glomerulus (see Fig. 15.9), either directly, by damaging podocytes, or indirectly, by causing scarring or deposition of exogenous material such as amyloid into the glomerulus. Investigation of nephrotic syndrome usually involves renal biopsy, although non-invasive tests may also be helpful in suggesting the underlying cause . In children, minimal change disease is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome and therefore renal biopsy is not usually required unless the patient fails to respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy. Similarly, most patients with diabetes presenting with nephrotic syndrome will have diabetic nephropathy, and so renal biopsy is usually not performed unless the course of the disease is atypical (rapidly increasing proteinuria or rapid decline in renal function;). Management of nephrotic syndrome should be directed at the underlying cause. In addition, nephrotic syndrome is associated with a number of complications , which may require suppoive management unless the nephrosis is expected to resolve rapidly, such as in glucocoicoid-responsive minimal change disease.

While arrhythmias can occur at any time, in some forms of LQTS arrhythmias are more commonly seen in response to exercise or mental stress (LQT1), in other forms following a sudden loud noise (LQT2) , and in some forms during sleep or immediately upon waking (LQT3). Some rare forms of long QT syndrome are associated with symptoms affecting other pas of the body.

Since the staing point is a group of people who already have suffered from the disease, this is labeled as a retrospective study.(BACKWARD LOOKING STUDY) Advantages of case control studies Relatively quick and easy to undeake. Relatively cheap to undeake. Only method useful in rare diseases. Not enmeshed in problems of follow-up as the data is collected at one point in time. Can be used to study the effect of many exposure variables on a single disease outcome. Drawbacks of case control studies Prone to selection and recall bias. Can't measure relative risk or provide incidence estimates . (Only odd's ratio can be calculated from the type of study, which is a rough estimate of relative risk. But when the disease in question is a rare one odd's ratio is almost equal to relative risk.) Sometimes the occurrence of the exposure in terms of time, i.e. whether it occurred before the disease may be difficult to estimate. Can't be used for rare exposures. Attributable risk can be estimated in a coho study. Ref : Park's Textbook of Preventive and Social Medicine; 18th edition; Page-65",C

Which one of the following is an emerging viral disease?,SARS,Chicken pox,Measles,Rabies,"Virus discovery in particular has been greatly facilitated by new nucleic acid technology. These frontiers were first notably explored with high-density microarrays containing spatially arrayed sequences from a phylogenetically diverse collection of viruses. Although biased toward those with homology to known viruses, novel viruses in clinical samples were successfully identified on the basis of their ability to hybridize to these prespecified sequences. This methodology famously contributed to identification of the corona virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Once discovered, this SARS corona-virus was rapidly sequenced: the full genome was assembled in April 2003, less than 6 months after recognition of the first case. This accomplishment illustrated the advancing power and speed of new diagnostic technologies.

Secondary lung abscesses occurred in bronchial obstructions (by tumor, foreign body or enlarged lymph nodes), with coexisting lung diseases (bronchiectasis, bullous emphysema, cystic fibrosis, infected pulmonary infarcts, lung contusion), then spreading from extrapulmonary sites-hematogenous (abdominal sepsis, infective endocarditis, infected canula or central venous catheter, septic thromboembolisms) or by direct spreading (broncho-oesophageal fistula, subphrenic abscess) (6). Based on way of spreading, lung abscess can be bronchogenic (aspiration, inhalation) and haematogenic-dissemination from other infected sites. Division of lung abscesses: According to the duration: Acute (less than 6 weeks); Chronic (more than 6 weeks); By etiology: Primary (aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, necrotizing pneumonia, immunodeficiency); Secondary (bronchial obstructions, haematogenic dissemination, direct spreading from mediastinal infection, from subphrenium, coexisting lung diseases); Way of spreading: Brochogenic (aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, bronchial obstruction by tumor, foreign body, enlarged lymph nodes, congenital malformation); Haematogenic (abdominal sepsis, infective endocarditis, septic thromboembolisms).

Proximal Bronchiectasis is feature of?,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Tuberculosis,Measles pneumonia,All of the above,"Ans. a (Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) (Ref. Harrison's Medicine, 18thCh. 204)Bronchiectasis accompanying ABPA often involves proximal airways and is associated with mucoid impaction.Other features on high-resolution CT scanning can suggest a specific etiology of the bronchiectasis. For example, bronchiectasis of relatively proximal airways suggests ABPA, whereas the presence of multiple small pulmonary nodules (nodular bronchiectasis) suggests infection with M. avium complex.BRONCHIECTASISEtiologies of Bronchiectasis- Mycobacterial- Viral (Swyer-James syndrome)- Fungal (including ABPA)- Dyskinetic cilia syndromes (Kartagener's)- Cystic fibrosis- Alphal-antitrypsin deficiency- Mounier-Kuhn's syndrome- Williams-Campbell syndrome- Bronchopulmonary sequestration- AIDS- Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia- Selective or pangammaglobulinemia- Postobstructive (neoplasm, foreign body, stricture)- Chronic rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis)- Graft-versus-host disease- Aspiration- Inhalation of toxic gases- Collagen vascular diseases- Asthma- Yellow-nail syndrome- Sarcoidosis High-resolution CT (HRCT) is accepted accurate noninvasive means of diagnosing bronchiectasis. Signs described on CT include: tram-track sign, signet ring sign, string of pearls sign, and cluster of grapes sign. When a dilated bronchus is oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the section it is recognized in cross-section as a ring structure, with an internal diameter larger than that of its accompanying pulmonary artery branch. Termed the signet ring sign, the wall of the dilated bronchus represents the band of the ring, whereas the signet is the soft-tissue density produced by the artery. This is diagnostic sign.A wide spectrum of abnormalities may be identified at HRCT in patients with airway disease, including various distinctive patterns of bronchiectasis in specific clinical settings, such as ABPA, MAC infection, AIDS, and cystic fibrosis (CF). The predominant HRCT finding in CF is bronchiectasis, which is typically panlobar. Proximal and parahilar bronchiectasis are identified in all of these cases; in about a third of cases it is limited to these areas, a pattern termed CENTRAL OR PROXIMAL BRONCHIECTASIS, as seen in ABPA.",A
Major symptoms of hypernatremia are,Cardiac,Neurologic,Respiratory,Musculoskeletal,"Hypernatremia increases osmolality of the ECF, generating an osmotic gradient between the ECF and ICF, an efflux of intracellular water, and cellular shrinkage. As in hyponatremia, the symptoms of hypernatremia are predominantly neurologic. Altered mental status is the most frequent manifestation, ranging from mild confusion and lethargy to deep coma.

When to do Retinopathy screening in a patient with Diabetic Neuropathy?,Immediately,After 4 weeks,After 4 months,After 1 year,"(A) Immediately# DIABETIC RETINOPATHY is a important cause of avoidable blindness in India. Treatment interventions at early stages of diabetic retinopathy can reduce burden of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. With the available cost-effective methods of early screening, appropriate strategies/models need to be developed.> Diabetic retinopathy has no early warning signs.> Macular edema, which can cause rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. A person with macular edema is likely to have blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive and in some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.> Diagnosis of Diabetic retinopathy is detected during an eye examination that includes: Visual acuity test: This test uses an eye chart to measure how well a person sees at various distances (i.e., visual acuity). Pupil dilation: The eye care professional places drops into the eye to dilate the pupil. This allows him or her to see more of the retina and look for signs of diabetic retinopathy. After the examination, close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. Ophthalmoscopy:(1) Looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or(2) Wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time. Fundus Fluorescein angiography (FFA): This is an imaging technique which relies on the circulation of Fluorescein dye to show staining, leakage, or non-perfusion of the retinal and choroidal vasculature. Optical coherence tomography (OCT): This is an optical imaging modality based upon interference, and analogous to ultra- sound.

Minamata disease is caused by toxicity of:,Arsenic,Antimony,Lead,Mercury,"A significant example of mercury exposure affecting public health occurred in Minamata, Japan, between 1932 and 1968, where a factory producing acetic acid discharged waste liquid into Minamata Bay. The discharge included high concentrations of methylmercury. The bay was rich in fish and shellfish, providing the main livelihood for local residents and fishermen from other areas. For many years, no one realised that the fish were contaminated with mercury, and that it was causing a strange disease in the local community and in other districts. At least 50 000 people were affected to some extent and more than 2 000 cases of Minamata disease were ceified. Minamata disease peaked in the 1950s, with severe cases suffering brain damage, paralysis, incoherent speech and delirium. Ref :",D

Which of the following statements about the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) is true –,Provides severe punishment for drug users and drug peddlers alike,Consumption of excessive alcohol is punishable under the act,Recommends treatment/rehabilitation of drug users and punishment for drug peddlers,Farmers growing opium are permitted to grow and consume unlimited amount of opium,"The Narcotic Drugs and Psychoactive Substances Act 1985 (NDPS)
This Act repeals and renders obsolete three Acts namely –
1. The Opium Act 1857
2. The Opium Act 1878
3. The Dangerous Drugs Act 1930

According to this Act, a narcotic drug refers to the cocoa leaf, cannabis (hemp), opium, poppy straw and includes all manufactured drugs. A manufactured drug means all the cocoa derivatives, medicinal cannabis, opium derivatives and poppy straw concentrate and any other narcotic substance preparation, which the Central Government may by notification, declare to be manufactured drug.
The Act defines psychotropic substance as any substance, natural or synthetic, included in the list of psychotropic substances specified in a Schedule to the Act. The Schedule lists 77 psychotropic substances.
Under section 27 of the Act, if a person possess in a small quantity, any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance intended for personal use and not for sale or distribution, or consumes any narcotic or psychotropic substance, he shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. The small quantity as quoted in the definition means:

1. 5 gm of hashish
2. 250 mg of heroin, smack and brown sugar
3. 5 gm of opium
4. 125 mg of cocaine
5. 500 gm of ganja

NDPS Act prohibits the cultivation of poppy, cannabis and coca plants, however, restricted cultivation is allowed for the medicinal or scientific purpose.
The minimum punishment for any offence committed under the Act is 10 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 1 lakh while maximum punishment is 20 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 2 lakh.",C

Dissociative sensory loss is not seen in,Syringomelia,Cauda equine syndrome,Diabetes mellitus,Damage to spino-thalamic pathway,"Dissociated sensory loss is a pattern of neurological damage caused by a lesion to a single tract in the spinal cord which involves preservation of fine touch and proprioception with selective loss of pain and temperature. Understanding the mechanisms behind these selective lesions requires a brief discussion of the anatomy involved. Loss of pain and temperature are due to damage to the lateral spinothalamic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord close to the level where they enter it and travel up the spinal column on the opposite side to the one they innervate (i.e. they ascend contralaterally). Note that a lesion of the lateral spinothalamic tract at a given level will not result in sensory loss for the dermatome of the same level; this is due to the fibers of the tract of Lissauer which transmit the neuron one or two levels above the affected segment (thus bypassing the segmental lesion on the contralateral side). Loss of fine touch and proprioception are due to damage to the dorsal columns, which do not cross the cord until the brainstem, and so travel up the column on the same side to the one they innervate (i.e. they ascend ipsilaterally). This means that a lesion of the dorsal columns will cause loss of touch and proprioception below the lesion and on the same side as it, while a lesion of the spinothalamic tracts will cause loss of pain and temperature below the lesion and on the opposite side to it. Dissociated sensory loss always suggests a focal lesion within the spinal cord or brainstem. The location of cord lesions affects presentation--for instance, a central lesion (such as that of syringomyelia) will knock out second order neurons of the spinothalamic tract as they cross the centre of the cord, and will cause loss of pain and temperature without loss of fine touch or proprioception. Other causes of dissociated sensory loss include: Diabetes mellitus Syringomyelia Brown-Sequard syndrome Lateral medullary syndrome aka Wallenberg's syndrome Anterior spinal aery thrombosis Tangier disease Subacute combined degeneration Multiple sclerosis Tabes dorsalis Friedreich's ataxia (or other spinocerebellar degeneration) Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2756",B

Which nerve is most commonly involved in Sarcoidosis ?,Facial,Optic,Ophthalmic,Vestibular,"Cranial neuropathies are the most common manifestation of neurosarcoidosis . Any cranial nerve (CN) may be affected, and multiple cranial nerve involvement is common. The most frequently affected CN is VII, and sometimes bilateral facial neuropathies are present . Optic neuropathy is also not uncommon . Involvement of CN VIII (uni- or bilaterally) can cause auditory or vestibular dysfunction , but it may be asymptomatic and detected by brainstem auditory-evoked responses . Nerves involved in eye movement (CN III, IV, and VI) may also be affected. Olfactory involvement is somewhat uncommon and causes anosmia and impaired taste Cranial neuropathies may occur because of basilar meningitis, but infiltration or compression of nerves along their course can cause their dysfunction. For example, olfactory nerve dysfunction can occur from olfactory bulb involvement as well as from involvement of the nasal mucosa . In the latter instance, it can be diagnosed by nasal biopsy. In addition, some facial neuropathies probably occur from basilar meningitis, while other cases may be due to granulomatous involvement of the extracranial poion of the nerve. Ref - pubmed.com",A

True about mucosa associated lymphoma,H. Pylori predisposes,Chemotherapy sensitive,Multiple lymphomas,Stromal Polyp,"Gastric lymphoma This is a rare tumour, accounting for less than 5% of all gastric malignancies. The stomach is, however, the most common site for extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 60% of all primary gastrointestinal lymphomas occur at this site. Lymphoid tissue is not found in the normal stomach but lymphoid aggregates develop in the presence of H. pylori infection. Indeed, H. pylori infection is closely associated with the development of a low-grade lymphoma (classified as extranodal marginal-zone lymphomas of MALT type). EUS plays an impoant role in staging these lesions by accurately defining the depth of invasion into the gastric wall. The clinical presentation is similar to that of gastric cancer and endoscopically the tumour appears as a polypoid or ulcerating mass. While initial treatment of low-grade lesions confined to the superficial layers of the gastric wall consists of H. pylori eradication and close observation, 25% contain t(11:18) chromosomal translocations. In these cases, additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy is usually necessary. High-grade B-cell lymphomas should be treated by a combination of rituximab, chemotherapy , surgery and radiotherapy. The choice depends on the site and extent of tumour, the presence of comorbid illnesses, and other factors, such as symptoms of bleeding and gastric outflow obstruction. The prognosis depends on the stage at diagnosis. Features predicting a ourable prognosis are stage I or II disease, small resectable tumours, tumours with low-grade histology, and age below 60 years.

"A 24 year old male presents with altered sensorium and rapid shallow breathing. ABG shows:pH 7.2, sodium 140, bicarbonate 10 and chloride 98. Probable diagnosis is -",Renal tubular acidosis,DKA,Ethylene glycol poisoning,Amphetamine toxicity,"usually happens because your body doesn't have enough insulin. Your cells can't use the sugar in your blood for energy, so they use fat for fuel instead. Burning fat makes acids called ketones and, if the process goes on for a while, they could build up in your blood. That excess can change the chemical balance of your blood and throw off your entire patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and develops when insulin levels are insufficient to meet the body's basic metabolic requirements. DKA is the first manifestation of type 1 DM in a minority of patients. Insulin deficiency can be absolute (eg, during lapses in the administration of exogenous insulin) or relative (eg, when usual insulin doses do not meet metabolic needs during physiologic stress) The therapeutic goals of DKA management include optimization of 1) volume status; 2) hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis; 3) electrolyte abnormalities; and 4) potential precipitating factors. The majority of patients with DKA present to the emergency room. Therefore, emergency physicians should initiate the management of hyperglycemic crisis while a physical examination is performed, basic metabolic parameters are obtained, and final diagnosis is made. Several impoant steps should be followed in the early stages of DKA management: collect blood for metabolic profile before initiation of intravenous fluids; infuse 1 L of 0.9% sodium chloride over 1 hour after drawing initial blood samples; ensure potassium level of >3.3 mEq/L before initiation of insulin therapy (supplement potassium intravenously if needed); initiate insulin therapy only when steps 1-3 are executed.

"A 56 year old diabetic man, Damu who regularly consumes nearly 120g alcohol per day, was referred by the PHC physician with history of fatigue, cough with putrid smelling sputum and fever. He has anemia, weight loss, pyorrhea and gingivitis. His chest X-Ray showed some findings which helped the doctor to diagnose his pathology. The true statement regarding treatment of this condition is:",Patients with fever persisting for 5 days should undergo bronchoscopy,Metronidazole is preferred over clindamycin if used alone,Duration of treatment is 7 days,Clindamycin is the initial treatment of choice in this setting,"This is a tricky question, here we have a patient with alcoholism with frequent aspirations. On the top of that the patient is diabetic too. He is complaining of fever, weight loss, cough with expectoration with foul smelling sputum, so the first d/d is lung abscess due to anaerobes. Let us see the explanations from harrison: Lung abscess: A common feature is periodontal infection with pyorrhea or gingivitis. The usual symptoms are fatigue, cough, sputum production, and fever. Chills are uncommon. Many patients have evidence of chronic disease, such as weight loss and anemia. Some patients have putrid-smelling sputum indicative of the presence of anaerobes. This is usually treated with clindamycin; the initial IV dose of 600 mg four times daily can be changed to an oral dosage of 300 mg four times daily once the patient becomes afebrile and improves clinically. The duration of therapy is until imaging shows that chest lesions have cleared or have left a small, stable scar. An alternative to clindamycin is any B-lactam/-lactamase inhibitor combination; parenteral treatment may be followed by orally administered amoxicillin/clavulanate. Penicillin was previously regarded as a preferred drug for these infections, but many oral anaerobes produce -lactamases, and clindamycin proved superior to penicillin G in a randomized clinical trial. Metronidazole is highly active against viually all anaerobes but not against aerobic microaerophilic streptococci, which play an impoant role in mixed infections. In therapeutic trials, metronidazole has done poorly unless combined with a -lactam or another agent active against aerobic and microaerophilic streptococci. Patients with fevers persisting for 7-14 days should undergo bronchoscopy. Ref: Harrisons Principles of Medicine, 18th Edition, Chapter 258, Pages 2145-2146",D

Frequently the pain is pleuritic, consequent to accompanying pleural inflammation (i.e., sharp and aggravated by inspiration and coughing), but sometimes it is steady, constricting, radiates into either arm or both arms, and resembles that of myocardial ischemia; therefore, confusion with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is common.

Tension pneumothorax is associated with -,Mediastinal displacement away from the lesion,Decreased percussion note on the side of the lesion,increased blood pressure,Stridor,In tension pneumothorax the pressure in pleural space is positive throughout the respiratory cycle. This condition usually occurs during mechanical ventilation and resuscitative effos. Difficulty in ventilation during resuscitation or high peak inspiratory pressures during mechanical ventilation strongly suggest the diagnosis. Physical examination shows : Enlarged hemithorax Absent breath sounds Hyperresonance on percussion Shift of mediastinum to contralateral side The positive pleural pressure in tension pneumothorax is life threatening because ventilation is severely compromised and the positive pressure is transmitted to mediastinum resulting in decreased venous return to hea and reduced cardiac output.

Cardiac abnormality seen with Noonan's syndrome is -,VSD,ASD,Pulmonary stenosis,Coarctation of aorta,"Noonan Syndrome :

were previously thought to have a form of Turner syndrome, with which Noonan syndrome shares a number of clinical features.
The observation that patients with Noonan syndrome have normal karyotypes was important in allowing the distinction to be made between the Turner and Noonan syndromes.

Pathophysiology :

The pathophysiology of Noonan syndrome is not fully understood. A disease-causing gene, PTPN11, has been identified. The gene product, SHP2, plays an important role in cardiac semilunar valve development.

Sex :

Noonan syndrome occurs in either a sporadic or autosomal dominant fashion. In either case, males and females are affected equally.

Age :

The disorder is present from birth, but age impacts upon the facial phenotype Infants with Noonan syndrome can be difficult to recognize by facial appearance alone. The phenotype becomes more striking in early childhood, but with advancing age, it may again become quite subtle. Careful examination of an affected child's parents may, in fact, reveal that they are affected mildly.

Which of the following is a major criteria for diagnosis of poycythemia vera:,Presence of JAK-2 mutation,Low Erythropoetin levels,High Leucocyte Alkaline Phosphatase (TLAP score),Thrombocytosis,"Answer is A (Presence of JAK-2 mutation) Presence of JAK-2 mutation is a Major criterion fir diagnosis of polycythemia Vera according to the proposed new WHO criteria for the diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera. Low Erythropoetin levels, Thrombocytosis and increased LAP scores are all minor criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia Vera. JAK-2 Mutation and Polycythemia Vera JAK-2 is a member of an evolutionarily well conserved, non receptor tyrosine kinase family and serves as the cognate tyrosine kinase for the erythropoietin receptors A mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK-2 appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of PV by causing constitutive activation of the kinase The presence of JAK -2 mutation thus allows for the exclusion of a reactive erythrocytosis. The 2001 WHO criteria for diagnosis of PV were however developed prior to the discovery of this impoant mutation and hence revised WHO criteria have been developed that include presence of JAK-2 mutation as a major criterion for diagnosis of PV Note : Although presence of JAK-2 mutation is a major criterion for diagnosis of PV, the presence of JAK-2 mutation alone is not diagnostic of PV. JAK-2 mutations may also be seen in other myeloproliferative disorders such as Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and Chronic Idiopathic Myelojlbrosis (CIMF). Various major and minor criteria used for the diagnosis of polvcythemia vera in various classification systems (WHO criteria (revised and old )/ Polvcythemia vera study group criteria) Major Minor * JAK2 V617F mutation * Thrombocytosis (> 400 x 109/L) * Hemoglobin >18.5 g/dL in men, 16.5 g/dL in * Leucocytosis (WBC > 12 x 109/L) women * Increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP > 100U) * Increased red blood cell mass * Increased serum B12/binders * Splenomegaly (B12 > 900 pg/ml; unbound B12 binding capacity> 2200 pg/ml) * Clonal genetic abnormality other than * Low serum erythroprotein levels.

"A thiy five year old female has proximal weakness of muscles, ptosis and easy fatigability. The most sensitive test to suggest the diagnosis is.",Muscle Biopsy,CPK levels,Edrophonium test,EMG,"Tensilon test (edrophonium test) is a pharmacological test used for the diagnosis of ceain neural diseases, especially myasthenia gravis. It is also used to distinguish a myasthenic crisis from a cholinergic crisis in individuals undergoing treatment for myasthenia gravis 10 mg edrophonium hydrochloride syringe and a 2 mg atropine syringe are prepared. Atropine is prepared for immediate use in case cholinergic crisis occurs. After a neurologic examination and recording of vital signs, first 2 mg edrophonium is injected intravenously. After waiting 30 seconds and ensuring that no adverse reactions occurred, the remaining 8 mg of edrophonium is also injected. A patient suffering from myasthenia gravis experiences improvement in muscle strength and endurance with repetitive movements, while normal persons do not feel any difference. The effects of edrophonium lasts around 10 minutes. The edrophonium allows accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neuromuscular junctions, and makes more ACh available to the muscle receptors, thereby increasing muscle strength in myasthenia gravis. In newborns, a 0.15 mg/kg edrophonium administered subcutaneously produces a response within 10 minutes. In infants, the drug is administered intravenously at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Improvement of diplopia is often used as an evaluation item because in this case, placebo effect can be excluded Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2456",C

Dose of MgSO4 in asthma is,8 g i.v. over 20 minutes,2g infused over 20 minutes,2g i.v. over 40 minute,6 g i.V. over 40 minutes,"Bronchodilators Bronchodilator therapy is central to the management of breathlessness. The inhaled route is preferred and a number of different agents delivered by a variety of devices are available. Choice should be informed by patient preference and inhaler assessment. Sho-acting bronchodilators may be used for patients with mild disease but longer-acting bronchodilators are usually more appropriate for those with moderate to severe disease. Significant improvements in breathlessness may be repoed despite minimal changes in FEV1, probably reflecting improvements in lung emptying that reduce dynamic hyperinflation and ease the work of breathing. Oral bronchodilator therapy, such as theophylline preparations, may be contemplated in patients who cannot use inhaled devices efficiently but their use may be limited by side-effects, unpredictable metabolism and drug interactions; hence the requirement to monitor plasma levels. Orally active, highly selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors remain under appraisal. Combined inhaled glucocoicoids and bronchodilators The fixed combination of an inhaled glucocoicoid and a LABA improves lung function, reduces the frequency and severity of exacerbations and improves quality of life. These advantages may be accompanied by an increased risk of pneumonia, paicularly in the elderly. LABA/inhaled glucocoicoid combinations are frequently given with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). LAMAs should be used with caution in patients with significant hea disease or a history of urinary retention. Oral glucocoicoids Oral glucocoicoids are useful during exacerbations but maintenance therapy contributes to osteoporosis and impaired skeletal muscle function, and should be avoided. Oral glucocoicoid trials assist in the diagnosis of asthma but do not predict response to inhaled glucocoicoids in COPD. Pulmonary rehabilitation Exercise should be encouraged at all stages and patients reassured that breathlessness, while distressing, is not dangerous. Multidisciplinary programmes that incorporate physical training, disease education and nutritional counselling reduce symptoms, improve health status and enhance confidence. Most programmes include two to three sessions per week, last between 6 and 12 weeks, and are accompanied by demonstrable and sustained improvements in exercise tolerance and health status. Oxygen therapy Long-term domiciliary oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival in selected patients with COPD complicated by severe hypoxaemia (aerial PaO2 < 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg)). It is most conveniently provided by an oxygen concentrator and patients should be instructed to use oxygen for a minimum of 15 hours/ day; greater benefits are seen in those who use it for more than 20 hours/day. The aim of therapy is to increase the PaO2 to at least 8 kPa (60 mmHg) or SaO2 to at least 90%. Ambulatory oxygen therapy should be considered in patients who desaturate on exercise and show objective improvement in exercise capacity and/or dyspnoea with oxygen. Oxygen flow rates should be adjusted to maintain SaO2 above 90%. Surgical intervention Bullectomy may be considered when large bullae compress surrounding normal lung tissue. Patients with predominantly upper lobe emphysema, preserved gas transfer and no evidence of pulmonary hypeension may benefit from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), in which peripheral emphysematous lung tissue is resected with the aim of reducing hyperinflation and decreasing the work of breathing. Both bullectomy and LVRS can be performed thorascopically, minimising morbidity. Lung transplantation may benefit carefully selected patients with advanced disease (p. 567). Other measures Patients with COPD should be offered an annual influenza vaccination and, as appropriate, pneumococcal vaccination. Obesity, poor nutrition, depression and social isolation should be identified and, if possible, improved. Mucolytic agents are occasionally used but evidence of benefit is limited. Palliative care Addressing end-of-life needs is an impoant, yet often ignored, aspect of care in advanced disease. Morphine preparations may be used for palliation of breathlessness in advanced disease and benzodiazepines in low dose may reduce anxiety. Decisions regarding resuscitation should be addressed in advance of critical illnes Magnesium sulfate is a bronchodilator. It relaxes the bronchial muscles and expands the airways, allowing more air to flow in and out of the lungs. This can relieve symptoms of asthma, such as shoness of breath. initial loading dose 2 gm over a period of 20 minutes where infused Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 577",B
Which of the following is not related to epidemiology,Promotion of health,Identification of etiology of disease,To collect data of magnitude of health problem,To teach a medical student how to conduct safe delivery,"According to the International Epidemiological Association (lEA), epidemiology has three main aims :


To describe the distribution and magnitude of health and disease problems in human populations.
To identity aetiological factors (risk factors) in the pathogenesis of disease; and
To provide the data essential to the planning, implementation and evaluation of services for the prevention, control and treatment of disease and to the setting up of priorities among those services.


In order to fulfil these aims, three rather different classes of epidemiological studies may be mentioned: descriptive studies, analytical studies, and experimental or intervention studies,
The ultimate aim of epidemiology is to lead to effective action :


To eliminate or reduce the health problem or its consequences; and
To promote the health and well-being of society as a whole.",D

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebral hemorrhage,Acute cerebral infarction,Myocardial infarction,Pulmonary thromboembolism,"Hip fracture and prolonged bed rest are classic risk factors for the development of pulmonary thromboemboli (PE). Common clinical manifestations of PE are hypoxia (due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch) despite a normal chest x-ray, tachycardia, and delirium in older patients. Cerebral hemorrhage might cause delirium but would not directly cause hypoxia unless the patient was hypoventilating (e.g., because of brainstem involvement). Cerebral infarction could produce delirium but would not directly cause hypoxia unless the patient was hypoventilating. Myocardial infarction could account for delirium and tachycardia, but not for hypoxia with a normal chest x-ray. Severe congestive hea failure after myocardial infarction could cause hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, but the chest x-ray would not be normal.

Which drug is recommended for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV infection ?,Didanosine,Nevirapine,Indinavir,Nelfinavir,"A in special situations (Pregnancy) Nevirapine is the drug that prevents mother to child transmission . All pregnant women should have HIV testing at an early stage in pregnancy. The CD4 count falls by about 25% during pregnancy due to haemodilution. The course of HIV disease progression is not altered by pregnancy. In the pre-A era, the rate of mother-to-child transmission was 15-40%, with rates being influenced by several factors .A has dramatically reduced the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than 1%. All pregnant women should sta A at the beginning of the second trimester, unless they have advanced disease, when A should be staed in the first trimester. Caesarean section is associated with a lower risk of mother- to-child transmission than vaginal delivery, but the mode of delivery does not affect transmission risk if the viral load is suppressed on A. HIV is also transmitted by breastfeeding. In high-income countries, exclusive formula feeding is generally recommended. In resource-poor settings, however, formula feeding is associated with a risk of infant morbidity and moality, which may negate the benefit of not transmitting HIV to the infant. There is minimal risk of transmitting HIV by breastfeeding in women with a suppressed viral load on A. Fuhermore, providing antiretrovirals to infants (usually nevirapine monotherapy) while they are breastfeeding has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission. Breastfeeding is therefore now encouraged in resource-poor settings. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, as mixed feeding (with formula or solids) is associated with a higher risk of transmission. Diagnosis of HIV in infancy requires the detection of HIV RNA by PCR, as maternal antibodies to HIV, which persist for up to 15 months, will give a false-positive result on antibody assays. PCR should ideally be carried out within 6 weeks of bih to facilitate early A initiation. If the baby is breastfed, the PCR should be repeated 2 weeks after weaning.

Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis Risk Factor For CF PLUS Laboratory Evidence of CFTR Dysfunction * Presence of one or more typical clinical feature * Positive sweat chloride test (> 1 phenotypic symptom) Plus (>60 mcq/l on two occasions) or Or * History of CF in sibling Plus * Identification of 2 CF mutations or or * Positive Neonatal screening test Plus * Abnormal Nasal Potential Difference The patient in question has typical clinical features of cystic fibrosis; however the sweat chloride levels are border line (between 40-60meq/1) on two separate occasions. To establish the diagnosis of cystic. fibrosis, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is therefore required. This can be achieved by demonstration of abnormal CF mutation by DNA analysis or by demonstrating an abnormal nasal potential difference. The diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires demonstration of at least two CF mutations and hence demonstration of an abnormal F508 mutation alone is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of CF An abnormal CFTR nasal potential difference is an established laboratory evidence of CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criterion to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.",B

Hydrostatic Pulmonary edema with fluid in alveoli is usually seen when PCWP is:,>6 mm Hg,>10 rnm Hg,>15 mm Hg,>25 mm Hg,"Answer is D (>25mm Hg): Alveolar Pulmonary edema from elevated hydrostatic pressure (Cardiogenic) is typically associated with PCWP >25 ntm Hg. Elevated PCWP but with Pressure <25mm Hg is usually associated with interstitial pulmonary edema and not true alveolar pulmonary edema. Hydrostatic pulmonary edema is also known as cardiogenic pulmonary edema (since it typically arises from left hea failure). The inefficient left ventricle causes blood to back up in the *pulmonary circulation, increasing hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries (Increased PCWP). High capillary pressure progressively forces fluid first into the interstitium (Interstitial Pulmonary Edema) and then into the alveoli (Alveolar Pulmonary Edema). Three stages of pulmonary edema can be distinguished based on the degree of fluid accumulation Stage 1 is characterized by excess fluid that can still be cleared by lymphatic drainage. Stage 2 is characterized by the presence of interstitial edema. Stage 3 is characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema (fluid and proteins enter the alveolar space) PCWP Stage Interpretation in relation to Hydrostatic Pulmonary Edema 6-12 mm Hg Normal No Pulmonary Edema (Normal) 12-18mm Hg Stage I Usually not associated with pulmonary edema (Mild Increase) Excess fluid can still be cleared by lymphatic drainage No Physical or X-ray Findings are usually evident 18 - 25 mm Hg Stage 2 Characterized by the presence of interstitial edema (Moderate Increase) Some physical findings including some fine crackling breath sounds may be evident X-ray evidences of pulmonary edema in the form of engorged pulmonary vessels and appearance of infiltrates may be seen >25 mm Hg Stage 3 Characterized by alveolar pulmonary edema (fluid and proteins enter the alveolar (Severe Increase) space) Physical findings are prominent and include clinically significant hypoxemia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, diffuse crackles, and wheezing breath sounds Obvious x-ray evidence of pulmonary edema (greatly increased infiltrates and vascular engorgement)",D

Reactivation tuberculosis and primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung are similar in that they both are commonly associated with,Cavitation,Scar carcinomas,Silicosis,Ectopic secretion of a parathormone-like peptide,"Both reactivation tuberculosis (TB) and primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung are associated with cavitation. Other pulmonary diseases associated with cavitation include systemic fungal infections, Klebsiella pneumonias, and silicosis. In silicosis, the large fibrotic nodules undergo central necrosis from ischemia. Fuhermore, silicosis predisposes patients to the development of TB within the fibrotic nodules, thus producing cavitation. Ectopic secretion of a parathormone-like peptide producing hypercalcemia is seen only in squamous cell carcinoma. Scar carcinomas are a possible sequela of old scar tissue in TB. Adenocarcinomas are more frequently associated with scar carcinomas than squamous carcinoma. The most common extrapulmonary site for TB is the kidneys, and the adrenal gland is the most common site for metastatic squamous cancer. Silicosis predisposes patients to TB, but not to primary lung cancer. Ref - Harrison's principles of internal medicine 20e pg 1236 , pubmed.com",A

True about correlation coefficient:,Denoted by r2,Its value can never be Zero,Can be used to calculate value of one variable if other is known,Value lies between -1 to +1,"Ans. D. Value lies between -1 to +1Correlation: Often we wish to know if there is linear relation between two variables, e.g. height and weight. To find out the strength of association between the two variables we calculate the coefficient of correlation and it is denoted by V.The value of r can lie between -1 to +1If r = 0 then there is no association between the two variables.Regression: Used when we wish to calculate unknown value of a variable, when we know value of another variable.The known variable is called independent variable and denoted by x and the unknown variable is called dependent variable denoted by y.Equation for linear regression is given byy = a + bxWhere y is dependent variable, a is constant, b is the regression coefficient and x is independent variable.Coming to the present questionOption a is wrong as correlation coefficient is denoted by r and not r2.Option b has to be false if option d is correct. In such questions, where there are two mutually exclusive options, i.e. of the two statement one explains the other and only one can be true, you easily rule out the other two even if you do not know about them. Thus, in this question even if you do not know a thing about correlation (which by now you do pretty well) you can conclude answer has to be either option c or d.Option d is the only true statement among all four.Option c is the definition of regression.",D
Spontaneous CSF leak occurs in all except -,Increased intracranial tension,Partial or complete empty sella syndrome,Pseudotumour cerebri,Low risk encephalocoele,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increased intracranial tensionWe are not sure of the answer.We have gone for increased intracranial tension because spontaneous C.S.F. leak is associated with intracranial hypotension.Increased intracranial tension is not associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak.All other options mentioned in the question are associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak.Pseudotumor CerebriPseudotumor cerebri usually presents with triad of headache, papilledema and minimal or absent focal neurological signs, but rarely the presenting feature may be a nasal C.S.F. leak.Empty sella syndromeIn empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica (the bony structure which contains pituitary enlarges). In this disease there is a defect in tissue barrier that normally keeps the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain separate from the sella turcica. As a result cerebrospinal fluid puts increased pressure on the pituitary glands and the walls of the sella turcica. The sella tunica enlarges and the pituitary shrinks.The empty sella syndrome may produce no symptoms at all and seldom produces serious symptom. About half of those affected have headaches. In rare cases there is leaking of the cerebrospinal fluid from the nose.EncephaloceleEncephalocele may present with C.S.F. leak.More on spontaneous C.S.F. leak or spontaneous intracranial hypotensionSpontaneous intracranial hypotension is a condition where patient gets postural headache due to leak of the cerebrospinal fluid in the spinal membrane.What happens is that the leak causes low C.S.F. pressure within the nervous system and thus causes a string of headache to the patient.The problem with SIH is that it is hard to diagnose and there is not a great deal of information on why it occurs.It has been associated with connective tissue diseases which may involve the dura causing tear in it.To summarize it, spontaneous C.S.F. leak is very rare and unlike other causes it does not occur due to any specific traumatic event or surgical procedure in the nervous system.Although there is not much information on the possible causes of C.S.F. leak, it is suspected that an intrinsic weakness of the spinal membrane or an abnormality of the brain structure causes the rare condition. The symptoms of SIH are so small and so common that it can often be misdiagnosed.",A

It is related to malnutrition in both ways, i.e. -


Measles tends to be more severe in the malnourished child.
In a healthy child, measles precipitates malnutrition.


That means measles predisposes malnutrition and vice versa.
All cases of severe measles and all cases of measles in areas with high case-fatality rates should be treated with vitamin A, as many children develop an acute deficiency of vitamin A, which may lead to keratomalacia and blindness from corneal scarring.
So, vitamin 'A' should be administered along with the measles vaccine.
A high dose of vitamin A is given immediately on diagnosis of measles and repeated the next day. The recommended age-specific daily doses are 50,000 IU for infants aged < 6 months, 100,000 IU for infants aged 6-11 months, and 200,000 IU for children aged 12 months.

"Due to an effective prevention program, the pre valence of an infectious disease in a community has been reduced by 90%. A physician continues to use the same diagnostic test for the disease that she has always used. How have the test’s characteristics changed?",Its sensitivity has increased,Its positive predictive value has increased,The test’s characteristics have not changed,Its negative predictive value has increased,"PPV and NPV of a screening test depends on:

– Sensitivity
– Specificity
– Prevalence of disease in the population
In this question, since a physician continues to use the same diagnostic test for the disease that she has always used, sensitivity and specificity of the test will remain same
But predictive value of a test (PPV and NPV) depends on prevalence of a disease in a population

PPV is directly proportional to prevalence of disease in the population

– PPV á Prevalence of disease
– As the prevalence of a disease increases in a population, PPV increases for the screening test

NPV is inversely proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population

Additional finding is",Low serum transferrin,Increased iron binding capacity,Increased Hb A2,Increased Serum copper,"Serum Iron and Total Iron-Binding Capacity The serum iron level represents the amount of circulating iron bound to transferrin. The TIBC is an indirect measure of the circulating transferrin. The normal range for the serum iron is 50-150 mg/dL; the normal range for TIBC is 300-360 mg/dL. Transferrin saturation, which is normally 25-50%, isobtained by the following formula: serum iron x 100 / TIBC. Iron deficiency states are associated with saturation levels below 20%. There is a diurnal variation in the serum iron. A transferrin saturation % >50% indicates that a dispropoionate amount of the iron bound to transferrin is being delivered to nonerythroid tissues.

When fatigued, the patient is unable to hold her head up or chew her food. She often notes diplopia when driving home from work. On physical examination, she has no loss of reflexes, sensation, or coordination. Which of the following is the likely pathogenesis of this disease?",Autoantibodies directed against the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor causing neuromuscular transmission failure,Destruction of anterior horn cells by virus,Progressive muscular atrophy caused by spinal degeneration,Demyelinating disease,"The disease process described is myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disease marked by muscle weakness and fatigability. Myasthenia gravis results from a reduction in the number of junctional acetylcholine receptors as a result of autoantibodies. Antibodies cross-link these receptors, causing increased endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes. A decreased number of available acetylcholine receptors results in decreased efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. MG patients also have autoantibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) receptors. MG presents with weakness and fatigability, particularly of cranial muscles, causing diplopia, ptosis, nasal speech, and dysarthria. Proximal limb weakness also occurs. Diseases of the central nervous system (poliomyelitis, Friedreich ataxia, or multiple sclerosis, as in the option b, c, and d) cause changes in reflexes, sensation, or coordination. ALS, a pure motor disorder, causes fasciculations and muscle atrophy as a result of lower motor neuron involvement. McArdle disease, a glycogen storage disease, causes muscle cramping and occasionally rhabdomyolysis with heavy exertion but only very rarely with usual daily activities.Ten percent of myasthenia patients have thymic tumors. Surgical removal of a thymoma is necessary because of local tumor spread. Even in the absence of tumor, 85% of patients clinically improve after thymectomy.

Now the question arises, why only measles vaccine causes TSS more commonly and not the other commonly used vaccines? : -
It is due to the absence of preservatives.
Preservatives are substances used in vaccines to prevent bacterial & fungal contamination.
Measles vaccine contains limited or no amount of preservative, therefore rapid multiplication of pathogen takes place.
Most of the other commonly used vaccines contain preservatives.

Thiamine deficiency is seen in all except,Chronic diarrhoea,Chronic alcoholism,Homocystinemia,Food faddist,"Homocysteinemia Thiamine was the first vitamin to be identified and is therefore called as vitamin Bl. Thiamine deficiency or beriberi refers to the lack of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of the vitamin . Thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism through the decarboxylation of alphaketoacids and in the formation of glucose by acting as a coenzyme for the transketolase in the pentose monophosphate pathway Causes of Thiamine deficiency Persons may become deficient in thiamine either by not ingesting enough vitamin B-1 through the diet or by excess use, which may occur in hypehyroidism, pregnancy, lactation, or fever (sates of high energy consumption, such as hypehyroidism, pregnancy, or severe illness, require more thiamine and other nutrients.) Prolonged diarrhea may impair the body's ability to absorb vitamin B-1, and severe liver disease impairs its use. Decreased absorption is seen in - Diarrhea - Chronic intestinal disease - Alcoholism - Malnutrition - Gastric bypass surgery - Malabsorption syndrome - Celiac and tropical sprue - Hyperemesis gravidarum - Long term starvation - Fad diets( Fad diets often do not contain necessary amounts of thiamine) Increased depletion is seen in - Diuretic therapies - Peritoneal dialysis - Hemodialysis(Dialysis robs thiamine from the circulation) Alcohol is known to interfere directly with the absorption of thiamine and with the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate.( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids. This is due to the lack of available micronutrition supplementation Food faddism and fad diet are terms which refer to the tendency for idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns. A fad diet is supposed and promoted to improve health but may do nothing at all, or even have the opposite results if it is nutritionally unbalanced and unconfirmed by scientific studies Developing countries are known to have more vitamin deficiency problems in general Pathophysiology (Beriberi) In healthy individuals who are deprived of thiamine, thiamine stores are depleted in approximately 1 month. However, within a week of no thiamine intake, healthy people develop a resting tachycardia, weakness, and decreased deep tendon reflexes and some people develop a peripheral neuropathy. Nervous system involvement is termed dry beriberi. Dry beriberi involves both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. - Peripheral nerve involvement is typically a symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy with pain , parasthesias, and loss of reflexes. The legs are affected more than the arms. - Central nervous system involvement results in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. - Wernicke's encephalopathy consists of nystagmus progressing to ophthalmoplegia, truncal ataxia, and confnsion. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as WernikeKorsakoff syndrome. Wet beriberi is the term used for the cardiovascular involvement of thiamine deficiency. Wet beriberi is characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output hea .failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Diagnosis In most instances, the clinical response to empiric thiamine therapy is used to suppo a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. The most commonly used and widely available biochemical tests are measurement of erythrocyte transketolase activity and urinary thiamine excretion",C

Characteristic of incised wound are all except ?,Length of wound not correlated with weapon,Bleeding less than laceration,Hesitation cuts seen,Clean cut edges,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Bleeding less than laceration In incised wound, length of wound is longer than depth, bleeding is more as vessels are cut. There are clean cut edges and hesitation cuts are seen. Incised wound It is a clean cut through the tissues (usually, skin and subcutaneous tissue), caused by sharp-edged object, which is longer than its depth, when the weapon is struck or pressed and drawn across the body pa, i.e., there is pressure and friction. Examples of sharp edged object are knife, blade, razor, scalpel, sword, chopper etc. The characteristic features of incised wound are : Length is the greatest dimension (most impoant). Hair, hair bulb, nerve and vessels are cut bleeding is profuse as vessels are cut. Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound. Langer's line of skin determines gaping : gaping is more when cut is across these lines. Margins are eveed, clear, and clean cut. Clean incised wounds heal by primary intention, whereas diy, infected or large wounds heal by secondary intention, with scar formation. Hesitation cuts (Tentative cuts or trial cuts) are characteristic features of suicidal attempt. Incised wound on nose, ear and genital are usually homicidal and are inflicted on account of jealously or revenge in case of adultery, causing disfiguration.",A

The validity of a test is the extent to which it accurately measures which it purports to measure. In other words its the ability to show which individuals have the disease in question and which do not.
Validity has two components - sensitivity & specificity. To be truly valid, a test should be highly sensitive, specific and unbiased.
In this question the test results are not accurate (accurate value is 10.2) → Test has low validity.

Reliability (or Repeatability, reproducibility or precision)

This column is easy to form, you do it by successively accumulating the relative frequencies of each of the various intervals. In the above table the cumulative percentage for the first three intervals is 8.8 + 33.3 + 17.5 = 59.6 and we can say that 59.6% of the children in the data set have a weight of 39.5 lb or less. Or, as another example, 96.4% of children weight 69.5 lb or less. The cumulative relative frequency can be presented graphically. This type of curve is called a cumulative frequency graph or OGIVE. To construct such a graph, we place a point representing the cumulative relative frequency and the points are connected with straight lines. The cumulative frequency graph provides a class of impoant statistics known as percentiles or percentile scores. For example, the 90th percentile is the numerical value that exceeds 90% of the values in the data set and is exceeded by only 10% of them. As another example, the 80th percentile is that numerical value that exceeds 80% of the values contained in the data set and is exceeded by 20% of them, and so on. The 50th percentile is commonly called the median. Uses of Cumulative frequency graph When two cumulative frequency graph, representing two different data sets, are placed on the same graph, they provide a rapid visual comparison without any need to compare individual intervals. Cumulative frequency graph provides an impoant application in the formation of health norms for the monitoring of physical process (weight and height) of infants and children.",C

Its aim was to provide reliable estimates of birth and death rates at national and state levels.The SRS now covers the entire country.It is a major source of health informationSince the introduction of this system, more reliable information on birth and death rates; age-specific fertility and mortality rates, infant and adult mortality etc. have become available.Sample registration system is a dual-record system consisting of: - (a) Enumerator - continuous enumeration of births and deaths by an enumerator (b) Independent survey - Independent survey every 6 months by an investigator supervisor.Census - It is an important source of health information. It is taken usually at intervals of 10 years.Civil registration system - It is deficient in India.",D
'Boxer's attitude' is seen in person dying of the following condition:,Fear,Poisoning,Burns,Strangulation,"Pugilistic Attitude (boxing, fencing or defence attitude): The posture of a body which has been exposed to great heat is often characteristic. The legs are flexed at the hips and knees, the arms are flexed at elbows and wrists and held out in front of the body, head slightly extended, all fingers are hooked like claws. Contraction of paraspinal muscles often causes a marked opisthotonus, in an attitude commonly adopted by boxers. This stiffening is due to the coagulation of proteins of the muscles and dehydration which cause contraction.

Following is not used in the management of Post dural headache -,Propped up position,Sumatriptan,Hydration,Epidural blood patch,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Propped up position * Supine (recumbent) position and not propped up is recommended for the management of post dural headache.* Post dural puncture headache is due to CSF leak. Typical location is bifrontalor occipital.* Headache gets worsen on sitting or upright posture and is relieved by lying down position and abdominal pressure - The hallmark of postdural puncture headache i.e., association with body position.* The onset of headache is usually 12-72 hours following the procedure, however, it may be seen almost immediately. In most cases it lasts for 7-10 days.* PDPH is believed to result from leakage of CSF from a dural defect and decreased ICT. Loss of CSF at a rate faster that it can be produced causes traction on structure supporting the brain, particularly dura and tentorium. Traction on cranial nerve (particularly 6th nerve) produces diplopia.* Factors that increase the incidence of PDPH are young age, female sex, Pregnancy, large bore needle and multiple punctures. Timing of ambulation has no effect on incidence of PDPH* Use of small bore needle can prevent PDPH.* Intially conservative treatment is given which includes analgesics (NSAIDs), oral or i.v. fluids, Sumatriptan, cosyntropin, caffeine and recumbent position.* If conservative treatment fails, epidural blood patch can be used. It involves injecting 15-20 ml of autologous blood into the epidural space which stop leakage of CSF by coagulation and mass effect.",A
True statements regarding diarrhea in HIV infection include all of the following except:,Diarrhea due to Salmonella has a greater incidence of associated bacteremia and may require chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy.,"The most common parasites associated with diarrhea are Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.","Mycobacterium avium complex may cause diarrhea due to malabsorption, which responds well to treatment.",Cryptosporidium is diagnosed by acid-fast stain of intestinal biopsy or stool specimens; there is no proven effective treatment.,"Diarrhea is a common complaint of HIV - infected patients. A wide variety of pathogens have been described, but frequently no specific pathogen can be found. Routine cultures, ova and parasite examination, and acidfast stains for Cryptosporidium should be obtained, If initial specimens are negative, repeating ova and parasite and Cryptosporidia studies may be useful. Salmonella is more difficult to treat in HIV -infected patients. Enteritis may be accompanied by bacteremia, which may be difficult to eradicate and may require chronic suppressive therapy. The most common parasites described in conjunction with diarrhea and HIV infection are Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium. Effective therapy is available for Giardia and Entamoeba, but no treatment has proven effective for Cryptosporidium.

Triphasic waveforms in hepatic encephalopathy occurs in stage of -,Coma stage-IV,Confusion stage-I,Deep coma stage-V,Drowsiness stage-II,"Hepatic encephalopathy Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by liver disease. As it progresses, delirium is followed by coma. Simple delirium needs to be differentiated from delirium tremens and Wernicke's encephalopathy, and coma from subdural haematoma, which can occur in alcoholics after a fall . Features include changes of intellect, personality, emotions and consciousness, with or without neurological signs. The degree of encephalopathy can be graded from 1 to 4, depending on thesep features, and this is useful in assessing response to therapy . When an episode develops acutely, a precipitating factor may be found . The earliest features are very mild and easily overlooked, but as the condition becomes more severe, apathy, inability to concentrate, delirium, disorientation, drowsiness, slurring of speech and eventually coma develop. Convulsions sometimes occur. Examination usually shows a flapping tremor (asterixis), inability to perform simple mental arithmetic tasks or to draw objects such as a star (constructional apraxia; ), and, as the condition progresses, hyper-reflexia and bilateral extensor plantar responses. Hepatic encephalopathy rarely causes focal neurological signs; if these are present, other causes must be sought. Fetor hepaticus, a sweet musty odour to the breath, is usually present but is more a sign of liver failure and poosystemic shunting than of hepatic encephalopathy. Rarely, chronic hepatic encephalopathy (hepatocerebral degeneration) gives rise to variable combinations of cerebellar dysfunction, Parkinsonian syndromes, spastic paraplegia and dementia. Pathophysiology Hepatic encephalopathy is thought to be due to a disturbance of brain function provoked by circulating neurotoxins that are normally metabolised by the liver. Accordingly, most affected patients have evidence of liver failure and poosystemic shunting of blood, but the balance between these varies from individual to individual. Management The principles are to treat or remove precipitating causes and to suppress the production of neurotoxins by bacteria in the bowel. Dietary protein restriction is rarely needed and is no longer recommended as first-line treatment because it is unpalatable and can lead to a worsening nutritional state in already malnourished patients. Lactulose (15-30 mL 3 times daily) is increased gradually until the bowels are moving twice daily. It produces an osmotic laxative effect, reduces the pH of the colonic content, thereby limiting colonic ammonia absorption, and promotes the incorporation of nitrogen into bacteria. Rifaximin (400 mg 3 times daily) is a well-tolerated, non-absorbed antibiotic that acts by reducing the bacterial content of the bowel and has been shown to be effective. It can be used in addition, or as an alternative, to lactulose if diarrhoea becomes troublesome. Chronic or refractory encephalopathy is one of the main indications for liver transplantation.

Spleen rate is widely used for measuring the endemicity of malaria in a community.b) Average enlarged spleen: A refinement of spleen rate, denoting the average size of spleen.c) Parasite rate: Defined as on the percentage of children between the ages of 2 & 10 yrs showing malarial parsites in their blood films.d) Parasite density index: Average degree of parasitimiae) Infant parasite rate: Percentage of infants showing malarial parasites in their blood films. It is the most sensitive index of recent transmission of malaria in a locality. If the infant parasite rate is zero for three consecutive years in a locality, it is regarded as absence of malaria transmission even though, the Anopheline vectors responsible for previous transmissions may remain.Eradication Eraa) Annual Parasite Incidence (API) = (Confirmed cases during one year / population under surveillance) x 1000.

Which of the following is secondary level of prevention: March 2005,Prophylactic drug administaion,Admitting disabled child in special schools,Vaccination,Cervical pap smear checking,"Ans. D: Cervical pap smear checking The levels of prevention: Primordial prevention is prevention of the emergence/development of the risk factors in countries/population in which they have not yet appeared. e.g. obesity and hypeension prevention Primary prevention methods are used before the person gets the disease. Primary prevention aims to prevent the disease from occurring. So primary prevention reduces both the incidence and prevalence of a disease. Encouraging people to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet rays is an example of primary prevention of skin cancer. Secondary prevention is used after the disease has occurred, but before the person notices that anything is wrong. A doctor checking for suspicious skin growths is an example of secondary prevention of skin cancer. The goal of secondary prevention is to find and treat disease early. In many cases, the disease can be cured. Secondary prevention can be defined as action which halts the progress of a disease at its incipient stage and prevents complications. The specific interventions are early diagnosis (e.g. screening tests, case finding programmes) and adequate treatment. Teiary prevention targets the person who already has symptoms of the disease The goals of teiary prevention are: Prevent damage and pain from the disease - Slow down the disease - Prevent the disease from causing other problems (These are called ""complications."") - Give better care to people with the disease - Make people with the disease healthy again and able to do what they used to do Developing better treatments for melanoma is an example of teiary prevention.

Treatment of choice for severe alcoholic hepatitis patient with high discriminatory function test score is ?,Liver transplant,Colchicine,Steroid,Anti-TNF alfa agents,"Management Cessation of alcohol consumption is the single most impoant treatment and prognostic factor. Life-long abstinence is the best advice. General health and life expectancy are improved when this occurs, irrespective of the stage of liver disease. Abstinence is even effective at preventing progression, hepatic decompensation and death once cirrhosis is present. In the acute presentation of ALD it is impoant to identify and anticipate alcohol withdrawal and Wernicke's encephalopathy, which need treating in parallel with the liver disease and any complications of cirrhosis. Nutrition Good nutrition is very impoant, and enteral feeding a fine-bore nasogastric tube may be needed in severely ill patients. Drug therapy The optimum treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey's discriminative score >32) has been debated for some time. The STOPAH study was a large, multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial to evaluate the relative merits of glucocoicoids and/or a weak anti-TNF agent (pentoxifylline), alone or in combination. In a coho of 1103 patients, no significant benefit from pentoxifylline treatment was identified but treatment with prednisolone (40 mg daily for 28 days) led to a modest reduction in sho-term moality, from 17% in placebo-treated patients to 14% in the prednisolone group. These findings were consistent with earlier studies where an improvement in 28-day survival from 52% to 78% is seen when glucocoicoids are given to those with a Glasgow score of more than 9. Neither glucocoicoids nor pentoxifylline improved survival at 90 days or 1 year, however. Sepsis is the main side-effect of glucocoicoids, and existing sepsis and variceal haemorrhage are the main contraindications to their use. If the bilirubin has not fallen 7 days after staing glucocoicoids, the drugs are unlikely to reduce moality and should be stopped. Liver transplantation The role of liver transplantation in the management of ALD remains controversial. In many centres, ALD is a common indication for liver transplantation. The challenge is to identify patients with an unacceptable risk of returning to harmful alcohol consumption. Many programmes require a 6-month period of abstinence from alcohol before a patient is considered for transplantation. Although this relates poorly to the incidence of alcohol relapse after transplantation, liver function may improve to the extent that transplantation is no longer necessary. The outcome of transplantation for ALD is good and if the patient remains abstinent there is no risk of disease recurrence. Transplantation for alcoholic hepatitis has been thought to have a poorer outcome and is seldom performed due to concerns about recidivism; studies to quantify this are ongoing.

"For Pure motor hemiparesis involving face, arm, and leg select the site of the lesion of cerebrovascular disease,",Internal carotid aery,Middle cerebral aery,Midbasilar aery,"Penetrating branch, middle cerebral aery","Sudden, painless monocular blindness is a sign of carotid disease. The symptom is also called amaurosis fugax . The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral aery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral aery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar aery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar aery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral aeries, the basilar aery, and the paired posterior cerebral aeries. The basilar aery divides into two posterior cerebral aeries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar aery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral aery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral aery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct).",D

Hyperostosis is associated with all except -,Hypothyroidism,VitA intoxication,Cushings syndrome,Radiation osteoma,"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a common disorder, affecting 10% of men and 8% of women over the age of 65, and is associated with obesity, hypeension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is characterised by florid new bone formation along the anterolateral aspect of at least four contiguous veebral bodies . DISH is distinguished from lumbar spondylosis by the absence of disc space narrowing and marginal veebral body sclerosis, and from ankylosing spondylitis by the absence of sacroiliitis or apophyseal joint fusion. The exact cause is unknown. Mechanical, dietary factors and use of some medications ( vit A derivatives) may be of significance. There is a correlation between these factors but not a cause or effect. The distinctive radiological feature of DISH is the continuous linear calcification along the antero-medial aspect of the thoracic spine. DISH is usually found in people in their 60s and above, and is extremely rare in people in their 30s and 40s. The disease can spread to any joint of the body, affecting the neck, shoulders, ribs, hips, pelvis, knees, ankles, and hands. Although DISH manifests in a similar manner to Ankylosing spondylitis , they are separate diseases. Ankylosing spondylitis is a genetic disease with identifiable marks, tends to sta showing signs in adolescence or young adulthood, is more likely to affect the lumbar spine, and affects organs. DISH has no indication of a genetic link, and does not affect organs other than the lungs, which is only indirect due to the fusion of the rib cage.

Third nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia suggests which of the following area of involvement?,Internal Capsule,Brainstem nucleus,Cavernous sinus,Diabetic Neuropathy,"Third-nerve palsy can result from a lesion anywhere along its anatomic path, which begins in the brainstem nucleus, continues within the subarachnoid space, traverses the cavernous sinus, and terminates within the orbit. Contralateral hemiplegia suggests brainstem involvement. Impoant: Contralateral hemiplegia suggests brainstem involvement. In cases of isolated oculomotor palsy, the subarachnoid space is the most likely site of pathology. The differential includes a posterior communicating aery aneurysm, uncal herniation, compressive neoplasms, inflammatory lesions, or trauma. Causes for third-nerve palsy within the cavernous sinus include neoplasms, carotid aery aneurysm, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and carotid-cavernous fistula. Orbital lesions causing third-nerve palsies may be due to inflammation, trauma, neoplasms, and mucoceles. Isolated third-nerve palsy is common with diabetic or hypeensive disease, likely due to microvascular ischemia. In this situation, the palsy rarely affects the pupil, and may be extremely painful.

A cover slip is placed over this and a drop of Florence solution (Potassium iodide, iodine and water) is allowed to run under the cover slip. If semen is present dark brown crystals of choline iodide appear immediately. They are rhombic or needle shaped crystals resembling haemin but are larger and arranged in clusters, rosettes, crosses etc. Choline originates from the seminal vesicles. Positive test is not a proof of seminal fluid, but only the presence of some vegetable or animal substance. A negative reaction is a proof that the stain is not seminal.",A

Index of duration of malnutrition is -,Weight for height,Height for age,Weight for age,None,"<p> Malnutrition: Defined as a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. It comprises: Undernutrition, Overnitrition, Imbalance and Specific deficiency. Main victims are children under 15 years. Children under 5 years are hit the hardest. Malnutrition in India is mainly attributed to kwashiorkar, marasmus, xerophthalmia, nutritional anemia and endemic goitre. Iron deficiency anemia is the most widespread micronutrient deficiency affecting all age groups in India. The effects are direct and indirect. Direct effects are occurence of frank and subclinical nutrition deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkar, marasmus, vitamin and mineral deficiency. Indirect effects are a high morbidity and moality among young children retarded physical and mental growth. Malnutrition predisposes to infection and infection to malnutrition. Waterlow&;s classification of PEM: It defines two groups- 1. Malnutrition with a retarded growth, in which a drop in height/age ratio points to a chronic condition - shoness/stunting. It is an index of duration of malnutrition 2. Malnutrition with a low weight fir a normal height, in ehich the weight for height ratio is indicative of acute condition of rapid weight loss/ wasting . It is an index of severity of malnutrition. Classification of grades of PEM is given by ICMR. IAP Classification of malnutrition: Based on % of ideal weight expected for the age. 1. Normal : >80% 2.

Rupture of a berry aneurysm of the Circle of Willis would likely produce hemorrhage into the,Epidural space,Cerebellum,Subarachnoid space,Subdural space,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage is much less common than hypeensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and most often it results from rupture of a berry aneurysm. Berry aneurysms are saccular aneurysms that result from congenital defects in the media of aeries. They are typically located at the bifurcations of aeries. They are not the result of atherosclerosis. Instead, berry aneurysms are called congenital, although the aneurysm itself is not present at bih. Berry aneurysms are most commonly found in the circle of Willis, typically either at the junction of the anterior communicating aery with the anterior cerebral aery or at the junction of the middle cerebral aery and the posterior communicating aery. The chance of rupture of berry aneurysms increases with age (rupture is rare in childhood). Rupture causes marked bleeding into the subarachnoid space and produces severe headaches, typically described as the ""worst headache ever."" Additional symptoms include vomiting, pain and stiffness of the neck (due to meningeal irritation caused by the blood), and papilledema. Death may follow rapidly.

A: 1 day before and 4 days after appearance of rash Chickenpox/ varicella is a highly infectious disease that spreads from person to person by direct contact or by air from an infected person's coughing or sneezing. Touching the fluid blister can also spread the disease. A person with chickenpox is infectious from 1-2 days before the rash appears. The contagious period continues until all blisters have formed scabs, which is about 4 to 5 days after the rash. After the spots have scabbed over, the sufferer is still highly contagious, from 10 to 21 days, meaning they can still spread the virus through close contact, breathing, and even sleeping in someone's bed. It takes from 10 to 21 days after contact with an infected person for someone to develop chickenpox.",A

It is a manifestation of excessive prolifespindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin, it is more a consequence of disordered cytokine regulation of cell growth than a true cancer. Generally speaking the tumor respects tissue planes and is rarely invasive. Disseminated K.S. is believed to be d/t occurence of multiple neoplasm all over the body rather than to metastasis.o Though K.S. is an oppurtunistic ds in HIV-infected individuals but unlike opportunistic infection, its oecurance is not strictly related to the level of depression of CD4+T cells counts. It may be seen at any stage of HIVinf. even in the presence of normal CD4+T cell count.o Human Herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is universally present in all froms of KS (in all the 4 types)o In constrast to most maligancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen early in K.S. and is of no clinical significance.",B

The number of girls a woman would bear if she passes through her reproductive age with the same feility rate gives: March 2009,Total feility rate,Feility rate,Gross reproductive rate,Net reproductive rate,"Ans. C: Gross reproductive rate The net reproduction rate (NRR) measures the effective feility in a population, taking account not only of bihs but also of the fact that not all women born will survive to their own reproductive years. The NRR is the average number of daughters of reproductive age that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the prevailing age-specific rates of feility and if her daughters experienced the prevailing rates of moality. The gross reproduction rate (GRR) for a paicular year is the average number of daughters that a woman would have if she experienced over her lifetime the age-specific feility rates of that year. In that it refers only to the number of daughters born to women, not the total number of children, it is a special case of the (period) total feility rate; in most circumstances (unless the sex ratio at bih is highly unequal) the GRR equals roughly half the TFR. The general feility rate is similar to the crude bih rate except that it uses a more restricted denominator, the female population of childbearing age, ages 15 to 49. Age-specific feility rates (also called age-specific bih rates) are similar to the crude bih rate but are calculated for specific age groups of women of childbearing age. The range of childbearing ages is conventionally considered to be ages 15 to 49 (sometimes 15 to 44 is used), and a full set of age-specific feility rates would span this interval-usually either in single-year age groups or, more commonly, in five-year groups: 15 to 19, 20 to 24, ..., 45 to 49. Marital feility rates can be calculated either for the full range of reproductive ages (15 to 49 or 15 to 44) or as age-specific rates. The numerator is usually taken as the total number of live-bihs to women in the specified age range, regardless of the marital status of the mother; the denominator is the number of currently married women in the specified age range The total feility rate (TFR) at a given time (technically referred to as the period total feility rate) is the average number of children a woman would bear in her life if she experienced the age-specific feility rates prevailing at that time.",C

False about case fatality rate: March 2011,Represents the killing power of disease,Denominator is mid-year population,Indicates virulence power of causative agent,Not much useful for chronic diseases,"Ans. B: Denominator is mid-year population Case fatality rate= Total number of deaths due to a disease X 100/ Total number of cases due to that disease Case fatality/Fatality rate: It is the ratio of deaths within a designated population of people with a paicular condition, over a ceain period of time. An example of a fatality rate would be 9 deaths per 10,000 people at risk per year. This means that within a given year, out of 10,000 people formally diagnosed with a disease, 9 died. Rabies, if contracted by an unvaccinated individual who does not seek prophylactic treatment, is also an extremely deadly virus, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Moality rate: It is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit time. Moality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a moality rate of 9.5 in a population of 100,000 would mean 950 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from morbidity rate, which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence rate) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time (incidence rate). The term ""moality"" is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group. This disease moality statistic is more precisely referred to as ""case fatality"". One Distinguishes: The crude death rate, the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people. The perinatal moality rate, the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths (stillbihs) per 1000 bihs. The maternal moality ratio, the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live bihs in same time period. The maternal moality rate, the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15-44 years of age). The infant moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live bihs. The child moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live bihs. The standardized moality rate (SMR)- This represents a propoional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender, etc. The age specific moality rate (ASMR) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age.",B

Treatment of sever ulnar neuritis in borderline tuberculoid leprosy is -,MDT only,MDT + steroid,Wait and watch,MDT + thalidomide,"Lepra reaction During the course of leprosy, immunologically mediated episodes of acute or subacute inflammation known as reactions may occur. Because peripheral nerve trunks are often involved, unless reactions are promptly and adequately treated, such episodes can result in permanent deformities. Type 1 (Reversal Reaction) 1. Delayed hypersensitivity. 2. Occurs in both PB and MB cases in unstable types like BT.BB.BL. 3. Skin lesions suddenly become reddish, swollen, warm, painful, and tender. New lesions may appear. 4. Nerves close to skin may be enlarged, tender.and painful (neuritis) with loss of its functions (loss of sensation and muscle weakness) which may appear suddenly. 5. Other organs - not affected. 6. General symptoms - not common. Treatment of Lepra reactions (moderate to severe cases) It includes bed rest, rest to affected nerves by splint, analgesics, prednisolone. Each case of reaction should be assessed for his/her fitness to put on prednisolone as per check list given above Prednisolone tablets issued must be entered in 'Prednisolone card'. Tapering of prednisolone may be done according to its response. Patient must be instructed on salt restriction, no prednisolone intake on empty stomach and repoing adverse effects/symptoms immediately. Adding Clofazimine for Type II reaction may be extremely useful for reducing or withdrawing coicosteroids in patients who have become dependent on them. Total duration of Clofazimine therapy should not exceed 12 months. If a patient develops lepra reaction during the treatment, do not stop MDT (rather complete the course of MDT). Lepra reactions, which occur after completion of treatment, should also be managed as mentioned earlier. MDT should not be restaed for such cases. Response to treatment should be monitored and assessed, including check on adverse effects of prednisolone. Before staing the steroid treatment, the patient should be asked questions about epigestric pain and diarrhoea, with or without blood and or mucous; and examined for fungal infection, scabies, and worm infestations, as all these conditions may be made worse by steroids. Treatment of all these conditions can be staed at the same time as steroids are staed. Before staing the steroid treatment the patient should be explained the reason for treatment; the duration of the treatment; impoance of taking daily dose and that the treatment should not be stopped suddenly (the dosage is decreased gradually) and impoance of completing the full course of treatment; and possible side-effects.

Methods of contraceptions during lactations are all except -,Breast feeding,IUD,OCPs,Minipills,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., OCPs Contraception during lactation Preferred methods of contraception during breast feeding are those that do not interfere with lactation. Methods are : 1. Lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) The probability of pregnancy is very small for first 6-8 months after pregnancy, if the mother is fully breast-feeding her infant, is still amenorrhoeic and the child does not receive additional food. Under these conditions there is only 2% chance of pregnancy. So breast - feeding is a very impoant and efficient contraceptive method during early puerperium - Reffered to as lactation amenorrhea method. 2. Alternative methods Barrier methods, IUD and progesteron only hormonal methods (minipills, implants, injectables) are the primary contraceptive alternatives during breast feeding. They have no adverse effects on lactation, the condition of the infant or maternal ovarian function. Sterilization is only a good alternative only if the family wants a permanent method of contraception.

What is the Median survival time in cardiac amyloidosis?,1-3 months,3-6 months,6-12months,12-18months,"ANSWER: (C) 6-12 monthsREF: Harrison's 18th ed ch: 238Once heart failure develops, the median survival is 6-12 months in primary amyloidosisAmyloidosis is the major cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, most often due to ""primary amyloidosis"". Amyloidosis secondary to other chronic diseases rarely involves the heart. Only 5% of patients of primary amyloidosis survive beyond 10 yearsPresentation: Amyloid fibrils infiltrate the myocardium, especially around the conduction system and coronary vessels. Typical clinical features are conduction block, autonomic neuropathy, renal involvement, and occasionally thickened skin lesions. Cardiac amyloid is suspected from thickened ventricular walls in conjunction with an electrocardiogram that shows low voltage. A characteristic refractile brightness in the septum on echocardiography is suggestive, but neither sensitive nor specific. Both atria are dilated, often dramatically so.Diagnosis: The diagnosis of primary or familial can be made from biopsies of an abdominal fat pad or the rectum, but cardiac amyloidosis is most reliably identified from the myocardium Therapy: Therapy is largely symptomaticDiuretics are used as needed to treat fluid retention, which often requires high doses.Digoxin bound to the amyloid fibrils can reach toxic levels, and should therefore be used only in very low doses, if at all. There is no evidence regarding use of neurohormonal antagonists in amyloid heart disease, where the possible theoretical benefit has to be balanced against their potential side effects in light of frequent autonomic neuropathy and dependence on heart rate reserve.The risk of intracardiac thrombi may warrant chronic anticoagulation. Once heart failure develops, the median survival is 6-12 months in primary amyloidosis. Multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy {prednisone, melphalan, bortezomib), the extent of which is usually limited by the potential of worsening cardiac dysfunction.Colchicine can be of some benefit in inflammation-associated (AA) amyloid. Transthyretin-associated cardiac amyloid requires heart and liver transplantation, while senile cardiac amyloid is treated with conventional heart failure regimens.Immunoglobulin associated amyloid has occasionally been treated with sequential heart transplantation and delayed bone marrow transplant, with frequent recurrence of amyloid in the transplanted heart.Poor prognostic factors in cardiac amyloidosis:Congestive heart failureSyncopeComplex arrhythmiaDegree of left ventricular hypertrophy (More=worse prognosis)Low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)Restrictive hemodynamic.Right ventricular dilatationPulmonary hypertensionLow voltage on ECGHigh brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)High troponinT1 kinetics on gadolinium-enhanced MRI (to demonstrate extent of myocardial involvement)",C

All of the following hea sounds are heard in chronic mitral stenosis except?,Mid diastolic murmur,Third hea sound,Opening snap,Loud S I,"Ans. B. Third hea sound. Clinical Findings in Mitral Stenosis Upon auscultation of an individual with mitral stenosis, the first hea sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first hea sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid hea valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It may be the most prominent sign. If pulmonary hypeension secondary to mitral stenosis is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) component of the second hea sound (S2) will become loud. An opening snap that is a high-pitch additional sound may be heard after the A2 (aoic) component of the second hea sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve. A mid-diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation will be heard after the opening snap.The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope.Its duration increases with worsening disease.Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur. A thrill might be present when palpating at the apical region of the precordium.",B

Hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia are seen in.,CRF,Pseudobypoparathyoidsm,Vit-D deficiency,Vit-D deficiency,"<p>Improved medical management of chronic kidney disease now allows many patients to survive for decades and hence time enough to develop features of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid additional morbidity. Impaired production of 1,25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)</p>",A

Hepatitis B can transmitted through all of the following routes EXCEPT:,Milk,Semen,Stool,Blood,"However universal precaution is not needed for breast milk (no occupational hazard), Human breast milk has been implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV, and HBsAg has been found in the milk of mothers infected with HBV (REF: JAMA 1988; 259:1353-6. Lifson AR, Bond WW, Petersen NJ, Gravelle CR, Favero MS. Hepatitis B virus in peritoneal dialysis fluid: A potential hazard. Dialysis and Transplantation 1982; 11:592-600.)

Under universal precautions, blood and ceain body fluids of all patients are considered potentially infectious for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other bloodborne pathogens. BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS APPLY: *Universal precautions apply to blood and to other body fluids containing visible blood. *Blood is the single most impoant source of HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens in the occupational setting *Universal precautions also apply to tissues and to the following fluids: semen and vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), synol fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid. BODY FLUIDS TO WHICH UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS DO NOT APPLY: *Universal precautions do not apply to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, and vomitus unless they contain visible blood *The risk of transmission of HIV and HBV from these fluids and materials is extremely low or nonexistent. *Human breast milk has been implicated in perinatal transmission of HIV, and HBsAg has been found in the milk of mothers infected with HBV (10, 13). However, occupational exposure to human breast milk has not been implicated in the transmission of HIV nor HBV infection to health-care workers. *Whereas universal precautions do not apply to human breast milk, gloves may be worn by health-care workers in situations where exposures to breast milk might be frequent, for example, in breast milk banking. * Universal precautions do not apply to saliva. Saliva of some persons infected with HBV has been shown to contain HBV-DNA at concentrations 1/1,000 to 1/10,000 of that found in the infected person's serum.

An investigator obtained an increased incidence of a disease due to low fibre diet in a country by obtaining data from the health authorities and food industry of the country. This type of study is called:,Ecological,Cross-sectional,Psephological,Experimental,"Ecologic study: The analysis is at the level of an entire population rather than at the level of individual persons. The presence of a suspected risk factor can be measured in different populations and compared with the incidence of a paicular disease. Another name for this type of investigation is correlation study, because it seeks to determine the extent to which two characteristics (risk factor and disease occurrence) are related. Cross-sectional studies analyze data collected on a group of subjects at one time rather than over a period of time. Studies with interventions are called experimental or clinical trials.

"In a slow sand filter ,the element responsible for yielding bacteria freewater is the",Valve,Vital layer,Supernatant water,Under drainage system,"SLOW SAND OR BIOLOGICAL FILTERS Slow sand filters were first used for water treatment in 1804 in Scotland and subsequently in London. During the 19th century their use spread throughout the world. Even today, they are generally accepted as the standard method of water purification. Elements of a slow sand filter Essentially these consists of : (1) supernatant (raw) water (2) a bed of graded sand (3) an under-drainage system; and (4) a system of filter control valves. Vital layer : When the filter is newly laid, it acts merely as a mechanical strainer, and cannot truly be considered as ""biological"". But very soon, the surface of the sand bed gets covered with a slimy growth known as ""Schmutzdecke"", vital layer, zoogleal layer or biological layer. This layer is slimy and gelatinous and consists of threadlike algae and numerous forms of life including plankton, diatoms and bacteria. The formation of vital layer is known as ""ripening"" of the filter. It may take several days for the vital layer to form fully, and when fully formed it extends for 2 to 3 cm into the top poion of the sand bed. The vital layer is the ""hea"" of the slow sand filter. It removes organic matter, holds back bacteria and oxidizes ammoniacal nitrogen into nitrates and helps in yielding a bacteria-free water. Until the vital layer is fully formed, the first few days filtrate is usually run to waste. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 751",B

For exmaple underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.Necrophilia:* In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies.* It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell, and coldness act as stimulants.* Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",C

Alcoholic says that he drinks to overcome family problem - defense mechanism -,Rationalization,Anticipation,Denial,Repression,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Rationalization o Logical and socially acceptable explanation for an unacceptable behavior or feeling is rationalization Important Defence mechanisms1) Denial: - Denial is the avoidance of awareness of some painful aspect of reality by negating sensory data. Person is unable to face reality or admit an obvious truth (i.e., He is in denial). Denial is an outright refusal to admit or recognize that something has occured or is currently occuring. For example, denying that the physicians's diagnosis of cancer is correct and seeking a second opinion.2) Repression and suppression:- Repression acts unconsciously to exclude anxiety provoking ideas or feelings from conscious awareness. For example, a person who has repressed memories of abuse suffered as a child. When this is done consciously by forcing the unwanted information out of our awareness, it is referred as suppression, i.e., pushing the unwanted feelings into unconscious. For example, trying to forget something that causes anxiety. Suppression is the only voluntary defence mechanism.o Unconscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Repressiono Conscious exclusion of anxiety provoking feelings from awareness - Suppressiono Repression is the most basic defence mechanism therefore it is also referred as primary defence.3) Displacement:- Unconscious shifting of impulses on a less threatening target. For example, rather than express our anger in way's that could lead to negative consequences (like arguing with our boss), we instead express our anger towards a person or object that poses no threat (such as our spouse, children or pets).4) Sublimation:- Acting out unacceptabe impulses in a socially acceptable way. For example, sublimating your aggressive impulses toward a carrier as a boxer, or becoming a surgeon because of your desire to cut or lifting weight to release 'pent up' energy.5) Projection:- Placing unacceptable impulses in ourself onto someone else. In very simple language, Projection is placing blame for the unwanted event upon other. For example, would be saying that you failed in exam because the teacher is racist.6) Intellectualization:- Excessive use of intellectual processes (logic) to avoid affective expression (emotion), i.e., avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects. For example, a person who has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness might focus on learning everything about the disease in order to avoid distress and remain distant from the reality of the situation.7) Rationalization:- It is a defense mechanism that involves offering a socially acceptable behavior or feeling. For example, a student might blame a poor exam score on the instructor rather than his/her lack of preparation.8) Regression:- The personality may suffer a loss of some of the development already attained and may revert to a lower level of adaptation and expression. When confronted by stressful events, people sometimes abandon coping strategies and revert to patterns of behaviour used earlier in development. For example, sitting in a comer and crying after hearing bad news or throwing temper tantrum when you dont get your way or a teenager sucking their thumb around exam time.9) Reaction formation:- Transforming an unacceptable impulse into opposite extreme. For, example, a married woman who is disturbed by feeling attracted to one of her huband's friends treats him rudely.10. Active out:-The individuals copes with stress by engaging in actions rather then reflecting upon internal feeling.11. Altruism:- Satisfying internal needs through helping others.12. Undoing:- An act or communication which partially negates a previous one. For example, two close friends have a violent argument; when they next meet one of them brings the other a small gift.13. Passive-aggresstion:-Indirectly expressing anger towards other. These people have a tendency of expressing their anger or frustration in a silent way, instead of expressing it directly. For example, a reluctant child forced to bring sugar from shop spills it on the way.14. Aim inhibition:- The individual accepts a modified form of their original goal. For example, becomming a high school basketball coach rather than a professional athelete.15. Anticipation:- Realistic thinking and planning about future's unpleasurable events.16.

A 65-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for the last 8 years dies in a hospital She had no other significant medical history. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her death?,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Myocardial infarction,Renal failure,Stroke,"Despite all the treatments now available, the outcome for patients with diabetes remains disappointing. Longterm complications of diabetes still cause significant morbidity and moality (Boxes 21.31 and 21.32). Excess moality in diabetes is caused mainly by large blood vessel disease, paicularly myocardial infarction and stroke. Macrovascular disease also causes substantial morbidity from myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, cardiac failure and intermittent claudication. The pathological changes of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients are similar to those in the non-diabetic population but occur earlier in life and are more extensive and severe. Diabetes amplifies the effects of the other major cardiovascular risk factors: smoking, hypeension and dyslipidaemia (Fig. 21.11). Moreover, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors, which co-segregate with insulin resistance in the metabolic syndrome (p. 805). Disease of small blood vessels is a specific complication of diabetes and is termed diabetic microangiopathy. It contributes to moality through renal failure caused by diabetic nephropathy, and is responsible for substantial morbidity and disability: for example, blindness from diabetic retinopathy, difficulty in walking, chronic ulceration of the feet from peripheral neuropathy, and bowel and bladder dysfunction from autonomic neuropathy. The risk of microvascular disease is positively correlated with the duration and degree of sustained hyperglycaemia, however caused and at whatever age it develops.

"A family suffering a hereditary form of severe emphysema, with some family members also showing hepatic disease. Liver biopsy in one of the family members demonstrates increased reactivity with antibodies directed against a-1-antitrypsin. Serum levels of the enzyme are low, leading to increased activity of a number of serine proteases. Increased activity of which of the following serine proteases has been most closely tied to the emphysema that develops in these patients?",Chymotrypsin,Elastase,Plasmin,Thrombin,"The autosomal recessive disease is a-1-antitrypsin deficiency, in which an abnormal form of a-1-antitrypsin can be produced by, but not released from, liver cells. This enzyme was named when it was found in vivo to function as a good inhibitor of the pancreatic protease trypsin. However, it actually inactivates a wide variety of enzymes with protease activity that have an essential serine residue in the catalytic centers. Examples of these serine proteases include all of the question choices, and additionally, cathepsin G and plasminogen. Surprisingly, a-1-antitrypsin disease specifically targets only the liver and the lungs. The liver disease, which can be mild to life-threatening (either due to cirrhosis or, rarely, massive acute hepatic failure), is related to retained a-1-antitrypsin with residual enzymatic activity. The lung disease seems to be the specific result of an inability to turn off elastase produced by neutrophils during lung infections. Neutrophil elastase is one of the few enzymes that can successfully destroy the heavily cross-linked, insoluble, elastin that is presented in the lung interstitium and contributes to its elasticity. With destruction of this lattice-like elastic tissue suppo structure, emphysema can develop in the lungs. Chymotrypsin is a pancreatic enzyme formed in the intestinal lumen that cleaves aromatic aminoacyl bonds. Plasmin is an enzyme in the blood-clotting cascade. Thrombin is an enzyme in the blood-clotting cascade.",B

Live attenuated mumps vaccine strains used only on a limited scale include the Hoshino, Torii and NKM-46 strains. The WHO recommends that the Rubini mumps vaccine strain should not be used in national immunization programmes because of its demonstrated low effectiveness. A single dose (0-5 ml) intramuscularly produces detectable antibodies in 95% of vaccines. The duration of long-term immunity is not known. It is recommended for routine immunization for children over 1 year of age, either alone or in combination with other virus vaccines, e.g. in MMR vaccine or as a quadrivalent vaccine with varicella. A second dose is recommended for children at 4-6 years of age i.e., before staing the school. The current mumps strain (Jeryl Lynm) has the lowest associated incidence of post vaccine aseptic meningitis (from 1 in 150,000 to 1 in 1.8 million).

Which of the following is the best next step in management?,Await results of T4 and TSH.,Obtain T4 and TSH; begin intravenous thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid.,Begin rapid rewarming.,Obtain CT scan of the head.,"The clinical picture strongly suggests myxedema coma. Unprovoked hypothermia is a particularly important sign. Myxedema coma constitutes a medical emergency; treatment should be started immediately. Should laboratory results fail to support the diagnosis, treatment can be stopped. An intravenous bolus of levothyroxine is given (200-500 mg loading dose), followed by daily intravenous doses (50-100 mg). If high doses are used, the patient should be carefully monitored for cardiac arrhythmias. Impaired adrenal reserve may accompany myxedema coma, so parenteral hydrocortisone is given concomitantly. Intravenous fluids are also needed but are less important than thyroxine and glucocorticoids; rewarming should be accomplished slowly, so as not to precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. If alveolar ventilation is compromised, then intubation may also be necessary. Hyponatremia and an elevated PCO2 are laboratory markers of severe myxedema.

TB antigen -,ESAT-6,ESAT-7,CF-11,CF-12,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., ESAT-6 o Interferon-yam mu release assays (IGRAs! are diasnostic tools for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).o They are surrogate markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and indicate a cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis.o IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB. which is a microbiological diagnosis. A positive 1GR.4 result may not necessarily indicate active TB. and a negative IGRA result may not ride out active TB .o Because IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status, IGRAs are useful for evaluation ofL TBI in BCG-vaccinated individuals, particularly in settings where BCG vaccination is administered after infancy or multiple (booster) BCG vaccinations are given.Assay antigenso M. tuberculosis-specific antigens include :-# Early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and# Culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10).o These are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) segment of the M. tuberculosis genome.o They are more specific for M. tuberculosis than purified protein derivative (PPD) because they are not shared with any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM other than M. marinum, M kansasii, M. szulgai, and M. flavescens.Types of assayso Two IGRAs are available in many countries :-The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, which has replaced the second-generation Quantiferon- TB Gold (QFT-G) assay, and the T-SPOT.TB assay.o The QFT-GIT assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based, whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens i.e.,ESAT-6CFP-10, andTB 7.7) in an in-tube formato The result is reported as quantification of interferon (IFN)-gamma in international units (IU) per mL.o A newer assay, the QuantiFEROM-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), became available in 2015.This test is available in Europe but not in North America. The QFT-Plus assay has m-o TB antigen tubes, unlike the QFT assay (which has a single TB antigen tube).Sensitivity and specificityo IGRAs have specificity >95 percent for diagnosis oflatent TB infection. The sensitivity for T-SPOT.TB appears to be higher than for QFT-GIT or TST (approximately 90, 80, and 80 percent, respectively) . The higher sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB may be useful for evaluating individuals with immunosuppressive conditions. o TST specificity is high in populations not vaccinated with BCG (97 percent). Among populations where BCG is administered, it is much lower although variable (approximately 60 percent).",A

Interferons in chronic hepatitis B given in -,Early onset,HBV replication,Normal ALT,All the above,"Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology Ref Davidson edition23rd pg872",B

Tentative cuts are seen in: September 2011,Homicidal death,Suicidal death,Accidental death,Hanging,"Ans. B: Suicidal deaths Hesitation cuts derive their name from the hesitation with which these incisions are inflicted by a person intending to commit suicide by a cutting instrument. The preliminary cuts are known as tentative cuts Hesitation cuts are not found in homicidal assaults Hesitation/ tentative wounds They are defined either as: any cut or wound that is self-inflicted after a decision is made not to commit suicide, or any tentative cut or wound that is made before the final cut that causes death. Such wounds are usually superficial, sharp, forced skin cuts found on the body of victims. These less severe cutting marks are often caused by attempts to build up courage before attempting the final, fatal wound. Non-fatal, shallow hesitation wounds can also accompany the deeper, sometimes fatal incisions. Although hesitation cuts are not always present in cases of suicide, they are typical of suicidal injuries. However, the presence of hesitation marks alongside or near to the final fatal mark usually indicates a forensic diagnosis of suicide over other possible causes of death. Hesitation wounds are generally straight-line marks at the elbows, neck/throat, and wrists, although in a few cases they occur in the general area of the upper middle pa of the abdomen (near the hea). Wounds made by people attempting suicide are typically made at an angle related to the hand that holds the weapon. The angle of such hesitation wounds is usually in a downward flowing direction because of the natural motion of the arm as it sweeps across the body. Hesitation wounds are often made under clothing, with paicular pas of the clothing being paed to expose the target area of the body. Instruments used to inflict hesitation wounds are generally those found around the living quaers of the person attempting suicide. Such instruments include kitchen knives, single-edge and double-edge knifes, pocket knives, hatchets, razor blades, screwdrivers, and other sharp objects. People who have previously attempted suicide, but have not succeeded in their endeavor, will often carry visible scars from hesitation wounds.",B

False rejection of a true null hypothesis is due to?,Type II error,Type I error,Beta error,Error of second kind,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Type I error Statistical errors Statistical errors are used to describe possible errors made in statistical decision. Before reading about the types of error you must know null hypothesis because these tests are related to null hypothesis. Null hypothesis says - Any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance and not significant that means there is no variation (difference) exists between variables. Null hypothesis testing (e.g., in Chisquare test) is used to make a decision about whether : - i) The data contradict the null hypothesis - That means there is true difference (which is significant) between variables and it is not due to chance. Or ii) The data approve the null hypothesis There is no difference between variables and the difference you see is due to chance. Now see types of error :? There are two basic type of statistical errors : ? Type I error Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true - False rejection of null hypothesis. That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words ""we observe a difference when it is not true"" - false positive. One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. Probability of type-I error is given by 'P-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or A-error or false negative. This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one - False negative. An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",B

Bone pearl appearance is seen in ?,Electrical burns,Hydrocution,Strangulation,Throttling,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Electrical burns Electric burns Electric burns are at times, also referred to as joule burns. Technically, joule burn is an endogenous burn, i.e. burns produced due to release of heat from the body, on application of electric current. Electric burns may be of following types :? 1) Contact burns : Due to contact with live wire. 2) Spark burns : Due to sparking of current, e.g. in loose electrical fitting. 3) Flash burns : Caused on being near the main power line, without actual contact. Burns result due to arcing of current from these lines. Characteristic features of electric burns are :? 1) There may be holes in clothes or shoes. 2) There is a wound of entry and wound of exit of electric current :- Entry wound : It is non-bleeding, thick, leathery, greyish white, depressed, hard and cauliflower like, known as crater formation. High voltage current may cause burns over large areas of skin, i.e. crocodile skin lesions. The skin may get coloured due to metallic pigment : green (in brass electrode), black (in iron electrode), blue (in copper electrode) and grey (in aluminium electrode). Exit wound : It is like a laceration and is bleeding. 3) Metals from electrode may melt and as small balls (current pearls) may be carried to tissue. Calcium phosphate of bones may also melt and is radiologically seen as bone pearls (wax dripping). 4) Muscles show Zenker's degeneration. Causes of death Commonest cause of death is ventricular fibrillation. Other causes include shock, cardiopulmonary arrest, cerebral anoxia, paralysis of respiratory muscles, and mechanical injuries due to fall.",A

Significant reductions of the glomerular filtration rate reduce the elimination of digoxin and, therefore, may prolong digoxin's effect, allowing it to accumulate to toxic levels, unless the dose is reduced.> DIGITALIS INTOXICATION: This is a serious and potentially fatal complication. Advanced age, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypoxemia, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, and acute myocardial infarction all may reduce tolerance to digitalis. Chronic digitalis intoxication may be insidious in onset and is characterized by anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, exacerbations of HF, weight loss, cachexia, neuralgias, gynecomastia, yellow vision, and delirium. The most frequent disturbances of cardiac rhythm are ventricular premature beats, bigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, and, rarely, ventricular fibrillation. Atrioventricular block and nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with variable atrioventricular block are characteristic of digitalis intoxication; withdrawal of the drug and treatment with li-adrenocepior blocker or lidocaine are indicated. If hypokalemia is present, potassium should be administered cautiously by the oral route. Fab fragments of purified, intact digitalis antibodies are a potentially lifesaving approach to the treatment of severe intoxication.> The administration of quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, and propafenone to patients receiving digoxin raises the serum concentration of the latter, increasing the propensity to digitalis intoxication.> The dose of digitalis should be reduced by half in patients receiving these drugs.",B

Which of teh following statements about recommended daily allowance is false -,The RDA is decided by a panel of expes and is based on scientific research,The RDA caters to the dietry requirement of all people,The RDA is often higher than the recommended minimum requirement,The RDA is based on the estimated average requirement (EAR),"BALANCED DIET A diet may be defined as the kinds of food on which a person or group lives. A balanced diet is defined as one which contains a variety of foods in such quantities and propoions that the need for energy, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, fats, carbohydrate and other nutrients is adequately met for maintaining health, vitality and general well-being and also makes a small provision for extra nutrients to withstand sho duration of leanness. A balanced diet has become an accepted means to safeguard a population from nutritional deficiencies. In constructing balanced diet, the following principles should be borne in mind : (a) First and foremost, the daily requirement of protein should be met. This amounts to 10-15 per cent of the daily energy intake. (b) Next comes the fat requirement, which should be limited to 15-30 per cent of the daily energy intake (c) Carbohydrates rich in natural fibre should constitute the remaining food energy. The dietary pattern varies widely in different pas of the world. It is generally developed around the kinds of food produced (or impoed) depending upon the climatic conditions of the region, economic capacity, religion, customs, taboos, tastes and habits of the people. It takes into account 95-98% of population. Balanced diets formulated by the Indian Council of Medical researchiis given below A nutritional education guide ""The Food Guide Pyramid"" emphasizes foods from the five major food groups shown in the three lower sections of the Pyramid. Each of these food groups provides some, but not all, of the nutrients required. Foods in one group can't replace those in another. No one of these major food groups is more impoant than another for good health, one needs them all. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 636",B

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Parkinsons disease,Progressive supranuclear palsy,Multi infarct dementia,Alzheimers disease,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a degenerative disease that involves the brainstem, basal ganglia, limbic structures and selected areas of coex. Clinically, this disorder begins with falls and executive or subtle personality changes such as mental rigidity, impulsivity, or apathy. A progressive oculomotor syndrome ensues that begins with square wave jerks, followed by slowed saccades (veical worse than horizontal) before resulting in progressive supranuclear ophthalmoparesis. Dysahria, dysphagia, and symmetric axial rigidity can be prominent features that emerge at any point in the illness. A stiff, unstable posture with hyperextension of the neck and a slow, jerky, toppling gait is characteristic. The oculomotor disorder is supranuclear.The dementia overlaps with Fronto temporal dementia, featuring apathy, frontal-executive dysfunction, poor judgment, slowed thought processes, impaired verbal fluency and difficulty with sequential actions and with shifting from one task to another. Response to l-dopa is limited or absent. Death occurs within 5-10 years of onset. Ref: Harrison's Internal Medicine, 18th Edition, Pages 3311, 3317-3326, 3309, 3305",B

The minimum concentration of reduced hemoglobin required for cyanosis is,1gm/dl.,3 gm/d,7 gm/d,5 gm/d,"Cyanosis refers to a bluish colour of the skin and mucous membranes resulting from an increased quantity of reduced hemoglobin, or of hemoglobin derivatives, in the small blood vessels of those areas. It is usually most marked in the lips, nail beds, ears, and malar eminences.
The degree of cyanosis is modified by the colour of the cutaneous pigment and the thickness of the skin, as well as by the state of the cutaneous capillaries.
In some instances, central cyanosis can be detected reliably when the SaO2 has fallen to 85%; in others, particularly in dark-skinned persons, it may not be detected until it has declined to 75%.
The increase in the quantity of reduced hemoglobin in the mucocutaneous vessels that produces cyanosis may be brought about either by an increase in the quantity of venous blood as a result of dilation of the venules and venous ends of the capillaries or by a reduction in the Sa in the capillary blood. In sulhaemoglobmemia cyanosis occurs when its level exceeds 0.5gm/dl A methemogiobm level of 15% (i.e.,1.5gm/dl) 3 is associated with visible cyanosis-Nelson",D

A 63-year-old man becomes oliguric 2 days following an open cholecystectomy. Which of the following findings would suggest that prerenal ARF is a major factor in the etiology?,postural hypotension,fractional excretion of sodium is 3%,specific gravity is 1.012,the urine sodium is 30 mEq/L,"Although evidence of volume contraction cannot confirm prerenal ARF, as this can progress into intrinsic renal failure, it suggests that prerenal factors are contributing. In prerenal ARF, specific gravity is usually > 1.020 and sodium concentration is < 10 mmol/L. The fractional excretion of sodium relates sodium clearance to creatinine clearance and is more sensitive than direct measurements of sodium excretion. In prerenal azotemia, sodium is avidly resorbed from glomerular filtrate, but not in intrinsic renal azotemia because of tubular epithelial cell injury. Creatinine is resorbed less efficiently in both conditions. Therefore, the fractional excretion of sodium is <1% in prerenal azotemia (often much less) whereas it is >1% in intrinsic renal azotemia.

In shock all happens except,Constriction of capacitance vessels,Dilation of aerioles,Decrease in cardiac output,Hea rate decreases,"Shock is a common condition necessitating admission to the ICU or occurring in the course of critical care. Shock is defined by the presence of multisystem end organ hypoperfusion. Clinical indicators include reduced mean aerial pressure (MAP), tachycardia, cool skin and extremities, acute altered mental status, and oliguria. Hypotension is usually, though not always, present. The end result of multiorgan hypoperfusion is tissue hypoxia, oftenclinically manifested by lactic acidosis. Since the MAP is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), reductions in blood pressure can be caused by decreased cardiac output and/or decreased SVR. Accordingly, the initial evaluation of a hypotensive patient should include an assessment of the adequacy of cardiac output; this should be pa of the earliest assessment of the patient by the clinician at the bedside once shock is contemplated . Clinical evidence of diminished cardiac output includes a narrow pulse pressure--a marker that correlates with stroke volume--and cool extremities with delayed capillary refill. Signs of increased cardiac output include a widened pulse pressure (paicularly with a reduced diastolic pressure), warm extremities with bounding pulses, and rapid capillary refill. If a hypotensive patient has clinical signs of increased cardiac output, one can infer that the reduced blood pressure is a result of decreased SVR. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2198",D

It is occasionally transmitted to man by direct or indirect contact with infected animals. There is no evidence of transmission .from man to ratan. Agents - gram negative, non-motile, intracellular coccobacilli. Reservoir of infection - Main reservoirs of human infection are cattle, swine, horses and dogs. - In animals brucella can cause aboion premature expulsion of the fetus or death - Brucella is excreted in urine, milk, placenta and vaginal discharges. Thus brucellosis is predominantly a disease of farmers, shepherds, butchers and abattoir workers & veterinarians. Modes of transmission a. Contact infection (Most common) - direct contact with infected tissues, blood, urine, vaginal discharge, aboed fetuses and especially placenta. b. Food borne infection - ingestion of raw milk or dairy products from infected animals - fresh raw vegetable scan also carry infection if grown on soil containing manure from infected farms. - water contaminated with excreta of infected animals also serves as source of infection. c.

Aedes aegypti index near pos should be less than -,1%,5%,8%,10%,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 1% For the surveillance of Aedes mosquitoes, the WHO uses an index known as Aedes aegypti index. This is a house index and is defined as ""The percentage of houses and their premises, in a limited well-defined area, showing actual breeding of Aedes aegypti larvae"". This index should not be more than 1% in towns and seapos in endeic areas to ensure freedom from yellow fever. International health regulation for yellow fever Measures designed to restrict the spread of yellow fever are specified in the ""International health regulation"" of WHO. These are implemented by the Govt of India through stringent aerial and maritime traffic regulations. Broadly these comprise : - i) Travellers All travellers (including infants) exposed to yellow fever or passing through endemic zones of yellow fever must posses a valid international ceificate fo vaccination against yellow fever before they are allowed to enter yellow fever receptive areas like India. The validity of the ceificate begins 10 days after the date of vaccination and extends up to 10 years. Revaccination performed before the end of the validity of ceicicate renders the ceificate valid for a fuher period of 10 years staing on the day of revaccination. If no such ceificate fo vaccination is available, the travellar is placed on quarantine for 6 days from the date of leaving an infected area. ii) Mosquitoes The aircraft and ships arriving from endemic areas are subjected to aerosol spraying with prescribed insecticides. Airpos and Seapos are kept free from the breeding of insect vectors over an area extending at least 400 metres around their perimeters. The ""aedes aegypti index"" is kept below 1.",A
Hypercalcemia is seen in all except-,Lithium,Multiple myeloma,Loop diuretics,HypervitaminosisD,"biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake.Lithium, used in the management of bipolar depression and other psychiatric disorders, causes hypercalcemia in ~10% of treated patients. The hypercalcemia is dependent on continued lithium treatment, remitting and recurring when lithium is stopped and restaed. The parathyroid adenomas repoed in some hypercal- cemic patients with lithium therapy may reflect the presence of an independently occurring parathyroid tumor; a permanent effect of lithium on parathyroid gland growth need not be implicated as most patients have complete reversal of hypercalcemia when lithium is stopped.

Which test is performed to detect reversible myocardial ischemia?,Coronary angiography.,MUG a scan.,Thallium scan.,Resting echocardiography.,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Thallium scan Assessment of myocardial perfusion using nuclear imaging techniques is being widely used for evaluation of Ischemic heart disease. The radioisotopes injected are thallium, sestamibiProcedureRadioisotopes are injected at rest and during stress (exercise) to produce images of myocardiumThe degree of uptake is directly proportional to blood flow.Principle - The images of myocardium is produced proportional to the uptake of regional blood flow. During stress the blood flow to an area is increased upto five times above the resting condition. But in the case of coronary artery stenosis the blood supply to the area supplied by the stenosed artery will not increase proportionately so the isotope uptake will be low and an area of hypoperfusion appear.In case of thallium what happens is that over the next several hours a complex process occurs that is known as redistribution'. Due to this process thallium continues to pour in the hypoperfused area and the final result is that an area which initially appeared as an area of reduced uptake becomes apparently normal over time.Note - In region of fibrosis (infarction or dead tissue) there will be no redistribution on delayed imaging.",C

A middle aged man noticed that he can no longer fit in his shoes and enlarging of jaw and phalanges. These effects are mediated by?,ACTH,TRH,Somatomedin,TGF beta,"ANSWER: (C) SomatomedinREF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition chapter 333Symptoms are suggestive of Acromegaly & GH effects are mediated via Somatomedins. Principal Somatomedins are IGF-I, IGF-II.CLINICAL FEATURES OF ACROMEGALY:Protean manifestations of GH and IGF-I hypersecretion are indolent and often are not clinically diagnosed for 10 years or more. Acral bony overgrowth results in frontal bossing, increased hand and foot size, mandibular enlargement with prognathism, and widened space between the lower incisor teeth.In children and adolescents, initiation of GH hypersecretion prior to epiphyseal long bone closure is associated with development of pituitary gigantism.Soft tissue swelling results in increased heel pad thickness, increased shoe or glove size, ring tightening, characteristic coarse facial features, and a large fleshy nose.Other commonly encountered clinical features include hyperhidrosis, deep and hollow- sounding voice, oily skin, arthropathy, kyphosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, proximal muscle weakness and fatigue, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags.Generalized visceromegaly occurs, including cardiomegaly, macroglossia, and thyroid gland enlargementThe most significant clinical impact of G H exces s occurs with respect to the cardiovascular system. Coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy with arrhythmias, left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased diastolic function, and hypertension occur in about 30% of patientsUpper airway obstruction with sleep apnea occurs in more than 60% of patients and isassociated with both soft tissue laryngeal airway obstruction and central sleep dysfunctionDiabetes mellitus develops in 25% of patients with acromegaly, and most patients are intolerant of a glucose load (as GH counteracts the action of insulin).Laboratory InvestigationAge- and gender-matched serum IGF-I (somatomedin) levels are elevated in acromegaly. Consequently, an IGF-I level provides a useful laboratory screening measure when clinical features raise the possibility of acromegaly.Due to the pulsatility of GH secretion, measurement of a single random GH level is not useful for the diagnosis or exclusion of acromegaly and does not correlate with disease severity.The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by demonstrating the failure of GH suppression to <1 ug/L within 1-2 h of an oral glucose load (75 g).",C

This is also known as inter capillary glomerulosclerosis or Kimmelstiel Wilson disease. The glomerular lesions take the form spherical, often laminated, nodules of matrix situated in the periphery of the glomerulus.e. The nodules are PAS-positive. Usually, not all the lobules in the individual glomerulus are involved by nodular lesions, but even lobules and glomeruli show striking mesangial sclerosis.f. Nodular lesions are frequently accompanied by prominent accumulations of hyaline material in capillary loops (""fibrin caps"") or adherent to Bowman's capsules (""capsular drops""). Both afferent and efferent glomerular hilar arterioles show hyalinosis.",A

Visible pulsations anywhere other than this expected location are abnormal. The left anterior chest wall may heave in patients with an enlarged or hyperdynamic left or right ventricle.# Physical examination in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension shows tachypnea, a prominent pulmonic S2 heart sound, palpable right ventricular heave, elevated jugular venous pressure, and dependent edema.# Many of the signs encountered in cor pulmonale are also present in HF patients with a depressed EF, including tachypnea, elevated jugular venous pressures, hepatomegaly, and lower-extremity edema. Patients may have prominent v waves in the jugular venous pulse as a result of tricuspid regurgitation. Other cardiovascular signs include an RV heave palpable along the left sternal border or in the epigastrium. The increase in intensity of the holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation with inspiration (""Carvallo's sign"") may be lost eventually as RV failure worsens.

The current criteria for definition of FUO (fever of un- known origin) is that the fever lasting for more than___ weeks.,7 days,15 days,21 days,28 days,"Ans. c (21 days). (Ref. Harrison's principles of internal medicine 18th ed. Ch. 18).FUO (FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)Definition - Fever of unknown origin (FUO) was defined by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961 as:1) temperatures of >38.3AdegC (>101AdegF) on several occasions;2) a duration of fever of >3 weeks; and3) failure to reach a diagnosis despite 1 week of inpatient investigation.Types - Durack and Street's new classification of FUO:# Classic FUO# Nosocomial FUO# Neutropenic FUO# FUO associated with HIV infectionClassic FUOCorresponds closely to the earlier definition of FUO, differing only with regard to the prior requirement for 1 week's study in the hospital. The newer definition is broader, stipulating three outpatient visits or 3 days in the hospital without elucidation of a cause or 1 week of ""intelligent and invasive"" ambulatory investigation.Nosocomial FUOa temperature of 38.3degC (lOTF) develops on several occasions in a hospitalized patient who is receiving acute care and in whom infection was not manifest or incubating on admission. Three days of investigation, including at least 2 days' incubation of cultures, is the minimum requirement for this diagnosis.Neutropenic FUODefined as a temperature of 38.3AdegC (101degF) on several occasions in a patient whose neutrophil count is <500/L or is expected to fall to that level in 1-2 days. The diagnosis of neutropenic FUO is invoked if a specific cause is not identified after 3 days of investigation, including at least 2 days' incubation of cultures.HIV-associated FUODefined by a temperature of 38.3AdegC (101degF) on several occasions over a period of >4 weeks for outpatients or >3 days for hospitalized patients with HIV infection. This diagnosis is invoked if appropriate investigations over 3 days, including 2 days' incubation of cultures, reveals no source.Causes of FUOInfections# Infections remain the most common cause of FUO.# Tumors have classically been the second most common cause of FUO in adults.# Tumors that present most often as FUO are hematologic malignancies, especially Hodgkin's disease and other lymphomas (Pel-Ebstein fevers--those that occur daily for days to weeks then disappear, only to reappear later in the same pattern--are now rarely seen), multiple myeloma and leukemias. Solid tumors like renal cell carcinoma is most often noted to cause FUO; much less commonly, hepatomas and cancer of the colon and gastrointestinal tract, lung, and breast, atrial myxomas, can cause FUO.Collagen vascular diseases, granulomatous diseases# Still's disease is the most frequent diagnosis in adults younger than 50 years; in older adults with FUO, temporal arteritis is the most common diagnosis. Other causes of FUO include polyarteritis nodosa, cryoglobulinemia, poly-myositis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and sarcoidosis.Other causes of FUO# Common entities, such as pulmonary emboli and hematomas, can manifest as FUO primarily.# Many different drugs can cause fever (table below), and hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis can also present as FUO.# Periodic fevers, such as familial Mediterranean fever, are rare and occur in select populations.# Factitious and fraudulent fevers--interesting diagnostic dilemmas that appear in every series of FUO--are uncommon.Commonly used medications that can cause fever of unknown originAntimicrobialsAnticonvulsantsAntihistaminesCardiovascular drugs H2-blockersMiscellaneousCarbapenemsCephalosporinsMinocycline HCINitrofurantoinPenicillinsRifampinSulfonamidesBarbituratesCarbamazepinePhenytoinHydralazineProcainamide HCIQuinidineCimetidineRanitidine HCIIodidesHerbal remediesNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsIbuprofenSulindacPhenothiazinesSalicylates",C

Two groups are tested for anemia. Which test should be used ?,Paired T-test,Unpair T-test,Chi-square test,ANOVA,"Ans. is `c' i.e., Chi-square test Observations in the given question are in the form of qualitative data (anemia present or not). Thus Chi-square test should be used. Chi square test Is used when the observation are in the form of propoions (for qualitative data) The outcome are in clear cut answers; yes or no. As in the example the HBsAg is either present or not present. In contrast when the observation is normally distributed in the population e.g blood pressure, blood sugar ; student test is used. In the example comparing the occurence of hepatitis B surface antigen in medical and dental students, use of chi square analysis is appropriate because the outcome variables are dichomatous. Students are classified by the presence or absence of HBsAg. Student t test is used when the outcome variable is normally distributed in population (for quantitative data) e.g blood pressure, blood glucose. In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high , but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. Students t test may be following types: Unpaired t test (Independent t test) : It compares the mean of two small samples: The data is unpaired from two independent sample. for example, blood sugar concentration is measured in two different group (A group of 10 patients and other group of 8 patient). To test the significance of difference between the means of the two groups, unpaired t test is used. Paired t test : It compares the mean in paired data, before and after the intervention from same sample. For example, Blood sugar level in a sample of 10 patients is measure before giving and after giving the oral hypoglycemic. In this condition paired t test is used. Chi-square test Vs Student t test In the example student t test is used to assess the difference between mean systolic pressure of pregnant and non pregnant women ( to know the effect of pregnancy on mean systolic blood pressure) because mean systolic blood pressure is normally distributed in the population. Every single lady has a mean systolic blood pressure. It may be low or high , but she has a value of mean systolic blood pressure. But suppose we change the example in a way that we make a clear cut definition of hypeension ( such as mean systolic blood pressure over 140 mm of Hg will be taken to be hypeension) and then look for hypeension among pregnant and non-pregnant women. The test now used to analyse the outcome will be chi square test since the outcomes are now in the form of dichomatous data i.e yes or no (a woman is either hypeensive or not hypeensive. This is in contrast to mean systolic blood pressure which was normally distributed among ladies; every lady had one value of mean systolic blood pressure). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (F test/ F ratio) ANOVA is considered as an extension of the student t test for the significance of the difference between two sample means. The student t test can be used only for making just one comparison (between two sample means), or between a sample mean and hypothesized population mean. ANOVA is used when more than one comparison is to be made (When means of more than two groups are being compared). For example, BP is measured in more than two groups of men (married, unmarried, widowed, separated and divorced). In this situation ANOVA test is best.",C

What is the most common cause of parasuicide?,Drug ingestion,Hanging,Cutting wrist,Firearms,"Ans. a. Drug ingestion Parasuicide is a suicide attempt or gesture and self-harm where there is no result in death. It is a non7fatal act in which a person deliberately causes injury to him or herself or ingests any prescribed or generally recognized therapeutic dose in excess. It is considered to be a serious public health issue. Parasuicide is the strongest known indicator for a future successful suicide attempt. Examples of suicidal gestures include cutting, where the cut is not deep enough to cause significant blood loss, or taking a non-lethal overdose of medication.'- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasuicide `Maximum cases of near-suicides are due to drug overdose.

False about type 2 renal tubular acidosis.,proximal tubule defect,Urine pH >5.5,Anion gap is normal,Fanconi syndrome present,Urine pH >5.5 in RTA 1.,B
Alkalinization of urine is done in which of the following drug poisoning? (),Amphetamine,Morphine,Phenobarbitone,Digoxin,"Most drugs taken in overdose are extensively detoxified by the liver to produce inactive metabolites which are voided in the urine. Sometimes hepatic degradation produces active metabolites, but the secondary compounds are then conveed to non-toxic derivatives. Under these circumstances, forced diuresis is inappropriate. The procedure should be undeaken only if the following conditions are satisfied: # A substantial propoion of the drug is excreted unchanged. # The drug is distributed mainly in the extracellular fluid. # The drug is minimally protein-bound. # Principle-- Most drugs are weak electrolytes and exist paly as undissociated molecules at physiological pH. The extent of ionisation is a function of the ionisation constant of the drug (Ka for both acids and bases), and the pH of the medium in which it is dissolved. Ionisation constants are usually expressed in the form of their negative logarithm, pKa. Hence the pKa scale is analogous to the pH notation : the stronger an acid the lower its pKa, and the stronger a base the higher its pKa. Thus when pKa = pH, the concentrations of ionised and non-ionised drugs are equal. Cell membranes are most permeable to substances that are lipid soluble and in the non-ionised, rather than the ionised form. Thus the rate of diffusion from the renal tubular lumen back into the circulation is decreased when a drug is maximally ionised. Because ionisation of acidic drugs is increased in an alkaline environment, and that of basic drugs is increased in an acid solution, manipulation of the urinary pH enhances renal excretion. # Forced alkaline diuresis : This is most useful in the case of phenobarbitone, lithium, and salicylates. Administer 1500 ml of fluid IV, in the first hour as follows : - 500 ml of 5% dextrose - 500 ml of 1.2 or 1.4% sodium bicarbonate - 500 ml of 5% dextrose. # Forced acid diuresis : Forced acid diuresis is no longer recommended for any drug or poison, including amphetamines, strychnine, quinine or phencyclidine.

These includea) Sadism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on ones partner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc.b) Lust murder: In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.c) Necrophagia: (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat): This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure.d) Masochism: Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, tortured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual partner.e) Necrophilia: In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants.f) Fetishism: A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm, eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc.g) Transvestism = Eonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality.h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these parts with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public).i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine).j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom: Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman.k) Frotteurism: Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone.l) Undinism: In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex.m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual part of either or is sexually favored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva.# A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant.# Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine.n) Uranism: General term for perversion of the sexual instinct.o) Satyriasis: Incessant sexual desire.p) Priapism: Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",B

"In a right-handed person, which of the following signs is not a characteristic feature of occlusion in the right middle cerebral aery?",Left hemoplegia with left UMN VII cranial nerve palsy,Left hemiplegia with aphasia,Left hemiplegia with right anosognosia,Left hemiplegia with left hemi-anaesthesia,"Middle cerebral aery syndrome is a condition whereby the blood supply from the middle cerebral aery (MCA) is restricted, leading to a reduction of the function of the poions of the brain supplied by that vessel: the lateral aspects of frontal, temporal and parietal lobes, the corona radiata, globus pallidus, caudate and putamen. The MCA is the most common site for the occurrence of ischemic stroke. Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the aery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypeonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypeonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean aerial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean aerial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion. Contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss of the face, upper and lower extremities is the most common presentation of MCA syndrome. Lower extremity function is more spared than that of the faciobrachial region.The majority of the primary motor and somatosensory coices are supplied by the MCA and the coical homunculus can, therefore, be used to localize the defects more precisely. Middle cerebral aery lesions mostly affect the dominant hemisphere i.e. the left cerebral hemisphere Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2456",B

"Which of the following shows ""cyclodevelopmental"" type of biological transmission: September 2011",Filarial parasite,Malarial parasite,Plague bacilli,All of the above,"Ans. A: Filarial parasite Cyclodevelopmental biological transmission is shown by filarial parasite in culex mosquito and guineaworm embryo in Cyclops (when the disease agent undergoes cyclical changes but do not multiply in the body of the ahropod) Propagative transmission In the case of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria and parasites, the parasites reproduce (i.e. propagate) in the vector, but do not pass through developmental stages. Transmission cannot occur until the parasite population has increased many fold and been disseminated, e.g. to the salivary glands. Cyclopropagative transmission In this case, protozoan parasites undergo both development and reproduction within the vector. These parasites both increase in number and transform to a different life stage before transmission can occurs. However, the veebrate stages of these parasites can invoke a new infection if they are directly transferred to another veebrate host blood transfusion or across the placenta (e.g. malaria parasites) or through sexual intercourse. (e.g. trypanosomes). Cyclodevelopmental transmission Microfilarial parasites ingested by the vector with the blood meal undergo development to 3rd stage larvae (L3) before being transferred back to another veebrate host. There is no replication and not all ingested microfilaria survive to L3. Thus, the number of parasites leaving the vector is always less than the number entering.",A

False regarding a propagated epidemic is -,No secondary waves,Spread depends on herd immunity,Person to person transmission occurs,Slow rise,"Propagated epidemics 

Propagated epidemic is most often of infectious origin. -
It results from person to person transmission.
Source of disease agent is not common to all cases. Every new case becomes the source for others.
The epidemic usually shows a gradual rise and tails off over a much longer period of time.
The speed of spread depends upon herd immunity, opportunities for contact and secondary attack rate.
Propagated epidemics are more likely to occur where large number of susceptible are aggregated, or where there is a regular supply of new susceptible individuals (e.g. birth, immigrants) lowering herd immunity.
Transmission continues until the number of susceptible is depleted or susceptible individuals are no longer exposed to infected persons or intermediary vectors.
Epidemic continues over more than one incubation period.
Secondary waves are seen.
Examples - epidemic of polio and Hepatitis A.

Also know

A typical type of epidemic is epidemic of cholera.
It starts as common source-epidemic → most of the initial cases acquire the disease from a common source (e.g. a well with contaminated water).
Then it continues as a propagated epidemic → these cases become the source for the other persons in their close vicinity.
So it has a sharp peak but tails of gradually over a longer period of time.",A

Consent from guardian/husband for MTP is required if -,Female is below 28 years of age,Female is below 23 years of age,Female is below 17 years of age,All,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Female is below 17 years of age The conditions under which a pregnancy can be terminated under the MTP Act. 1971 : There are 5 conditions that have been identified in the Act : a. Medical - where continuation of the pregnancy might endanger the mother's life or cause grave injury to her physical or mental health. b. Eugenic - where there is substantial risk of the child being born with serious handicaps due to physical or mental abnormalities. c. Humanitarian - where pregnancy is the result of rape d. Socio-economic - where actual or reasonably foreseeable environments (whether social or economic could lead to risk of injury to the health of the mother). e. Failure of contraceptive devices - The anguish caused by an unwanted pregnancy resulting from a failure of any contraceptive device or method can be presumed to constitute a grave mental injury to the health of the mother. This condition is a unique feature of the Indian law and viually allows aboion on request, in view of the difficulty of proving that a pregnancy was not caused by failure of contraception.

Infected endocarditis is commonly seen with all the following except,Small VSD,Tetralogy of fallot,PDA,ASD,"Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the hea, usually the valves. Osler's nodes (""ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet""), Roth's spots on the retina, positive serum rheumatoid factor Other signs may include night sweats, rigors, anemia, spleen enlargement Damaged valves and endocardium contribute to the development of infective endocarditis.Specifically, the damaged pa of a hea valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as pa of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis. Damage to the valves and endocardium can be caused by: Altered, turbulent blood flow. The areas that fibrose, clot, or roughen as a result of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent ductus aeriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects. Catheters, electrodes, and other intracardiac prosthetic devices. Solid paicles from repeated intravenous injections. Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune mechanisms and degenerative valvular lesions. The risk factors for infective endocarditis provide a more extensive list of conditions that can damage the hea. Infective endocarditis (IE) can be the first presentation of a silent patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). PDA IE vegetations usually accumulate at the pulmonary end of the PDA and shower septic emboli to the lungs Infective endocarditis is a rare occurrence in the main pulmonary aery trunk and even rarer in tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common congenital hea disease with survival to adulthood Infective endocarditis can occur in healthy people or in those with a preexisting hea disease.ENT examination also showed pseudomembranous anginas associated with poor oral health status. IE associated with VSD are the most frequent IEs among patients with congenital hea disease Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 536",D

Which of the following is not abrasion?,Graze,Scratches,Impact,Avulsion,"Ans. is d i.e., Avulsion Types of abrasion are : ? 1) Scratches (linear abrasion) : It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e.g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc. Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch. 2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion) : It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e.g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) : Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion) : It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface. It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",D

Protein present in brown adipose tissue is -,Thermogenin,Dinitroprotein,Leptin,Adipocin,"The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.

All of the following statements regarding cirrhotic ascites are true except:,The serum albumin minus the ascites albumin is usually less than 1.1,Cirrhotic ascites may in pa be related to splanchnic vasodilation.,Spironolactone and furosemide are mainstays of therapy,High-volume paracentesis is an acceptable form of therapy,"Currently, the vasodilator theory for development of cirrhotic/poal hypeensive ascites is the most widely accepted one. Peripheral vasodilatation results in underfilling of the aerial tree. When this result is hemodynamically significant, a baroreceptor-mediated increased release of renin, aldosterone, vasopressin, and norepinephrine occurs, resulting in fluid retention and deteriorating renal function. At the extreme end of the spectrum, the hepatorenal syndrome can develop with oliguria, marked salt retention, and essentially normal renal morphology, Ascites formation also depends on the presence of poal hypeension. The increased hydrostatic pressure will cause an increased leakage of fluid from the very permeable hepatic sinusoids into the space of Disse. Fluid subsequently leaks from the space of Disse into the peritoneal cavity. The lymphatics are overwhelmed, and ascites forms. There are several facets to therapy. Although as little as 700 mg of sodium may be excreted daily in the cirrhotic state, a diet of less than 2 g of sodium daily is unpalatable and impractical. Therefore, in most instances of significant ascites, diuretics are necessary. Spironolactone, by inhibiting aldosterone, may be effective in mobilizing ascitic fluid 1 to 2 weeks after initiating therapy. Therefore, furosemide is usually begun concomitantly. Careful attention to serum potassium and renal function is required. High-volume paracentesis with or without IV albumin is very effective and seldom causes renal compromise. Peritoneovenous-jugular shunts are effective in mobilizing ascitic fluid but can result in congestive hea failure or variceal bleeding in susceptible individuals. Shunt occlusion is a common complication. Peritoneal fluid should be evaluated with simultaneous ascitic fluid and serum samples for albumin. A gradient of greater than 1.1 between the serum and the ascitic fluid (serum-ascitic) is consistent with poal hypeension. If it is less than 1.1, then an inflammatory/infectious or malignant cause must be sought.",A

"In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes share a similar function with",Gemistocytes,Astrocytes,Schwann cells,Microglial cells,"Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) share a similar function with Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system-synthesis of myelin. Oligodendrocytes are small, round, lymphocyte-size cells that produce and maintain CNS myelin, which is primarily located in the white matter. Ceain diseases, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by a papovavirus, specifically attack oligodendrocytes and produce demyelination. Oligodendrogliomas are malignant tumors that are derived from oligodendrocytes. However, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes contribute segments of myelin sheaths to more than one axon. Gemistocytes are reactive astrocytes that have an eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are commonly seen along the periphery of cerebral infarctions. Some astrocytomas have a gemistocytic appearance. Astrocytes provide the structural framework for the neurons and are analogous to the fibroblasts in connective tissue. However, scarring in the brain is not associated with collagen synthesis but with filling in the defect with the cellular processes of astrocytes. A cerebral abscess is the only example of CNS repair with collagen, which is derived from the blood vessels. Microglial cells are derived from monocytes. They are the phagocytic cell of the CNS. Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They do not produce CSF nor are they responsible for reabsorption of CSF, a function relegated to arachnoid cells.

All of the following are approaches to health education except :,Service approach,Regulatory approach,Health education approach,Mass media,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Mass media According to Alma-Ata declaration (1978), ""Health education is a process aimed at encouraging people to want to be healthy to know how to stay healthy to do what they can individually and collectively to maintain health and seek help when needed"".Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health.Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person's level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures.There are 4 well-known approaches to health education:Regulatory approach (Managed prevention)There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations.The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E.g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat beltsService approachThe service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation.This is mainly the responsibility of the health department and health workers both in government and nongovernment health agencies.The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health.The service approach will be a failure when it is not based on the ""felt needs"" of the people.Health education approachThe health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health.Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E.g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, fertility control.Primary health care approachThe primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health.This is a radically new approach starting from the people with their full participation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination.The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health.Mass media is a method of health communication.

"A patient is on aspirin, what will be the finding?",Prolonged BT,Prolonged PT,Prolonged APTT,Prolonged CT,"Answer is A (Prolonged bleeding time (BT) Bleeding time is indicative of function of platelets. Aspirin ingestion results in defective platelet function and hence the deranged parameter will be Bleeding time. PT, APTT and Clotting time (CT) are parameters of coagulation defects, and will be normal in isolated disorders of platelet function. 'Ingestion of Aspirin and other Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory drugs, significantly prolongs the bleeding time'. `Aspirin even in small doses irreversibly inhibits T xA2 synthesis by platelets. Thus it interferes with platelet aggregation and bleeding time is prolonged to nearly twice the normal value'- Note: Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX -1 and COX - 2. (Harrison) COX inhibition leads to prevention of TXA2 synthesis and impairment of platelet secretion and aggregation The effect of aspirin on platelet function occur within 1 hour and lasts for the duration of the affected platelet's life span ie. 1 week.Q",A

If correlation between weight and heights are very strong what will be the correlation coefficient ?,1,> 1,0,None,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., +1 o A correlation simply expresses the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables in terms of a correlation coefficient, signified by `r'. o Values of r varies from -1 to +1.; o The strength of the relationship is indicated by the size of the coefficient , whereas its direction is indicated by the sign(+ or -) o A plus sign (+) means : That there is a positive correlation between the two variables - high values of one variable (such as salt intake ) are associated with high value of the other variable ( such as blood pressure) i.e salt intake is directly propoional to blood pressure. o A negative sign (-) means : That there is a negative correlation between the two variables - high values of one variables (such as cigarette consumption ) are associated with low values of the other ( such as life expectancy). Cigarette consumption is inversely propoional to life expectancy o If there is a perfect linear relationship between the two variables so that it is possible to know the exact value of one variable from the knowledge of other variable, the correlation coefficient ( r) will be exactly + or - 1.00 ( +1 or -1 ). o If there is absolutely no relationship between the two variables so that it is impossible to know anything about one variable on the basis of knowledge of the other variable. Then the coefficient will be 0. Strength of correlation o The strength of linear relationship between two random variables X and Y is based on the value of correlation coefficient and is often summarized according to the following guidelines:- For Positive Correlation For negative correlation Interpretation r<0. 30 - 0.30 r very weak linear relationship 0.30 5 r < 0.50 - 0.50 < r 5 - 0.30 weak linear relationship 0.50 _. r < or 0.80 - 0.80 <r - 0.50 moderate linear relationship 0.80 5..r< 0.90 - 0.90 <r- 0.80 strong linear relationship r 0.90 1.5.-0.90 very strong linear relationship o If you have difficulty in interpreting above table, I am giving in very simple language:- A. Positive Correlation i) Correlation coefficient less than 0.30 Very weak positive correlation. ii) Correlation coefficient 0.30 to 0.49 --) Weak Positive correlation iii) Correlation coefficient 0.50 to 0.79 Moderate Positive correlation iv) Correlation coefficient 0.80 to 0.89 --)Strong Positive correlation v) Correlation Coefficient equal to or greater than 0.90--> very strong positive correlation.

For example; if we are saying, more than - 0.30, that mean - 0.29, - 0.28, - 0.27 .... so on; and if we are saying less than - 0.90 that means - 0.91, - 0.92 .... so on.",A

In anklyosing spondylitis joint involvement is least in?,Wrist and hand,Sacroiliac joint,Acromio-clavicular joint,Costochondral junction,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Wrist and hand Ankylosing spondylitis (marie - strumpell disease) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. Prototype of seronegative (absence of rheumatoid factor) spondyloahropathies. Inflammatory disorder of unknown cause. Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA - B27. Joints involved in ankylosing spondylitis Primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. o Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee and ankle are also involved. Pathology Enthesitis i.e. inflammation of the inseion points of tendons, ligaments or joint capsule on bone is one of the hallmarks of this entity of disease. Primarily affects axial (spinal) skeleton and sacroiliitis is often the earliest manifestation of A.S.. Involvement of costoveebral joints frequently occur, leading to diminished chest expansion (normal 5 cm) Peripheral joints e.g. shoulders, and hips are also involved in 1/3rd patients. Extraaicular manifestations like acute anterior uveitis (in 5%); rarely aoic valve disease, carditis and pulmonary fibrosis also occur. Pathological changes proceed in three stages? Inflammation with granulation tissue formation and erosion of adjacent bone. Fibrosis of granulation tissue Ossification of the fibrous tissue, leading to ankylosis of the joint. Inflammatory bowel disease (CD, UC) may also be seen. Clinicalfeatures (symptoms) Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of an kvlasing spondylitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are :- D Sclerosis of the aiculating surfaces of SI joints Widening of the sacroiliac joint space Bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac joints Calcification of the sacroiliac ligament and sacro-tuberous ligaments Evidence of enthesopathy - calcification at the attachment of the muscles, tendons and ligaments, paicularly around the pelvis and around the heel. X-ray of lumbar spine may show :- Li Squaring of veebrae : The normal anterior concavity of the veebral body is lost because of calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Loss of the lumbar lordosis. Bridging 'osteophytes' (syndesmophytes) Bamboo spine appearance In the early disease process, plain x-rays may be read as normal. More accurate and early diagnosis can be done by using MR1 and/or CT scan. Dynamic MRI with fat saturation, either sho tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequnece or TI weighted images with contrast enhancement is highly sensitive and specific for identifying early intra-aicular inflammation, cailage changes, and underlying bone marrow edema in sacroilitis. Magnetic resonance imaging allows for visualization of acute sacroilitis, spondylitis, and spondylodiscitis, and can also detect acute inflammation of the entheses, bone and synovium. The ability to detect early inflammatiion and acurately visualize cailaginous and enthesal lesions makes magnetic resonance imaging a useful assessment tool in the spondyloahropathies.",A

Beware the percentage values!> A decrease of more than 80-100 CD4+ T-cells/pl per year is too much! Don't delay too long in such patients!> Because of considerable variability a single CD4+ T-cell count (especially when in the range of 200-350/pl) should be repeated before starting therapy.> Above 350 CD4+ T-cells/pl: wait, but continue to monitor at least every three months.> The higher the viral load, the more frequent checks ofCD4+ T-cell counts are necessary: > 100,000 copies/ml, testing should be performed at least every two months.> Initiation of treatment may be justified at levels above 350 CD4+ T-cells/pl - if viral load is very high, CD4+ T-cell count is decreasing rapidly or the patient requests it (after careful counseling).> A 25 year-old patient with 100 CD4+ T-cells/pl and a viral load of 100,000 copies/ml has a risk of approximately 10 % for developing AIDS within six months - for a 55 year-old, this level of risk is reached at 150 CD4+ T-cells/pl and a viral load of 30,000 copies/ ml",D

On examination she is mildly obtunded but arousable, BP 160/100, pulse 115/min, RR 30/min, O2 saturation 84% on her usual 3 L/min nasal cannula oxygen. She is using accessory muscles to breath, has diffuse wheezing and rhonchi bilaterally, a prolonged expiratory phase, distant but regular heart sounds, and no peripheral edema.Arterial blood gases (ABGs) on arrival are as follows:pH: 7.20,PO2: 70 mm HgPCO2: 65 mm Hgcalculated HCO3 29 mEq/L.Electrolytes return shortly thereafter as follows:Na: 140 mEq/LK: 5.1 mEq/LHCO3: 29 mEq/LCl: 100 mEq/LBUN 20 mg/dL creatinine 1.5 mg/dLglucose 89 mg/dL.After prompt initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (Bi-pap), blood cultures, toxicology screen, intravenous fluids, and IV antibiotics, you have time to consider the patient's metabolic situation. Choose the answer which best describes the acid-base condition and its etiology.","The patient has acute, severe respiratory acidosis caused by the sudden deterioration in her respiratory status.",The patient has an underlying metabolic acidosis caused by her renal insufficiency now compounded by a respiratory alkalosis.,The patient ingested abundant amounts of aspirin which caused a severe metabolic acidosis and respiratory failure.,"The patient has a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation, now with a superimposed further respiratory acidosis caused by decreased ventilation.","Patients with severe COPD often have a baseline chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 in the 50 to 60 mm Hg range. They are unable to ventilate sufficiently to correct the acidotic situation this creates. The kidney then compensates by retaining HCO3 . This results in a new steady state in which the patient has a near-normal pH on their blood gas despite the chronically elevated CO2 . In this question the further deterioration in the patient's respiratory status due to COPD exacerbation has caused further CO2 retention and a superimposed acute respiratory acidosis on top of the chronic respiratory acidosis. Salicylate overdose normally causes an anion gap acidosis and the AG is normal here. Volume depletion, especially due to recurrent vomiting, can lead to a contraction alkalosis, but this patient's acidosis indicates that the elevated bicarbonate level is caused by renal compensation for her chronic CO2 retention.",D

Hypocalcemia with hypophosphatemia is seen in: September 2006,Crush injury,Rhabdomyolysis,Vitamin D dependent rickets-II,Renal failure,"Ans. C: Vitamin D dependent rickets-II In rhabdomyolysis due to crush injury, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia may occur. Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome. Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium. Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia. Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",C

Some 80% of cases occur prior to the age of 5, with the peak incidence occurring at <2 years.It is characterized by:Nonsuppurative cervical adenitisChanges in the skin and mucous membranes such as edema; congested conjunctivae; erythema of the oral cavity, lips, and palmsDesquamation of the skin of the fingertips.Although the disease is generally benign and self-limited, it is associated with coronary artery aneurysms in 25% of cases, with an overall case-fatality rate of 0.5-2.8%. These complications usually occur between the third and fourth weeks of illness during the convalescent stage.Vasculitis of the coronary arteries is seen in almost all the fatal cases that have been autopsied.There is typical intimal proliferation and infiltration of the vessel wall with mononuclear cells. Beadlike aneurysms and thromboses may be seen along the artery. Other manifestations include pericarditis, myocarditis, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and cardiomegalyTreatment of choke:The prognosis of this disease for uneventful recovery is excellent.High-dose IV globulin (2 g/kg as a single infusion over 10 h) together with aspirin {100 mg/kg per day for 14 days followed by 3-5 mg/kg per day for several weeks) for coronary complications.",D

'Teichopsia' is seen in,Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD),Migraine,Vitreous hemorrhage,Optic atrophy,"Ans. B. Migrane. (Ref Victor Adams Neurology, pg. 182-183.)Classic migraine is usually familial, involves a unilateral, throbbing head pain, and diminishes in fre- quency with age. The blind spot, or scotoma, that may develop as part of the aura of a classic migraine attack will involve the same visual field in both eyes. This defect usually changes over the course of minutes. It typically enlarges and may intrude on the central vision. The margin of the blind spot is often scintillating or dazzling. If this margin has a pattern like the battlement of a castle, it is called a fortification spectrum, or teichopsia. Homonymous hemianoptic defects of the sort that develop during the aura of a classic migraine indicate an irritative lesion that is affecting one part of the occipital cortex in one hemisphere of the brain. The changes in the scotoma over the course of minutes indicate that the irritative phenomenon sets off a cascade of events in the visual cortex that temporarily disturbs vision in a progressively larger area. Other focal neurologic phenomena may precede classic migraine; the most common are tingling of the face or hand, mild confusion, transient hemiparesis, and ataxia. Fatigue, irritability, and easy distractibility often develop before a migraine. Affected persons usually also have hypersensitivity to light and noise during an attack.",B

Ebstein's anomaly is characterized by:,Upward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid valve into right atrium,Downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid valve into right ventricle,Ventricularized right atrium,Atrialized left ventricleCoarctation of Aoa,"Answer is B (Downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid valve into right ventricle) Ebstein's anomaly is characterized by downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid valve (Septa! and posterior leaflet) into the right ventricle such that the poion of the right ventricle above the displaced tricuspid valve leaflets becomes pa of the right atrium (Atrialized Right Ventricle). Ebstein's Anomaly * The normal Tricuspid Valve has three leaflets (Anterior: Posterior; Septal). * Ebstein's anomaly is characterized by Downward (Apical) displacement of the Septal and Posterior leaflets into the Right Ventricle The principle feature of Ebstein's anomaly is apical displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve from the inseion of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by at least 8 mm/m- body surface area. * The anterior leaflet which is fOrmed at a diflerent stage of development usually retains a normal position though it mar be redundant, fenestrated or tethered * Overall the functional annulus is displaced downward (Apical) into the right ventricle. * The poion of the right ventricle above the displaced annulus becomes Atrialized (Atrialized Right Ventricle). * The right atrium and atrialized right ventricle becomes dilated with variable degrees of hyperophy and thinning of the wall. * The true tricuspid annulus is also dilated.",B
Mummification is enhanced by ?,Moist and hot air,Moist and cool air,Dry and hot air,Dry and cool air,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Dry and hot air Mummification It is a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of moisture. That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deses, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil. Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body pas like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation). Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning or mummification. Medicolegal impoance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",C
Automated external defibrillar is used for?,Atrial fibrillation,Ventricular fibrillation,Atrial flutter,Supraventricular tachycardia,"An automated external defibrillator is used in cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias which lead to sudden cardiac arrest, 'which is not the same as a hea attack. The rhythms that the device will treat are usually limited to:'' Pulseless Ventricular tachycardia (shoened to VT or V-Tach) Ventricular fibrillation (shoened to VF or V-Fib) In each of these two types of shockable cardiac arrhythmia, the hea is electrically active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and circulate blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the hea beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the hea becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the hea decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole. AEDs, like all defibrillators, are not designed to shock asystole ('flat line' patterns) as this will not have a positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator.

Hypomagnesemia alone would increase phosphorus by decreasing parathormone effect. Hyperparathyroidism can decrease phosphorus but would cause hypercalcemia. Severe hypophosphatemia is seen with malnutrition, especially during the refeeding stage when carbohydrate intake causes phosphate to shift into the intracellular space. Such patients have clear clinical evidence of malnutrition. In addition, malnutrition almost always causes hypoalbuminemia.

All of the following can cause neuropathies with predominant motor involvement except,Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,Acute intermittent porphyria,Lead intoxication,Arsenic intoxication,"Arsenic interferes with cellular longevity by allosteric inhibition of an essential metabolic enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by NAD+. With the enzyme inhibited, the energy system of the cell is disrupted resulting in cellular apoptosis. Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency. Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis. Low potassium levels in the cells increases the risk of experiencing a life-threatening hea rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide. Arsenic in cells clearly stimulates the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When the H2O2 reacts with ceain metals such as iron or manganese it produces a highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Inorganic arsenic trioxide found in ground water paicularly affects voltage-gated potassium channels, disrupting cellular electrolytic function resulting in neurological disturbances, cardiovascular episodes such as prolonged QT interval, neutropenia, high blood pressure,central nervous system dysfunction, anemia, and death.

The most characteristic initiating event is formation (and often subsequent lysis) of microthrombi composed of platelets, fibrin, and coagulative factors. The consumption of coagulative factors leads to increased prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT). The consumption of platelets leads to a decreased platelet count. A more specific confirmatory test is an increase in fibrin split products, such as ""D-dimers."" Characteristically, DIC clinically produces a mix of hemorrhagic and coagulative complications, and is difficult to treat because correcting the coagulative tendency tends to worsen the hemorrhage, and correcting the hemorrhagic tendency tends to worsen thrombotic complications.

Within the cell, vitamin K undergoes electron reduction to a reduced form of vitamin K (called vitamin K hydroquinone) by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (or VKOR). Another enzyme then oxidizes vitamin K hydroquinone to allow carboxylation of Glutamate to gamma carboxyglutamate; this enzyme is called the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase or the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction will only proceed if the carboxylase enzyme is able to oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time; the carboxylation and epoxidation reactions are said to be coupled reactions.",C

Specificity of a test refers to its ability to detect -,True positive,True negatives,False negatives,False positive,"When a screening test is used to diagnose a disease, the test outcome can be positive (diseased) or negative (healthy), while the actual health status of the person may be different.
In that setting


True positive → Diseased people correctly diagnosed as diseased.
False positive →  Healthy people wrongly identified as diseased.
True negative → Healthy people correctly identified as healthy.
False negative → Diseased people wrongly identified as healthy.


There are two major statistical measures for the validity of a screening test : -


Sensitivity
Specificity

Sensitivity

It is the ability of a test to identify correctly all those who have the disease, i.e., true positive. 
In other words sensitivity measures the percentage of sick people who are identified as having disease.
For example if a test is 90% sensitive, that means out of 100 diseased people, it will diagnose 90 (90% of diseased people will be diagnosed). Remaining 10% will be wrongly indentified as not having the disease, i.e., false negative.

Specificity

It is the ability of a test to identify correctly those who do not have the disease i.e., true negative 
In other words specificity measures the percentage of well people who are identified as not having the disease.
For example, a 90 percent specificity means that 90% of nondiseased people will be identified as not having the disease. The remaining 10% will be wrongly classified as diseased, i.e., false positive.",B

Glomerulonephritis with the nephrotic syndrome is observed occasionally; HBsAg, immunoglobulin, and C3 deposition has been found in the glomerular basement membrane.* While generalized vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa) develops in considerably fewer than 1% of patients with chronic HBV infection, 20-30% of patients with polyarteritisnodosa have HBsAg in serum.* Another extrahepatic manifestation of viral hepatitis is essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC). The disorder is characterized clinically by arthritis; cutaneous vasculitis (palpable purpura); and, occasionally, with glomerulonephritis and serologically by the presence of circulating cryoprecipitable immune complexes of more than one immunoglobulin class.* Many patients with this syndrome have chronic liver disease and a substantial proportion has chronic HCV infection, with circulating immune complexes containing HCV RNA.* Immune-complex glomerulonephritis is another recognized extrahepatic manifestation of chronic hepatitis C.",D

Renin plays impoant role in,Renovascular hypeension,Malignant hypeension,Coronary aery disease,Essential hypeension',"Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leads to vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, sympathetic nervous system activation. This is mediated by angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of aerioles in both the kidney and the systemic circulation . Activation of the sympathetic nervous system may initially maintain cardiac output through an increase in myocardial contractility, hea rate and peripheral vasoconstriction. However, prolonged sympathetic stimulation leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, hyperophy and focal myocardial necrosis.renin also has an essential role in renovascular hypeension.Renovascular hypeension is another renin-mediated form of hypeension. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin dependent. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2044",A

Rhabdomyolysis is caused by-,Sea snake,Cobra,Viper,Krait,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sea snake According to clinical features, snakes arc divided into : A. Neurotoxic It includes elapids, i.e. cobra, krait and coral snake. Krait is the most common poisonous snake in india. These have minimal reaction locally, but produce strong neurotoxicity. They act on motor nerve cells, resembling poisoning with curare. There is weakness of legs and face. Muscle paralysis occurs in following order :- mouth (first) followed by throat and finally respiratory muscles. Cobra venom also produces convulsions (krait venom produces only paralysis). B. Vasculotoxic (hematotoxic) It includes vipers. Viper venom contains hemolysins and thromboplasin which cause widspread endothelial damage and hemolysis. Locally at the site of bite, there is severe oozing of blood. There may be coagulation abnormalities with death due to hemorrhagic shock. Hematuria and hemoglobinuria occurs due to hemolysis. C. Myotoxic (musculotoxic) These are sea snakes. Their venom produces generalized muscle pain, weakness, followed by polymyositis,myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia and increased muscle enzymes. Finally there is respiratory and renal failure.",A
O2 required to oxidize all pollutants in water is,Biochemical oxygen demand,Chemical oxygen demand,Biochemical index,oxygen index,"Ans) a (Biochemical oxy...) Ref park 20th ed p668The strength of sewage is expressed in terms of biochemical oxygen demand.(BOD)Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) is a measure of the oxygen used by microorganisms to decompose this waste. If there is a large quantity of organic waste in the water supply, there will also be a lot of bacteria present working to decompose this waste. In this case, the demand for oxygen will be high (due to all the bacteria) so the BOD level will be high. As the waste is consumed or dispersed through the water, BOD levels will begin to decline.It is defined as the amount of oxygen absorbed by asample of sewage during a specified period, generally 5 days at a specified temperature, generally 20degc for the aerobic destruction or use of organic matter by living organism.BOD value ranges from 1 mg per litre for natural body waters to 300 mg /litre for untreated domestic sewage.If BOD is 300m g/l or above sewage is said to be strong and less tha lOOmg/l it said to be weak.",A

All cases cluster within one incubation period in:,Point source epidemic,Continuous source epidemic,Secondary epidemic,Endemic,"Ans: a (Point source epidemic) Ref: Park, 19th ed, p. 60There are three kinds of time trends or fluctuation in disease occurrence1. Short term fluctuation2. Periodic fluctuation3. Long term or secular trendsShort term fluctuations-Best known example is an epidemic.Types of epidemics:A. Common -source epidemicsa) Single exposure or point source epidemicsb) Continuous or multiple exposure epidemicsB. Propagated epidemicsa) Person-to-personb) Arthropod vectorc) Animal reservoirC. Slow or modem epidemicCommon-source epidemics:1. S ingle exposure or point source epidemics-The exposure to the disease agent is brief and simultaneous, the resultant cases all develop within one incubation period of the disease. The main features of a point source epidemic are:i. The epidemic curve rises and falls rapidly, with no secondary wavesii. The epidemic tends to be explosive, there is clustering of cases within a narrow interval of timeiii. All cases develop within one incubation period of the disease.Examples -Bhopal gas tragedy in India, Mina Mata disease in Japan, food poisoning2. Common -source, continuous or repeated exposure epidemicsExposure from the same source may be prolonged, or repeated. The resulting epidemics tend to be more extensive and irregular. Diseases tend to occur beyond the range of one incubation period. No evidence of secondary cases among persons who had contact with ill persons. E.g. A prostitute being a common source in gonorrhea outbreak.Propagated Epidemics:The epidemic usually shows a gradual rise and tails off over a much longer period of time. Transmission continues until the number of susceptible is depleted. E.g., polio, hepatitis APeriodic fluctuations:a) Seasonal trend-upper respiratory tract infections in winter, gastrointestinal infections in summer.b) Cyclic trend-diseases may occur in cycles spread over a short period of time. E.g., Measles in pre vaccination era appeared every 2-3 years, rubella every 6-9 years, Influenza pandemic every 7-10 years.Long term or secular trends - Changes in occurrence of disease over a long period of time, over years or decades.e.g., coronary artery disease, lung cancer, diabetes.Endemic - it refers to the constant presence of a disease or an infectious agent within a given population group or geographic area without importation from outside.",A

"Fatigue, myalgia, weakness, which electrolyte -",Hypo K,Hypo Na,Hypo Mg,Hyper Mg,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hypokalemia Potassiumo Potassium is the major intracellular ion.o The normal plasma K+ concentration is 3.5 - 5.0 mmoL/L, where as in the cells it is about 150 mmoL/L.o Therefore, the amount of K+ in the ECF constitutes < 2% of the total body K+ content.o The ratio of ICF to ECF K~ concentration (normally 38:1) is the principal result of the resting membrane potential and is crucial for normal neuromuscular function.o The basolateral Na+, K+ ATPase pump actively transports K+ in and Na~ out of the cell in a 2:3 ratio and the passive outward diffusion of K+ is quantitatively the most important factor that generates the resting membrane potential.Hypokalemiao It is defined as plasma K' concentration <3.5 mmoL/L.Clinical featureso The clinical manifestations of K+ depletion vary> greatly between individuals and their severity depends upon the degree of hypokalemia.o The main manifestations of hypokalemia are neuromuscular and these are due to lower (more negative) resting membrane potential.o The common neuromuscular complaints are - Fatigue, myalgia and muscular weakness.o More severe hypokalemia may lead to progressive weakness hypoventilation (due to respiratory muscle involvement) and eventually complete paralysis.o There is increased risk of rhabdomyolysis.o Smooth muscles too are involved and it is manifested in G.I.T. as constipation and paralytic ileus.Hypokalemia is also marked bv characteristic E. C. G chanseso The E.C.G. changes of hypokalemia are due to delayed ventricular repolarization and do not correlate well with the plasma K+ concentration.Early changes areo Flattening or inversion of the T waveo A prominent U waveo ST segment depressiono Prolonged QU intervalSome manifestations associated with chronic hypokalemiao Polydipsia and polvurea-Chronic hypokalemia causes renal tubular damage (kaliopenic nephropathy) decreases the ability of the kidney to concentrate urine and causes polyurea and worsening potassium loss.o Carbohydrate intolerance-Due to impaired insulin resistanceo Metabolic alkalosis-By stimulation of bicarbonate reabsorption by the proximal tubule.",A

Which of the following can be eliminated by double blinding: March 2009,Berkensonian bias,Recall bias,Interviewer's bias,Selection bias,"Ans. C: Interviewer's bias Park's PSM,21st ed., p-70 states: Interviewer's bias: Bias may also occur when the interviewers knows the hypothesis and also knows who the cases are. This type of bias can be eliminated by double blinding. Interviewer's bias may occur when the interviewer knows the hypothesis and also knows who the cases are. This prior information may lead to question the cases more thoroughly than controls regarding a positive history of the suspected casual factor. This type of bias can be eliminated by double-blinding. In a double-blind experiment, neither the individuals nor the researchers know who belongs to the control group and the experimental group. Only after all the data have been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which individuals are which. Performing an experiment in double-blind fashion is a way to lessen the influence of the prejudices and unintentional physical cues on the results (the placebo effect, observer bias, and experimenter's bias). Random assignment of the subject to the experimental or control group is a critical pa of double-blind research design. The key that identifies the subjects and which group they belonged to is kept by a third pay and not given to the researchers until the study is over. Double-blind methods can be applied to any experimental situation where there is the possibility that the results will be affected by conscious or unconscious bias on the pa of the experimenter. Computer-controlled experiments are sometimes also erroneously referred to as double-blind experiments, since software may not cause the type of direct bias between researcher and subject.",C

The best advice to be given to a patient of newly diagnosed type 2 Diabetes mellitus-,Saturated fat intake <10% of total fat,Consistent calorie intake,Carbohydraterestrictitm,Exercise,"All patients with diabetes should be advised to achieve a significant level of physical activity and to maintain this in the long term. This can include activities such as walking, gardening, swimming or cycling. Supervised and structured exercise programmes may be of paicular benefit to people with type 2 diabetes. Various guidelines exist for physical activity in the general population. Those from the US Depament of Health and Human services (2008) suggest that adults (18-64 years) should build up to achieve a weekly minimum of 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, or a combination thereof. The aerobic (moderate-intensity) activity should be performed for at least 10 minutes each time and spread throughout the week, with at least 30 minutes on at least 5 days of the week. Older adults should also follow these guidelines as far as their abilities allow. Recently, it has also been suggested that a combination of both aerobic and resistance exercise may lead to greater improvements in glycaemic control. In type 1 diabetes, exercise can increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, so patients should seek specialist advice on taking extra carbohydrate, reducing insulin doses and choosing an injection site.

"A 70-year-old diabetic and hypeensive patient was being investigated for angina and a coronary angiogram was performed. Two days later, he developed fever and abdominal discomfo and dyspnea and a mottled skin rash. His great toe appeared black. His BP increased to 180/100. His creatinine was found to have risen from a pre-angiography level of 1.2 to 3.6 mg/dl. He has eosinophilia. Which one of the following statements is TRUE regarding this condition?",N-acetylcysteine would have prevented this condition,This is contrast-induced nephropathy,Heparin is the treatment of choice,Kidney biopsy will show micro-vessel occlusion with a cleft in the vessel,"Diabetes and angina both point to atherosclerosis. In patients undergoing angiography, catheterization can lead to embolism of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque in descending aoa downstream to renal aeries leading to an atheroembolic kidney disease. The symptoms of diabetic patient developed after angiography and since atherosclerotic lesion can involve the aoa, the atheroembolic event would explain the events. Presence of eosinophilia and mottling of toes and reduced kidney function confirm the diagnosis as Atheroembolic kidney disease. Hence Choice D is the answer. Lab findings include Rising serum creatinine Transient eosinophilia Elevated sedimentation rate Hypocomplementemia Definitive diagnosis by doing kidney biopsy:- Microvessel obstruction with cholesterol crystals that leave a cleft in the vessel. Contrast-induced nephropathy can occur in diabetics with chronic kidney disease. However rash, toe discoloration with the sudden rise of creatinine and eosinophilia are not seen in contrast-induced nephropathy. Hence choice B is ruled out Choice A is ruled out as it prevents contrast-induced nephropathy Choice C is ruled as out as heparin will not manage cholesterol embolism",D
"In acute intersitial nephritis, proteins associated -",Amyloid,Fibrinogen,Vitamin D binding protein,Albumin,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Causes Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type . The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 278",A

Which of the following metals the physician has in his mind?",Iron,Barium,Mercury,Thallium,"The patient with a positive history of working in a factory and now having presented with the classical symptoms (excessive salivation, tremors, disturbed personality and blue lines on gums) points towards the diagnosis of chronic mercury poisoning. The mercury poisoning can occur from various mercuric compounds. They are Mercuric chloride, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric oxide, Mercuric cyanide, Mercuric sulphide, Mercuric nitrite, Mercuric sulphate, Mercurous chloride, Sulphate of mercury, Ammoniomercuric chloride and organic compunds of mercury. Elemental mercury is found in glass thermometers, electrical switches, fluorescent light bulbs, older dental fillings and few medical equipments. Inorganic mercury is found in batteries, chemistry labs, disinfectants, folk culture medicines and red cinnabar mineral. Organic mercury is found in older germ-killers (antiseptics), thimerosal, fumes from burning coal and in a few fishes that have consumed organic mercury. Mercury poisoning can occur as acute poisoning or chronic poisoning. The mercuric ion tends to bind with the sulphydryl groups of cellular proteins, enzymes, nucleic acids and mitotic apparatus thus interferes with the cellular and enzymatic functions. Renal tubular function get affected and in the pas of the central nervous system that are mainly targeted are cerebellum, basal ganglia, temporal lobe and corpus callosum. In acute poisoning the symptoms are bronchitis, constriction in throat, hoarse voice, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, fibrosis, abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, blood stained diarrhea, glossitis, ulcerative gingivitis, renal tubular necrosis, cylinduria, uraemia and acidosis. Chronic mercury poisoning is also known as hydrargyrism. The common symptoms are sore mouth, gingivitis, salivation, formation of blue lines at the junction with teeth (Buonian line), Danbury tremors, Glass blower's shakes (hatter's shakes), Concussio mercurialis, Mercurial erethism, Mercuria lentis (brownish deposition of mercury on anterior lens capsule) and Acrodynia or pink disease.

Hence, endoscopy should be pa of the evaluation of achalasia. * When the clinical suspicion for pseudoachalasia is high and endoscopy nondiagnostic, CT scanning or endoscopic ultrasonography may be of value. * Since barium swallow may not be able to differentiate achalasia from pseudoachalasia, (MRI and CT scan must be done for determining the cause as well as for staging.

"A patient has angina, dyspnea and syncope. Whatis the most likely diagnosis?",Aoic stonosis,Aoic regurgitation,ASD,VSD,"Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms of AS. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual cuailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

There are two subgroups; Serpentine group: consist of chrysotile Amphiboles group: crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, anthophyllite and actinolite There are four main diseases associated with inhalation of asbestos fibres. Mesothelioma - a form of cancer mainly affecting the mesothelial cells. Asbestos related lung cancer Asbestosis - a non-malignant scarring of the lung tissue a form of pneumoconiasis. Non malignant pleural disease (diffuse pleural thickening and pleural plaques) Pathophysiology: There are 4 principal processes by which asbestos affects the pleura 1. The fibers irritate the pleura, thereby inducing scarring or a more malignant process 2. The fibers may pierce the mitotic spindle of cells, thereby disrupting mitosis leading to chromosomal damage 3. They also induce the generation of iron-related reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing DNA damage 4. Asbestos also induces phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases which increases the expression of early-response proto-oncogenes.

All of the following are true about Raynaud's disease except,More common in females,Positive antinuclear antibodies,Most common cause of raynaud's phenomenon,Has good prognosis,"Raynaud's disease is a rare disorder of the blood vessels, usually in the fingers and toes. It causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed. When this happens, blood can't get to the surface of the skin and the affected areas turn white and blue. When the blood flow returns, the skin turns red and throbs or tingles. In severe cases, loss of blood flow can cause sores or tissue death. Primary Raynaud's happens on its own. The cause is not known. There is also secondary Raynaud's, which is caused by injuries, other diseases, or ceain medicines. People in colder climates are more likely to develop Raynaud's.

The endotoxin of the following gram negative bacteria does not play any pa in the pathogenesis of the natural disease -,Escherichia coli,Klebseilla spp.,Vibrio cholerae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Cholera Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae serotype O1, is the archetypal toxin-mediated bacterial cause of acute watery diarrhoea. The enterotoxin activates adenylate cyclase in the intestinal epithelium, inducing net secretion of chloride and water. V. cholerae O1 has two biotypes, classical and El Tor, and each of these has two distinct serotypes, Inaba and Ogawa. Following its origin in the Ganges valley, devastating epidemics have occurred, often in association with large religious festivals, and pandemics have spread worldwide. The seventh pandemic, due to the El Tor biotype, began in 1961 and spread the Middle East to become endemic in Africa, subsequently spreading throughout South and Central America. Numbers of cases of cholera have been increasing, with outbreaks in Ghana in 2014 and Tanzaniain 2015. El Tor is more resistant to commonly used antimicrobials than classical Vibrio, and causes prolonged carriage in 5% infections. An atypical serotype, O139, has been responsible for localised outbreaks in Bangladesh. Infection spreads the stools or vomit of symptomatic patients or of the much larger number of subclinical cases. Organisms survive for up to 2 weeks in fresh water and 8 weeks in salt water. Transmission is normally through infected drinking water, shellfish and food contaminated by flies, or on the hands of carriers. Clinical features Severe diarrhoea without pain or colic begins suddenly and is followed by vomiting. Following the evacuation of normal gut faecal contents, typical 'rice water' material is passed, consisting of clear fluid with flecks of mucus. Classical cholera produces enormous loss of fluid and electrolytes, leading to intense dehydration with muscular cramps. Shock and oliguria develop but mental clarity remains. Death from acute circulatory failure may occur rapidly unless fluid and electrolytes are replaced. Improvement is rapid with proper treatment. The majority of infections, however, cause mild illness with slight diarrhoea. Occasionally, a very intense illness, 'cholera sicca', occurs, with loss of fluid into dilated bowel, killing the patient before typical gastrointestinal symptoms appear. The disease is more dangerous in children. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1132",C

Incised looking laceration is seen at ?,Forehead,Hand,Thorax,Abdomen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture) Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized poions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are :? i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed). ii) Site of injury is the site of impact. iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue. iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface. There are following types of laceration : ? 1) Split laceration : Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound. 2) Strech lacerations : Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. 3) Avulsion (shearing laceration) : An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a poion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area). 4) ears : Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching. 5) Cut laceration : Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument.",A

The hexaxial reference system can be used to visualise the directions in which the depolarisation wave may travel. When subjects were lying on the left side during sleep, due to the effect of gravity on hea, the position of hea changed, for example, turned and rotated, causing changes in the ECG of frontal plane and horizontal plane, which lead to a change in ECG.

"On vigorous exercise, the respiratory function largely depends upon -",Available of ADP,Available of substrate,Glycogen stores,Increased IP,"During intense, intermittent exercise and throughout prolonged physical activity, muscle glycogen paicles are broken down, freeing glucose molecules that muscle cells then oxidize through anaerobic and aerobic processes to produce the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules required for muscle contraction.The rate at which muscle glycogen is degraded depends primarily upon the intensity of physical activity; the greater the exercise intensity, the greater the rate at which muscle glycogen is degraded. As a result, high-intensity activity, such as repeated sprinting, can quickly lower glycogen stores in active muscle cells, even though the total time of activity might be relatively brief (eg, 10 x 30-s sprints with sho recovery intervals). In comparison, an endurance athlete who trains for hours at a time will also experience a marked decline in muscle glycogen, although at a slower rate of degradation than the sprinter.

Interstitial nephritis is seen with all except,Beta lactam inhibitors,INH,Diuretics,Allopurinol,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulointerstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type . The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage Pathophysiology This disease may follow on from AIN that does not resolve, or may be associated with ingestion of various toxins and drugs, or with metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases . In many patients, CIN presents at a late stage and no underlying cause can be identified. Genetic causes may underlie many of these cases . Toxins that have been associated with CIN include those contained within the plant Aristolochia clematitis (bihwo). These are probably responsible for the severe nephrotoxicity that can be associated with treatment with herbal medicines in Asia and for Balkan nephropathy, which affects isolated rural communities in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia, possibly through contaminated flour. The nephropathy is commonly linked with tumours of the collecting system and is probably due to the mutagenic effects of the plant toxin on the urothelial epithelium. Ingestion of mushrooms within the Coinarius genus can cause a devastating and irreversible renal tubular toxicity. It is encountered occasionally in Scandina and Scotland.

Screening for breast cancer using mammography is,Primordial prevention,Primary prevention,Secondary prevention,Teiary Prevention,"Secondary prevention is the identification and treatment of premalignant or subclinical cancers. Screening by means of mammography is a typical example of secondary prevention. Teiary prevention is defined as symptoms control and rehabilitation. Screening for breast cancer There is evidence that screening for breast cancer has a ourable effect on moality from breast cancer. The basic techniques for early detection of breast cancer are : (a} breast self-examination (BSE) by the patient (b) palpation by a physician (c) thermography (d) mammography. All women should be encouraged to perform breast self- examination. Breast cancers are more frequently found by women themselves than by a physician during a routine examination. Although the effectiveness of BSE has not been adequately quantified, it is a useful adjuvant to early case detection. In many countries, BSE will probably be the only feasible approach to wide population coverage for a long time to come. Palpation is unreliable for large fatty breasts. Thermography has the advantage that the patient is not exposed to radiation. Unfounately, it is not a sensitive tool. Mammography is most sensitive and specific in detecting small tumours that are sometimes missed on palpation. The use of mammography has three potential drawbacks: (i) exposure to radiation. This may amount to a dose of 500 milliroentgen compared to a 30-40 milliroentgen dose received in chest X-ray. Therefore, there has been concern about exposure to radiation from repeated mammographies and the risk of breast cancer developing as a result (ii) mammography requires technical equipment of a high standard and radiologists with very considerable experience - these two factors limit its more widespread use for mass screening purposes, and (iii) biopsy from a suspicious lesion may end up in a false-positive in as many as 5-10 cases for each case of cancer detected. Although recent evidence points to the superiority of mammography over clinical examination in terms of sensitivity and specificity, medical opinion is against routine mammography on the very young. Women under 35 years of age should not have X-rays unless they are symptomatic or a family history of early onset of breast cancer Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 387",C

Enzyme missing in refsum's disease is ?,Sphingomyelinase,Phytanoyl-CoA a-hydroxylase,Alpha galactosidase-A,N-acetyglucosaminidase,"Refsum's disease can manifest in infancy to early adulthood with the classic tetrad of (1) peripheral neuropathy, (2) retinitis pigmentosa, (3) cerebellar ataxia, and (4) elevated CSF protein concentration. Most affected individuals develop progressive distal sensory loss and weakness in the legs leading to foot drop by their 20 s . Subsequently, the proximal leg and arm muscles may become weak. Patients may also develop sensorineural hearing loss, cardiac conduction abnormalities, ichthyosis, and anosmia. Refsum's disease is genetically heterogeneous but autosomal recessive in nature. Classical Refsum's disease with childhood or early adult onset is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for phytanoylCoA a-hydroxylase (PAHX). Less commonly, mutations in the gene encoding peroxin 7 receptor protein (PRX7) are responsible. These lead to the accumulation of phytanic acid in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Treatment is removal of phytanic precursors (phytols: fish oils, dairy products, and ruminant fats) from the diet Ref - Harrisons 20e p3211",B

Usually begins in the second or third decade with a median age of 23, in 5% symptoms begin after 40. o Male to female ratio is 2-3 : 1 Strong correlation with HLA-B27 90-95% of cases are positive for HLA B27. Joints involved in ankvlosing spondylitis Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects axial skeleton. The disease usually begins in the sacro-iliac joints and usually extends upwards to involve the lumbar, thoracic, and often cervical spine. In the worst cases the hips or shoulders are also affected. Hip joint is the most commonly affected peripheral joint. o Rarely knee (Ebenzar 4thie 593) and ankle (Apley's 9th/e 67) are also involved. Clinical features Low back pain of insidious onset Duration usually less than 3 months Significant morning stiffness and improvement with exercise o Limited chest expansion Diffuse tenderness over the spine and sacroiliac joints Loss of lumbar lordosis, increased thoracic kyphosis Decreased spinal movements (especially extension) in all directions. Radiological features of ankvlosing spondvlitis Radiographic evidence of sacroiliac joint is the most consistent finding in ankylosing spondylitis and is crucial for diagnosis. The findings are :?

"If we reject null hypothesis, when actually it is true it is known as -",Type I error,Type II error,Power,Specificity,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Type I error Statistical errors o Statistical errors are used to describe possible errors made in statistical decision. o Before reading about the types of error you must know null hypothesis because these tests are related to null hypothesis. o Null hypothesis says -3 Any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance and not significant that means there is no variation (difference) exists between variables. o Null hypothesis testing (e.g., in Chisquare test) is used to make a decision about whether : - i) The data contradict the null hypothesis ---> That means there is true difference (which is significant) between variables and it is not due to chance. or ii) The data approve the null hypothesis ---> There is no difference between variables and the difference you see is due to chance. Now see types of error : ? There are two basic type of statistical errors : ? 1) Type I error 2) Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. o This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true False rejection of null hypothesis. o That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words ""we observe a difference when it is not true"" false positive. o One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. o Probability of type-I error is given by '13-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). o Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. o Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. o If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . o Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or error or false negative. o This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false -->False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one --4 False negative. o An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",A

"An 70-year-old male patient with uncontrolled hypertension has serum creatinine of 4.5, mild proteinuria. Renal ultrasound shows left kidney 9 cm and right kidney 7 cm in length {normal 10 cm). There was no obstruction. What is the next investigation of choice?",IVP,MR angiography,Isotope renogram,Retrograde pyelography,"Ans: C (Isotope renogram) Ref: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ednExplanation:Imaging Studies in Chronic Kidney DiseaseThe most useful imaging study is a Renal ultrasound.Advantages of Renal Ultrasoundo Verify the presence of two kidneyso Determine if they are symmetrico Provide an estimate of kidney sizeo Rule out renal masseso Evidence of obstruction.Since it takes time for kidneys to shrink as a result of chronic disease, the finding of bilaterally small kidneys supports the diagnosis of CKD of long-standing duration, with an irreversible component of scarring.If the kidney size is normal, it is possible that the renal disease is acute or subacute.The exceptions are diabetic nephropathy {where kidney size is increased at the onset of diabetic nephropathy before CKD with loss of GFR supervenes). Amyloidosis and HIV nephropathy, where kidney size may be normal in the face of CKD.Polycystic kidney disease that has reached some degree of renal failure will almost always present with enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts.A discrepancy >1 cm in kidney length suggests either a unilateral developmental abnormality or disease process or renovascular disease with arterial insufficiency affecting one kidney more than the other.The diagnosis of renovascular disease can be undertaken with different techniques, including Doppler sonography, nuclear medicine studies, or CT orMRI studies.If there is a suspicion of reflux nephropathy (recurrent childhood urinary tract infection, asymmetric renal size with scars on the renal poles), a voiding cystogram may be indicated.However, in most cases by the time the patient has CKD, the reflux has resolved, and even if still present, repair does not improve renal function.Radiographic contrast imaging studies are NOT particularly helpful in the investigation of CKD.Intravenous or intraarterial dye should be avoided where possible in the CKD patient, especially with diabetic nephropathy, because of the risk of radiographic contrast dye- induced renal failure.When unavoidable, appropriate precautionary measures include avoidance of hypovolemia at the time of contrast exposure, minimization of the dye load, and choice of radiographic contrast preparations with the least nephrotoxic potential.Additional measures thought to attenuate contrast-induced worsening of renal function include judicious administration of sodium bicarbonate-containing solutions and W-acetyl-cysteine.A retrograde pyelogram may be indicated if a high index of clinical suspicion for obstruction exists despite a negative finding on renal ultrasonography.Intravenous pyelography is not commonly performed, because of the potential for renal toxicity from the intravenous contrast; however, this procedure is often used to diagnose renal stones.A renal radionuclide scan can be used to screen for renal artery stenosis when performed with captopril administration; it also quantitates differential renal contribution to total glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, radionuclide scans are unreliable in patients with a GFR of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more useful for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis, although renal arteriography remains the criterion standard. However, MR! contrast is problematic in patients with existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) because they have a low, but potentially fatal, risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.",C

Incisura is absent in ?,Aoic valve replacement,Aoic stenosis,Cardiac tamponade,Hypovolumic shock,"The occurrence and magnitude of the incisura of the central aoic pressure were shown in 66 patients to depend on the functional state of the aoic valve. In normal subjects and children with congenital aoic stenosis (with thin flexible leaflets), the incisura ranged between 6 and 14 mm Hg. With aoic regurgitation, the incisura diminished as the severity of regurgitation increased. With calcific aoic stenosis, the incisura was smaller or absent. These observations imply a valve mechanism productive of the incisura. In vitro studies of human aoic valves confirmed these observations. Additional in vitro studies with high speed cinematography (2,000 frames/sec) of a stented normal porcine valve also showed that early diastolic stretch and recoil of the leaflets occurs. These results indicate that in the presence of a normal or diseased aoic valve the aoic incisura is produced primarily by valve distension or recoil, respectively. Distension and rebound of the aoic walls do not appear to contribute significantly in the presence of a normal or a diseased valve. Because acquired aoic valve disease affects the magnitude of the central aoic incisura, inspection of the incisura may be of ancillary valve in evaluating the pathologic state of the aoic valve.

In a social group a social act which is considered natural and right is referred to as –,Taboo,Ritual,Custom,Tradition,"Terms custom and tradition are used interchangeably. But there is a difference (though minute) between these two : -
Customs

It the established patterns of behavior that can be objectively verified within a particular society.
In simple words, it is the act (social act) which is commonplace considered to be normal for that society.
It should be keep in mind that custom of one society may be strange or abnormal to other society.

Traditions 

Traditions are a daily part of our lives which is herited by other persons.
That is Tradition is a custom that is handed down. That means : -
Custom is usual behavior (social act).
When custom is handed to other persons of society, the same act (custom) becomes tradition.

About other options.

Taboo → A tabbo is a social prohibition (ban) relating to any area of human activity (custom). Breaking of taboo is usually considered objectionable by society.
Ritual → It is a prescribed order of cremony.",C

Inherited MTC is usually present by the third decade of life. Inherited syndromes of medullary thyroid cancer are all transmitted in an autosomal dominant form. The mutation is detected in the tyrosine kinase proto-oncogene RET and can be identified in 98% of affected family members with appropriate screening. Also know: 6% of patients with sporadic medullary thyroid cancer carry a germline RET mutation. Genetic testing should, thus, be offered to all patients with newly diagnosed apparent sporadic disease. MEN 2B patients tend to exhibit more locally aggressive MTC , and screening with RET testing is recommended at age 6 months or prior; for familial MTC and MEN 2A screening is recommended by 5 years of age.

For a survey a village is divided into 5 lanes then each lane is sampled randomly is an example is ?,Simple random sampling,Stratified random sampling,Systemic random sampling,All of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Stratified random sampling Simple random sampling has been explained (See above explanation). Systematic random sampling In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a ceain way (for example, alphabetically). o A random staing point is selected and then every nth (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample. o That is, after arranging the individuals in ceain pattern (e.g., alpabetically) a staing point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular intervals. For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses. 120/8 = 15, So every 15th house is chosen after a random staing point between 1 and 15. If the random staing point is 11, then the houses selected are -4 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116. o In contrast to simple random sampling, some houses have a larger selection probabily e.g., in this question 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 100 and 116. While the remaining number can not be selected. Stratified random sampling When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. o Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling. o The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. o Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum. Population Stratification -4 Systematic random sampling -4 Sample. o This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error. o For example, suppose in a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hb estimation, first conve the population into homogenous striata (e.g., 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females by doing systematic random sampling. Now see the question o First the village has been stratified into five lanes. o Then random sampling is done on each lane. o It is stratified random sampling. Multistage random sampling: o Is done in successive stages; each successive sampling unit is nested in the previous sampling unit o Advantage: Introduces flexibility in sampling. o For example, in large country surveys, states are chosen, then districts, then villages, then every 10th person in village as final sampling unit. Multiphase random sampling: Is done in successive phase; pa of information is obtained from whole sample and pa from the sub-sample. o For example, in a TB survey, Mantourx test done in first phase, then X-ray done in all Mantoux positive, then sputum examined in all those with positive X-ary findings.",C

P-wave is absent in-,WPW syndrome,WPW syndrome,Ventricular Tachycardia,Ventricular Fibrillation,"WPW is commonly diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram in an asymptomatic individual. In this case, it is manifested as a delta wave, which is a slurred upstroke in the QRS complex that is associated with a sho PR interval. The sho PR interval and slurring of the QRS complex are reflective of the impulse making it to the ventricles early ( the accessory pathway) without the usual delay experienced in the AV node. If a person with WPW experiences episodes of atrial fibrillation, the ECG shows a rapid polymorphic wide-complex tachycardia (without torsades de pointes). This combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW is considered dangerous, and most antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1546 When an individual is in normal sinus rhythm, the ECG characteristics of WPW are a sho PR interval (less than 120 milliseconds in duration), widened QRS complex (greater than 120 milliseconds in duration) with slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, and secondary repolarization changes (reflected in ST segment-T wave changes). In individuals with WPW, electrical activity that is initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, as well as through the AV node to activate the ventricles both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing propeies of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards the AV node. This gives the sho PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex known as the delta wave. In case of type A pre-excitation (left atrioventricular connections), a positive R wave is seen in V1 (""positive delta"") on the precordial leads of the electrocardiogram, while in type B pre-excitation (right atrioventricular connections), a predominantly negative delta wave is seen in lead V1 (""negative delta"" Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 468",B

Which of the following statements about Wilson's disease is true,Low serum ceruloplasim and low urinary copper,Low serum ceruloplasim and high urinary copper,High serum ceruloplasmin and low urinary copper,High serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton .

Which of the following patients would LEAST likely require a bone marrow examination?,Adult with pancytopenia and a normal mean corpuscular volume,Adult with a myeloproliferative disease,Adult with a monoclonal spike on a serum protein electrophoresis,"Adult with fever and a WBC of 20,000 cells/l with a left shift","An adult with fever and a white blood cell count of 20,000 cells/l with a left shift has an infection, which is not an indication for a bone marrow examination. Pancytopenia; documenting a myeloproliferative disease; ruling out multiple myeloma as the cause of a monoclonal spike; and evaluating a child with the fever, bone pain, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and an increased lymphocyte count for possible acute lymphoblastic leukemia are all valid indications for a bone marrow examination. Other indications include the work-up of metastatic disease to bone and staging for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. As a general rule, bone marrow aspirates/biopsies are not usually necessary in: Diagnosing iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease, because iron studies are adequate Thalassemia syndromes, because hemoglobin electrophoresis is the gold standard test B12 or folate deficiency, because Bib red blood cell folate, and serum folate levels are usually sufficient Hemolytic anemias, because the reticulocyte count (marker for all hemolytic anemias), the direct and indirect Coombs test (autoimmune anemias), osmotic fragility (congenital spherocytosis), Heinz body preparations (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency), and hemoglobin electrophoresis (sickle cell and its variants) are sufficient in most cases Most bone marrow examinations are performed on the posterior iliac crest, since both a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may be obtained in this area. A ""dry tap"" means that nothing was obtained on the bone marrow aspirate. A ""dry tap"" may be due to faulty positioning of the needle (most common cause), a marrow packed with cells (leukemia), a marrow replaced by fibrous tissue (agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and myelofibrosis secondary to metastatic disease), or anaplastic marrow. Normal components of a bone marrow examination and repo include: An evaluation of cellularity. Normally, there is an approximately 30% fat to 70% cell ratio (varies with age). Calculation of the myeloid to erythroid ratio, which is normally 3: 1 An evaluation of hematopoietic cell morphology and adequacy of numbers of megakaryocytes (platelet production) An estimate of the status of marrow iron stores with the Prussian blue stain. Absent iron characterizes iron deficiency; excess iron the anemia of chronic inflammation; and ringed sideroblasts, a sideroblastic anemia.
