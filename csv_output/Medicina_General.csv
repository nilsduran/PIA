"Hardness of water is expressed per litre (m Eq/L), one unit which is equivalent to which one of the following.",20 mg CaCO3 (20 ppm),30 mg CaCO3 (30 ppm),40 mg CaCO3 (40 ppm),50 mg CaCO3 (50 ppm),"Hardness of water

Hardness of water is defined as the soap-destroying power of water.
Water is considered to be bard if large amounts of soap are required to produce lather.
The hardness is caused by high mineral content, Mainly calcium and magnesium cations.
Hardness may be : -

i) Temporary (Carbonate) hardness → Calcium bicarbonate & Magnesium bicarbonate.

It is called temporary because it can be removed by boiling or addition of lime.

ii) Permanent (Non-Carbonate) hardness → Calcium Sulfate, magnesium sulfate, Calcium chloride, magnesium chloride.

It is called permanent because it cannot be removed by boiling.
Hardness is expressed in terms of mili-equilents per litre (mEq/L).
One mEq/L of hardness - producing ion is equal to 50 mg CaCO3 (50ppm) in one litre of water.",D

Wilson's disease is characterized by,Low serum ceruloplasmin and low urinary copper,Low serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper,High serum ceruloplasmin and low urinary copper,High serum ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton .

True statement about GERD -,Associated with H. pylori,Fundoplication is done,Smoking is protective,PPI is used in treatment,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in heaburn affects approximately 30% of the general population. Pathophysiology -Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Several factors are known to be involved in the development of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing. Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance , Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time.

In a patient with NIDDM which of the following condition is seen :,Ketosis commonly occurs on stopping treatment,Hyperiglyceridmia never occurs,Pancreatic beta cells stop producing insulin,"Increased levels of insulin in blood, may be seen","Answer is D (Increased levels of insulin in blood may be seen): The prominent mechanism involved in pathogenesis of NIDDM is 'insulin resistance' i.e. the decreased ability of insulin to act effectively on peripheral tissues. This insulin resistance is relative and supra normal levels of insulin are still capable of normalizing blood glucose. In NIDDM (type II DM) insulin secretion initially increases in response to insulin resistance to maintain normal glucose levels in blood. Thus increased levels of insulin in blood may be seen in patients with NIDDM or type II DM. Pancreatic 1 cells respond by an initial increase in insulin secretion. They are however unable to maintain there hyperinsulinemia for long and gradually as the disease progresses insulin levels decline. Secretion of insulin from )6' cells may thus decrease but it never stops completely. Ketosis or diabetic Ketoacidosis is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes mellitus. It is typically seen in patients of type I D.M or IDDM who either are untreated, inadequately treated or have stopped treatment-API 7th/1113 Individuals with DM may have several forms of dyslipidemia Dplipidentias are more frequent in type II DM or NIDDM The most common patterns of dyslipidemia is hyperiglyceredemia & reduced HDL cholestrol",D

Macrophages obtained from granulomatous tissue conve 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D at an increased rate. There is a positive correlation in patients with sarcoidosis between 25(OH)D levels (reflecting vitamin D intake) and the circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2 D, whereas normally there is no increase in 1,25(OH) 2 D with increasing 25(OH) D levels due to multiple feedback controls on renal 1a-hydroxylase . The usual regulation of active metabolite production by calcium and phosphate or by PTH does not operate in these patients. Clearance of 1,25(OH) 2 D from blood may be decreased in sarcoidosis as well.

Virus causing rabies in man is: March 2005,Wild virus,Street virus,Fixed virus,All of the above,"Ans. B: Street virus The rabies virus is the type species of the Lyssavirus genus, which encompasses other similar viruses. Lyssaviruses have helical symmetry, with a length of about 180 nm and a cross-sectional diameter of about 75 nm. These viruses are enveloped and have a single stranded RNA genome with negative-sense. The genetic information is packaged as a ribonucleoprotein complex in which RNA is tightly bound by the viral nucleoprotein. The RNA genome of the virus encodes five genes whose order is highly conserved: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and the viral RNA polymerase (L). From the point of entry, the virus is neurotropic, traveling quickly along the neural pathways into the central nervous system (CNS), and then fuher into other organs. The salivary glands receive high concentrations of the virus thus allowing fuher transmission. The virus recovered from naturally occurring cases of rabies is called street virus and is pathogenic for all mammals and shows a long variable incubation period (20-60 days in dogs).",B

Renal replacement therapy replaces all except:,Endocrine function,Urine output,Blood biochemistry,Ultrafiltration,"Ans: a (Endocrine function) Ref: Davidson, 20th ed, p. 491RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPYThe facility to replace some functions of the kidney artificially by dialysis has been available since the 1960s. Such treatment is now routine in patients with acute or chronic renal failure. It does not replace the endocrine and metabolic functions of the kidney, but aims to maintain the plasma biochemistry (uraemic toxins, electrolytes and acid-base status) at acceptable levels. Dialysis can also remove fluid from the circulation (ultrafiltration) to maintain euvolaemia. The major side-effects of dialysis relate to haemodynamic disturbance caused by fluid removal or the extracorporeal circulation of blood, and reactions between blood and components of the dialysis system (bioincompatibility)",A

Celiac sprue causes malabsorption syndrome due,Coliform infection ofsmall bowel,Lactase deficiency,Hypersensitivity to dietary gluten,Ischaemia of celiac aery,"Coeliac disease is an inflammatory disorder of the small bowel occurring in genetically susceptible individuals, which results from intolerance to wheat gluten and similar proteins found in rye, barley and, to a lesser extent, oats. It can result in malabsorption and responds to a gluten-free diet. The condition occurs worldwide but is more common in nohern Europe. The prevalence in the UK is approximately 1%, although 50% of these people are asymptomatic. These include both undiagnosed 'silent' cases of the disease and cases of 'latent' coeliac disease - genetically susceptible people who may later develop clinical coeliac disease. Pathophysiology The precise mechanism of mucosal damage is unclear but immunological responses to gluten play a key role . There is a strong genetic component, with around 10% of first-degree relatives of an index case affected, and there is strong (approximately 75%) concordance in monozygotic twins. There is a strong association with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2/DQ8. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been identified but it is unclear if this is pathological or a response to the underlying mucosal changes Clinical features Coeliac disease can present at any age. In infancy, it occurs after weaning on to cereals and typically presents with diarrhoea, malabsorption and failure to thrive. In older children, it may present with non-specific features, such as delayed growth. Features of malnutrition are found on examination and mild abdominal distension may be present. Affected children have growth and pubeal delay, leading to sho stature in adulthood. In adults, the disease usually presents during the third or fouh decade and females are affected twice as often as males. The presentation is highly variable, depending on the severity and extent of small bowel involvement. Some have florid malabsorption, while others develop non-specific symptoms, such as tiredness, weight loss, folate deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. Other presentations include oral ulceration, dyspepsia and bloating. Unrecognised coeliac disease is associated with mild under-nutrition and osteoporosis. Coeliac disease is associated with other HLA-linked autoimmune disorders and with ceain other diseases . In some centres, people at higher risk of developing coeliac disease, such as those with type 1 diabetes, may undergo periodic antibody screening. Such screening may identify people with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease; there is controversy about the optimum management strategy for such individuals.

When it is slow, the gross appearance of the skin resembles myxedema because of the edematous condition of the face and limbs. Particularly striking are bright red erythematous areas rather than the dark postmortem lividity blotches usually noted. Bullae may occur over areas of chronic pressure or contact. When death follows rapid cooling, the lack of cyanosis in the skin in hypostatic areas is the significant external sign.INTERNALLY: Even with rapid cooling, and minimal external signs, internal examination demonstrated conclusive features. In order of frequency, gastrointestinal lesions are noted in about 90% of cases and about 80% in the pancreas. In the gastrointestinal tract, order of frequency of involvement is the stomach, the duodenum, and occasionally the esophagus. Seen early, the lesions consist of many small submucosal hemorrhages (black in color). Later, lesions present as small shallow ulcers. Gross pancreatic changes vary from focal fat necrosis to severe hemorrhage of the pancreas and nearby tissue.

Mainstay of treatment of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus is:,Desmopressin,Thiazide / Amiloride diuretics and salt restriction,Desmopressin and salt restriction,Vasopressin and salt restriction,"Answer is B (Thiazide / Amiloride diuretics and salt restriction): The treatment of Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus is usually achieved through a combination of thiazide / amiloride diureties and dietary salt restriction. A prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor (indomethacin) may be added. Thiazide diuretics and salt restriction can reduce urinary output by inducing a state of mild volume contraction thereby promoting increased proximal reabsorption of isotonic fluid and inhibiting the delivery of free water to the collecting duct. A combination of thiazide - amiloride formulation will avoid thiazide induced hypokalemia. Addition of Indomethacin may fuher reduce urinary output by inhibiting prostaglanding synthesis-Harrison Thiazide diuretics in combination with amiloride and indomethacin are the most useful pharmacological agents in the treatment of Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus'- Pediatric Endocrinology (CDC Press) 2007/668 Desmopressin is usually ineffective in Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus.

C. G. appearance.But an important point to noteIt does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia.Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium.""Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelsThe goals of the therapy for the t/t of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:-Antagonize the affect of K+ on excitable cell membranesRedistribution of extracellular potassium into cellsEnhance elimination of potassium from the bodyAntagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membraneCalcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia.It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes.Calcium for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt.The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis.The onset of action is < 3 minutes.The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time further measures may be undertaken to lower pK.Redistribution of potassium into cells InsulinInsulin shifts potassium into cells.Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ K+ ATPase.I. V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium level Q.The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes.Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia.It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release.The administration of hypertonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasonsEndogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect.There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypertonicity. b adrenoceptor agonistsThese drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell.High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours,The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol.Patients taking nonselective b adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterolEven among patient's not taking b blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol.The mechanism for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond.For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. BicarbonateBicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate.It has now been demonstrated that short term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause K+shift into cells.Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift K+ into cells even after several hours.It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary K+ elimination in patients with some kidney function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated.Elimination of potassium from the bodyHyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency.However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron.Sodium bicarbonateA sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis.The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis.Exchange resinSodium polystyrene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin.In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium.Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut.There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemiaThe first is its slow effectWhen given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs.The second is its adverse effectIt can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis""Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body"".The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",C

"A 42 year old male has strong positive Benedict's test, random blood sugar is > 163 mg%, fasting blood sugar is >200 mg% Next line of investigation is-",Urine glucose chaing 5 hourly,OralGTT,Repeat benedict's test,24 hr urine sugar estimation,"Urine testing Glucose -Testing the urine for glucose with dipsticks is a common screening procedure for detecting diabetes. If possible, testing should be performed on urine passed 1-2 hours after a meal to maximise sensitivity. Glycosuria always warrants fuher assessment by blood testing (see below). The greatest disadvantage of urinary glucose measurement is the individual variation in renal threshold for glucose. The most frequent cause of glycosuria is a low renal threshold, which is common during pregnancy and in young people; the resulting 'renal glycosuria' is a benign condition unrelated to diabetes. Another disadvantage is that some drugs (such as b-lactam antibiotics, levodopa and salicylates) may interfere with urine glucose tests. Ketones -Ketone bodies can be identified by the nitroprusside reaction, which measures acetoacetate, using either tablets or dipsticks. Ketonuria may be found in normal people who have been fasting or exercising strenuously for long periods, who have been vomiting repeatedly, or who have been eating a diet high in fat and low in carbohydrate. Ketonuria is therefore not pathognomonic of diabetes but, if associated with glycosuria, the diagnosis of diabetes is highly likely. In diabetic ketoacidosis (p. 811), ketones can also be detected in plasma using test sticks (see below). Protein -Standard dipstick testing for albumin detects urinary albumin at concentrations above 300 mg/L, but smaller amounts (microalbuminuria, see Box 17.13, p. 476) can only be measured using specific albumin dipsticks or by quantitative biochemical laboratory measurement. Microalbuminuria or proteinuria, in the absence of urinary tract infection, is an impoant indicator of diabetic nephropathy and/or increased risk of macrovascular disease (p. 830). Blood testing Glucose- Laboratory glucose testing in blood relies upon an enzymatic reaction (glucose oxidase) and is cheap, usually automated and highly reliable. However, blood glucose levels depend on whether the patient has eaten recently, so it is impoant to consider the circumstances in which the blood sample was taken. Blood glucose can also be measured with colorimetric or other testing sticks, which are often read with a poable electronic meter. These are used for capillary (fingerprick) testing to monitor diabetes treatment (p. 810). There is some debate as to whether selfmonitoring in people with type 2 diabetes improves glycaemic control. Many countries now only offer selfmonitoring to people with type 2 diabetes taking blood glucose concentration should be estimated using an accurate laboratory method rather than a poable technique.Glucose concentrations are lower in venous than aerial or capillary (fingerprick) blood. Whole blood glucose concentrations are lower than plasma concentrations because red blood cells contain relatively little glucose. Venous plasma values are usually the most reliable for diagnostic purposes (Boxes 21.10 and 21.11). Ketones -Blood ketone monitoring is increasingly available. Urinary ketone measurements described above are semi-quantitative, difficult to perform and retrospective (i.e. the urine has accumulated over several hours), and do not measure the major ketone in blood during diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), beta-hydroxybutyrate (bOHB). Whole blood ketone monitoring detects b-OHB and is useful in assisting with insulin adjustment during intercurrent illness or sustained hyperglycaemia to prevent or detect DKA. Blood ketone monitoring is also useful in monitoring resolution of DKA in hospitalised patients (Box 21.7). Glycated haemoglobin Glycated haemoglobin provides an accurate and objective measure of glycaemic control integrated over a period of weeks to months. In diabetes, the slow non-enzymatic covalent attachment of glucose to haemoglobin (glycation) increases the amount in the HbA1 (HbA1c) fraction relative to nonglycated adult haemoglobin (HbA0). These fractions can be separated by chromatography; laboratories may repo glycated haemoglobin as total glycated haemoglobin (GHb), HbA1 or HbA1c. In most countries, HbA1c is the preferred measurement. The rate of formation of HbA1c is directly propoional to the ambient blood glucose concentration; a rise of 1% in HbA1c corresponds to an approximate average increase of 2 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) in blood glucose. Although HbA1c concentration reflects the integrated blood glucose control over the lifespan of erythrocytes (120 days), HbA1c is most sensitive to changes in glycaemic control occurring in the month before measurement.

Prion disease may manifest as?,Sporadic,Inherited,Familial,All of the above,"Ans. d (All of the above) (Ref. Nostric Warden Principles of Neurology, p. 224)PRIONS are Proteinaceous particles devoid of nucleic acid, that cause slowly evolving spongiform degeneration of central nervous system without production of immune response and due to abnormality of protein folding. Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a normal (predominantly (3-helical) protein termed prion protein (PrPc) to a a-pleated form (PrPsc), which is transmissible. PrPsc resists protease degradation and facilitates the conversion of still more PrPc to PrPsc. Accumulation of PrPsc results in spongiform encephalopathy and dementia, ataxia, and death. It can be sporadic (Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease--rapidly progressive dementia), inherited (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), or acquired (kuru).New concepts have emerged from studies of prions:(1) Prions are the only known infectious pathogens that are devoid of nucleic acid; all other infectious agents possess genomes composed of either RNA or DNA that direct the synthesis of their progeny.(2) Prion diseases may be manifest as infectious, genetic, and sporadic disorders; no other group of illnesses with a single etiology presents with such a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations.(3) Prion diseases result from the accumulation of PrPSc, the conformation of which differs substantially from that of its precursor, PrPC.(4) PrPSc can exist in a variety of different conformations, each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype.Master's Criteria for GD (1979)* NeuropaBiologically confirmed spongiform encqdialopathy in a patient of progressive demantia with any one of the following:* Myoclonus (90% cases)* Extrapyramidal signs (80% cases)* Pyramidal signs (55% cases)* EEG (triphasic electrical Bursts)* Cerebellar signs (30% cases)",D

Most impoant measure to prevent hospital infection ?,Use of antibiotics,Use of antiseptics,Proper hand washing,Formalin fumigation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Proper hand washing There are following types of modes of transmission of hospital-acquired infections : 1) Contact transmission It is the most common and most preventable means of transmission. It is divided into two types - Direct contact : It involves contact of body surface to body surface with a physical transfer of microorganisms. Hand contact is most common mode of transmission. Indirect contact : It involves body surface contact with a contaminated intermediate object. As hand contact is the most common mode of transmission, the best preventive measure of nosocomial infection is proper hand hygiene. 2) Droplet transmission It occurs when droplet containing microorganisms from an infected person are propelled through the air (e.g. coughing, sneezing) and land on the mouth, eyes or nose of another person. 3) Airborne transmission It results when a droplet containing microorganisms evaporates and remains suspended in air for a long time (this should not be confused with droplet infection, in which transmission is immediate and droplets do not remains suspended in the air). Airborne transmission also occurs by dust paicles containing microorganism. 4) Vehicle transmission It refers to transmission of infection by contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices and equipment.",C

"All of the follwing may be associated with thymoma, Except",SIADH,Myaesthenia gravis,Hypogammaglobulinemia,Cushing's syndrome,"Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is characterized by excessive unsuppressible release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) either from the posterior pituitary gland, or an abnormal non-pituitary source. Unsuppressed ADH causes an unrelenting increase in solute-free water being returned by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation non associated with thymoma The causes of SIADH are grouped into six categories: 1) central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus, the site of control of ADH secretion; 2) various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH; 3) various lung diseases; 4) numerous drugs that chemically stimulate the hypothalamus; 5) inherited mutations; and 6) miscellaneous largely transient conditions. ADH is derived from a preprohormone precursor that is synthesized in cells in the hypothalamus and stored in vesicles in the posterior pituitary. Appropriate ADH secretion is regulated by osmoreceptors on the hypothalamic cells that synthesize and store ADH: plasma hypeonicity activates these receptors, ADH is released into the blood stream, the kidney increases solute-free water return to the circulation, and the hypeonicity is alleted. Inappropriate (increased) ADH secretion causes an unrelenting increase in solute-free water (""free water"") absorption by the kidneys, with two consequences. First, in the extracellular fluid (ECF) space, there is a dilution of blood solutes, causing hypoosmolality, including a low sodium concentration - hyponatremia. Then viually simultaneously, in the intracellular space, cells swell, i.e. intracellular volume increases. Swelling of brain cells causes various neurological abnormalities which in severe or acute cases can result in convulsions, coma, and death. Potential treatments of SIADH include restriction of fluid intake, correction of an identifiable reversible underlying cause, and/or medication which promotes solute-free water excretion by the kidney. The presence of cerebral edema may necessitate intravenous isotonic or hypeonic saline administration.SIADH was originally described in 1957 in two people with small-cell carcinoma of the lung.

It arises through a combination of the normal circadian rhythm and release of counter-regulatory hormones (growth hormone, coisol, glucagon and epinephrine) during the later pa of the night which increases insulin resistance, causing blood sugar to rise, as well as diminishing levels of overnight insulin. Steps that may help include eating dinner earlier in the evening, avoiding carbohydrate intake at bedtime, doing something active after dinner (such as going for a walk), moving the long-acting insulin from before the evening meal to bedtime, switch to a different medication, use an insulin pump to administer extra insulin during early-morning hours.

They include hand washing before and after contact with every patient and the use of gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection when contact with open sores, blood, or body secretions is anticipated. Contact precautions reduce the risk of spreading microorganisms that are transmitted by direct or indirect contact. They include private room placement of the patient and the use of gloves and gowns when in contact with the patient or the immediate environment. Contact precautions are indicated in patients colonized or infected with MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and C difficile.Droplet precautions limit the transmission of infections that are carried in respiratory droplets (>5 mm in size) such as influenza and meningococcal meningitis. Droplet precautions include placing the patient in a private room and asking health care professionals to use surgical masks within 3 ft from the patient.

Drug for management of hypeension in Phaeochromocytoma,Phenoxybenzamine,Phentolamine,Labetalol,Esmolol,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Phenoxybenzamine Once a pheochromocytoma is diagnosed, all patients should undergo a resection of the pheochromocytoma following appropriate medical preparation. Resetting a pheochromocytoma is a high-risk surgical procedure and an experienced surgeon/anesthesiologist team is required. Some form of preoperative pharmacologic preparation is indicated for all patients with catecholamine-secreting neoplasms. Preoperative medical therapy is aimed at: Controlling hypeension (including preventing a hypeensive crisis during surgery) o Volume expansion In patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytomas who undergo surgery for other reasons (and who therefore have not undergone preoperative medical therapy), surgical moality rates are high due to lethal hypeensive crises, malignant arrhythmias, and multiorgan failure. Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade Combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade is the most common approach to control blood pressure and prevent intraoperative hypeensive crises. Alpha-adrenergic blockade An alpha-adrenergic blocker is given 10 to 14 days preoperatively to normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume. Phenoxybenzamine is the preferred drug for preoperative preparation to control blood pressure and arrhythmia in most centers in the United States. It is an irreversible, long-acting, nonspecific alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. The initial dose is 10 mg once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every two to three days as needed to control blood pressure and spells. The final dose of phenoxybenzamine is typically between 20 and 100 mg daily. Beta-adrenergic blockade After adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade has been achieved, beta-adrenergic blockade is initiated, which typically occurs two to three days preoperatively. The beta-adrenergic blocker should never be staed first because blockade of vasodilatory peripheral betaadrenergic receptors with unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation can lead to a fuher elevation in blood pressure. The alternatives to a and 13 adrenergic agents are calcium channel blockers and metyrosine. Calcium channel blockers Although perioperative alpha-adrenergic blockade is widely recommended, a second regimen that has been utilized involves the administration of a calcium channel blocker. Nicardipine is the most commonly used calcium channel blocker in this setting; the staing dose is 30 mg twice daily of the sustained release preparation. Metyrosine Another approach involves the administration of metyrosine (alpha-methyl Para-tyrosine), which inhibits catecholamine synthesis.",A

Which part is first involved by mummification?,Heart,Skin,Stomach,Muscles,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Skin Mummification* It is also a modification of putrefaction, which occurs in the absence of moisture. That is when there is excess air and warmth but no moisture (humidity), i.e. hot dry and windy climate, mummification takes place in place of normal putrefaction. Thus mummification occurs in deserts, especially in summer and also in bodies buried in shallow grave in sandy soil.* Mummification is characterized by dessication or drying of the dead body. There is drying, dehydration and shriveling of dead body. It proceeds from exterior to interior. Therefore first to be involved is skin, especially of exposed body parts like lips, nose tip, hands (fingers) and feet (toes). The skin is shrunken, contracted, dry, brittle, leathery, streched across bony prominences and rusty brown to black in color. Internal viscera also dry up, darken in color and blend with each other to form a single mass. Body emits smell like rotten cheese. Facial features and injuries are well preserved, thus identification of body and cause of death can be determined (like adipocere formation).* Time required for mummification varies between 3 months - 2 years. If properly preserved, a mummified body can remain for years. Chronic arsenic or antimony poisoning favor mummification.* Medicolegal importance: (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

In the list of bioterrorism which of the following belongs to category A ?,Plague,Brucella,SARS,E. coli 157: H7,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Plague Bioterrorism A bioterrorism attack is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, or other germs (agents) used to cause illness or death in people, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but it is possible that they could be changed to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicine, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, through water, or in food. Terrorists may use biological agents because they can be extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, can not. Bioterrorism Agent Categories Bioterrorism agents can be separated into three categories, depending on how easily they can be spread and the severity of illness or death they cause. Category A agents are considered the highest risk and Category C agents are those that are considered emerging threats for disease. Category A These high-priority agents include organisms or toxins that pose the highest risk to the public and national security because: They can be easily spread or transmitted from person to person They result in high death rates and have the potential for major public health impact. They might cause public panic and social disruption They require special action for public health preparedness. Category B These agetns are the second highest priority because They are moderately easy to spread They result in moderate illness rates and low death rates They require specific enhancements of CDC's laboratory capacity and enhanced disease monitoring. Category C These third highest priority agents include emerging pathogens that could be engineered for mass spread in the future because: They are easily available They are easily produced and spread They have potential for high morbidity and moality rates and major health impact.",A

All of the following statements about SIADH are true except:,"Serum sodium is low, typically < 135 meq/1",Urinary sodium excretion is low / normal,Water loading test may be used,Vaptans are new FDA approved agents for treatment of SIADH,"Answer is B (Urinary sodium excretion is low / normal): SIADH is typically characterized by high urinary sodium (Increased rate of excretion of. odium). Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion (SIADH) is associated with increased secretion of vasopressin (ADH), which leads to increased absorption of water producing dilutional hyponatremia (serum sodium typically < 135 meq/l) along with concentrated or hyperosmolar urine. Excessive retention of water stimulates compensatory mechanisms that enhance Watriuresis'. Natriuresis results in increased urinary sodium excretion rate increased urinary sodium concentration) and is believed to compensate for increased volume from inappropriaye ADH secretion preventing a state of clinical hypervolemia, hypeension or edema. SIADH is associated low serum sodium levels ( Cardinal features of SIADH include: Hyponatremia (dilutional hyponatremia with Na+ < 135 mmo1/1) Decreased plasma osmolality (increased urine osmolality > 150 m osm). High Urine sodium (over 20 meq4) Low Blood urea Nitrogen < 10 mg/L Hypouricemia ( Clinical Euvolemia - Absence of signs of hypervolemia (edema, ascitis) - Absence of signs of hypovolemia (ohostatic hypotension, tachycardia, features of dehydration) Absence of cardiac, liver or renal disease Normal thyroid and adrenal function A high BUN suggests a volume contracted state and excludes a diagnosis of SIADH. Water loading test may be used to help diagnosis of SIADH Water loading test is recognized as a 'supplemental criteria' in establishing a diagnosis of SIADH.

Which of the following is associated with emotional valence and is most likely to be influenced by motivation –,Attitude,Belief,Practice,Knowledge,"Emotional valence
Emotional valence means the intrinsic attractiveness (positive valence) or aversiveness (negative valence) of an event, object or situation. That means positive or negative emotional feeling of an event, object or situation.
Amongst the given options two have emotional components:
Attitude
Effects of emotional components (affect) on attitude also show the importance of affective content. In general, people with positive mood tend to like things more than people in a neutral or negative mood.
Attitude is usually fixed and stable → not influenced by motivation.
Practice (Habit)
Practice refers to an established way of doing things. It is the usual way of action and on accustomed act performed without thinking.
While the term habit is used for individual actions, the term practice is generally used for a set of fixed habits.
Practices (Habits) are usually formed as a result of positive emotional valence (intrinsic attractiveness).
Examples of habit/practice in the field of health include (few examples):


Good habits: hand washing prior to eating, exercise etc
is ad habits: Smoking, drinking.


By motivation, bad habits can be converted into good ones → Habits are influenced by motivation.

So,

Attitude has emotional component but attitude is not influenced by motivation (fixed and stable)
Practice/habit has emotional component and Practice habit can be influenced by motivation.",C

He is likely to be having-,Atrial septal defect,Large ventricular septal defect,Small ventricular septal defect,Eisenmenger's syndrome,"ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a defect in the ventricular septum, the wall dividing the left and right ventricles of the hea. The extent of the opening may vary from pin size to complete absence of the ventricular septum, creating one common ventricle. The ventricular septum consists of an inferior muscular and superior membranous poion and is extensively innervated with conducting cardiomyocytes signs and symptoms Ventricular septal defect is usually symptomless at bih. It usually manifests a few weeks after bih. VSD is an acyanotic congenital hea defect, aka a left-to-right shunt, so there are no signs of cyanosis in the early stage. However, uncorrected VSD can increase pulmonary resistance leading to the reversal of the shunt and corresponding cyanosis. Pansystolic (Holosystolic) murmur along lower left sternal border (depending upon the size of the defect) +/- palpable thrill (palpable turbulence of blood flow). Hea sounds are normal. Larger VSDs may cause a parasternal heave, a displaced apex beat (the palpable heabeat moves laterally over time, as the hea enlarges). An infant with a large VSD will fail to thrive and become sweaty and tachypnoeic (breathe faster) with feeds. The restrictive ventricular septal defects (smaller defects) are associated with a louder murmur and more palpable thrill (grade IV murmur). Larger defects may eventually be associated with pulmonary hypeension due to the increased blood flow. Over time this may lead to an Eisenmenger's syndrome the original VSD operating with a left-to-right shunt, now becomes a right-to-left shunt because of the increased pressures in the pulmonary vascular bed ref Harrison20th edition pg 1299",B

As soon as intravascular hemolysis begins, serum levels of which of the following will decrease?",Bilirubin,C-reactive protein,Free iron,Haptoglobin,"Haptoglobin (or alpha-2 globulin) is a serum protein that promptly binds to free hemoglobin in the serum, forming a tight complex. The haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex is quickly cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system, which allows the hemoglobin to be salvaged instead of lost into the urine. Intravascular hemolysis from any cause is rapidly followed by a dramatic drop in serum haptoglobin. Bilirubin is synthesized in the liver and spleen as an end-product of heme degradation. Serum bilirubin levels would not change until the haptoglobin in the blood was completely saturated, and free hemoglobin began to circulate. In this circumstance, serum bilirubin would increase, not decrease. C-reactive protein an acute phase reactant produced by the liver in increased quantity in response to inflammation. This patient's urinary tract infection would increase C-reactive protein levels, but the hemolysis would not fuher affect them. Serum free iron does not change appreciably in intravascular hemolysis. Ferrous iron in the red blood cell is complexed to hemoglobin, and this complex is not broken in hemolysis. Ref: Beutler E. (2010). Chapter 42. Disorders of Iron Metabolism. In J.T. Prchal, K.

On physical examination, there is tender swelling of the right calf without erythema. His D-dimer is 640 ng/mL. Venous Doppler of the right leg reveals occlusive thrombi in the deep veins. A plan is made to initiate anticoagulation and to extend the treatment for 6 months.What will be the drug of choice for anticoagulation for this patient?",Rivaroxaban,Low-molecular-weight heparin,Warfarin,Low dose aspirin (81 mg/d),"Malignancy is a recognized risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and VTE is the second leading cause of death in cancer patients. Procoagulant molecules expressed both by cancer cells and host tissue contribute to this condition. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is the preferred anticoagulant for long-term treatment in patients with cancer. When compared with warfarin, LMWH reduces the rate of recurrent VTE without significant risk of bleeding. Newer anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban have not been adequately tested for cancer-induced VTE yet.Young patients with unprovoked VTE, a history of unexplained VTE, or family history of VTE raise the suspicion of an inherited hypercoagulable disorder. The common inherited hypercoagulable disorders are Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, protein S deficiency, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. When inherited hypercoagulable disorders are strongly suspected, tests for above mentioned disorders can be ordered. In the event of an acute thrombosis, however, it is not recommended to test for protein C, protein S, and anti-thrombin III since active coagulation can reduce the plasma concentration of these proteins resulting in false-positive result. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to order only Factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and antiphospholipid antibody with acute VTE or when patients are on warfarin.Warfarin-induced skin necrosis results from a transient hypercoagulable state. Warfarin initially affects all the vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins (Factors II, VII, IX, X, and proteins C and S). Since Protein C has a short half-life (8-12 hours), the serum protein C concentration drops quickly to 50% of normal in first 24 hours. Since circulating levels of other vitamin K-dependent proteins are still high, this gives rise to a hypercoagulable state which may cause microthrombi in the dermal and subcutaneous vessels, resulting in skin necrosis. The risk is particularly high in case of congenital protein C deficiency; nearly one-third cases of warfarin-induced skin necrosis are associated with congenital protein C deficiency.",B

A patient of left hemiplegia with previous history of right deep vein thrombosis. Cause of hemoptysis in this patient is?,Pulmonary thromboembolism,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Fat Embolism,Superior Vena Cava Syndrome,"Pulmonary thromboembolism REF: Harrison's Internal Medicine 17th edition Chapter 256. Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Thromboembolism PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM: Pathophysiology When venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary aerial circulation or, paradoxically, to the aerial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic. With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent inseion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE. Pathophysiological abnormalities include: The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased aerial P02) and an increased alveolar-aerial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungs Increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin. Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface. Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptors Increased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchi Decreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactant Signs & Symptoms Sudden-onset dyspnea (shoness of breath) Tachypnea (rapid breathing) Chest pain of a ""pleuritic"" nature (worsened by breathing) Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the hea. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct) A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudative A low-grade fever may be present, paicularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE Risk factors The most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses. The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchow's triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the propeies of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present. Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel), pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant) Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTE Factors affecting the propeies of the blood (procoagulant state) Estrogen-containing hormonal contraception Genetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders) Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants) Diagnosis D-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of ceainty, an indication of absence of a PE The gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiography CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right hea catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to patients Ventilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung scintigraphy), which shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is used less often because of the more widespread availability of CT technology, however, it may be useful in patients who have an allergy to iodinated contrast or in pregnancy due to lower radiation exposure than CT",A
The criteria for validity of a screening test are -,Accuracy,Predictability,Sensitivity & Specificity,Cost effectiveness,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Predictability Screening test to be applied o The screening test to be applied should fulfil the following impoant criteria before it is considered suitable for screening : ? 1. Acceptability The test should be acceptable to the people at whom it is aimed. In general painful or embarrasing tests e.g., per rectal or vaginal examination are not likely to be acceptable. 2. Repeatability (reliability) Repeatability means, the test must give consistent results when it is repeated more than once on the same individual under same conditions. That means the results of test are precise (exact), So repeatability is some time called precision, reliability or reproducibility. 3. Validity (accuracy) Validity refers to what extent the test accurately measures which is purpos to measures. That means a valid test distinguish the people who have the disease from those who do not.

Niacin should be avoided in patients with -,Peptic ulcer,Hypeension,Alzheimer's disease,rkinsonism,"NSAIDs Treatment with NSAIDs is associated with peptic ulcers due to impairment of mucosal defences . Niacin should be avoided in patients with peptic ulcers Smoking Smoking confers an increased risk of gastric ulcer and, to a lesser extent, duodenal ulcer. Once the ulcer has formed, it is more likely to cause complications and less likely to heal if the patient continues to smoke. Clinical features Peptic ulcer disease is a chronic condition with spontaneous relapses and remissions lasting for decades, if not for life. The most common presentation is with recurrent abdominal pain that has three notable characteristics: localisation to the epigastrium, relationship to food and episodic occurrence. Occasional vomiting occurs in about 40% of ulcer subjects; persistent daily vomiting suggests gastric outlet obstruction. In one-third, the history is less characteristic, especially in elderly people or those taking NSAIDs. In this situation, pain may be absent or so slight that it is experienced only as a vague sense of epigastric unease. Occasionally, the only symptoms are anorexia and nausea, or early satiety after meals. In some patients, the ulcer is completely 'silent', presenting for the first time with anaemia from chronic undetected blood loss, as abrupt haematemesis or as acute perforation; in others, there is recurrent acute bleeding without ulcer pain. The diagnostic value of individual symptoms for peptic ulcer disease is poor; the history is therefore a poor predictor of the presence of an ulcer. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 799",A

It is generally denoted by .x. It is calculated as follows.Mean (x) = Sum of the values of all observations (Sx) / Total number of observations (n)Mathematicallyx = Sx / nIt is influenced by extreme valuesMedian:Median is a locative measure which is the middlemost observation after all the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. In other words median is that -value which divides the entire data set into 2 equal parts, when the data set is ordered in an ascending (or descending) fashion.In case when there is odd number of observations we have a single most middle value which is the median value. In case when even number of observations is present there are two middle values and the median is calculated by taking the mean of these two middle observations. Thus!Median ={ n +1 /2 : when n is odd}Unlike mean, median is not influenced by extreme values.Mode:Mode is the most common value that repeats itself in the data set.Though mode is easy to calculate, at times it may he impossible to calculate mode if we do not have any value repeating itself in the data set.In this case mean is 3.3, median 2.5 and mode is 2.

"Disease which shows changes in occurrence (of disease) over a long period of time: March 2013 (a, h)",Cyclic trend,Secular trend,Seasonal trend,Sho term fluctuations,"Ans. B i.e. Secular trend Time trends 1. Secular (long-term) trends: Graphing the annual cases or rate of a disease over a period of years (Decades or centuries) shows long-term or secular trends in the occurrence of the disease. We commonly use these trends to suggest or predict the future incidence of a disease. Secular is influenced by population features e.g. - Change of degree of susceptibility e.g. by immunization - Socioeconomic - Environmental sanitation and - Nutritional status of a population. 2. Periodic (cyclic variation) Where disease occurrence for a period then increase again in cyclic pattern e.g. measles in prevaccination era occur every 2 - 3 years. 3. Seasonality By graphing the occurrence of a disease by week or month over the course of a year or more we can show its seasonal pattern. Example: the number of repoed cases of influenza typically increases in winter. Others increase in summer e.g. food poisoning and diarrhea Seasonal patterns may suggest hypotheses about: - How the infection is transmitted. - What behavioral factors increase risk, and - Other possible contributors to the disease or condition. 4. Rapid fluctuation Usually occur in the form of epidemics that appear abruptly and ends abruptly either natural or due to intervention 5.

A young female presents with diminished pulses in the upper limb and hypeension. The most likely diagnosis is:,Takayasu Aeritis,Coarctation of Aoa,Giant Cell Aeritis,Polyaeritis Nodosa,"Answer is A (Takayasu Aeritis): Diminished pulses in upper extremities and hypeension in a young female suggests a diagnosis of Takayasu aeritis. Coarctation is associated with diminished pulses in the lower extremities and Hypeension. Takayasu aeritis is typically prevalent in adolescent girls and young women (Obstruction at the level of proximal branches of the aoic arch (Subclan and Common Carotids) leads to diminished pulses in the upper extremity (Reversed Coarctation). Hypeension is a major complication of the disease and most commonly arises from renal aery stenosis. Since upper limb pulses are typically difficult to feel it may be dcult to record the blood pressure and hypeension may be easily missed. High blood pressure may be recorded in the lower limbs. 1990 criteria of American College of Rheumatology for the classification of Takayasu aeritis Criteria Definition Age at disease onset in year Development of symptoms or findings related to Takayasu aeritis at age Claudication of extremities Development and worsening of fatigue and discomfo in muscles of one or more extremity while in use, especially the upper extremities.

Additional features of SLE are low-grade fever, alopecia, pericarditis, ahritis, nephritis, nervous system involvement, and pleural effusions. Women are affected ten times more often than men. The lupus band test, demonstrating linear IgG and complement deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction, is positive in 90% of cases. However, it is not specific for SLE and may also be seen in bullous pemphigoid, dermatomyositis, and other autoimmune diseases. A positive reaction to the lupus band test on normal-appearing skin is helpful in diagnosis. Serum complement levels decline with disease flares and are useful in guiding treatment, whereas the ESR often remains elevated during remissions and is an unreliable marker of disease activity.

Which of the following is present in post mortem staining?,Seen on dependent parts of body,Extravasation of blood from capillaries,Lividity is greatest on the pressure points,Develops rapidly in running water,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Seen on dependent parts of body * Postmortem staining refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.* As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.* Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1) It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2) It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when putrification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3) If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4) Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple.In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5) It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death:i) In supine: On posterior dependent portion of body. But not seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks and back of calves due to contact flattening, i.e. toneless capillaries are compressed and occluded by weight and pressure of body.ii) In hanging: Dependent lower half of both lower limb and upper limb (i.e. lower half of leg with feet and lower half of forearm with hands), and external genitalia.iii) In drowning: Head and upper half of body as head being the heaviest part becomes the dependent part. It does not develop in running water due to constantly changing position of the body.6) No lividity is seen on pressure points of body, i.e. contact pallor, as pressure caused by weight of body causes compression of toneless vessels and prevent their filling with blood:i) In supine: No lividity is seen on back of shoulder blades, buttocks, occipital area and calf ->> contact flattening.ii) Also no lividity occurs in parts tightly tied with belt, waist band or brassiere and the area is seen as stripes or bands called vibices.",A

Increasing number of services in rural areas is a part of -,Intersectoral coordination,Equitible distribution,Appropriate technology',None.,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Equitable distribution o The first key principle in the primary' health care strategy is equity or equitable distribution of health services,o At present health sendees are mainly concentrated in the major towns and cities resulting in inquality of care to the people in rural areas.o Primary health care aims to redress this imbalance by shifting the centre of gravity of the health care system from cities to rural areas and bring these sendees as near people's homes as possible.Principles of primary health care1. Equitable distributionIt means, health sendees must be shared equally by all people irrespective of their ability to pay and all people (urban or rural, rich or poor) have access to health sendees.2 Community' participationThe local community is involved in planning and implementation of health sendees.Primary' health care is thus described as - Health by the people, placing people's health in people hands.Village health guides and trained dais are perfect examples of community participation.

Median is-,Middle most value in sequentially arranged data,Most frequently occurring value in a data set,Highest value in a data,Lowest value in a data,"The median 

A median is described as a value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.

It does not depend on the total and number of items.

To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or descending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median.

For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows – 83, 75, 81, 79,71, 95, 75, 77, 84. Now data is arranged in ascending order – 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95. Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from the lower four values, so it is the median. 
If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values.
For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90. Data is arranged in ascending order – 71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95
Here two values are separating the upper half of values from the lower half. So the median here is - Median = (79 + 81) / 2 = 80. 
Advantage of median

The value of the median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value. 

Taking the example as was taken in the mean – The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 20, 300 = (Total 352) Here mean = 50.3, median = 7. The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas the median is not affected, and the median is more nearer to the truth. So, the median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values → median is used for skewed distribution.",A

While on normal salt and water intake.Water loading test in SIADHA water loading or ADH testing is sometimes performed in patients with hyponatremiaIn this test specific quantities of water is given to the patient and the amount of urine produced and the changes in urine osmolarity and blood osmolarity are monitored.With this test the patients with SIADH typically show decreased serum sodium and osmolality but not normal urine sodium and quantity of urine.They do not produce as much urine as expectedA normal person should excrete >90% of the water load within 4 hours whereas patients with SIADH are not able to excrete more than 20-30% of the water loadThe urine osmolality is high relative to serum osmolality.This suggests that patients do not excrete adequate water load.Management of SIADHGeneral principles used in the management of SIADH Fluid restriction It is the mainstay of the treatment of most patients with SIADH with a suggested goal intake of less than 800 ml/day.In addition to fluid restriction the therapy of SIADH associated hyponatremia often requires the administration of sodium chloride either as oral tablets or intravenous saline.When using intravenous saline, the osmolality of the administered fluid must be greater than the osmolality of urine (This is achieved by administering hypertonic saline).Among patients with urine osmolality more than twice the plasma osmolality, a loop diuretic may be used to reduce urinary concentration.Vasopressor receptor antagonist (Vaptans)Vasopressor receptor antagonists increases free water excretion without the loss of any sodium or potassium.Intravenous conivaptan (which is used in hospitalized patients) and oral tolvaptan are available and approved for use in patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH.The utility of vaptan therapy is limited byExcessive thirstProhibitive cost (at least in the united states) andThe potential for overtly rapid correction of hyponatremia which has led to the necessity for hospitalization for the initiation of therapy.Only one of the vasopressor antagonist i.e. conivaptan has been approved for short term in hospital I. V. treatment of SIADH and the hyponatremia of congestive heart failure.Others are currently in phase III trials.Choosing, the appropriate therapyThe choice of therapy in patients with hyponatremia due to SIADH varies with the severity of hyponatremia and the presence or absence of symptoms. a) Patients with severe hyponatremia who present with seizures or other severe neurological abnormalities or with symptomatic hyponatremiaIn these cases urgent intervention with hypertonic saline is requiredIn these patients the serum sodium has fallen below 120 meq/L in less than 48 hrs leading to potentially fatal cerebral edema.These patients require urgent interventionIt consists of 100 ml bolus of 3% saline - If neurological symptoms persist or worsen100 ml bolus of 3%saline can be repeatedHypertonic saline preserve cerebral perfusion and prevent complications from hyponatremia induced brain edema, swelling.The intravenous hypertonic saline increases serum sodium concentration by approximately 1.5 meq/L and 2.0 meq/L in women.Mild to moderate symptomsLess severe neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, gait disturbance, forget fullness, confusion, lethargy)These are seen in patients with a serum sodium concentration below 120 meq/L that develops over more than 48 hrs.Initial therapy in these patients depends in part upon the severity of symptoms.Confusion and lethargyThese patients require initial administration of hypertonic saline therapy. The serum sodium should be raised at the rate of 1meqLL/hour for three to four hours.For patients with mild symptoms (forget fullness, gait disturbances)These patients do not require administration of hypertonic saline.In these patients the initial therapy consists of fluid restriction and oral salt tablets.Asymptomatic hyponatremiaThese patients have serum sodium b/w 120-129 meqLL.These patients are often treated only with fluid restriction.However, some of these seemingly asymptomatic patients have subtle neurological manifestation that can interfere with the quality of life and that may be improved by raising the serum sodium by the following methods.VaptansSaltsLoop diuretics (in patients with urine osmolality more than twice that of the plasma)Goal of serum sodium * Serum sodium should be maintained at 130 meq/L or higher in patients with SIADH because of possible presence of subtle neurologic manifestations and falls when the serum sodium is b/w 120-129 meq/L.",B

Cause of thick pancreatic secretions in cystic fibrosis?,Overproduction of mucin,Failure to clear mucin due to epithelial dysfunction,Defect in chloride channel leading to water reabsoption,Defect in sodium channel leading to water reabsorption,"CF occurs because of mutations in the gene that makes a protein called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator). A person with CF produces abnormal CFTR protein -- or no CFTR protein at all, which causes the body to make thick, sticky mucus instead of the thin, watery kind. This blockage causes a drop in the amount of digestive enzymes the pancreas puts out. Because of this, a child with CF has trouble absorbing fats, some proteins, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The problems with the pancreas can get very severe. Some of the hormone cells in the pancreas can be destroyed Ref Robbins 9/e pg 178",C

The ratio of the combined age groups 0-14 years plus 65 years and above to the 15-65 years age group is referred to as the total dependency ratio. It is also referred to as the societal dependency ratio and reflects the need for a society to provide for their younger and older population groups. The dependency ratio can be subdivided into young age dependency ratio (0-14 years); and old age dependency ratio (65 years and more). These ratios are, however, relatively crude, since they do not take into consideration elderly or young persons who are employed or working age persons who are unemployed.

"All of the following conditions are known to cause diabetes insipidus, except -",Multiple sclerosis,Head injury,Histiocytosis,Viral encephalitis,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterized by large amounts of dilute urine and increased thirst.[The amount of urine produced can be nearly 20 liters per day.[Reduction of fluid has little effect on the concentration of the urine.Complications may include dehydration or seizures Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is due to the inability of the kidney to respond normally to vasopressin. Dipsogenic Dipsogenic DI or primary polydipsia results from excessive intake of fluids as opposed to deficiency of arginine vasopressin. It may be due to a defect or damage to the thirst mechanism, located in the hypothalamus, or due to mental illness. Treatment with desmopressin may lead to water intoxication. Gestational Gestational DI occurs only during pregnancy and the postpaum period. During pregnancy, women produce vasopressinase in the placenta, which breaks down antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Gestational DI is thought to occur with excessive production and/or impaired clearance of vasopressinase. Most cases of gestational DI can be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP), but not vasopressin. In rare cases, however, an abnormality in the thirst mechanism causes gestational DI, and desmopressin should not be used. Diabetes insipidus is also associated with some serious diseases of pregnancy, including pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. These cause DI by impairing hepatic clearance of circulating vasopressinase. It is impoant to consider these diseases if a woman presents with diabetes insipidus in pregnancy, because their treatments require delivery of the baby before the disease will improve. Failure to treat these diseases promptly can lead to maternal or perinatal moality. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 887",A

Mahajan 6th edition, p. 79; Park PSM 22nd/pg.792)NORMAL DISTRIBUTION# When large number of observations of any variable such as height, blood pressure and pulse rate are taken at random to make it a representative sample, a frequency distribution table is prepared. Then some observations are above the mean and other below the mean. Normally almost half of the observations lie above and half below the mean and all observations are symmetrically distributed on each side of the mean.# A distribution of this shape is called normal distribution.# When no. of observations are very large and group interval is very small, the frequency polygon tends to lose its angulations giving place to a smooth curve known as frequency curve. Such a frequency curve drawn for normal distribution is called as normal curve (Gaussian curve).Important characteristics of normal curve are:# Shape of the distribution resembles a bell and is symmetric around midpoint.# At the center of the distribution, which is peaked, all the three measures of central tendency, namely, mean, mode & median coincide.# Normal curve never touches the baseline.# The area under the curve between any two points which correspond to the number of observations between any two values of the variate can be found out in terms of a relationship between the mean and the standard deviations.# Mean +-1 S.D. covers 68.27% of the observations.# Mean +- 2 S.D. covers 95.45% of the observations.# Mean +- 3 S.D. covers 99.73% of the observations.# Mean +- 1.96 S.D. covers 95% of the observations.# Mean +- 2.68 S.D. covers 99% of the observations.Statistical distributionMeasures of central tendencyMean = (sum of values) / (total number of values).Median = middle value of a list of data sorted from least to greatest.Mode = most common value.If there is an even number of values, the median will be the average of the middle two valuesMeasures of dispersionStandard deviation = how much variability exists from the mean in a set of values.Standard error of the mean = an estimation of how much variability exists between the sample mean and the true population mean.s= SD; n = sample sizeSEM = s/'h.SEM |as n |Normal distributionGaussian, also called bell-shaped.

Shilling's test is used to determine deficiency of,Vitamin B12,Vitamin B6,Folic Acid Deficiency,Vitamin D Deficiency,"Answer is A (Vitamin B12) Shilling's test is done to determine the cause of cyanocobalamine deficiency (Vitamin B12). Schilling test is abnormal in conditions that affect cobalamine absorption including Pernicious anemia, Chronic Pancreatitis, Bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Heal dysfunction. Conditions with Abnormal Schilling's Test (Abnormal Cobalamine Absorption) Pernicious anemia Chronic Pancreatitis Achlorhydria Bacterial overgrowth syndrome Beal dysfunction Schilling Test: Schilling test is performed to determine the cause of cobalamine malabsorption (Vit B12 malabsorption). Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. The Schilling test is performed by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin orally and collecting urine for 24h 1 mg of cobabmine is administed intramuscularly one hour after ingestion of the Radiolabelled cobalamine. This is done to ensure saturation of cobalamine binding sites in the liver as urinary excretion of cobalamine will reflect cobalamine absorption only provided that intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are fully occupied. Once intrahepatic binding sites of cobalamine are saturated all absorbed radiolabelled cobalamine will be excreted in urine. The Schilling test may be abnormal (defined as less than 10 percent excretion in 241i) in conditions that affect cobalamine absorption including Pernicious anemia, Chronic Pancreatitis, Bacterial overgrowth syndrome and Heal dysfunction. The etiology for an abnormal Schilling test may be deduced by administering Co58-labeled cobalamin with intrinsic factor, pancreatic enzymes or after 5 day course of antibiotics. Differential Results of Schilling Test in various diseases associated with cobalamin malabsorption may thus help establish the diagnosis.

Dooo- needle time should be  30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0  control (50-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists 90 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI.

Which nerve is most commonly involved in Sarcoidosis ?,Facial,Optic,Ophthalmic,Vestibular,"Cranial neuropathies are the most common manifestation of neurosarcoidosis . Any cranial nerve (CN) may be affected, and multiple cranial nerve involvement is common. The most frequently affected CN is VII, and sometimes bilateral facial neuropathies are present . Optic neuropathy is also not uncommon . Involvement of CN VIII (uni- or bilaterally) can cause auditory or vestibular dysfunction , but it may be asymptomatic and detected by brainstem auditory-evoked responses . Nerves involved in eye movement (CN III, IV, and VI) may also be affected. Olfactory involvement is somewhat uncommon and causes anosmia and impaired taste Cranial neuropathies may occur because of basilar meningitis, but infiltration or compression of nerves along their course can cause their dysfunction. For example, olfactory nerve dysfunction can occur from olfactory bulb involvement as well as from involvement of the nasal mucosa . In the latter instance, it can be diagnosed by nasal biopsy. In addition, some facial neuropathies probably occur from basilar meningitis, while other cases may be due to granulomatous involvement of the extracranial poion of the nerve. Ref - pubmed.com",A

Larvae of which of the following lies parallel to surface of water : September 2007,Anopheles,Culex,Aedes,Sandfly,"Ans. A: Anopheles Mosquito larvae have a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large thorax and a segmented abdomen. They have no legs. In contrast to other mosquitoes, Anopheles larvae lack a respiratory siphon and for this reason position themselves so that their body is parallel to the surface of the water. Larvae breathe through spiracles located on the 8th abdominal segment and therefore must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms in the surface microlayer. They dive below the surface only when disturbed. Larvae swim either by jerky movements of the entire body or through propulsion with the mouth brushes.",A

Persistent contracted stage is seen in?,Rigor mortis,Algor mortis,Heat stiffening,Cold stiffening,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Heat stiffeningoRigor mortis in tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter.oAlgor mortis is cooling of the body after death. After death, dead body behaves like an inert substance and therefore, if atmospheric temperature is low, body loses its heat by conduction, convection, radiation and evaporation, so as to attain the atmospheric temperature, i.e. the body cools. No cooling of dead body occurs if atmospheric temperature is higher than that of body. Cooling of body starts 1/2 to 1 hour after death.oHeat stiffening is permanent.oOn warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears.oGas (putrefactive) rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.Differential diagnosis of post mortem stiffening1. Rigor mortis#It is defined as contraction, stiffening, shortening and opacity of muscles after death. It is preceded by a period of relaxation. It occurs after molecular (cellular) death. In tropical countries (e.g. India), it begins 1-2 hours after death, takes further 2 hours to develop and lasts for 18-36 hours in summer and 24-48 hours in winter. In temperate countries, it begins in 3-6 hours, takes further 2-3 hours to develop and lasts for 2-3 days.2. Heat stiffening#In body exposed to extensive heat (>65degC) there results stiffening and flexion of all joints, known as 'Pugilistic or boxers or defence posture', due to denaturation and coagulation of proteins. However, heat stiffening is permanent (unlike rigor mortis which passes off after few hours.)3. Cold stiffening#Due to exposure to freezing temperature, body becomes stiff due to freezing (solidification) of fats and body fluids. On warming the part of body, cold stiffening disappears, differentiating it from rigor mortis.4. Putrefactive (gas) stiffening#During decomposition, body part becomes rigid because of collection of gases in subcutaneous tissues and the pressure exerted by these gases. It can be differentiated from rigor mortis as other signs of putrefaction are present and putrefactive rigidity disappears on incision due to release of gases.5. Cadaveric spasm (instantaneous rigor or cataleptic rigidity)#The muscles, which were in contraction or spasm at the time of death, continue to be in spasm even after death, without the stage of primary relaxation.",C

Exchange, removing blood plasma and exchanging it with blood products to be donated to the recipient. This type is called plasma exchange (PE, PLEX, or PEX) or plasma exchange therapy (PET). The removed plasma is discarded and the patient receives replacement donor plasma, albumin, or a combination of albumin and saline (usually 70% albumin and 30% saline). Donation, removing blood plasma, separating its components, and returning some of them to the same person while holding out others to become blood products donated by the donor. In such a plasma donation procedure, blood is removed from the body, blood cells and plasma are separated, and the blood cells are returned while the plasma is collected and frozen to preserve it for eventual use as fresh frozen plasma or as an ingredient in the manufacture of a variety of medications.

DOC in adrenal insufficiency -,Norepinephrine,Adrenaline,Dexamethasone,Fludrocortisone,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Dexamethasone Treatment of acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) in adultsEmergency measuresEstablish intravenous access with a large-gauge needle.Draw blood for immediate serum electrolytes and glucose and routine measurement ofplasma cortisol and A CTH. Do not wait for lab results.Infuse 2 to 3 liters of isotonic saline or 5 precent dextrose in isotonic saline as quickly as possible. Frequent hemodynamic monitoring and measurement of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid iatrogenic fluid overload.Give 4 mg dexamethasone as intravenous bolus over one to five minutes and every 12 hours thereafter Dexamethasone is the drug of choice because it does not interfere with the measurement ofplasma cortisol. If dexamethasone is unavailable, intravenous hydrocortisone, 100 mg immediately and every six hours thereafter, may be used.Use supportive measures as needed.Subacute measures after stabilization of the patientContinue intravenous isotonic saline at a slower rate for next 24 to 48 hours.Search for and treat possible in fections precipitating causes of the adrenal crisis.Perform short ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, ifpatient does not have know adrenal insufficiency.

People are arranged alphabetically by their names and then every 3rd person is chosen for study. The type of sampling is -,Stratified random,Systematic random,Simple random,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Systematic random Simple random samplingo Simple random sampling, also, known as 4unrestricted random samplingis applicable for small, homogenous, readily available population and is used in clinical trials,o In simple random sampling each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance,o So, each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process.For example : -o Let us assume you had a school with 1000 students, divided equally into boys and girls, and you wanted to select 100 of them for further study.o You might put all their names in a bucket and then pull 100 names out.o Not only does each person have an equal chance of being selected, we can also easily calculate the probaility of a given person being chosen, since we know the sample size (n) and population (N) and it becomes a simple matterof division - n/N or 100/1000 = 0.10 (10%).o This means that even' student in the school has a 10% or 1 in 10 chance of being selected using this method.Methods of simple random sampling.Lottery methodRandom number tableComputer sofware - Computer technique.Systematic random samplingo In order to do systematic random sampling, the individuals in a population are arranged in a certain way (for example, alphabetically).o A random starting point is selected and then every n,h (for example 10th or 15th) individual is selected for the sample.o That is, after arranging the individuals in certain pattern (e.g., alpabetically) a starting point is chosen at random, and choices thereafter at regular interv als,o For example, suppose you want to sample 8 houses from a street of 120 houses.o 120/8 = 15, So every' 15th house is chosen after a random starting point between 1 and 15.o If the random starting point is 11, then the houses selected are - 11, 26, 41, 56, 71, 86, 101, and 116.o In contrast to simple random sampling, some houses have a larger selection probabily e.g., in this question 11, 26,41,56, 71, 86, 100 and 116.o While the remaining number can not be selected.Stratified random samplingo When sub-populations vary considerably, it is advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently,o Stratification is the process of grouping members of the population into relative hemogenous subgroups before sampling.o The strata should be mutually exclusive, every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum,o Then systematic random sampling method is applied within each stratum.Population - Stratification - Systematic random sampling - Sample.o This often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.o For example, suppose in a population of 1000, sample of 100 is to be drawn for Hb estimation, first convert the population into homogenous striata (e.g., 700 males and 300 females), then draw 70 males and 30 females by doing systematic random sampling.",B

"Minimal change glomerulopathy may be seen ' association with all of the following except,",Hepatitis B,HIV,Drug-induced interstitial nephritis,Hodgkin's disease,"Secondary MCD wherein the extraglomerular disease process evokes, directly or indirectly, the characteristic changes in permselectivity and morphology. In this circumstance the morphology is similar, if not identical, to primary or 'idiopathic' MCD. Moreover, it is possible, even likely, that similar or identical pathogenetic mechanisms are operative. In this scenario, a distinct etiologic link is presumed to exist between the extraglomerular disease process and the occurrence of MCD. Such a linkage would be strongly suppoed if cure of the extraglomerular disease lead to the eradication of MCD and if recurrence of the extraglomerular disorder was associated with relapse. While an attempt has been made to be comprehensive, it is possible that individual repos describing an association between the specific extra-glomerular disease and MCD may have been overlooked. The majority of the instances in which MCD has been associated with an extraglomerular disease involve neoplastic processes and idiosyncratic, hyper-sensitivity or toxic reactions to drugs. Neoplasia A variety of neoplastic processes have been repoed in association with MCD (Table 2) . In some, the association is rare enough to suspect that chance alone may have been the operational mechanism underlying the association. In others, the association is clearly contemporaneous and likely causal. Among patients with glomerular disease associated with neoplasia, 40% have MCD on renal biopsy. As mentioned previously it is possible that some of the described associations between neoplasia and MCD may be the consequence of treatment of MCD (especially cytotoxic drug therapy) predisposing to the emergence of a malignancy. Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are among the most frequently repoed neoplastic processes associated with MCD . Interestingly, repos describing the concurrence of MCD and Hodgkin's disease have decreased in recent years, perhaps due to the more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies available for this and related diseases. MCD is a rare complication of Hodgkin's ppdisease occurring in from 1:2000 to 1:10 000 cases. MCD has been associated with both limited (Stage 1) and disseminated (Stage 4) forms of Hodgkin's disease.Therapy of Hodgkin's disease, either by local radio- therapy to regional lymph nodes or by systemic chemotherapy, has often resulted in remission of MCD and recurrences of Hodgkin's disease have been associated with recurrence of MCD. These observations strongly imply a causal relationship between the tumour (or a product of the abnormal neoplastic cells) and the pathophysiological abnormalities involved in MCD. Indeed, it is quite possible that the same clone of cells which are involved in the development of Hodgkin's disease are also involved in the pathogenesis of MCD in both the primary and secondary forms. Such an explanation is more difficult to conjecture for the association of MCD with theother tumours listed in Table 2, except for mycosis fungoides, angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukaemia . Perhaps, in these instances, the peurbations for MCD have also triggered the oncogenic potential of cells predisposed to neoplastic transformation (e.g. lack of a wild type tumour suppressor gene). Alternatively, lymphocytes infiltrating neoplastic growths could be induced to elaborate factors responsible for abnormal permeability. Whatever the case may be, it is wohwhile to consider potential underlying neoplasia in patients with MCD when atypical features are present such as weight loss, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, haematuria, fever, pleural effusions or skin lesions. Overall, the occurrence of MCD as a complication of neoplastic disorders is quite uncommon. MCD may precede the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years or may follow the diagnosis of neoplasia by months or years. Some repos have suggested that NK-cell deficiency is associated with the development of MCD in patients with Hodgkin's disease Ref Harrison20th edition pg 299",A

"A 48-year-old man complains of recurrent episodes of sudden-onset dizziness. He notices an abrupt onset of a ""spinning"" sensation when sitting up or lying down in bed. The symptoms last for 30 seconds and then resolve completely. He has no hearing change or other neurologic symptoms, and his physical examination is completely normal. A Dix-Hallpike maneuver reproduces his symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for his vertigo symptoms?",basilar migraine,brain stem ischemic events,benign cerebellar tumors,calcium debris (calcium carbonate crystals) in the semicircular canals,"This person has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by sudden-onset brief episodes of vertigo lasting less than a minute. The symptoms are usually brought on by head movement. The cause is commonly attributed to calcium debris in the semicircular canals, known as canalithiasis. The debris is loose otoconia (calcium carbonate) within the utricular sac. Although BPPV can occur after head trauma, there is usually no obvious precipitating factor. It generally abates spontaneously and can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation. Basilar migraine can cause vertigo, but it is not brought on by movement, there is an associated headache and lasts longer than the 30 seconds noticed in this patient. Brainstem ischemic events or cerebellar tumors can cause vertigo but the symptoms are persistent and not intermittent. Finally, Meniere disease also causes vertigo but there is associated hearing changes, and the symptoms last longer than in BPPV.",D

The following tests may be useful in the assessment of a patient with sarcoidosis,Chest X-ray,ACE,Serum calcium,All of the above,"Investigations in Sarcoidosis Lymphopenia is characteristic and liver function tests may be mildly deranged. Hypercalcaemia may be present (reflecting increased formation of calcitriol - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D - by alveolar macrophages), paicularly if the patient has been exposed to strong sunlight. Hypercalciuria may also be seen and may lead to nephrocalcinosis. Serum angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE may provide a non-specific marker of disease activity and can assist in monitoring the clinical course. Chest radiography has been used to stage sarcoid . In patients with pulmonary infiltrates, pulmonary function testing may show a restrictive defect accompanied by impaired gas exchange. Exercise testsmay reveal oxygen desaturation. Bronchoscopy may demonstrate a 'cobblestone' appearance of the mucosa, and bronchial and transbronchial biopsies usually show non-caseating granulomas, as may samples from the mediastinal nodes obtained by EBUS. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid typically contains an increased CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio. Characteristic HRCT appearances include reticulonodular opacities that follow a perilymphatic distribution centred on bronchovascular bundles and the subpleural areas. PET scanning can detect extrapulmonary disease. The occurrence of erythema nodosum with BHL on chest X-ray is often sufficient for a confident diagnosis, without recourse to a tissue biopsy. Similarly, a typical presentation with classical HRCT features may also be accepted. In other instances, however, the diagnosis should be confirmed by histological examination of the involved organ. The presence of anergy (e.g. to tuberculin skin tests) may suppo the diagnosis. Ref - Davidsons 23e p632",D
"MMR vaccine is a type of: September 2009, March 2013",Killed vaccine,Toxoid,Live attenuated vaccine,Immunoglobulin,"Ans. C: Live attenuated vaccine The MMR vaccine is an immunization shot against measles, mumps and rubella (also called German measles). It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman in the late 1960s The vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated viruses. The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection. In the case of live vaccines, immunization is generally achieved with a single dose. The exception is polio vaccine which needs three or more doses. As per Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the vaccine is administered once to children around the age of 15 months. Few countries advocates a second dose also before staing of school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose is not a booster; it is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2-5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. An inactivated vaccine (or killed vaccine) consists of virus paicles which are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde Types include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Salk vaccine) and influenza vaccine - Bacterial: typhoid vaccine, cholera vaccine, plague vaccine, and peussis vaccine Examples of live attenuated vaccines include: - Viral: polio vaccine (Sabin vaccine), measles vaccine, mumps vaccine, rubella vaccine, chicken pox vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and nasal-spray flu vaccine. - Bacterial: BCG vaccine, typhoid vaccine A toxoid is a bacterial toxin (usually an exotoxin) whose toxicity has been weakened or suppressed either by chemical (formalin) or heat treatment, while other propeies, typically immunogenicity, are maintained. Toxoids are used in vaccines as they induce an immune response to the original toxin or increase the response to another antigen. For example, the tetanus toxoid (derived from the tetanospasmin produced by Clostridium tetani and causing tetanus) and diphtheria toxoid.",C

Population genetics principle was given by ?,Hardy weinberg,Sewall wright,J.B.S Haldane,R.A Fisher,"Population genetics is a subfield of genetics that deals with genetic differences within and between populations, and is a pa of evolutionary biology. Studies in this branch of biology examine such phenomena as adaptation, speciation, and population structure Population genetics began as a reconciliation of Mendelian inheritance and biostatistics models. Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural or sexual selection implausible. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. According to this principle, the frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.

Thiamine deficiency is seen in all except ?,Chronic diarrhoea,Chronic alcoholism,Homocystinemia,Food faddist,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Homocystienentia Causes of Thiamine deficiency o Persons may become deficient in thiamine either by not ingesting enough vitamin B-1 through the diet or by excess use, which may occur in hypehyroidism, pregnancy, lactation, or fever (sates of high energy consumption, such as hypehyroidism, pregnancy, or severe illness, require more thiamine and other nutrients.) o Prolonged diarrhea may impair the body's ability to absorb vitamin B-1, and severe liver disease impairs its use. D Decreased absorption is seen in Diarrhea Chronic intestinal disease Alcoholism Malnutrition Gastric bypass surgery Malabsorption syndrome Celiac and tropical sprue 1-Iyperemesis gravidarum Long term starvation Fad diets( Fad diets often do not contain necessary amounts of thiamine) Increased depletion is seen in Diuretic therapies Peritoneal dialysis Hemodialysis (Dialysis robs thiamine from the circulation) o Alcohol is known to interfere directly with the absorption of thiamine and with the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate.( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) o Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids. This is due to the lack of available micronutrition supplementation Food faddism and fad diet are terms which refer to the tendency for idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns.

Adipocere formation is seen in?,Dead body exposed to air,"Dead body buried in damp, clay soil",Burial dry hot air,All of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dead body buried in damp, clay soil Adipocere formation (saponification)o Adipocere is a modification ofputrefaction, which occurs in the absence of air. That is when there is excessive moisture (humidity) and warnth (warm temperature), but absence of air i.e. warm humid climate, normal putrefaction does not occur, rather saponification occurs.o Thus adipocese formation occurs in dead bodies which are lying in water (immered in water) or hurried in damp lay soil.o Saponification (adipocer formation) is the conversion of dead body into soft, fatty waxy substance due to conversion of unsaturated liquid fats to saturated solid fats under the influence of intrinsic lipase and lecithinase produced by Cl. perfringens. The process involves gradual hydrolysis and hydrogenation of body fats into higher fatty acids which combine with calcium and ammonium ions to form insoluble soaps. Ultimately, palmitic, oleic, stearic and hydroxystearic acids are formed, mixture of these is known as adipocere.o Adipocere formation starts in subcutaneous fat and is marked in areas having excessive fat, eg. cheeks, female breast, buttocks and abdomen. Slowly the whole body including muscles and internal viscera change into adipocere. Adipocere has offensive or sweetish smell, however in early stages, smell is ammonical.o Body is converted into soft, waxy and brittle substance, it floats on water, it can be cut easily, it dissolves in alcohol and ethers, and it melts on heating. Facial features and injuries on body are well preserved, thus identfication of body and determination cause of death (in case of injury) are possible.o Normally adipocere formation requires 3 weeks to upto 3 to 6 months. However shortest recorded period in india is 3 days 22 hours. In india, it has been observed to begin within 4-5 days. Adipocere may persist for years or decades. Adipocere does not occur in foetus less than 7 months.o Medicolegal importance : (i) Identification of body (facial features are preserved), (ii) cause of death (injury marks are preserved), (iii) time since death can be estimated.",B

The endotoxin of the following gram negative bacteria does not play any pa in the pathogenesis of the natural disease -,Escherichia coli,Klebseilla spp.,Vibrio cholerae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Cholera Cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae serotype O1, is the archetypal toxin-mediated bacterial cause of acute watery diarrhoea. The enterotoxin activates adenylate cyclase in the intestinal epithelium, inducing net secretion of chloride and water. V. cholerae O1 has two biotypes, classical and El Tor, and each of these has two distinct serotypes, Inaba and Ogawa. Following its origin in the Ganges valley, devastating epidemics have occurred, often in association with large religious festivals, and pandemics have spread worldwide. The seventh pandemic, due to the El Tor biotype, began in 1961 and spread the Middle East to become endemic in Africa, subsequently spreading throughout South and Central America. Numbers of cases of cholera have been increasing, with outbreaks in Ghana in 2014 and Tanzaniain 2015. El Tor is more resistant to commonly used antimicrobials than classical Vibrio, and causes prolonged carriage in 5% infections. An atypical serotype, O139, has been responsible for localised outbreaks in Bangladesh. Infection spreads the stools or vomit of symptomatic patients or of the much larger number of subclinical cases. Organisms survive for up to 2 weeks in fresh water and 8 weeks in salt water. Transmission is normally through infected drinking water, shellfish and food contaminated by flies, or on the hands of carriers. Clinical features Severe diarrhoea without pain or colic begins suddenly and is followed by vomiting. Following the evacuation of normal gut faecal contents, typical 'rice water' material is passed, consisting of clear fluid with flecks of mucus. Classical cholera produces enormous loss of fluid and electrolytes, leading to intense dehydration with muscular cramps. Shock and oliguria develop but mental clarity remains. Death from acute circulatory failure may occur rapidly unless fluid and electrolytes are replaced. Improvement is rapid with proper treatment. The majority of infections, however, cause mild illness with slight diarrhoea. Occasionally, a very intense illness, 'cholera sicca', occurs, with loss of fluid into dilated bowel, killing the patient before typical gastrointestinal symptoms appear. The disease is more dangerous in children. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1132",C

The absolute level of blood pressure is not as impoant as its rate of rise. Pathologically, the syndrome is associated with diffuse necrotizing vasculitis, aeriolar thrombi, and fibrin deposition in aeriolar walls. Fibrinoid necrosis has been observed in aerioles of kidney, brain, retina, and other organs. Clinically, the syndrome is recognized byprogressive retinopathy (aeriolar spasm, hemorrhages, exudates,and papilledema), deteriorating renal function with proteinuria,microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and encephalopathy.In these patients, historic inquiry should include questions about the use of monamine oxidase inhibitors and recreational drugs (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines). ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2058",D

Which of the following is not a side effect of blood transfusion: September 2009,Hypokalemia,Hypomagnesemia,Hypocalcemia,Iron overload,"Ans. A: Hypokalemia Nonimmunologic adverse reactions to blood transfusion: Citrate toxicity: Citrate is the anticoagulant used in blood products. It is usually rapidly metabolised by the liver. Rapid administration of large quantities of stored blood may cause hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia when citrate binds calcium and magnesium. This can result in myocardial depression or coagulopathy. Patients most at risk are those with liver dysfunction or neonates with immature liver function having rapid large volume transfusion. Potassium Effects: Stored red cells leak potassium propoionately throughout their storage life. Irradiation of red cells increases the rate of potassium leakage. Clinically significant hyperkalaemia can occur during rapid, large volume transfusion of older red cell units in small infants and children Iron accumulation: Iron accumulation is a predictable consequence of chronic RBC transfusion. Organ toxicity begins when reticuloendothelial sites of iron storage become saturated. Liver and endocrine dysfunction creates significant morbidity and the most serious complication is cardiotoxicity which causes arrhythmias, and congestive hea failure.",A

Normal CRP with elevated ESR seen in,RA,SLE,Scleroderma,Polymyalgia rheumatica,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., SLE Both ESR and CRP are markers of inflammation Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR is used to separate inflammation from non-inflammation. Another sign of inflammation is the rise in blood level of number of proteins called as acute phase proteins. One of the proteins is C-reactive protein (CRP). Like ESR and other acute phase proteins, CRP also goes up in inflammation. In systemic lupus however the level does not rise unless there is infection associated. The normal response to active inflammatory disease is an increase in plasma CRP concentration. o For reasons that remain unclear tht response is either significantly lower in magnitude or entirely absent in a few inflammatory conditions. This has proven diagnostically useful because there are very few inflammatory conditions in which ESR is significantly raised (reflecting an inflammatory process) but plasma CRP is only slightly raised or even normal. One ofthese conditions is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus), a relatively common chronic autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of child-bearing age. When this inflammation occurs in the lupus patient it is accompanied as expected by a marked increase in ESR. However in contrst to most other inflammatory condition, the plasma CRP remains resolutely normal. The combination of raised ESR and normal CRP is a useful diagnostic feature of SLE. Other disorders where CRP is not increased Osteoahritis, leukemia, anemia Polycythemia, viral infection Ulcerative colitis, pregnancy, estrogen",B

All are useful for treatment of metabolic alkalosis except,Sodium chloride,Potassium chloride,Hydrochloric acid,Ammonium Hydroxide,"Metabolic Alkalosis This is primarily directed at correcting the underlying stimulus for HCO3-generation. If primary aldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome is present, correction of the underlying cause, when successful, will reverse the hypokalemia and alkalosis. loss by the stomach or kidneys can be mitigated by the use of proton pump inhibitors or the discontinuation of diuretics. The second aspect of treatment is to remove the factors that sustain the inappropriate increase in HCO3-reabsorption, such as ECFV contraction or K+deficiency. K+deficits should always be repaired. Isotonic saline is recommended to reverse the alkalosis when ECFV contraction is present. If associated conditions preclude infusion of saline, renal HCO3-loss can be accelerated by administration of acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (125-250 mg IV), which is usually effective in patients with adequate renal function but can worsen K+losses. Dilute hydrochloric acid (0.1NHCl) has been advocated historically in extreme cases, but can cause hemolysis, and must be delivered slowly in a central vein.

All are signs of somatic death except ?,Cessation of respiration,Cessation of hea,Non-responding muscles,No response to external stimuli,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Non-responding muscles Death denotes death of human being (46 IPC). It is defined as cessation of life or cesation to exist. Death is of two types (1) somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) and (2) molecular death (cellular death). Somatic death (systemic death or clinical death) It is the complete and irreversible stoppage of the circulation, respiration and brain functions (bishop's tripod of life). Somatic death is associated with immediate signs of death :? Permanent and complete cessation of function of brain and flat electric EEG with no response to external stimuli; i.e. brain death. Permanent and complete cessation of function of hea and flat ECG. Permanent and complete cessation of function of lungs. Somatic death is due to stopped aerobic processes. However, anaerobic enzymatic processes are still continuing, hence (i) muscles still respond to mechanical, electrical and thermal stimuli, (ii) pupils still respond to miotics and mydriatics. Molecular death (cellular death) It occurs after somatic death. It refers to death of all individual cells. It occurs when even anaerobic processes stop, due to non availability of ATP. At this stage : Muscles do not respond to stimuli. Pupils do not respond to stimuli or drugs. There are early signs and late signs of death : Early signs : Changes in skin and eye, cooling of the body, post-moem lividity, changes in muscles (e.g. primary relaxation, rigor mois). Late signs : Decomposition (putrefaction), adipocere fromation and mummification. 4. Molecular death of various organs occur at different intervals after somatic death : Nervous tissue --> After 5 minutes. Liver ---> After 15 minutes. Hea --> After 45 minutes. Kidney --> After 1 hours. Muscles --> After 3 hours. Cornea --> After 6 hours. Blood After 6 hours.",C

When the pt. is injected with other serotype of dengue virus, an anamnestic, heterotypic response occurs and large amount of cross reacting antibodies to the first serotype are produced.These antibodies form immune complexes which activate the complement system, causing increased vascular permeability and thrombocytopenia .These antibodies may increase the entry of virus into monocytes and macrophages with the consequent liberation of a large amount of cytokines. These cytokines are responsible for the haemorrhagic manifestation and shock.Any serotype can cause DHF, if it is following the infection with the previous serotype.But Harrison writes that serotype II is apparently more dangerous than other serotype in causing DHF or DHF with shock. Jawetz too writes that DHF or DHF with shock occurs more frequently when Dengue Type II was the second infecting Virus.Lab diagnosis :Thrombocytopenia *Hemoconcentration *Prolonged bleeding time Elevated Prothrombin time*Dengue shock syndrome:In DSS seen are all the above clinical features of DHF + shock.The period of shock lasts one to two days and most pts. respond promptly to close monitoring , oxygen administration and infusion of crystalloid* or in severe cases-colloid. *Thus we see that option (b), &(c) are wrong and out of (d & a), (a) seems to be more correct",A

It is associated with in-hospital moality rates >50%. . Circulatory failure based on cardiac dysfunction may be caused by primary myocardial failure, most commonly secondary to acute myocardial infarction (MI ), and less frequently by cardiomyopathy or myocarditis, cardiac tamponade, or critical valvular hea disease.Most patients have continuing chest pain and dyspnea and appear pale, apprehensive, and diaphoretic. Mentation may be altered, with somnolence, confusion, and agitation. The pulse is typically weak and rapid, often in the range of 90-110 beats/min, or severe bradycardia due to high-grade hea block may be present. Systolic blood pressure is reduced (<90 mmHg) with a narrow pulse pressure (<30 mmHg), but occasionally BP may be maintained by very high systemic vascular resistance. Tachypnea, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, and jugular venous distention may be present. The precordium is typically quiet, with a weak apical pulse. S 1 is usually soft, and an S 3 gallop may be audible. Acute, severe MR and VSR usually are associated with characteristic systolic murmurs Rales are audible in most patients with LV failure causing CS.

Rupture of myocardium takes place in what duration after myocardial infarction: March 2007,First week,Second week,Third week,Fouh week,"Ans. A: First week The most often used markers are the creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction and the troponin I (TnI) or troponin T (TnT) levels. On the basis of the ECG, a distinction is made between ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Risk Factors Older age Male sex Tobacco smoking Hypercholesterolemia (more accurately hyperlipoproteinemia, especially high low density lipoprotein and low high density lipoprotein) Hyperhomocysteinemia Diabetes (with or without insulin resistance) High blood pressure Obesity (defined by a body mass index of more than 30 kg/ m2) Stress Occupations. Women who use combined oral contraceptive pills. The most serious of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib/VF), an extremely fast and chaotic hea rhythm that is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death. Another life threatening arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (V-Tach/VT). Different zones of the hea can become injured: - An occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary aery(LAD) will result in an anterior wall myocardial infarct. - Infarcts of the lateral wall are caused by occlusion of the left circumflex coronary aery(LCx) or its oblique marginal branches (or even large diagonal branches from the LAD.) Both inferior wall and posterior wall infarctions may be caused by occlusion of either the right coronary aery or the left circumflex aery, depending on which feeds the posterior descending aery. Right ventricular wall infarcts are also caused by right coronary aery occlusion. Electrocardiogram The 12 lead ECG is used to classify patients into one of three groups: Those with ST segment elevation or new bundle branch block Those with ST segment depression or T wave inversion Those with a so-called non-diagnostic or normal ECG. Complications - Congestive hea failure Myocardial rupture is most common three to five days after myocardial infarction, commonly of small degree. - Life-threatening arrhythmia-The re-entry phenomenon may cause rapid hea rates (ventricular tachycardia and even ventricular fibrillation), and ischemia in the electrical conduction system of the hea may cause a complete hea block - Pericarditis-In Dressler's syndrome, this occurs several weeks after the initial event. - Cardiogenic shock",A
"Features seen in hemolytic anemia are all, EXCEPT:",Tear drop and Burr cells,Reduced Haptoglobin,Reticulocytosis,Hemoglobinuria,"The laboratory features of Hemolytic anemia are related to hemolysis per se and the erythropoietic response of the bone marrow. Hemolysis regularly produces in the serum an increase in unconjugated bilirubin and aspaate transaminase (AST); urobilinogen will be increased in both urine and stool. If hemolysis is mainly intravascular, the telltale sign is hemoglobinuria (often associated with hemosiderinuria); in the serum there is increased hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. In contrast, the bilirubin level may be normal or only mildly elevated. The main sign of the erythropoietic response by the bone marrow is an increase in reticulocytes.

Zinc is not required for: March 2011,Embryonic development,Coagulation pathway,DNA synthesis,Spermatogenesis,"Ans. B: Coagulation Pathway Severe maternal zinc deficiency has been associated with congenital malformations or spontaneous aboions Zinc deficiency has been repoed to result in sexual infantilism (zinc is required for proper reproduction) Zinc is required for wound healing. Zinc enhances cell growth and division. Zinc Zinc is found in nearly 100 specific enzymes, serves as structural ions in transcription factors and is stored and transferred in metallothioneins. It is ""typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms"" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. In proteins, Zn ions are often coordinated to the amino acid side chains of aspaic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine and histidine. There are 2-4 grams of zinc distributed throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate and pas of the eye. Semen is paicularly rich in zinc, which is a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth. In humans, zinc plays ""ubiquitous biological roles"". It interacts with ""a wide range of organic ligands"", and has roles in the metabolism of RNA and DNA, signal transduction, and gene expression. It also regulates apoptosis. In the brain, zinc is stored in specific synaptic vesicles by glutamatergic neurons and can ""modulate brain excitability"". It plays a key role in synaptic plasticity and so in learning. However it has been called ""the brain's dark horse"" since it also can be a neurotoxin, suggesting zinc homeostasis plays a critical role in normal functioning of the brain and central nervous system. Zinc is an efficient Lewis acid, making it a useful catalytic agent in hydroxylation and other enzymatic reactions. The metal also has a flexible coordination geometry, which allows proteins using it to rapidly shift conformations to perform biological reactions. Two examples of zinc-containing enzymes are carbonic anhydrase and carboxypeptidase, which are vital to the processes of carbon dioxide (CO2) regulation and digestion of proteins, respectively.",B

Post mortem lividity is not seen in?,Drowning in well,Drowning in a fast flowing river,Postmortem submersion,Drowning in chlorinated swimming pool,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Drowning in a fast flowing river o Postmortem lividity does not develop in drowning in running water (due to constantly changing position of body) and areas of contact flattening (due to collapsed capillaries)o Postmortem staining has so many synomyms, i.e. livor mortis/post mortem lividity/hypostasis/cadaveric lividity/ vibices/suggilation/darkening of death.o It refers to discoloration of skin and internal organs after death due to accumulation of fluid blood in toneless capillaries and small veins of dependent part of the body.o As dead body behaves like an inert substance, therefore there is gravitational flow of blood to the dependent parts of body, causing stagnation of blood in toneless capillaries and small veins, causing bluish purple staining of these parts.o Characteristic features of postmortem staining are:1. It does not appear elevated above the surface but has sharply defined (usually horizontal) margins.2. It is an early sign of death. It starts at about 1 hour, becomes a series of mottled patches within 1-3 hours and these pathces increase in size to coalesce in about 3-6 hours. After 6-12 hours, lividity is fully developed and fixed (unchangeable), i.e. primary lividity. It ends when purification sets in. Fixation of lividity is due to stagnation of blood in distended capillaries and venules (not due to coagulation of blood).3. If the position of body is changed, after development of lividity but before it becomes fixed, these patches will disappear and fresh ones will develop in the new dependent areas (secondary lividity), but lividity to a slight degree will remain in the original area due to staining of tissue by hemolysis (complete).4. Normally the staining is at first bluish-pink and afterwards bluish purple. In severe anemia, and death from haemorrhage, the staining is very faint. In deaths from asphyxia, where blood is deoxygenated and may not readily coagulate, the staining is intensely developed and purple in colour. In conditions where blood coagulates quickly eg. in lobar pneumonia lividity is less abvious.5. It is seen on dependent parts of the body, therefore site depends upon position of body after death :i) In supine : On posterior dependent portion of body.

"Pancreatitis, pituitary tumor and pheochromocytoma may be associated with:",Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid,Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid,Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid,Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid,"Answer is A (Medullary Carcinoma of Thyroid); Out of all the histological variants of carcinoma thyroid it is the medullary variant that is associated with multiple endocrinal neoplastic syndromes and hence is the answer here. (No confusion regarding the answer) What puzzles the situation? is the fact that the combination of pancreatitis, pituitary tumor and pheochromocytoma, suggests a diagnosis of MENI syndrome. MEN I has been mentioned to be associated with C cell hyperplasia, and not Medullary carcinoma thyroid. Medullary thyroid carcinomas is a feature of MEN II syndromes. Justification: Medullary carcinoma thyroid arises from parafollicular C cells. C cell hyperplasia thus, may be regarded as a precursor of Medullary carcinoma thyroid.

Line Ia: Disease or condition directly leading to death 
Line Ib: Antecedent/underlying cause 
Line Ic: Main antecedent/underlying cause 
Line II: Other significant conditions contributing to death but not related to disease/condition causing it
Example of a death cerficate: Line la: Renal failure. Line lb: Diabetic nephropathy. Line Ic: Diabetes mellitus. Line II: Hypertension

Casper's dictum is related to,Rate of putrefaction,Floatation of a dead body,Calculation of time since death,Identification of dead body,"PUTREFACTION IN WATER Casper dictum: It states that a body decomposes in air twice as rapidly as in water, and eight times as rapidly as in eah. The rate of putrefaction is slower in water than in air. Putrefaction is more rapid in warm, fresh water than in cold, salt water. It is more rapid in stagnant water than in running water. Putrefaction is delayed when a body is lying in deep water and is well protected by clothing, while it is rapid in a body lying in water contaminated with sewage. As the submerged cadavers float face down with the head lower than the trunk, gaseous distension and postmoem discolouration are first seen on the face and then spread to the neck, upper extremities, chest, abdomen and the lower extremities in that order. Fluid gravitation in the head ours marked decomposition. When the body is removed from the water, putrefaction is hastened as the tissues have absorbed much water.

Hepatits C is associated with all except -,PAN,Dermatomyositis like syndrome,Lichen planus,Psoriasis,"Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Investigations Serology and virology - The HCV genome encodes a large polypeptide precursor that is modified post-translationally to at least ten proteins, including several antigens that give rise to antibodies in an infected person; these are used in diagnosis. It may take 6-12 weeks for antibodies to appear in the blood following acute infection, such as a needlestick injury. In these cases, hepatitis C RNA can be identified in the blood as early as 2-4 weeks after infection. Active infection is confirmed by the presence of serum hepatitis C RNA in anyone who is antibody-positive. Anti-HCV antibodies persist in serum even after viral clearance, whether spontaneous or post-treatment. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",A

Coisol decreases neutrophil adhesion in the peripheral blood, thus releasing the marginating pool into the circulation. Coisol also increases lymphocyte adhesion in the efferent lymphatics and is toxic to eosinophils. Endotoxic shock results in a neutropenia because endotoxins increase neutrophil adhesion. Absolute neutropenia is a feature of typhoid fever, splenomegaly, and sinus bradycardia. Whooping cough due to Bordetella peussis produces an absolute lymphocytosis.

A patient with salicylic acid poisoning has the following aerial blood gas analysis repo : pH = 7.12 : pCO2 18mmHg; HCO3= 12mmol/L. The resulting acid base abnormality can be best labeled as :,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Metabolic acidosis,"Answer is A (Metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis): With pH < 7.35 (7.12) acidosis is confirmed. Abbnormal CO2 with change in opposite to expected. (acidosis should have increased CO2) indicates that the change in compensatory (compensatory respiratory alkalosis), Decreased bicarbonates with change in keeping with change in pH suggests that the problem is metabolic. Thus the whole picture represents metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Explanation : Acid base disorders needlessly, confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. pH < 7.35 is acidosis ; pH > 7.45 is alkalosis 1deg change in HCO3 is termed as metabolic (Normal HCO3- = 22 - 30 meq/l) if change in HCO3- is in keeping with the pH (i.e. if there is acidosis and HCO3- decreased) the problem is a Metabolic one. If change in HCO3 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and HCO3"" is increased or normal) the problem is compensatory metabolic. 1deg change is CO2 is termed as respiratory (Normal pCO2 = 35 - 45 mmHg) If change in CO2 is in keeping with the pH (if in acidosis CO2 is raised) the problem is termed respiratory If change in CO2 is opposite with the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory. the pH (if there is acidosis and CO2 is decreased or normal) problem is termed as compensatory respiratory. STEP 1 : What is the pH. Normal pH pH of patient Inference Acidosis 7.35 - 7.45 7.12 pH is decreased Acidosis STEP II : Is it a metabolic or respiratory change Parameter Inference Is change towards acidosis or alkalosis Parameter Inference Is change towards Is change in Final Inference acidosis or alkalosis keeping with Is change in keeping with change in pH change in pH Final Inference pCO2 = 18mm Hg (Respiratory component) (Respiratory decreased component) pCO2 is decreased Alkalosis pCO2 = 18mm Hg pCO2 is Alkalosis No Respiratory component is compensatory No Respiratory component is compensatory pCO3- = 12 mmol/e (Metabolic component) (Metabolic decreased component) FICO3"" is decreased Acidosis pCO3- = 12 mmol/e FICO3"" is Acidosis Yes Metabolic component is primary Yes Metabolic component is primary STEP III : Final deduction Because metabolic component is primary and respiratory component is compensatory the acid base disorder is Metabolic acidosis with compensatory Respiratory alkalosis.",A

What should be the next appropriate investigation to be done ?,ESR,RA factor,Creatine kinase,Electromyography,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Creatine kinase Difficulty in combing hairs and climbing upstairs suggests proximal muscle weakness.Presence of proximal muscle weakness along with maculopapular rash suggests dermatomyositis.Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy.Inflammatory myopathyThe inflammatory myopathy represents the largest group of acquired and potentially treatable causes of skeletal muscle weakness.They are classified into three major groupsPolymyositisDermatomyositisInclusion body myositis (IBM)Characteristic features of inflammatory myopathyProgressive and symmetric muscle weaknessExcept,IBM, which can have an asymmetric pattern early involvement of proximal musclesPatients usually report increasing difficulty with everyday tasks requiring the use of proximal muscles, such as getting up from a chair, climbing steps, stepping on to a curb, lifting objects or combing hair.Fine motor movements which depend on the strength of distal muscles such as buttoning a shirt, sewing, knitting, or writing are affected only late in the course of PM and DM.RememberThe distal muscles are involved fairly early in inclusion body myositis. Another important clinical feature of IBM is frequent falling which occurs due to early involvement of quadriceps in IBM.Sparing of ocular musclesOcular muscles are spared even in advanced untreated cases, if these muscles are affected the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy should be questioned.Sparing of fascial musclesFacial muscles are unaffected in DM and PM.ButMild facial involvement can occur in IBM.Involvement of pharyngeal and neck Flexor musclesIn all forms of inflammatory myopathy, pharyngeal and neck flexor muscles are often involved causing dysphagia or difficulty in holding up the headTendon reflexesTendon reflexus are preserved ButMay be absent in severely weak or atrophied muscle especially in Inclusion body myositis.Intact sensationsSensations are intact in all types of inflammatory myopathy.Progression of the weaknessWeakness in PM and DM progresses sub acutely over a period of weeks or months and rarely acutely.By contrastWeakness progresses very slowly in IBM.More on inflammatory myopathy earlier it was believed that,If the muscular weakness is accompanied by skin rash it is called dermatomyositis where as if it remains confined to muscles only it is called polymyositis.Now daysPolymyositis is diagnosis of exclusionIt is a subacute myopathy affecting adults and rarely children who do not have the followingRashInvolvement of extraocular and facial muscles.Family history of neuromuscular disease - History of exposure to myotoxic drugs or toxins Endocrinopathy, neurogenic disease, muscular dystrophy, biochemical muscle disorder.Diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy * The diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy is confirmed by -Examining the serum muscle enzymesEMG findingsMuscle biopsySerum muscle enzymesThe most sensitive enzyme is the serum creatine kinase which in active disease can be elevated as much as 50 foldEMGEMG shows myopathic potentials, characterized by, short duration, low amplitude, polyphasic units on voluntary activation and increased spontaneous activity with fibrillations.

Consider the following statements regarding thyroid hormones-,Majority of the circulating T3 remains in bound form,Only 50% of the circulating T3 is secreted by Thyroid,TSH estimation is not a sensitive test for diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism,Fatel pituitary-thyroid axis is dependent to a large extent on maternal pituitary-thyroid axis,"Thyroid Hormones physiology The thyroid secretes predominantly thyroxine (T4) and only a small amount of triiodothyronine (T3); approximately 85% of T3 in blood is produced from T4 by a family of monodeiodinase enzymes that are active in many tissues, including liver, muscle, hea and kidney. Selenium is an integral component of these monodeiodinases. T4 can be regarded as a prohormone, since it has a longer half-life in blood than T3 (approximately 1 week compared with approximately 18 hours), and binds and activates thyroid hormone receptors less effectively than T3. T4 can also be conveed to the inactive metabolite, reverse T3. T3 and T4 circulate in plasma almost entirely (> 99%) bound to transpo proteins, mainly thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). It is the unbound or free hormones that diffuse into tissues and exe diverse metabolic actions. Some laboratories use assays that measure total T4 and T3 in plasma but it is increasingly common to measure free T4 and free T3free hormone measurements is that they are not influenced by changes in the concentration of binding proteins. For example, TBG levels are increased by oestrogen (such as in the combined oral contraceptive pill) and this will result in raised total T3 and T4, although free thyroid hormone levels are normal.

A 45-year old female had sought medical attention for her recent increase in weight and proximal limb weakness. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid ahritis. 1 week ago has been staed on prednisolone tablets. Physical examamination revealed truncal obesity; BP - 145/90 mm Hg and PR- -90/ mill. High levies of coisol were found in her blood and 24 hour urine sample. A high dose dexamethasone suppression test was performed and the plasma coisol level was suppressed. Serum ACTH level was high. The etiology of this condition can be confirmed by,CT scan of the chest,MRI of the brain,CT scan of the abdomen,Plasma metanephrine level,"Most of the signs and symptoms of ACTH-secreting tumors come from having too much coisol (an adrenal steroid hormone). But quite a few diseases can cause the body makes too much coisol, which is called Cushing's syndrome. If you have symptoms suggesting this syndrome, you'll need tests to see if it's caused by a pituitary tumor or something else. One of the tests used measures the levels of coisol in your saliva late at night to see if they stay elevated. (They normally drop at night.) Another may include measuring levels of coisol and ACTH in blood samples taken at different times of the day. You also may be asked to collect all of your urine over a 24-hour period, which is then tested to measure your daily production of coisol and other steroid hormones. One test involves taking a dose of a powerful, coisone-like drug called dexamethasone, then checking blood or urine coisol levels. Often more than 1 of these tests is needed to help distinguish ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors from other diseases, such as adrenal gland tumors, that can cause similar symptoms.

(2) Absorption- elution technique. (3) Absorption-inhibition. (4) Latex method. (5) Enzymological methods. TESTS FOR DETERMINING ABO GROUPING IN BLOOD STAINS : (1) TUBE METHOD : A drop of washed suspension of red cells is added to equal volumes of each of the antisera of A, B and 0 in separate tubes. The blood group can be identified when agglutination is seen by naked eye or microscope in the tubes. (2) Tile Method: A porcelian tile is used instead of tubes. (3) ABSORPTION -INHIBITION METHOD : The sample and antisera are allowed to react with each other for a longer period. ( 4) MIXED AGGLUTINATION TEST : The sample piece of stained cloth is cut into pieces of 2 to 3 mm and the fibres are separated and added to tubes along with antisera of A, B, 0 types. The group can be known by the antisera which clumped to the cloth fibres. (5) ABSORPTION-ELUTION TECHNIQUE: Test is similar to mixed agglutination, but the clumps are seen on the walls of the test tube and not on fibres. This test can be used for body tissues also. Blood stains can be typed for the presence of ABO agglutinogens by absorption-elution, absorption- inhibition, mixed agglutination or ELISA method, or for agglutinins by the Lattes crust method.

"A 55-year-old farmer develops recurrent cough, dyspnea, fever, and myalgia several hours after entering his barn. He has had similar reactions several times previously, especially when he feeds hay to his cattle. Which of the following statements is true?",The presence of fever and myalgia indicates that this is an infectious process.,Immediate-type IgE hypersensitivity is involved in the pathogenesis of his illness.,The causative agents are often thermophilic actinomycete antigens.,Demonstrating precipitable antibodies to the offending antigen confirms the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by an immunologic inflammatory reaction in response to inhaled organic dusts, the most common of which are thermophilic actinomycetes, fungi, and avian proteins. In the acute form of the illness, exposure to the offending antigen is intense. Cough, dyspnea, fever, chills, and myalgia typically occur 4 to 8 hours after exposure. Patients are often suspected of having an infection, especially pneumonia, but the history of previous similar symptoms on antigen exposure should suggest hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In the subacute form, antigen exposure is moderate, chills and fever are usually absent, and cough, anorexia, weight loss, and dyspnea dominate the presentation. In the chronic form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, progressive dyspnea, weight loss, and anorexia are seen; pulmonary fibrosis is a permanent and sometimes fatal complication.Almost all patients have IgG antibody to the offending antigen, although positive serology is common in asymptomatic patients and is therefore not diagnostic. While peripheral T-cell, B-cell, and monocyte counts are normal, a suppressor T-cell functional defect can be demonstrated in these patients. IgE does not play a role, so the symptoms begin hours (not minutes) after antigen exposure. Inhalation challenge with the suspected antigen and concomitant testing of pulmonary function can confirm the diagnosis but are seldom used. Therapy involves avoidance; steroids are administered in severe cases. Bronchodilators and antihistamines are not effective.",C

"In acute intersitial nephritis, proteins associated -",Amyloid,Fibrinogen,Vitamin D binding protein,Albumin,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulo- interstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Causes Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type . The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 278",A

Comparing cost of 2 studies and choosing the one which is economically superior to others is done by: March 2005,Cost accounting,Cost benefit,System analysis,Network analysis,"Ans. B: Cost benefit Cost-benefit analysis is a management technique which compares the economic benefit of a programme with its cost. The benefits are expressed in cost of that programme. The benefits are expressed in monetary terms to determine whether a given programme is economically sound, and to select the best out of several alternate programmes. Cost accounting establishes budget and actual cost of operations, processes, depaments or product and the analysis of variances, profitability or social use of funds. Managers use cost accounting to suppo decision-making to cut a company's costs and improve profitability. Costs are measured in units of nominal currency by convention. Cost accounting can be viewed as translating the supply chain (the series of events in the production process that, in conce, result in a product) into financial values.",B
Which is not true of hypocalcaemia -,Can occur in hypoparathyroidism,Latent tetany is seen,Prolonged QT interval,Inverse relation with Mg++ levels,"Hypocalcaemia is low calcium levels in the blood serum.The normal range is 2.1-2.6 mmol/L (8.8-10.7 mg/dl, 4.3-5.2 mEq/L) with levels less than 2.1 mmol/l defined as hypocalcemia.Mildly low levels that develop slowly often have no symptoms.Otherwise symptoms may include numbness, muscle spasms, seizures, confusion, or cardiac arrest Common causes include hypoparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency.Others causes include kidney failure, pancreatitis, calcium channel blocker overdose, rhabdomyolysis, tumor lysis syndrome, and medications such as bisphosphonates.Diagnosis should generally be confirmed with a corrected calcium or ionized calcium level.Specific changes may be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Initial treatment for severe disease is with intravenous calcium chloride and possibly magnesium sulfate.Other treatments may include vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium supplements. If due to hypoparathyroidism, hydrochlorothiazide, phosphate binders, and a low salt diet may also be recommended.About 18% of people who are being treated in hospital have hypocalcemia The neuromuscular symptoms of hypocalcemia are caused by a positive bathmotropic effect (i.e. increased responsiveness) due to the decreased interaction of calcium with sodium channels. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, reduced calcium lowers the threshold for depolarization.The symptoms can be recalled by the mnemonic ""CATs go numb"" - convulsions, arrhythmias, tetany, and numbness in the hands and feet and around the mouth. Petechiae which appear as on-off spots, then later become confluent, and appear as purpura (larger bruised areas, usually in dependent regions of the body). Oral, perioral and acral paresthesias, tingling or 'pins and needles' sensation in and around the mouth and lips, and in the extremities of the hands and feet.

isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is seen in the following conditions except-,Hemolysis,Gilbe syndrome,Crigler-Najjar syndrome,Dubin-Johnson syndrome,"Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism . It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Ref Davidson 23e p897",B

Mean + 1.96 SD include following % of values in a distribution: September 2012,68%,99.50%,88.70%,95%,"Ans: D i.e. 95% 96 is the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution used in probability and statistics. 95% of the area under a normal curve lies within roughly 1.96 standard detions of the mean, and due to the central limit theorem, this number is therefore used in the construction of approximate 95% confidence intervals.",D
All are true regarding Normal distribution curve except,One standard detion includes 95% of values,"Mean, Median, Mode coincides",Median is mid value,Area under the curve is one,"NORMAL DISTRIBUTION The normal distribution or 'normal curve' is an impoant concept in statistical theory. Let us suppose, we collect the haemoglobin values of a very large number of people and make a frequency distribution with narrow class intervals, we are likely to get a smooth, symmetrical curve. Such a curve is called a normal distribution or normal curve. The shape of the curve will depend upon the mean and standard detion which in turn will depend upon the number and nature of observations. It follows, therefore, there will be an infinite number of normal curves. Standard normal curve Although there is an infinite number of normal curves depending upon the mean and standard detion, there is only one standardized normal curve, which has been devised by statisticians to estimate easily the area under the normal curve, between any two ordinates. The standard normal curve is a smooth, bell-shaped, perfectly symmetrical curve, based on an infinitely large number of observations. The total area of the curve is 1; its mean is zero; and its standard detion is 1. The mean, median and mode all coincide. The distance of a value (x) from the mean (X) of the curve in units of standard detion is called ""relative dete or standard normal variate"" and is usually denoted by Z.

"All are causes of pulmonary hypertension except,",Hyperventilation,Morbid obesity,High altitude,Fenfluramine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hyperventilation There are three main causes of pulmonary hypertension:-Cardiac diseasesRespiratory diseasePulmonary thromboembolic diseaseCardiac diseasesLead to pulmonary hypertension by increasing pulmonary blood flow (e.g., large left to right shunt) or by increasing pulmonary venous pressure (e.g., L. V. failure).In Respiratory diseases,The predominant mechanism for the pulmonary hypertension is an increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow arising from perivascular parenchymal changes coupled with pulmonary vasoconstriction due to hypoxia.In pulmonary thromboembolic disease,Clots in pulmonary vessels increase resistance to blood flow causing pulmonary hypertension.Now about other options mentioned in the question.Alveolar hyperventilationPulmonary hypertension is seen in Alveolar hypoventilation (not hyperventilation).In patients with alveolar hypoventilation the primary pathogenic mechanism responsible for pulmonary hypertension is alveolar hypoxia potentiated by respiratory acidosis. (alveolar hypoxia leads to constriction of pulmonary vessels).Regardless of the etiology, whether pulmonary hypertenstion will occur in patients with alveolar hypoventilation depends on whether there is sufficient alveolar and arterial hypoxia to raise pulmonary arterial pressure considerably.In sleep apnea syndrome seen in obese individualsSevere arterial hypomexia occurs during sleep due to hypoventilation (apnea). This causes pulmonary hypertension during sleep. After some point of time, the pulmonary hypertension may continue even during the day time.AnorexiantsPulmonary hypertension has been associated with anorexiants.""A causal relationship has been established between exposure to several anorexigens including aminorex and fenfluramine and development of pulmonary artery hypertension.

Adrenal aldosteronoma is best diagnosed by -,HRCT,MRI,JVP,KUB,"Ans is option 1 HRCT The usual screening test is to measure the serum potassium level. If it is low, diagnostic tests are done including measuring blood and urinary aldosterone levels and blood renin levels. In Conn's syndrome, the aldosterone is elevated and the renin is suppressed. If these tests are diagnostic then imaging studies are done to see if a tumor can be localized. Since these tumors are small they can be hard to find even with the best CT or CT with contrast or MRI scan. Some patients may have no obvious radiographic tumor but one adrenal is affected (unilateral primary adrenal hyperplasia) and they can benefit from surgical removal. Other patients may have both adrenals affected with no visible tumor (idiopathic hyperaldosteronism) and surgery will not help. In these situations blood has to be drawn from each adrenal vein (so called adrenal venous sampling) in order to measure aldosterone levels to be sure which adrenal has the tumor. The symptoms of hyperaldosteronism may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your physician for a diagnosis. the diagnostic procedures for aldosteronoma may include: Blood and urine tests to measure potassium and hormone levels Computed tomography (CT or CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) - are non-invasive procedures that take cross-sectional images of the adrenal or other internal organs; to detect any abnormalities that may not show up on an ordinary x-ray Adrenal venous sampling- an invasive test performed by a radiologist where a catheter is placed in the adrenal veins to measure the hormone level and confirms the tumor location.

Major bacterial enzyme responsible for putrefaction,Hyaluronidase,Lecithinase,Metalloproteinase,Collagenase,"DECOMPOSITION It involves two processes: (1) Autolysis and (2) Putrefaction. Autolysis: Autolysis is self-digestion of tissues Putrefaction: The disintegration of body tissues after death is known as decomposition. The terms decomposition and putrefaction are used as synonyms. Putrefaction usually follows the disappearance of rigor mois. During hot season, it may commence before rigor mois has completely disappeared from the lower extremities. Mechanism: Organisms enter the tissues sholy after death, mainly from the alimentary canal, and less often through the respiratory tract or through an external skin wound. Multiplication of bacteria begins within 4 hours and peak is reached within 24-30 hours. The fall in the oxygen concentration in the tissues and rise in hydrogen ion concentration after death our bacterial growth and spread throughout the body. Because the protective agencies of the body are absent, the bacteria spread through the blood vessels using the proteins and carbohydrates of the blood as culture media. The chief destructive bacterial agent is Cl. welchii, which causes marked haemolysis, liquefaction of postmoem clots and of fresh thrombi and emboli, disintegration of tissue and gas formation in blood vessels and tissue spaces. Bacteria produce a large variety of enzymes and these breakdown the various tissues of the body. Lecithinase produced by Cl. welchii is most impoant. This hydrolyses the lecithin which is present in all cell membranes including blood cells*, and is responsible for the postmoem haemolysis of blood. Features: The characteristic features of putrefaction are: (1) changes in the colour of the tissues, (2) the evolution of gases in the tissues, and (3) the liquefaction of tissues. The first external sign of putrefaction in a body lying in air is usually a greenish discolouration of the skin over the region of the caecum, which lies fairly superficially, and where the contents of the bowel are more fluid and full of bacteria. Internally, this is seen on the undersurface of the liver, anterior peritoneal surface of right lobe of liver and adipose tissue around gallbladder, where that organ is in contact with the hepatic flexure and transverse colon. The colour results from the conversion of haemoglobin of blood into sulphmethaemoglobin by the hydrogen sulphide formed in the large intestine and escaping into the surrounding tissues. The colour appears in 12 to 18 hours in summer and in one to two days in winter. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-164,165",B

Coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery may be required if angina is exacerbated by levothyroxine replacement therapy.

Chronic Non-Spherocytic hemolytic anemia is seen in which class of G6PD deficiency,Class I,Class II,Class III,Class IV,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Class I The four forms of symptomatic G6PD deficiency : Acute hemolytic anemia Favism Congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia Congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia Patients with class I G6PD variants have such severe G6PD deficiency that lifelong hemolysis occurs in the absence of infection or drug exposure. Such patients fall under the category of having congenital nonspherocvtic hemolytic anemia. These G6PD variants have low in vitro activity and/or marked instability of the molecule, and most have DNA mutations at the glucose-6-phosphate or NADP binding sites. These sites are central to the function of G6PD, which oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate and reduces NADP to NADPH. It is presumed that the functional defect is so severe that the red cells cannot withstand even the normal oxidative stresses encountered in the circulation. Anemia and jaundice are often first noted in the newborn period, and the degree of hyperbilirubinemia is frequently of sufficient severity to require exchange transfusion. After infancy, hemolytic manifestations are subtle and inconstant. Most individuals have mild to moderate anemia (hemoglobin 8 to 10 g/dL) with a reticulocyte count of 10 to 15 percent. Pallor is uncommon, scleral icterus is intermittent, splenomegaly is rare, and splenectomy generally is of little benefit. Hemolysis can be exaggerated by exposure to drugs or chemicals with oxidant potential or exposure to a beans. Some drugs with relatively mild oxidant potential that are safe in patients with class II or class III G6PD variants may increase hemolysis in patients with class I variants. Disease variants of Glucose 6 phosphate dehvdrogenase deficiency The World Health Organization has classified the different G6PD variants according to the magnitude of the enzyme deficiency and the severity of hemolysis. Classes IV and V are of no clinical significance. Types Features Class I Variants have severe enzyme deficiency (less than 10 percent of normal) and have chronic (nonspherocytic) hemolytic anemia. Class II Variants, such as G6PD Mediterranean, also have severe enzyme deficiency, but there are, usually only intermittent episodes of acute hemolysis associated with infection, drugs, or chemicals. Class III Variants, such as G6PD A-, have moderate enzyme deficiency (10 to 60 percent of normal) with intermittent episodes of acute hemolysis usually associated with infection, drugs, or chemicals Class IV Variants have no enzyme.deficiency or hemolysis. Class V Variants have increased enzyme activity",A

Renal vein thrombosis is/are not caused by -,Nephrotic syndrome,Invasive renal cell carcinoma,CKD,DehydrationPregnancy,"Nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is characterised by very heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 hrs), hypoalbuminaemia and oedema (see below). Blood volume may be normal, reduced or increased. Renal sodium and causes venous thrombosis retention is an early and universal feature;. The diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome all affect the glomerulus (see Fig. 15.9), either directly, by damaging podocytes, or indirectly, by causing scarring or deposition of exogenous material such as amyloid into the glomerulus. Investigation of nephrotic syndrome usually involves renal biopsy, although non-invasive tests may also be helpful in suggesting the underlying cause . In children, minimal change disease is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome and therefore renal biopsy is not usually required unless the patient fails to respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy. Similarly, most patients with diabetes presenting with nephrotic syndrome will have diabetic nephropathy, and so renal biopsy is usually not performed unless the course of the disease is atypical (rapidly increasing proteinuria or rapid decline in renal function;). Management of nephrotic syndrome should be directed at the underlying cause. In addition, nephrotic syndrome is associated with a number of complications , which may require suppoive management unless the nephrosis is expected to resolve rapidly, such as in glucocoicoid-responsive minimal change disease.

Her pain during intercourse, poor desire, and lack of sufficient lubrication probably stem from the psychological stress from her husband's infidelity. Marital counseling may aid in resolving the issues that resulted in the infidelity, and the aftermath. Female sexual dysfunction consists of four broad categories: dyspareunia, orgasmic disorder, arousal disorder, and impaired sexual drive. Sexual dysfunction may result from physical conditions, such as neuropathy or sleep deprivation, or from psychological conditions, such as depression or a history of abuse.

The most likely diagnosis is:",Neonatal Alveolar Proteinosis,Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Circulation (TAPVC),Meconium Aspiration Syndrome,Diffuse Herpes simplex infection,"Answer is.A (Neonatal Alveolar Proteinosis): The child in question is presenting with characteristic features of Neonatal Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP). Familial cases of Neonatal Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis have been observed and a genetic basis has been suggested. None of the other options have a familial basis and hence neonatal PAP is the single best answer of choice. TAPVC is unlikely as ECHO is unremarkable and TAPVC does not have a familial basis. Meconium aspiration syndrome is unlikely as it does not have a familial basis and the question provides no other clinical clues to suggest meconium aspiration such as meconium staining Congenital Herpes infection has an entirely different mode of presentation and can he safely excluded.

The non-poisoning Salt of cyanide is -,Potassium cyanide,Hydrocyanic acid,Sodium cyanide,Potassium ferrocyanide,"Hydrocyanic acid Cyanide occurs as solid, liquid or in gaseous state as: * Gas form -- Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) * Liquid form -- Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic acid) * Solid form -- occurs as salts such as potassium cyanide/ sodium cyanide. Mechanism of Action Cyanide reversibly inhibits ferric iron containing enzymes. Cyanide attaches to the iron of the prosthetic group of cytochrome oxidase resulting in disturbance of the transpo and utilization of oxygen in cells and causing a cytotoxic anoxia. Fatal Dose * 50 to 100 mg for hydrocyanic acid * 200 to 300 mg for sodium/potassium cyanide * 50 to 80 bitter almonds * Inhalation of 1 pa in 2000 -- hydrogen cyanide Fatal period: 2 to 10 minutes. Clinical Features Inhalation * Constriction about throat * Dizziness * Loss of consciousness * Coma * Death Ingestion * CNS: Headache, anxiety, agitation, dizziness, confusion, convulsions, coma * CVS: Initially bradycardia and hypeension and latter tachycardia and hypotension, arrhythmias * RS: Tachypnea followed by bradypnea * GIT: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, numbness. Skin * Perspiration * Bullae. Chronic poisoning: Chronic low level of exposure leads to: * Headache * Amblyopia * Optic atrophy * Peripheral neuropathy * Ataxia * Deafness * Glossitis * Stomatitis. Management * Ingestion: gastric lavage with 5 percent sodium thiosulfate solution * Antidote- amyl nitrate -- inhaled * Sodium nitrate slowly I.V. * Sodium thiosulfate 25 percent solution I.V. * Mechanism of action of nitrites: nitrates induce methemoglobinemia, which causes detachment of cyanide from the heme group of cytochrome oxidase since methemoglobin has a higher binding affinity for cyanide. Cyanide combines with methemoglobin and form non-toxic cynmethemoglobin. * Mechanism of action of sodium thiosulfate: sodium thiosulfate serves as a substrate for the enzyme rhodanese to catabolise cyanide to non-toxic thiocyanate, which is excreted in the urine. Autopsy Findings * Bitter almond like smell * Cherry red color of postmoem lividity * Cyanosis * Froth at mouth and nose * Bright red color blood9 * Pulmonary edema * Serosal surface may show hemorrhages * Stomach mucosa may be eroded and blackened due to formation of alkaline hematin.

True regarding DDT is: September 2007,Synthetic insecticide,Natural insecticide,Organophosphate insecticide,No incidence of resistance,"Ans. A: Synthetic insecticide DDT is an organochlorine, similar in structure to the insecticide methoxychlor and the acaricide dicofol. It is a highly hydrophobic, colorless, crystalline solid with a weak, chemical odor. It is nearly insoluble in water but has a good solubility in most organic solvents, fats, and oils. DDT does not occur naturally, but is produced by the reaction of chloral (CC13CH0) with chlorobenzene (C6H5C1) in the presence of sulfuric acid, which acts as a catalyst. In insects it opens sodium ion channels in neurons, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with ceain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and other similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by u p-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species.",A

Chvluria is associated with filariasis :- 

Chronic filaria can lead to renal involvement:- Chyluria is associated with abnormal retrograde or lateral flow of lymph from intestinal lymphatics of the kidney ureter or bladder allowing chylous material to be discharged into urinary collecting system.
Intestinal lymph may be intermittently discharged into the renal pelvis, causing lymph fluid to pass into the urine.
This is known as chyluria and it results in milky appearance of the urine
Since large amounts of fat and protein can be lost in the urine in individuals with chyluria this condition can lead to nutritional deficiencies including anemia and hvpoproteinemia.",A

Duret haemorrhage is seen in:,Endocardium,Brain,Ear,Liver,"Ans: b (Brain)Ref: Reddy, 29th ed., Pg. 230Duret haemorrhages are small areas of bleeding in the ventral and paramedian parts of the upper brainstem.It is named for Henri Duret. They are secondary to raised intracranial pressure with formation of a transtentorial pressure cone involving the cerebral peduncles (crus cerebri) and other midbrain structures caused by raised pressure above the tentorium.Kernohan's notch is a groove in the cerebral peduncle that may be caused by this displacement of the brainstem against the incisura of the tentorium. The resulting ipsilateral hemiparesis is a false localizing sign, known as the Kernohan-Woltman syndrome. This may succeed or accompany temporal lobe (uncal) herniation and subfalcian herniation secondary to a supratentorial mass.The common causes are an acute haematoma, oedema following trauma, abscess, or tumour. The Duret haemorrhage is demonstrated at CT or MRI. It usually indicates a fatal outcome. The mechanism is uncertain, but is probably caused by the displacement of the brainstem stretching and lacerating pontine perforating branches of the basilar artery.",B

Causes of fasting hypoglycemia are following except-,Excess glucagon,Glucose 6 phosphatase deficiency,Uremia,Glycogen synthatase deficiency,"Fasting hypoglycemia In otherwise healthy people, prolonged fasting (even up to several days) and prolonged strenuous exercise (even after a period of fasting) are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia. However, there are several diseases or conditions in which the body fails to maintain adequate levels of glucose in the blood after a period without food (fasting hypoglycemia). In people who drink heavily without eating, alcohol can block the formation of glucose in the liver. In people with advanced liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, or cancer, the liver may not be able to store and produce sufficient glucose. Infants and children who have an abnormality of the enzyme systems that control glucose use (such as a glycogen storage disease) also may have fasting hypoglycemia. A rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia is an insulinoma , which is an insulin-producing tumor in the pancreas. Disorders that lower hormone production by the pituitary and adrenal glands (most notably Addisons disease) can cause hypoglycemia. Other diseases, such as CKD , hea disease, cancer, and sepsis, may also cause hypoglycemia, especially in critically ill people. Causes of Hypoglycemia Ref - pubmed.com",A

Most West Africans and people with origins in that region carry the Duffy-negative FyFy phenotype and are therefore resistant to______ malaria,P. vivax,P. ovale,P. malariae,P. falciparum,"Ans. a (P. vivax) (Ref. Harrison 18th/ ch. 210)# After entry into the bloodstream, merozoites rapidly invade erythrocytes and become trophozoites.# Attachment is mediated via a specific erythrocyte surface receptor.# In the case of P. vivax, this receptor is related to the Duffy blood-group antigen Fya or Fyb.# Most West Africans and people with origins in that region carry the Duffy-negative FyFy phenotype and are therefore resistant to P. vivax malaria.ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS OF MALARIA# Four species of the genus Plasmodium cause nearly all malarial infections in humans (although rare infections involve species normally affecting other primates). These are:- P. falciparum,- P. vivax,- P ovale, and- P malariae.# Almost all deaths are caused by falciparum malaria. Human infection begins when a female anopheline mosquito inoculates plasmodial sporozoites from its salivary gland during a blood meal.# By amplification process (known as intrahepatic or preerythrocytic schizogony or merogony), a single sporozoite eventually may produce 10,000 to >30,000 daughter merozoites.# The swollen liver cell eventually bursts, discharging motile merozoites into the bloodstream.# These then invade the RBCs and multiply 6- to 20-fold every 48 to 72 h.# When the parasites reach densities of ~50/mL of blood, the symptomatic stage of the infection begins.# The dormant forms, or hypnozoites, are the cause of the relapses that characterize infection with P. vivax and P. ovale,# By the end of the 48-h intraerythrocytic life cycle (72 h for P. malariae), the parasite has consumed nearly all the hemoglobin and grown to occupy most of the RBC. It is now called a schizont.# Multiple nuclear divisions have taken place (shizogony or merogony), and the RBC ruptures to release 6 to 30 daughter merozoites, each potentially capable of invading a new RBC and repeating the cycle.# When a female Anopheline mosquito takes a blood meal, the male and female gametocytes continue their sexual development.# Schizonts are rarely seen in the peripheral blood and their presence may indicate a potentially serious parasitemia.",A

Squamous cancer can occur in any pa of the oesophagus and almost all tumours in the upper oesophagus are squamous cancers. Adenocarcinomas typically arise in the lower third of the oesophagus from Barrett's oesophagus or from the cardia of the stomach. The incidence is increasing and is now approximately 5: 100 000 in the UK; this is possibly because of the high prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux and Barrett's oesophagus in Western populations. Despite modern treatment, the overall 5-year survival of patients presenting with oesophageal cancer is only 13%. Clinical features Most patients have a history of progressive, painless dysphagia for solid foods. Others present acutely because of food bolus obstruction. In the late stages, weight loss is often extreme; chest pain or hoarseness suggests mediastinal invasion. Fistulation between the oesophagus and the trachea or bronchial tree leads to coughing after swallowing, pneumonia and pleural effusion. Physical signs may be absent but, even at initial presentation,cachexia, cervical lymphadenopathy or other evidence of metastatic spread is common. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg796",A
What is the most characteristic symptom in a lady diagnosed with Pheochromocytoma?,Sweating attacks,Weight loss,Ohostatic hypotension,Paroxysmal hypeension,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are catecholamine-producing tumors derived from the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The ""rule of tens"" for pheochromocytomas states that about 10% are bilateral, 10% are extraadrenal, and 10% are malignant. However, these percentages are higher in the inherited syndromes. The clinical presentation is so variable that Pheochromocytoma has been termed ""the great masquerader"". The dominant sign is hypeension. Classically, patients have episodic hypeension, but sustained hypeension is also frequent.",D

Which of the following is most commonly involved in Hypersensitivity vasculitis:,Capillaries,Aerioles,Post-capillary venules,Medium sized aeries,"Answer is C (Post-capillary venules): Post-capillary venules are most commonly involved in Hypersensitivity vasculitis Hypersensitivity vasculitis Hypersensitivity vasculitis refers to small vessel vasculitis that is restricted to the skin and not associated with any other form of primary or secondary vasculitis. Implicit in the definition is that this condition is not associated with medium or large vessel disease at other sites, nor with small vessel disease in other organs (only skin) Microscopic polyangitis affects the skin and also internal organs and hence is not considered pa of hypersensitivity vasculitis The typical histopathological feature of cutaneous vasculitis is the presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels. Vasculitis is charachterized by Leukocytoclasis -- Harrison's Synonyms for Hypersensitivity vasculitis include: cutaneous small vessels vasculitis, leucocytoclastic vasculitis, cutaneous leucocytoclastic angitis etc. 'Post-capillary venules are the most commonly involved vessels. Capillaries and aerioles may be involved less frequently' -- Harrison American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification of Hypersensitivity Vasculitis Laboratory and Radiographic Work-up of Patients with Possible Hypersensitivity Vasculitis Age at disease onset > 16 years Medication at disease onset Palpable purpura Maculopapular rash Biopsy including aeriole and venule, showing granulocytes in a perivascular or extravascular location For purposes of classification, hypersensitivity vasculitis may be diagnosed if the patient meets at least three of these five criteria.",C
The ECG of a patient with an aificial pacemaker in the right ventricle shows-,Right bundle branch block with narrow QRS complex,Right bundle branch block with broad QRS complex,Left bundle branch block with broad QRS complex,Left bundle branch block with narrow QRS complex,"Bundle branch block Damage to the right or left bundle branch of the conducting system can occur as a result of many pathologies, including ischaemic hea disease, hypeensive hea disease and cardiomyopathy. However, right bundle branch block (RBBB) can occur as a normal variant in healthy individuals . In left bundle branch block (LBBB) and RBBB, depolarisation proceeds through a slow myocardial route in the affected ventricle rather than through the rapidly conducting Purkinje tissues that constitute the bundle branches. This causes delayed conduction into the LV or RV, broadens the QRS complex (>=0.12 sec) and produces characteristic alterations in QRS morphology loss of consciousness that occurs without warning and results in collapse. A brief anoxic seizure (due to cerebral ischaemia) may occur if there is prolonged asystole. There is pallor and a death-like appearance during the attack, but when the hea stas beating again there is a characteristic flush. In distinction to epilepsy, recovery is rapid. Sinoatrial disease and neurocardiogenic syncope may cause similar symptoms. Management This depends on the clinical circumstances. Acute inferior MI is often complicated by transient AV block because the right coronary aery (RCA) supplies the AV node. There is usually a reliable escape rhythm and, if the patient remains well, no treatment is required. Symptomatic second- or third-degree AV block may respond to atropine (0.6 mg IV, repeated as necessary) or, if this fails, a temporary pacemaker. In most cases, the AV block will resolve within 7-10 days. Second- or third-degree AV hea block complicating acute anterior MI indicates extensive ventricular damage involving both bundle branches and carries a poor prognosis. Asystole may ensue and a temporary pacemaker should be inseed promptly. If the patient presents with asystole, intravenous atropine (3 mg) or intravenous isoprenaline (2 mg in 500 mL 5% dextrose, infused at 10-60 mL/hr) may help to maintain the circulation until a temporary pacing electrode can be inseed. Temporary pacing can provide effective rhythm suppo in the sho term. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1536",A
A 42 year old male after being influenced by online weight losing program decides to do an intense workout at gym. But he noticed that even after 45 minutes of workout he didn't sweat.

Transoesophageal Echocardiography is useful in -,Sinus venosus type of ASD,Dissection of arch of aoa,Prosthetic valve Thrombosis,Vascular ring,"Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) involves passing an endoscope-like ultrasound probe into the oesophagus and upper stomach under light sedation and positioning it behind the LA. It is paicularly useful for imaging structures such as the left atrial appendage, pulmonary veins, thoracic aoa and interatrial septum, which may be poorly visualised by transthoracic echocardiography, especially if the patient is overweight or has obstructive airway disease. The high-resolution images that can be obtained makes TOE paicularly valuable for investigating patients with prosthetic (especially mitral) valve dysfunction, congenital abnormalities such as atrial septal defects, aoic dissection, infective endocarditis (vegetations that are too small to be detected by transthoracic echocardiography) and systemic embolism (intracardiac thrombus or masses) A vascular ring is a congenital defect in which there is an abnormal formation of the aoa and/or its surrounding blood vessels.

Softening of water is recommended when hardness exceeds,6mEQ/L,4mEG/L,3meq/l,5mEQ/L,"HARDNESS OF WATER Hardness may be defined as the soap destroying power of water. The consumer considers water hard if large amounts of soap are required to produce lather. The hardness in water is caused mainly by four dissolved compounds. These are (1) Calcium bicarbonate (2) Magnesium bicarbonate (3) Calcium sulphate, (4) Magnesium sulphate. The presence of any one of these compounds produces hardness. There are others which are of less impoance. Chlorides and nitrates of calcium and magnesium can also cause hardness but they occur generally in small amounts. Iron, manganese and aluminium compounds also cause hardness, but as they generally are present in such small amounts, it is customary not to consider them in connection with hardness.

Interstitial nephritis is seen with all except,Beta lactam inhibitors,INH,Diuretics,Allopurinol,"Acute interstitial nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an immune-mediated disorder, characterised by acute inflammation affecting the tubulointerstitium of the kidney. It is commonly drug-induced, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) fast becoming the most common cause, but can be caused by other toxins, and can complicate a variety of systemic diseases and infections . Clinical features The clinical presentation is typically with renal impairment but, in some patients with drug-induced AIN, there may be signs of a generalised drug hypersensitivity reaction with fever, rash and eosinophilia. Proteinuria is generally modest (PCR < 100 mg/mmol) and tubular in type . The urine may contain white blood cells and white cell casts but is sterile on culture. Eosinophils are present in up to 70% of patients but this is a non-specific finding. AIN should always be considered in patients with non-oliguric AKI. There may be a rapid deterioration of renal function in some cases of drug-induced AIN, causing the condition to be mistaken for RPGN. Investigations Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis . This typically shows evidence of intense inflammation, with infiltration of the tubules and interstitium by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and lymphocytes. Eosinophils may also be observed, especially in drug-induced AIN. Often granulomas may be evident, especially in drug-induced AIN or sarcoidosis . The degree of chronic inflammation in a biopsy is a useful predictor of long-term renal function. Eosinophiluria may be present but is not a good discriminator for AIN. Management Some patients with drug-induced AIN recover following withdrawal of the drug alone, but high-dose glucocoicoids (prednisolone1 mg/kg/day) may accelerate recovery and prevent long-term scarring. Other specific causes should be treated, if possible. Chronic interstitial nephritis Chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN) is characterised by renal dysfunction with fibrosis and infiltration of the renal parenchyma by lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages, in association with tubular damage Pathophysiology This disease may follow on from AIN that does not resolve, or may be associated with ingestion of various toxins and drugs, or with metabolic and chronic inflammatory diseases . In many patients, CIN presents at a late stage and no underlying cause can be identified. Genetic causes may underlie many of these cases . Toxins that have been associated with CIN include those contained within the plant Aristolochia clematitis (bihwo). These are probably responsible for the severe nephrotoxicity that can be associated with treatment with herbal medicines in Asia and for Balkan nephropathy, which affects isolated rural communities in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Serbia, possibly through contaminated flour. The nephropathy is commonly linked with tumours of the collecting system and is probably due to the mutagenic effects of the plant toxin on the urothelial epithelium. Ingestion of mushrooms within the Coinarius genus can cause a devastating and irreversible renal tubular toxicity. It is encountered occasionally in Scandina and Scotland.

Sjogren's syndrome classically presents with keratoconjunctivitis (dry eyes) and xerostomia (dry mouth, often resulting in dental caries and fissures in the oral mucosa). These symptoms are due to autoimmune involvement with subsequent scarring of the salivary and lacrimal glands. Parotid gland enlargement is common, as is vasculitis, Raynaud's phenomenon, hyperviscosity syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. The development of oral squamous cell carcinoma is not related to the presence of dental caries. Polyaeritis nodosa is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Patients typically present with low-grade fever, weakness, and weight loss. Abdominal pain, hematuria, renal failure, hypeension, and leukocytosis may occur.

Association of Two variables explained by 3rd variable is ?,Spurious association,Indirect association,Direct association,Causal association,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Indirect association Association Descriptive studies help to suggest an aetiological hypothesis. Analytic and experimental studies test the hypothesis, derived from descriptive studies and confirm or refute the observed association between suspected causes and disease. Association may be defined as the concurrence of two variables more often than would be expected by chance. In other words, events are said to be associated when they occur more frequently togeher than one would expect by chance. Association can be of following types : - 1 .Spurious association Observed association between a disease and suspected factor is spurious, i.e., not real. In other words there is an observed association when none actually exists. 2.Indirect association The indirect association is a statistical association between a variable of interest and a disease due to the presence of another factor, known or unknown, that is common to both the variable and the disease. This third factor (i.e., the common factor) is also known as the confounding variable. For example, endemic goitre (disease) is found at high altitudes (variable), showing thereby an association between altitude and endemic goitre. But it is due to iodine deficiency which is common at high altitude. So, iodine deficiency acts as a confounding factor as it is associated with both high altitude and endemic goitre. 3.Direct (causal) association a) One to one causal relationship Two variables are stated to be causally related if change in one is followed by change in other. If It does not, then their relationship cannot be causal. b) Multifactorial causation The causal thinking is different in non-communicable disease (e.g., CHD) where the etiology is multifactorial, i.e., more than one factors are associated with disease causation.",B

Coomb's + ve Hemolytic Anaemia is seen in all except -,Alcoholic cirrhosis,Chronic active hepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Coombs test (also known as antiglobulin test or AGT) is either of two clinical blood tests used in immunohematology and immunology. The two Coombs tests are the direct Coombs test (DCT, also known as direct antiglobulin test or DAT), and the indirect Coombs test (also known as indirect antiglobulin test or IAT). The direct Coombs test detects antibodies that are stuck to the surface of the red blood cells. Since these antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells, a person can be anemic and this test can help clarify the condition. The indirect Coombs detects antibodies that are floating freely in the blood.. These antibiodies could act against ceain red blood cells and the test can be done to diagnose reactions to a blood transfusion The direct Coombs test is used to test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia--that is, a condition where the immune system breaks down red blood cells, leading to anemia. The direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies or complement proteins attached to the surface of red blood cells. To perform the test, a blood sample is taken and the red blood cells are washed (removing the patient's own plasma and unbound antibodies from the red blood cells) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (""Coombs reagent""). If the red cells then agglutinate, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies or complement proteins are bound to the surface of red blood cells and may be causing destruction of those cells. The indirect Coombs test is used in prenatal testing of pregnant women and in testing prior to a blood transfusion. The test detects antibodies against foreign red blood cells. In this case, serum is extracted from a blood sample taken from the patient. The serum is incubated with foreign red blood cells of known antigenicity. Finally, anti-human globulin is added. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive Coombs positive seen in hepatitis, haemolytic anemias ,biliary cirrhosis,cholangitis,blood transfusions, transplantation Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 763",A

A wide and notched P wave is typically seen in,Mitral stenosis,Cor-Pulmonale,COPD,Pulmonary embolism,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Mitral stenosis Mitral stenosis is icall associated with a Wide and Notched P wave rom Le t Atrial Enlar * ement LAE Cor-Pulmonate, COPD and Pulmonary embolism are all associated with Right Atrial Enlargement resulting in a Tall P wave (not a wide p wave). P wave becomes ""tall"" in RA enlargement and ""wide"" with LA enlargement Components of P wave RA component The SA node depolarises the RA first, so the initial pa of P wave represents RA current. After about 40 msec the wave front reaches LA and it begins it's depolarisation. LA component By the time LA is maximally depolarized the RA already stas its repolarisation. So there is overlap and also a sho time lag between these two wave forms. This is very impoant to recognise as, even if the RA conduction is prolonged in pathology the RA component of P-wave still falls within the LA wave. Hence it is not shown in the ECG and P wave is not widened in RA enlargement. This is in contrast to LA enlargement, when the terminal half of P vector delayed it stretches the P wave wide beyond the normal 100ms. Hence LAE widens the P wave. P wave becomes taller in RA enlargement In classical P pulmonale, the P wave is tall > 2.5 mm. It is easy to explain why it not getting wide than why it is getting taller The atrial vector has two components. The initial RA vector, is directed anteriorly. The main reason is due to the anatomical proximity of RA to the chest wall. Fuher the atrial electrical dp/dt is fast, so the slope of forward limb is steep. Any RA voltage increase is easily picked up by the chest leads. LAE can not produce tall P wave The left atrial vector which follows RA vector is mainly directed posteriorly and hence inscribe a descending limb of P wave. This causes the P terminal force. So the direction of vector forces and the anatomical locality make a tall and positive P deflection highly improbable in LAE.",A

Which of the following is not seen in chronic renal failure: September 2010,Hyperkalemia,Metabolic acidosis,Hypophosphatemia,Hypocalcemia,"Ans. C: Hypophosphatemia CKD (Chronic kidney disease) is initially without specific symptoms and can only be detected as an increase in serum creatinine or protein in the urine. As the kidney function decreases: Blood pressure is increased due to fluid overload and production of vasoactive hormones, increasing one's risk of developing hypeension and/or suffering from congestive hea failure. Urea accumulates, leading to azotemia and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy). Urea is excreted by sweating and crystallizes on skin (""uremic frost""). Potassium accumulates in the blood (hyperkalemia with a range of symptoms including malaise and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias) Erythropoietin synthesis is decreased (potentially leading to anemia, which causes fatigue) Fluid volume overload - symptoms may range from mild edema to life-threatening pulmonary edema Hyperphosphatemia - due to reduced phosphate excretion, associated with hypocalcemia (due to vitamin D3 deficiency). The major sign of hypocalcemia is tetany. Later this progresses to teiary hyperparathyroidism, with hypercalcaemia, renal osteodystrophy and vascular calcification that fuher impairs cardiac function.

Diffuse specific lesions on intestinal biopsy are seen in-,Celiac sprue,Whipples disease,Agammaglobulinemia,Abetalipoproteinemal,"Whipple's disease is a rare, systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. Whipple's disease primarily causes malabsorption but may affect any pa of the body including the hea, brain, joints, skin, lungs and the eyes.Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and ahritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable and approximately 15% of patients do not have these classic signs and symptoms. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and joint pains. The joint pains may be due to migratory non-deforming ahritis, which may occur many years before any digestive tract symptoms develop; they tend to involve the large joints but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface to the point that the joint becomes deformed. Fever and chills occur in a small propoion of people. In its more advanced form, malabsorption (insufficient absorption of nutrients from the diet) leads to wasting and the enlargement of lymph nodes in the abdomen. Neurological symptoms (discussed below) are more common in those with the severe form of the abdominal disease. Chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads to the poor absorption of fat, causing steatorrhea (fatty, offensive-smelling stool), flatulence, and abdominal distension. Protein-losing enteropathy may also occur, causing depletion of albumin, a blood protein, which may lead to peripheral edema caused by the lowered oncotic pressures Ref Davidson edition23rd pg810",B

Incised looking laceration is seen at ?,Forehead,Hand,Thorax,Abdomen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Forehead LACERATIONS (Tear or Rupture) Lacerations are tears or splits of skin, mucous membrane and underlying tissue (e.g., muscle or internal organs). Lacerations are produced by application of blunt force to broad area of the body, which crush or stretch tissues beyond the limits of their elasticity. Localized poions of tissue are displaced by the impact of the blunt force, which sets up traction forces and causes tearing of tissues. Features of lacerations are :? i) Hair and hair bulb, nerves and blood vessels are crushed - There may be paralysis (nerve crushed) and hemorrhage is not pronounced (blood vessels crushed). ii) Site of injury is the site of impact. iii) Shape of injury is irregular, margins are irregular and contused/abraded and show tags of tissue. iv) Size of injury does not corresponds to impacting surface. There are following types of laceration : ? 1) Split laceration : Splitting occurs by crushing of skin between two hard objects. Blunt force on areas where the skin is close to rigid structures like bone with scanty subcutaneous tissue, may produce a wound that by linear splitting of tissue may look like incised wound, i.e., incised like or incised looking wound. Examples of such area are scalp, eye brows, cheek bones (zygomatic), lower jaw, iliac crest, perineum and skin. A wound produced by a fall on knee or elbow with limb flexed and by a sharp stone also simulates incised wound. 2) Strech lacerations : Overstretching of the skin, if it is fixed, will cause laceration, for example, by kicking, sudden deformity of bone occurs after fracture, making it compound. 3) Avulsion (shearing laceration) : An avulsion is a laceration produced by sufficient force (shearing force) delivered at an acute angle to detach (tear off) a poion of a traumatized surface or viscus from its attachment, the shearing and grinding force by a weight. Flaying is type of avulsion in which shearing and grinding force by weight (such as of lorry wheel passing over a limb) may produce avulsion (separation of skin from underlying tissue/degloving of a large area). 4) ears : Tears of the skin and tissues can occur from imact by a against irregular or semi-sharp objects, such as door handle of a car. This is another form of overstretching. 5) Cut laceration : Cut lacerations may be produced by a heavy sharp edged instrument.",A

Which one of the following is the major determinant of plasma osmolality ?,Serum sodium,Serum potassium,Blood glucose,Blood urea nitrogen,"Sodium homeostasis Most of the body's sodium is located in the ECF, where it is by far the most abundant cation. Accordingly, total body sodium is the principal determinant of ECF volume. Sodium intake varies widely between individuals, ranging between 50 and 250 mmol/24 hrs. The kidneys can compensate for these wide variations in sodium intake by increasing excretion of sodium when there is sodium overload, and retaining sodium in the presence of sodium depletion, to maintain normal ECF volume and plasma volume. Functional anatomy and physiology The functional unit for renal excretion is the nephron (Fig. 14.2). Blood undergoes ultrafiltration in the glomerulus, generating a fluid that is free from cells and protein and which resembles plasma in its electrolyte composition. This is delivered into the renal tubules, where reabsorption of water and various electrolytes occurs. (More detail on the structure and function of the glomerulus is given in Ch. 15.) The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is approximately 125 mL/min (equivalent to 180 L/24 hrs) in a normal adult. Over 99% of the filtered fluid is reabsorbed into the blood in the peritubular capillaries during its passage through successive segments of the nephron, largely as a result of tubular reabsorption of sodium. The processes mediating sodium reabsorption, and the factors that regulate it, are key sodium plays main role in plasma osmolarity to understanding clinical disturbances and pharmacological interventions of sodium and fluid balance. The nephron can be divided into at least four different functional segments in terms of sodium reabsorption (Fig. 14.3). Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 350",A

A person breaks someone's mandible in alleged fight. Police can:,Arrest with warrant,Arrest without warrant,Declare him hostile and put him in jail,Put him in mental asylum,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Arrest without warrant Fracture or dislocation of mandible is a 'Grievous Injury' for which punishment is defined under IPC 325. It's a 'cognizable offence' hence a police officer can arrest the accused without warrant.A cognizable offence is one where a police officer can arrest without warrant.A non-cognizable offence is one where police officer cannot arrest without warrant.Arrest is a tool in the hands of a police officer to prevent the accused from escaping the clutches of law. It helps the police officer to prevent further commission of offence as a precautionary method. A warrant is a written order issued by a Magistrate to a police officer commanding him to arrest a person. In most serious crimes there may not be sufficient time to obtain a warrant from the Magistrate. By the time police officer obtains warrant the accused may escape. So the necessity to obtain warrant is not required in serious crimes. In Cognizable offences, the person can be arrested without warrant while it is not possible in non-cognizable offences.",B

Hyperthyroidism as a high cardiac output state. Am Heart J. 1970 Feb;79(2):265-75.Explanation:Hyperthyroidism is the most common cause of hyperkinetic circulatory disease.Thyroid hormone probably produces this high output state by inducing vasodilatation of the circulatory beds supplying muscle and skin.This hormone induced effect lowers the total peripheral resistance which increases cardiac output.The heart responds to the low peripheral resistance by accelerating the heart rate and augmenting stroke volume.Thyroid hormone enhances ventricular contractility.These cardiac responses are generated by a direct effect of thyroid hormone on the cardiovascular system and are essentially independent of autonomic influence.",A

Which of the following is not seen in Secondary Adrenal insufficiency,Pigmentation,Postural hypotension,Hypoglycemia,Lassitude,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Pigmentation Addison's disease The predominant manifestations in Addison's disease occur due to mineralocoicoid deficiency but the symptoms are also contributed by glucocoicoid deficiency and increased ACTH FEATURES OF :- Mineralocoicoid deficiency Lack of aldosterone secretion greatly decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorption and consequently allows sodium ions, chloride ions and water to be lost into urine in great profusion. The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia!, hyperkalemiae and mild acidosise develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) Glucocoicoid deficiency Fatigue, lack of energy o Weight loss, anorexia o Myalgia, joint pain Fever Anemia, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia Slightly increased TSH (due to loss of feedback inhibition of TSH release) Hypoglycemia (more frequent in children) Low blood pressure, postural hypotension oHyponatremia (due to loss of feedback inhibition of AVP release) Mineralocoicoid deficiency Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting Dizziness , postural hypotension Salt craving Low blood pressure, postural hypotension Increased serum creatinine (due to volume depletion) Hyponatremiayperkalemia deficiency Lack of energy Dry and itchy skin (in women) Loss of libido (in women) o Loss of axillary and pubic hair (in women) Symptoms Hyperpigmentation (primary Al only) oAlabaster-colored pale skin (secondary Al only) (due to deficiency of POMC-derived peptides) REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen. ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison:s. disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",A

Chronic renal failure with inappropriately high haemoglobin levels may be seen with,Hypeensive nephropathy,Ischaemic nephropathy,Diabetic nephropathy,Polycystic renal disease,"Clinical features Haemoglobin and erythropoietin levels in polycystic kidney disease increases Common clinical features are shown in Box 15.21. Affected people are usually asymptomatic until later life but hypeension usually occurs from the age of 20 onwards. One or both kidneys may be palpable and the surface may feel nodular. About 30% of patients with PKD also have hepatic cysts (see Fig. 22.39, p. 893) but disturbance of liver function is rare. Sometimes (almost always in women) this causes massive and symptomatic hepatomegaly, usually concurrent with renal enlargement but occasionally with only minor renal involvement. Berry aneurysms of cerebral vessels are an associated feature in about 5% of patients with PKD. This feature appears to be largely restricted to ceain families (and presumably specific mutations). Mitral and aoic regurgitation is frequent but rarely severe, and colonic diveicula and abdominal wall hernias may occur. Investigations The diagnosis is usually based on family history, clinical findings and ultrasound examination. Ultrasound demonstrates cysts in approximately 95% of affected patients over the age of 20 and is the screening method of choice, but may not detect small developing cysts in younger subjects. Cysts may also be identified by other imaging modalities, such as MRI (Fig. 15.15). Simple renal cysts may occur in normal individuals but are uncommon below the age of 30. The following criteria exist for an ultrasound diagnosis of PKD in patients with a family history but unknown genotype: * 15-39 years of age: at least three unilateral or bilateral kidney cysts * 40-59 years of age: at least two cysts in each kidney * 60 years or older: at least four cysts in each kidney. It is now possible to make a molecular diagnosis by mutation screening of PDK1 or PDK2 but this is seldom used in routine clinical practice because the PKD1 gene is so large and has many possible mutations. Next-generation sequencing allows faster and simpler genetic screening for PKD1 and PKD2. This is likely to be used in cases with an unceain diagnosis (young patients, few cysts, lack of family history), for workup of living kidney donors, or for screening for mutations associated with a worse prognosis (see below). Screening for intracranial aneurysms is not generally indicated but can be done by MR angiography in families with a history of subarachnoid haemorrhage. The yield of screening is low, however, and the risk:benefit ratio of intervention in asymptomatic aneurysms in this disease is not clear. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 288",D
"If serum osmolality 300 musm/ivg & urine osmolaUty is 1200 mOsm/kg, what is the diagnosis.",SIADH,Central DI,Nephrogenic Di,Water deprivation,"The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) involves the continued secretion or action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) despite normal or increased plasma volume. The resulting impairment of water secretion and consequent water retention produces the hyponatremia (ie, serum Na+ < 135 mmol/L) with concomitant hypo-osmolality (serum osmolality < 280 mOsm/kg) and high urine osmolality that are the hallmark of SIADH. The key to understanding the pathophysiology, signs, symptoms, and treatment of SIADH is the awareness that the hyponatremia results from an excess of water rather than a deficiency of sodium. Depending on the magnitude and rate of development, hyponatremia may or may not cause symptoms. The history should take into account the following considerations: In general, slowly progressive hyponatremia is associated with fewer symptoms than is a rapid drop of serum sodium to the same value Signs and symptoms of acute hyponatremia do not precisely correlate with the severity or the acuity of the hyponatremia Patients may have symptoms that suggest increased secretion of AVP, such as chronic pain, symptoms from central nervous system or pulmonary tumors or head injury, or drug use Sources of excessive fluid intake should be evaluated The chronicity of the condition should be considered Ref Harrison20th edition pg 288",A

True about Acute Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis is:,Meningitis caused by acanthamoeba species is acute in nature,Diagnosis is by demonstration of trophozoite in CSF,Caused by feco-oral transmission,More common in tropical climate,"Examination of the CSF for trophozoites may be diagnostically helpful, but lumbar puncture may be contraindicated because of increased intracerebral pressure. CT frequently reveals cortical and subcortical lesions of decreased density consistent with embolic infarcts. In other patients, multiple enhancing lesions with edema may mimic the CT appearance of toxoplasmosis. Demonstration of the trophozoites and cysts of Acanthamoeba on wet mounts or in biopsy specimens establishes the diagnosis. Culture on non-nutrient agar plates seeded with Escherichia coli also may be helpful. Fluorescein-labeled antiserum is available from the CDC for the detection of protozoa in biopsy specimens.

Acute physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scoring system is used as a scoring system to,To predict postoperative cardiac risk,To predict postoperative pulmonary complications,To evaluate prognosis in the critical care settings,To evaluate prognosis after acute myocardial infarction,"Currently, the most commonly utilized scoring systems are the APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) system and the SAPS (simplified acute physiology score) system. These systems were designed to predict outcomes in critical illness and use common variables that include age; vital signs; assessments of respiratory, renal, and neurologic function; and an evaluation of chronic medical illnesses. The APACHE II system is the most commonly used SOI scoring system in Noh America. Age, type of ICU admission (after elective surgery vs. nonsurgical or after emergency surgery), a chronic health problem score, and 12 physiologic variables (the most severely abnormal of each in the first 24 h of ICU admission) are used to derive a score. The predicted hospital moality is derived from a formula that takes into account the APACHE II score, the need for emergency surgery, and a weighted, disease-specific diagnostic category. ref:harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2196",C

A rickshaw tyre passed on a 8 year old child. Tyre marks were found on the body. This is an exmaple of :,Percolated bruise,Imprint abrasion,Contusion,Patterned bruise,"Imprint abrasion Real confusion in this question is between imprint abrasion and patterned bruising. In both imprint abrasion and patterned brusing there is mark or pattern of the object causing injury. Abrasion is caused by friction and/or pressure between the skin and some rough object or surface. For abrasions to occur some movement along with pressure is essential between the object or instrument or weapon and the skin. In abrasions superficial layers of skin are crushed and damaged. Bruises or contusions are caused by blunt trauma resulting in rupture of small blood vessels which lead to effusion of blood in subcutaneous or subepithelial tissues. However skin is intact in most cases until associated with abrasions. In an accident in which victim is overrun by vehicle, there will be movement and friction between the tyre and skin along with pressure by the tyre leading to imprint or patterned abrasion. There can be intradermal bruises also which are usually associated with patterned objects. So the tyre mark will be primarily an imprint or patterned abrasion (tyre has a pattern because of ridges and grooves) associated with bruises too. Also know? Abrasions are of following types Scratches - a linear injury produced by a sharp object, such as a pin, thorn, nail or tip of any sharp weapon. Graze - An injury which is produced when a broad surface of skin slides or scraps against a rough surface. These are the most common type. Commonly seen in road accidents. Violent lateral (tangential) rubbing against a rough surface can produce abrasion known as 'brush burn' or 'gravel rash'. 'Friction burn' can occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface. 3. Patterned abrasions: In it pattern of the object causing injury is produced over the skin when the force is applied at right angle to the surface of the skin. Patterned abrasions are produced either by pressure of the object or by impact with a rough object. The .former is called pressure (crushing or friction) abrasion and the latter is known as impact (contact or imprint) abrasion. There can be associated bruising in the surrounding area. Examples are ligature mark, nail and Muir& mark, teeth bite marks, whip marks, radiator, grill or tyre marks in vehicular accidents and muzzle marks in gunshot injuries.",B

Best site of blood sample collection in autopsy is,Femoral vein,Hea,Visceral blood,IVC,"The hea is contracted and the chambers are empty when death has occurred from anaemia, but chambers contain blood when death occurs due to asthenia. After death, reduction of oxygen causes capillary dialtation which is followed by stasis of blood in the dilated capillaries and venules. This causes impaired venous return.As a result of which there is raised venous pressure resulting in over distension and rupture of capillaries and venules. This causes congestion and petechia haemorrhages.Haemorrhages are found in the substance of viscera. Postmoem, the blood is fluid and dark,because of increased amount of carbon dioxide. The large veins are full of blood. Hence the femoral vein is the best site of sample collection in autopsy, whereas the viscera are fully congested. Postmoem fluidity of the blood is assessed.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is characterized by the following-,Hyponatremia and urine sodium excretion > 20 meq/1,Hypernatremia and urine sodium excretion > 20meq/1,Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia,Hypernatremia and hypokalemia,"Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes the body to retain too much water . Actions of ADH Osmoregulation The most impoant and primary function of ADH is to maintain the plasma tonicity, primarily by an alteration in water balance. Osmoreceptors detect the change in effective plasma osmolality in the hypothalamus. A decrease in tonicity prevents ADH release and prevents water retention. An increase in tonicity causes ADH release, which acts on V2 receptors on the luminal surface of coical and medullary collecting tubular cells. Under the influence of ADH, unique aquaporin-2 water channels are formed by the fusion of pre-formed cytoplasmic vesicles in the tubular cells and water is absorbed down the concentration gradient. Once the water is absorbed, these channels are removed by endocytosis and returned to the cytoplasm. In patients with SIADH, levels of ADH are high even in the presence of decreased plasma osmolality and/or hyponatremia. Excess water absorption keeps the blood volume high or normal. Volume Regulation An acute drop in blood pressure as sensed by "" volume receptors"" rather then ""osmoreceptors"" causes ADH release (along with other hormones like rennin and epinephrine) which generates free water absorption from the kidneys. This can potentially lead to hyponatremia and a decrease in effective ECF osmolality. So, the main focus in rapid and/or substantial decrease in blood volume is ""volume regulation,"" even at the cost of osmolality. This affect is more prominent in patients with liver disease or cardiac disease, and hyponatremia in such patients is the direct predictor of a worse prognosis Clinical manifestations of SIADH can be due to hyponatremia and decreased ECF osmolality which causes the water to move into the cells causing cerebral edema. Signs and symptoms depend upon the rate and severity of hyponatremia and the degree of cerebral edema. The earliest clinical manifestations of acute hyponatremia include nausea and malaise, which may be seen when the serum sodium concentration falls below 125 to 130 mEq/L (normal 135 to 145mEq/L). Vomiting is an ominous sign for patients with acute hyponatremia. With a more severe and acute fall in sodium concentration, headache, lethargy, obtundation, and eventually, seizures can occur. Coma and respiratory arrest can occur if the serum sodium level falls below 115 to 120 mEq/L. Acute hyponatremic encephalopathy may be reversible, but permanent neurologic damage or death can occur, paicularly in premenopausal women. Chronic hyponatremia allows cerebral adaptation, and the patients remain asymptomatic despite a serum sodium concentration below 120mmol/L. Nonspecific symptoms like nausea, vomiting, gait disturbances, memory and cognitive problems, fatigue, dizziness, confusion, and muscle cramps can occur with chronic hyponatremia. Sign and symptoms or mild and chronic hyponatremia are often subtle and missed during history and physical examination. Nausea and vomiting effect approximately one-third of patients with chronic hyponatremia who have a serum sodium concentration less then 120 mmol/L. The Idiopathic SIADH is more common in patients over 65 years of age, and mild to moderate hyponatremia in such patients may contribute to fractures in addition to a higher risk of falls and gait problems.

Which of the following is true about CML in children?,Translocation between long arm of chromosome 9 and sho arm of chromosome 22,Protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors are used in treatment,Commonly presents as blast crisis,2nad most common leukemia in children,"small percentage of patients diagnosed with CML are children and young adults. CML represents about 3 percent of newly diagnosed childhood leukemias. The treatment of children with CML is not standardized. It often follows guidelines developed for adults, even though there are differences between CML in children and adults in terms of disease presentation and progression. Some studies indicate that children and young adult patients have lower rates of complete cytogenetic and major molecular responses compared with older adults. Children and young adults might have a slightly higher risk of transformation to accelerated and blast phase. Children with CML should be treated by pediatric hematologist-oncologists (doctors who specialize in treating pediatric patients with blood cancer). The following TKI drugs are approved to treat CML in children: Imatinib (Gleevec(r)) Dasatinib (Sprycel(r)) Nilotinib (Tasigna(r)) Since children with CML may receive TKI therapy for much longer than adults and during periods of active growth, follow-up care is very impoant. In addition to testing their pediatric patients' responses to therapy, doctors should also monitor children's Height and weight--Doctors should consider a bone scan and a bone density scan if there is evidence of abnormal growth. Pubey--Doctors should refer patients to an endocrinologist if there is a delay in pubey. Thyroid function Hea--Patients should have an annual echocardiogram. Poor adherence to therapy, paicularly in adolescents and young adults, is an additional concern. With oral TKIs, it is impoant to follow the doctor's directions and keep taking the medication for as long as prescribed. Nonadherence to TKI treatment is known to increase the risk of lower response or possibly treatment failure. Taking into account the potential concerns of lifelong TKI treatment, researchers are studying stopping TKIs after a period of deep molecular response. Treatment-free remission is now considered a goal of treatment for selected patients and is a focus of study in various ongoing clinical trials. Intermittent TKI dosing is another potential method to reduce long-term side effects in pediatric CML patients, but more studies are needed to evaluate this approach. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is another treatment option.

Elevation of d-dimer indicates endogenous although often clinically ineffective thrombolysis. The sensitivity of the d-dimer is >80% for DVT (including isolated calf DVT) and >95% for PE. The d-dimer is less sensitive for DVT than for PE because the DVT thrombus size is smaller. The d-dimer is a useful ""rule out"" test. More than 95% of patients with a normal (<500 ng/mL) d-dimer do not have PE. The d-dimer assay is not specific. Levels increase in patients with myocardial infarction, pneumonia, sepsis, cancer, postoperative state and pregnancy (2nd/3rd trimester).# Increased fibrinogen degradation products (D-dimer assay) is sensitive, but not specific.",D

Surveillance Surveillance is the continuous scrutiny of the factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of disease and other conditions of ill health. In simple words ""surveillance is systemic ongoing collection, collation and analysis of data and the timely dissemination of information to those who need to know so that action can be taken"". According to above definition, monitoring becomes one specific and essential pa of the broader concept embraced by surveillance. Following example will help to differentiate these two ? In tobacco control - Surveillance includes collection of data about prevalence of tobacco use, its health and enconomic consequences, its socio-cultural determinats and tobacco control policy responses and tobacco industry activities. By collecting all these information effective tobacco control interventions can be taken. Monitoring will continously oversight the activities of this tobacco control interventions, to ensure that they are proceeding according to plan. It keeps track of achievement, resources supply and utilization, staff movement, etc, so that if anything goes wrong, immediate corrective measure can be taken. So, In surveillance, data is collected & collated, and this information is used to know what action to be taken - making a plan of action. Monitoring than keep a watch that this plan of action is working properly It is a pa of continued surveillance.

"All of the following are characteristic feature of obstructive pulmonary disease, except:",Normal Residual Volume,Decreased FEV1,Normal Vital Capacity,Decreased FCV1/FVC,"Answer is A (Residual volume Normal): Lung disease is typically associated with an Increased Residual volume Taken from Harrison 17th/1588 The hallmark of obstructive Lung Disease is decreased expiratory flow rate such the FEF25_75 is reduced and FEVI is typically reduced out of propoion to the Forced Vital Capacity ('FEV1/FVC). The Residual volume is typically increased. The vital capacity (FVC) may be normal or decreased while Total Lung capacity may be normal or increased. The hallmark of Restrictive Lung Disease is a decrease in lung volume typically TLC and vital capacity. Flow rates are preserved and hence FEF25_75 is generally normal. Also, when FEV1 is considered as a percentage of FVC, (FEV1/ FVC), the flow rates are often supranormal i.e. disporopoionately high relative to the size of lungs. Residual volume is also generally decreased.",A

False positive rheumatoid factor can be associated With all except-,Inflammatory bowel disease,HbsAg,VDRL,Coombs test,"Rheumatoid factor: Antibodies in rheumatoid disease, especially the IgM, can be demonstrated by the Rose Waaler test, latex fixation test or bentonite flocculation. Rheumatoid factor is positive in 80% of adults with rheumatoid ahritis. A differential agglutination titer of16 and above is diagnostic of rheumatoid ahritis. Patients with systemic inflammatory diseases such as RA will often present with elevated nonspecific inflammatory markers such as an ESR or CRP. Detection of serum RF and anti-CCP antibodies is impoant in differentiating RA from other polyaicular diseases, although RF lacks diagnostic specificity and may be found in association with other chronic inflammatory diseases in which ahritis figures in the clinical manifestations.IgM, IgG, and IgA isotypes of RF occur in sera from patients withRA, although the IgM isotype is the one most frequently measured by commercial laboratories. Serum IgM RF has been found in 75-80% ofpatients with RA; therefore, a negative result does not exclude the presence of this disease. It is also found in other connective tissue diseases,such as primary Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus,and type II mixed essential cryoglobulinemia, as well as chronic infections such as subacute bacterial endocarditis and hepatitis B and C.Serum RF may also be detected in 1-5% of the healthy population.The presence of serum anti-CCP antibodies has about the same sensitivity as serum RF for the diagnosis of RA. However, its diagnostic specificity approaches 95%, so a positive test for anti-CCP antibodies inthe setting of an early inflammatory ahritis is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of ahritis. There is some incremental value intesting for the presence of both RF and anti-CCP, as some patients withRA are positive for RF but negative for anti-CCP and vice versa. The presence of RF or anti-CCP antibodies also has prognostic significance, with anti-CCP antibodies showing the most value for predicting worse outcomes . Ref - harrisons 20e p2535",A

True about Rheumatic fever-,Chorea is aggravated during pregnancy,Chorea & ahritis co-existing,Subcutaneous nodules are tender,Erythema multiforme seen,"Ref: R Alagappan - Manual of Practical Medicine 4th Edition.pg no: 146-147 Rheumatic Fever Acute, recurrent, inflammatory disease, mainly of children (aged 5-15 years), typically occurring 1-5 weeks after group A streptococcal infection. Pathophysiology 1. Cross reactivity of host antistreptococcal antibodies to cardiac antigens 2. Microbe initiated autoimmune reactivity. Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever. Minor Criteria Clinical 1. Fever 2. Ahralgia 3. Previous history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic hea disease. Laboratory 1. Acute phase reactants (leucocytosis, raised ESR, C-reactive protein) 2.

On examination her blood pressure is 122/82, pulse 85, RR 14, with clear lungs, regular heartbeat, and 1+ bilateral pedal edema.

What is the most common pathophysiologic scenario leading to this acid-base disturbance?",The combination of long-standing diabetes and hypertension has led to distal nephron dysfunction inhibiting both acid and potassium secretion.,The patient's heart failure has caused decreased renal perfusion resulting in the metabolic abnormalities.,The patient has been overtreated with diuretics leading to intravascular volume depletion and acidosis.,The patient's aspirin use has led to toxicity in the setting of acute kidney injury and hence the metabolic acidosis.,"Type 4 renal tubular acidosis occurs when there is distal nephron dysfunction leading to disproportionate levels of hyperkalemia and acidosis compared to the degree of kidney disease encountered. This is most commonly seen in patients with long-standing diabetes and can be exacerbated by the use of non-steroidal, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A patient with congestive heart failure and renal hypoperfusion can develop prerenal azotemia, but you would expect clinical evidence of decompensated heart failure and an elevated BUN to creatinine ratio (well above 10/1). A patient who has been over diuresis will tend to have hypokalemia, a higher BUN/Cr ratio and a contraction alkalosis.

Most common organ affected in u nderwater blast -,Intestine,Liver,Spleen,Heart,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Intestine o The most common organ affected in underwater blast injury is intestine.Explosion injuryo An explosion is a phenomenon resulting from sudden release of energy which is then dissipated by a blast wave, by translocation of objects, or by the generation of heat. Injuries in explosion occur due to four factorsBlast or shock waveWhen an explosion occurs, the explosive material produces a large volume of gas and releases a large amount of energy. It produces a 'shock wave' which spread concentrically from the site of explosion. The injuries depend on the enviomment in which blast occursAir blast (most common) : Explosion occurs in air. There is barotrauma to air filled hollow organs. Tympanic membrane (ear drum) is most sensitive and most commonly injured. Lung is the second organ to be injured and is the most commonly injured hollow organ and most common cause of life threatening injury. Other parts injured are middle ear, cochlea, eyes, bowels, mesentery, omentum and brain. Homogenous solid organs like liver and muscles are usually not affected.Under water blast (explosion under water) : Gastrointestinal tract is injured most commonly. Lungs are also injured.Solid blast: Explosive is detonated near a rigid-'solid structure and wave of energy spreads through it. If people are in contact with that rigid structure, injuries take place. The injuries are mostly skeletal. fracture of legs and vertebral column are more common. GIT damage is more common than lung.Flame or hot gasesBums or burning of body may occur.Flying missiles (debris)Flying pieces of explosive debris may be driven through air against the skin causing bruises, abrasions, lacerations, and ragged perforations.AnoxiaVarious gases liberated during explosion may cause anoxia, e.g. carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, HCN and SO2",A

Gradient in pulmonary aery wedge pressure and left ventricular end diastolic pressure is seen in,Aoic regurgitation,Constrictive pericarditis,Left atrial myxoma,Pulmonary thromboembolism,Answer is C (Left atrial myxoma) An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle such as atrial myxoma. Pulmonary aery wedge pressure represents Left atrial pressure. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure represents Left ventricular pressure. Gradient between Left atrial pressure (PCWP) and Left ventricular pressure during diastole: Normally there is no gradient during diastole as both pressures are equal. An increased gradient during diastole is suggestive of an obstructive lesion between Left atrium and Left ventricle that is not allowing pressures to normalize between the atria and ventricle.

Marker test for vertical transmission of HIV,p24 antigen,Serum ELISA,Western blot,Immunoblot,"Ans. (a) p24 antigenRef : Harrison 19th ed. /1246-47* Following HIV infection, the sequences of markers to identify infection in their chronologic order of appearance in serum are: viral RNA followed by p24 antigen and lastly anti-HIV antibody.* ELISA is positive in all babies born to HIV positive mother, due to transplacental transferrin of anti - HIV antibody.* About 2 weeks after infection, viremia is thought to increase exponentially and then decline to a steady- state level as the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses control HIV replication. This time interval, the serologic ""window period,"" is characterized by seronegativity, occasionally detectable antigenemia, viremia (as measured by RNA), and variable CD4 lymphocyte levels. Detection of specific antibody to HIV signals the end of the window period and labels the individual as seropositive.* The exact time when HIV RNA, antigen, and antibody can be detected depends on several factors, including the test used, individual host responses, and viral characteristics. Viral RNA can be detected within the first 2 weeks using the highly sensitive RT-PCR method. Antigen, although transient, can appear as early as 2 weeks after infection and lasts 3 to 5 months Newer generation antibody assays, including the HIV third generation antigen-sandwich antibody assays, can detect antibody in most individuals at about 3 to 4 weeks post- infection and Hep D.",A

All of the following are true regarding levodopa except,Half life of levodopa is 60 to 90 minutes,"Levodopa can cause ohostatic hypotension, dyskinesias",Levodopa cannot cross the blood brain barrier,"With continued use, the duration of benefit following an individual dose of levodopa becomes progressively shoer.","Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), so clinical trials were initiated with levodopa, the precursor of dopamine. Studies over the course of the next decade confirmed the value of levodopa and revolutionized the treatment of PD. Levodopa is routinely administered in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor to prevent its peripheral metabolism to dopamine and the development of nausea, vomiting, and ohostatic hypotension due to activation of dopamine receptors in the area postrema that are not protected by the BBB. Levodopa-induced motor complications consist of fluctuations in motor response and involuntary movements known as dyskinesias which typically complicate ""on"" periods. When patients initially take levodopa, benefits are long-lasting (many hours) even though the drug has a relatively sho half-life (60-90 min).

Mechanism of hypoxemia in asthma is,Hypoventilation,Diffusion decreased,Shunting,Ventilation perfusin mismatch,"Pathophysiology Airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) - the tendency for airways to narrow excessively in response to triggers that have little or no effect in normal individuals is integral to the diagnosis of asthma and appears to be related, although not exclusively, to airwayinflammation . Other factors likely to be impoant in the behaviour of airway smooth muscle include the degree of airway narrowing and neurogenic mechanisms. The relationship between atopy (the propensity to produce IgE) and asthma is well established and in many individuals there is a clear relationship between sensitisation and allergen exposure, as demonstrated by skin-prick reactivity or elevated serum-specific IgE. Common examples of allergens include house dust mites, pets such as cats and dogs, pests such as cockroaches, and fungi. Inhalation of an allergen into the airway is followed by an early and late-phase bronchoconstrictor response . Allergic mechanisms are also implicated in some cases of occupational asthma . In cases of aspirin-sensitive asthma, the ingestion of salicylates results in inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, preferentially shunting the metabolism of arachidonic acid through the lipoxygenase pathway with resultant production of the asthmogenic cysteinyl leukotrienes. In exercise-induced asthma, hyperventilation results in water loss from the pericellular lining fluid of the respiratory mucosa, which, in turn, triggers mediator release. Heat loss from the respiratory mucosa may also be impoant. In persistent asthma, a chronic and complex inflammatory response ensues, characterised by an influx of numerous inflammatory cells, the transformation and paicipation of airway structural cells, and the secretion of an array of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Examination of the inflammatory cell profile in induced sputum samples demonstrates that, although asthma is predominantly characterised by airway eosinophilia, neutrophilic inflammation predominates in some patients while in others scant inflammation is observed: so-called 'pauci- granulocytic' asthma.

Which of the following statements about Dawn phenomenon is true:,Morning hyperglycemia with midnight hypoglycemia,Morning hypoglycemia with midnight hyperglycemia,Morning hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin,Morning hypoglycemia due to excess insulin,"Answer is C (Morning hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin): Dawn phenomenon typically refers to early morning hyperglycemia with stable blood glucose levels all night (no Hypoglycemia at night) Although typically Dawn phenomenon is caused by early morning physiological surge of counter regulatory hormones such as coisol, and growth hormone, inadequate night time insulin may also contribute to the 'Dawn phenomenon' (Early morning hyperglycemia). What causes the ""dawn phenomenon""? The term dawn phenomenon describes a rise in, blood glucose that occurs during the early morning hours (between 5:00 and 8:00 Am), paicularly among patients who have normal glucose levels throughout most of the night. The rise in glucose is thought to be due to several factors, including the following: The normal increase in the morning coisol level The cumulative effect of increased nocturnal growth hormone Insulinopenia as a result of the length of time since the last injection Strategies for managing the dawn phenomenon Shift more aggressive insulin use to the evening and pre-bedtime hours, using a type of insulin that has a longer duration or peak of action, initiating insulin pump therapy Not eating a carbohydrate snack at bedtime Increasing the amount of vigorous physical activity in the evening hours. The specific strategy or combination of strategies must be tailored to the individual. What is Somogyi phenomenon? The Somogyi phenomenon is rebound hyperglycemia after an incident of hypoglycemia. This rebound is secondary to the release of counterregulatory hormones, which is the natural response to hypoglycemia. As tighter glucose control is maintained, there is an increased likelihood of hypoglycemia and, therefore, of the Somogyi phenomenon. If the hypoglycemia is recognized and treated promptly, rebound hyperglycemia is less like to occur. Thus, the Somogyi phenomenon is commonly repoed more frequently at night because there is the greater likelihood of unrecognized and untreated hypoglycemia when the patient is asleep. When should the Somogyi phenomenon be suspected? The Somogyi phenomenon should be suspected when a person whose blood sugar is in excellent control begins to have intermittent high blood glucoses in the morning. If that pattern is noted, blood glucose should be checked between 2:00 and 3:00 AM on several nights to determine whether hypoglycemia is occurring. If night time hypoglycemia can be documented the likely diagnosis is Somogyi phenomenon. This may require the dose or type of evening insulin or the time that the dose is given to be altered.",C

All of the following are approaches to healtheducation:,Service approach,Regulatory approach,Health education approach,Mass media,"Mass media [Ref: Park 20/e p761, 766,7681 According to Alma-Ata declaration (1978), ""Health education is a process aimed at encouraging people to want to be healthy to know how to stay healthy to do what they can individually and collectively to maintain health and seek help when needed"". Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health. Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person' s level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures. There are 4 well-known approaches to health education: 1. Regulatory approach (Managed prevention) - There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations. - The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E.g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat belts 2. Service approach - The service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation. * - This is mainly the responsibility of the health depament and health workers both in government and non? government health agencies. - The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health. - The service approach will be a failure when it is not based an the ""felt needs"" of the people. 3. Health education approach - The health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health. - Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E.g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, feility control. 4. Primary health care approach - The primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health. - This is a radically new approach staing from the people with their full paicipation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination. - The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health. Mass media is a method of health communication. (p766, 768, Park 20/e)",D

Polio case definition for AFP surveillance ?,Onset of AFP,Residual paralysis,Stool specimen positive for virus,All of the above,"Ans. is `d' i.e., All of the above AFP Surveillance Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is carried out to identify all remaining infected areas, monitor progress towards eradication and target supplementary immunization appropriately. The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most impoant etiology of AFP, other causes are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis. AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and repoing them immediately to district immunization officer. Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are repoed, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP repoing will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, repoed and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease. The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus. WHO recommends the immediate repoing and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to repo any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis) Cases ofAFP are classified as Polio if : Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen. Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if : Stool specimens were inadequate and Residual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and 'Expe review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data.",D

Interval between primary and secondary cases ?,Latent period,Communicable period,Serial interval,Generation time,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Serial interval Latent period, serial interval and generation time, all are approximate measure of incubation period, i.e., these period can give some idea about incubation period. Latent period The period from disease initiation to disease detection. It is used in non-infectious disease as the equivalent of incubation period in infectious disease. Serial interval The gap time between onset of primary case and secondary case. By collecting information about a whole series of such onset, we get a distribution of secondary cases from which we can guess the incubation period. Generation time Interval between receipt of infecton by host and maximal infectivity of the host. Generation time is roughly equal to the incubation period. About option 'b' Communicable period The time during which an infectious agent may be transferred directly or indirectly from an infected person to another person. The period of communicability has no relation with incubation period, it merely reflects the duration when the infectious agent may be transferred. This may occur during incubation period, during actual illness or during convalsescence. Generally communicable diseaes are not communicable in incubation period except - measles, Chicken pox, Peussis hepatitis A, i.e., these diseases are communicable during their late incubation period.",C

To overcome this problem 't' test was devised by W.S. Cassette whose pen name was 'student' and hence this test was called student T test. Application of test : It is applied to find the significance of difference between two means, when sample size is less than 30. It is applied on a standard population either as : 1. Unpaired `e test : Applied when data is unpaired, i.e. when separate observations are made on inidividuals of two separate groups, and these need to be compared : Null hypothesis is assumed Observed diference between means of two samples is found. Standard error or difference between two means is calculated. t value is estimated. This is the ratio between points 2 and 3. Degrees of freedom are next calculated Calculated values are compared with the table values at the calculated degree of freedom (option d) P values are obtained and if it is more than 0.05, it has no significance. 2. Paired test : Is applied to paired data, when each individual gives a pair of observations such as : when observations are made before and after the play of a factor e.g. pulse rate before and after a drug. Fuher, it proceeds similar to the unpaired test.",B

Which drug is essential in Sheehan's syndrome-,Estrogen,Coisone,Thyroxin,Growth hormone,"Sheehan syndrome, is a rare complication of postpaum hemorrhage, where there is necrosis of the pituitary gland (anterior pituitary is more susceptible to damage than the posterior pituitary) and pituitary failure. The pituitary gland is physiologically enlarged in pregnancy and is therefore very sensitive to the decreased blood flow caused by massive hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock. The typical picture is failure of lactation (first sign often), amenorrhoea, hypothyroidism and adrenocoical insufficiency. Treatment of young women with Sheehan's syndrome usually includes replacement of hydrocoisone first and then replacement of thyroid hormone and estrogen with or without progesterone depending on whether she has a uterus. Hydrocoisone is replaced first because thyroxine therapy can exacerbate glucocoicoid deficiency and theoretically induce an adrenal crisis. The standard dose of hydrocoisone is 20 mg/d for an adult (15 mg every morning and 5 mg every evening). Reference : page 402 Textbook of Obstetrics Sheila Balakrishnan 2nd edition",B

Symptoms peak within an hour of onset and persist for hours to days. A positive family history is found in as many as 50% of cases. Tension headaches are more often bilateral and described as ""band-like"" or ""vise-like"" and are not usually associated with visual auras. TIAs more typically present as a transient monocular blindness without aura or headache. Cranial aeritis may present as painless loss of vision without aura. Meningoencephalitis is associated with nuchal rigidity and diffuse headache but not with visual auras. Acute treatment of migraine headache consists of ergotamine tarate, antiemetics, and analgesics.

"In hemolytic anemia, all of the following are true except: March 2005",Bone marrow hyperplasia,Reticulocytosis,Increased unconjugated bilirubin,Increased haptoglobulin,"Ans. D: Increased haptoglobulin Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. In most of the cases, a bone marrow aspirate is not necessary in the diagnostic workup; if it is done, it shows erythroid hyperplasia. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane is damaged in circulation, leading to intravascular hemolysis and the appearance of schistocytes. Infectious agents such as malaria and babesiosis invade red blood cells. Disorders of red blood cell enzymes, membranes, and hemoglobin cause hereditary hemolytic anemias. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency leads to hemolysis in the presence of oxidative stress. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by spherocytes, a family history, and a negative direct antiglobulin test. Sickle cell anemia and thalassemia are hemoglobinopathies characterized by chronic hemolysis.",D

"Amongst the following, which carries the least chance of transmitting HIV infection: September 2010",Heterosexual Intercourse,Blood transfusion,Veical transmission,IV drug abusers,"Ans. A: Heterosexual Intercourse. Heterosexual Intercourse is the most common route but the chance of infection is less (0.30%) ,looking to the other options. Average per act risk of getting HIVby exposure route to an infected source Exposure routeChance of infection Blood transfusion 90% Childbih (to child) 25% Needle-sharing injection drug use 0.67% Percutaneous needle stick 0.30% Receptive anal intercourse* 0.04-3.0% Inseive anal intercourse* 0.03% Receptive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.05-0.30% Inseive penile-vaginal intercourse* 0.01-0.38% Receptive oral intercourse*SS 0-0.04% Inseive oral intercourse*SS 0-0.005% * assuming no condom useSS source refers to oral intercourseperformed on a man Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use. MC mode of transmission: Hetero-sexual In hetero-sexual transmission: Male to female is commoner (as compared to female to male) Chances of transmission with accidental needle prick: 0.3%. Less commonly, HIV may be spread From mother to child during pregnancy, bih, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and sta HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV. In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by Oral sex--putting the mouth on the penis (fellatio), vagina (cunnilingus), or anus (rimming). In general, there's little to no risk of getting HIV from oral sex. Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV. This was more common in the early years of HIV, but now the risk is extremely small because of rigorous testing of the blood supply and donated organs and tissues. Eating food that has been pre-chewed by an HIV-infected person. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver's mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants. Being bitten by a person with HIV. Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. Contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and HIV-infected blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Deep, open-mouth kissing if both paners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive paner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative paner. HIV is not spread through saliva.",A

Recommendation of daily moderate exercise for an adult is,15 mins,30 mins,45 mins,60 mins,"Physical activity for all These recommendations are relevant to all healthy adults aged 18-64 years unless specific medical conditions indicate to the contrary. They are applicable for all adults irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity or income level. They also apply to individuals in this age range with chronic noncommunicable conditions not related to mobility such as hypeension or diabetes. These recommendations can be valid for adults with disabilities. However adjustments for each individual based on their exercise capacity and specific health risks or limitations may be needed. There are multiple ways of accumulating the total of 150 minutes per week. The concept of accumulation refers to meeting the goal of 150 minutes per week by performing activities in multiple shoer bouts, of at least 10 minutes each, spread throughout the week then adding together the time spent during each of these bouts: e.g. 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity 5 times per week. Pregnant, postpaum women and persons with cardiac events may need to take extra precautions and seek medical advice before striving to achieve the recommended levels of physical activity for this age group. Inactive adults or adults with disease limitations will have added health benefits if moving from the category of ""no activity"" to ""some levels"" of activity. Adults who currently do not meet the recommendations for physical activity should aim to increase duration, frequency and finally intensity as a target to achieving them.

"In civil negligence, onus of proof lies on:",Judicial first degree magistrate,Police not below the level of sub inspector,Doctor,Patient,"D i.e. Patient In case of malpractice, punishment is given by civil or criminal couQ (depending on type of negligence). Generally, the innocence of doctor is assumed and in cases where negligence is alleged, the plantiff (complainant, patient) has to establish the guilt. The patient is expected to prove that the defendant (doctor) was negligent; there fore the onus (responsibility) of proof lies on patient. But when the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor (ie thing speaks for itself) is applied such as in case of surgery on wrong patient / side / organ etc, the doctor will have to prove that what has happened is not due to his negligenceQ. This means onus of proof lies on patient in negligence (all civil & most criminal case) except in cases where doctrine of res ipsa loquitor appliesQ. Therapeutic misadventure (mischance / disaster / accident) is death or injury of a patient due to some unintentional act by doctor /nurse /hospitalQ during treatment (therapeutic), diagnosis (diagnostic) or experimental study. It provides defence against neglince because a doctor can't be held responsible for injuries resulting from adverse reaction of drug. However, the doctor must warn patient about possible side effects (eg death during surgery or transfusion). And ignorance of the possibility of reaction to drug prescribed to patient amounts to negligence (ie it is not 100% = absolute defence). At times it is not possible to explain every thing to the patient (who may be scared of procedure). Under such circumstances doctor can reveal the details to any one of close relatives of patient. This is called doctrine of therapeutic privilege. Doctrine of emergency says that doctor can provide the treatment without taking prior consent from a patient who is gravely sick, (critically ill), unconscious, or not able to understand the suggestion, or when mentally ill (IPC section 92). In emergency situation involving children, when their parents are not available, a/t doctrine of locoparentis, consent can be obtained from accompanying person (eg teacher or relative). On ceain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient might suffer severe injuries or permanent deformity. This is k/a medical maloccurance, inevitable act or Act of God. If doctor proves this before cou, it will be an absolute defence against malpractice. Free (charity) treatment of patient does not give doctor immunity (defence) against negligenceQ. Whereas judgemental (diagnostic) error, therapeutic misadventure, medical maloccurance, calculated risk doctrine, contributory negligence (on pa of patient), product liability, and res judicata (complain already tried once in cou) provide defenses to a doctor against charges of negligence. Law does not consider doctrine of contributory negligence & consent in charges of criminal negligence; whereas these provide defence in civil negligence.",D

Which drug is used for Mvaesthenia Gravis testing-,Edrophonium,Adrenaline,Phycostigmine,Acetylcholine,"Ans is 'a' i.e., Edrophonium Diagnosis of myasthenia graviso Myasthenia gravis presents with characteristic clinical featuresSeveral special diagnostic Tests for mysthenia gravisElectrophysiological Testingo Characteristic of myasthenia on electrophysiological testing is rapid reduction in the amplitude of muscle action potentials evoked during a series of repetitive stimulations of a peripheral nerve at a rate of 3 per second (decrementing response)o The traditional and simple method is to stimulate the nerve at 3 Hz and to measure the compound muscle action potential (a decrement of more than 10% when comparing the fifth to the first response is abnormal)Single fibre electromyographyo This is more sensitive but technically more difficult than electrophysiological testingo Confirmatory but not specific, often performed in conjuction.o This technique demonstrates an inconstancy in the firing of fibres connected to the same motor unit or a blocking of successive discharges from single muscle fibre belonging to the same motor unit.Edrophonium and Neostigmine test/Tensilon testo When edrophonium and neostigmine are given intravenously, it produces a transient improvement in strength in patients with myasthenia.o Edrophonium and neostigmine are anticholinesterase so they prolong and exaggerate the effect of acetylcholine in the synapse and therefore provide an increment in muscle power in patient with myasthenia.o Diagnosis is highly sensitive with 85% sensitivity inocular and 95% sensitivity in systemic myaesthenia.Measurement of receptor antibodies in the blood:o Measurement of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies provides a sensitive and highly specific test for the diagnosis of myasthenia. Presence of Ach antibodies is virtually diagnostic of Myaesthenia graves.o Sensitivity is limited to about 50% in purely occular myasthenia and about 85% in generalized myasthenia.o Definitive if positive but negative test does not rules out the diagnosis.",A

Nysten&;s rule is related to,Order of appearance of post moem caloricity,Time since death,Order of appearance of decomposition,Order of appearance of rigor mois,"The Order of Appearance of Rigor All muscles of the body, both voluntary and involuntary are affected. It does not sta in all muscles simultaneously (Nysten&;s rule). It first appears in involuntary muscles; the myocardium becomes rigid in an hour. It begins in the eyelids, neck and lower jaw and passes upwards to the muscles of the face, and downwards to the muscles of the chest, upper limbs, abdomen and lower limbs and lastly in the fingers and toes. In individual limbs, it usually progresses from above downwards. Such a sequence is not constant, symmetrical or regular. In individual limbs, it disappears in the same order in which it has appeared. Shapiro (1950) suggests that rigor mois does not follow the anatomical sequence usually described. He suggests that as rigor mois is a physicochemical process, it is most likely to develop simultaneously in all the muscles, although the changes are more easily first detected in the smaller masses than in the larger. The proximo-distal progression is more apparent than real, for the sequence is determined by the bulk and kind of muscle involved. Ref:- k s narayan reddy; pg num:-161",D

All the following are true in a randomized control trial (RCT) except -,Baseline characteristics of intervention and control groups should be similar,Investigator's bias is minimized by double blinding,The sample size required depends on the hypothesis,The drop-outs from the trial should be excluded from the analysis,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., The dropouts from the trial should be excluded from the analysis There is confusion about option c and d. But after reading following text you will not have any confusion. Option 'c' o As I have explained in previous explanation sample size depends upon underlying expected event rate in the control group. o The underlying expected event rate is established usually from previous studies, including observational coho study. So, the expected event rate will depends on the hypothesis made by previous study e.g., Coho study. o As the expected event rate is one of the component to calculate sample size, previously made hypothesis will determine the sample size (see above explanation). Option `d' Many subjects under study do not come for follow up, i.e., they dropout. This may cause misleading aifacts. o To avoid this intention to treat trial (intention to treat analysis) approch is utilized. ""Intention to treat"" is a strategy for the analysis of randomized control trials that compares patients in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned. o Everyone who begins the treatment is considered to be a pa of the trial, whether they finish or not (dropouts not excluded). So, intentention to treat analysis avoids the effects of : - i) Crossover --> Because patients are compared in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned. ii)Dropouts --> Everyone considered to be a pa of study whether they finish treatment or not. About remaining two options o Basline characteristics of study and control groups should be similar. Randomization is the statistical procedure in on RCT by which an attempt is made to make the study and control group comparable. o Double blinding minimizes both investigator bias and subject bias.",D

"All of the following statements about Pulse deficit in Atrial Fibrillation are true , except:",Usually more than 10/minute,Increases with faster ventricular rates,May be absent in digitalis intoxication,Radial pulse rate may be more than ventricular pulse rate,"Answer is D (Radial pulse rate may be more than ventricular pulse rate) The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. Pulse deficit refers to the difference between the radial pulse rate and the hea rate counted by auscultation (Apical Ventricular Rate). Pulse deficit is produced when ventricular contractions are preceded by sho diastoles such that poor ventricular filling results in insufficient stroke volume to transmit the pressure wave out to the radial pulse. The radial pulse rate is always lower than the ventricular pulse rate. Pulse Deficit in Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of pulse deficit (Pulse deficit has traditionally been believed to be a classical bedside sign for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation) Pulse deficit in Atrial Fibrillation is often more than 10 per minute. Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation is greater when the ventricular rate is high Pulse deficit in atrial fibrillation may be absent in patients with slow ventricular rate (<50) If a digitalized patient with a prior diagnosis of chronic atrial fibrillation presents with a perfectly regular pulse, one should suspect digitalis intoxication with a regular nodal rhythm and atrioventricular dissociation.

Systemic sclerosis shows all except,Acroosteolysis,Tufting,Calcinosis cutis,Digital ulcers,"Systemic scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis, is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by excessive production and accumulation of collagen, called fibrosis, in the skin and internal organs and by injuries to small aeries. There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without involvement of the face. The diffuse form affects also the skin above the elbows and knees and can spread also to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, hea, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process. Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 75%; less than 10% develop pulmonary aerial hypeension after 10 to 20 years. Patients with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis have a 10-year survival rate of 55%. Death is most often caused by lung, hea, and kidney involvement. There is also a slight increase in the risk of cancer Skin symptoms In the skin, systemic sclerosis causes hardening and scarring. The skin may appear tight, reddish, or scaly. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Where large areas are affected, fat and muscle wastage may weaken limbs and affect appearance. Patients repo severe and recurrent itching of large skin areas. The severity of these symptoms varies greatly among patients: Some having scleroderma of only a limited area of the skin (such as the fingers) and little involvement of the underlying tissue, while others have progressive skin involvement.Digital ulcers--open wounds on especially on fingeips and less commonly the knuckles--are not uncommon Diffuse scleroderma can cause musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal and other complications. Patients with greater cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud's phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud's normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud's can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees or other joints. Musculoskeletal The first joint symptoms that patients with scleroderma have are typically non specific joint pains, which can lead to ahritis, or cause discomfo in tendons or muscles.Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by calcinosis or skin thickening.Patients may develop muscle weakness, or myopathy, either from the disease or its treatments. Lungs Some impairment in lung function is almost universally seen in patients with diffuse scleroderma on pulmonary function testing;however, it does not necessarily cause symptoms, such as shoness of breath. Some patients can develop pulmonary hypeension, or elevation in the pressures of the pulmonary aeries. This can be progressive, and can lead to right-sided hea failure. The earliest manifestation of this may be a decreased diffusion capacity on pulmonary function testing. Other pulmonary complications in more advanced disease include aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumothorax Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 845",B

When exposure to moldy hay is stopped, symptoms and signs of farmer's lung all tend to abate and complete recovery usually follows. In acute syndromes, the presentation is 4-8 hours after exposure. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, cough, and dyspnea without wheezing. The rate of disease depends on rainfall (which promotes fungal growth) and agricultural practices related to turning and stacking hay. In acute and subacute presentations, removing exposure to the antigen will result in complete recovery.",C

WHO ORS has -,K+ -20mmol\/L,Na+ -90mmol\/L,HCO3 -10mmol\/L,Osmolality -150mmol\/L,"<p>ORS Aim of oral rehydration therapy is to prevent dehydration and reduce moality. Oral fluid therapy is based on the observation that glucose given orally enhances the intestinal absorption of salt and water and is capable of correcting electrolyte and water deficit. At first the composition of oral rehydration salt recommended by WHO was sodium bicarbonate based. Inclusion of trisodium citrate in place of sodium bicarbonate made the product more stable and it resulted in less stool output especially in high output diarrhoea, probably because of direct effect of trisodium citrate in increasing intestinal absorption of sodium and water. More recently an improved ORS formulation has been developed which is safe and effective as the original in preventing and treating diarrhoeal dehydration. It is focussed on reducing the osmolarity of ORS solution to avoid adverse effects of hypeonicity on net fluid absorption by reducing the concentration of glucose and sodium chloride in the solution. Decreasing the sodium concentration of ORS solution to 75 mOsm/l improved the efficacy of ORS regimen for children with acute non cholera diarrhoea.

Strangulation by keeping neck between angle of elbow ?,Burking,Smothering,Mugging,Gagging,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Mugging Strangulation is the form of asphyxia caused by constriction of neck by ligature or some other method, but without suspension of the body. So the force constricting the neck is external force (not the weight of the body as occurs in hanging). Depending upon the method used to constrict the neck, strangulation can be divided into : Ligature strangulation : Neck is compressed by a ligature of which usually multiple rounds are given and no knot is tied. Throttling (manual strangulation) : Neck is compressed by one or both hands. When neck is compressed by two palms, it is known as palmar strangulation. Bansdola : Compression of neck with one or two wooden sticks or bamboo. Garrotting : It is compression of neck by a rope thrown from behind. Spanish windlass is a type of garrotting, which used to be the official mode of execution in spain. In this, an iron collor around the neck was tightened by a screw for strangulation. Mugging (choke hold) : It is compression of neck by forearm or in the bend of elbow. Strangulation by knee/foot : In this, neck is compressed by knee or foot.",C

Assays of which of the following i bomarkers is most commonly used in the diagnosis of Hea failure:,Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP),Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP),Endothelin- 1 (ET-1),Adrenomedullin,"Answer is a (BNP) BNP is the most commonly used biomarker used in the diagnosis of Hea failure. Levels of Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), Endothelin -I (ET-1), Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) and Adrenomedullin are all increased in Hea Failure. BNP has scored over others in prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic values and has also a found place in the guidelines for the diagnosis of congestive hea failure. Assays of BNP are commercially available and used clinically for screening and diagnosis of hea failure, to predict severity of condition and estimate prognosis. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a neuro-hormone released from ventricular myocytes in response to myocytes stress. It is released as a pro-hormone and cleaved into N-terminal (NT) pro-BNP and BNP. It causes vasodilation, diuresis, and natriuresis and decreases activity of Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) and Renin-angiotensinAldosterone System (RAAS). Both BNP and NT-pro-BNP have prognostic value in hea failure. Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better. Out of BNP and NT-pro -BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in hea failure. BNP /NT-pro-BNP Assays: It helps in screening patients at risk of development of hea failure (Diabetics and asymptomatic coronary aery disease) It helps in deciding whether hea failure is the cause of dyspnoea in the emergency depament (A very low BNP or NT-pro-BNP helps exclude a cardiac cause of dyspnoea) It has prognostic value in hea failure (Those with higher values on admission do worse and those whose values decrease after treatment fare better) Out of BNP and NT-pro-BNP, NT-pro-BNP is superior to BNP in predicting hospitalisation and death in hea failure. Note: At present serial measurement of BNP are not recommended as a guide for Hea Failure Therapy",A

The measurement of aerial diastolic pressure with a sphygmomanometer may be complicated by the fact that systolic sounds are frequently heard with the cuff completely deflated. As the disease progresses and the LV end-diastolic pressure rises, the aerial diastolic pressure may actually rise as well, because the aoic diastolic pressure cannot fall below the LV end-diastolic pressure. For the same reason, acute severe AR may also be accompanied by only a slight widening of the pulse pressure.

Which of the following responsible for fasting hypoglycemia ?,Increased insulin level,Decreased insulin level,increased Glycogen,Increased Glucagon in liver,"Fasting hypoglycemia In otherwise healthy people, prolonged fasting (even up to several days) and prolonged strenuous exercise (even after a period of fasting) are unlikely to cause hypoglycemia. However, there are several diseases or conditions in which the body fails to maintain adequate levels of glucose in the blood after a period without food (fasting hypoglycemia). In people who drink heavily without eating, alcohol can block the formation of glucose in the liver. In people with advanced liver disease, such as viral hepatitits , cirrhosis, or cancer, the liver may not be able to store and produce sufficient glucose. Infants and children who have an abnormality of the enzyme systems that control glucose use (such as a glycogen storage disorder) also may have fasting hypoglycemia. A rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia is an insulinoma, which is an insulin-producing tumor in the pancreas.

A 50 year old patient with signs of peripheral neuropathy is found to have diabetes mellitus. He has no ocular symptoms. When would you refer this patient for retina evaluation?,When he develops ocular symptoms,Immediately after diagnosis,When he needs insulin for blood sugar,Five years after diagnosis,"Since the age of the patient is 50 years, it is highly likely that the patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is insidious in onset. Thus, even though patient has no ocular complaints, the fundus examination for retina evaluation should be done immediately. The significance of this problem is highlighted by the finding that individuals with DM are 25 times more likely to become legally blind than individuals without DM. Blindness is primarily the result of progressive diabetic retinopathy and clinically significant macular edema. For Type 1 diabetes mellitus, a complete eye checkup is recommended three to five years after the disease onset. Annual examination of the fundus is recommended in both type of diabetes.",B

Which of the following pulmonary symptoms dont have the corresponding not pulmonary association?,Cyanosis.Anxiety,Wheezing-CHF,Tachypnoea-Acidosis,Chest pain-pericarditis,"Cyanosis is the bluish or purplish discolouration of the skin or mucous membranes due to the tissues near the skin surface having low oxygen saturation. Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke&;s work,it is classically described as occurring if 5.0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin or greater is present. This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of aerial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on aerial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0 g/dL of deoxyhemoglobin may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of deoxyhemoglobin, the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis Approach to diagnosis: Inquire about duration (cyanosis since bih suggests congenital hea disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins). Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis. Check for nail clubbing: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital hea disease and occasionally pulmonary disease. If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.

A ventrolateral cordotomy is performed to produce relief of pain from the right leg. It is effective because it interrupts the:,Left Dorsal Column,Left Lateral Spinothalamic tract,Right Lateral Spinothalamic tract,Right Coicospinal tract,"Answer is B (Left Lateral Spinothalamic tract): `Neurosurgical Operations on the Spinal Cord' Pain sensations from the right leg are carried the contralateral Lateral Spinothalamic tract. Ventrolateral cordotomy (surgical procedure of ablating selected pain conducting tracts) of the Left Spinothalamic Tract should effectively relieve pain from the right lower extremity. Ventrolateral Cordotomy Ventrolateral cordotomy is a surgical procedures in which the spinal anterolateral ascending system, for transmission of nociception (pain) known as the spinothalamic tract is interrupted for the relief of severe, intractible pain (cancer pain) not responding to any other conventional measures of pain control. Ventrolateral cordotomy can be performed by both, percutaneous and open surgical techniques. Ventrolateral cordotomy has been shown to be most effective in the treatment of intermittent shooting pain and evoked pain such as allodynia and hyperpathia, which is essentially mediated by the Lateral Spinothalamic Tract. The optimal candidate for such a procedure is a patient with unilateral severe pain (usually with malignant cancer) not adequately treated with less invasive measures. Fibres carrying sensation of 'pain' decussate (cross obliquely) to the opposite side within the spinal cord (over one to five segments) and ascend in the contralateral white column as the Lateral spinothalamic Tract. The Left spinothalamic tract carries sensation of pain from the Right side of the body. Cordotomy (ventrolateral) therefore aims to interrupt the lateral spinothalamic tract ascending contralaterallv to the painful side. Fibres carrying sensation of pain' decussate (cross obliquely) to the opposite side within the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral white column as the Lateral Spinothalamic Tract.",B

The Prevalence of the following with its degree may correlate with Disease activity in SLE,Autoimmune Hemolytic anemia,Lymphopenia,Neutropenia,Thrombocytopenia,"(B) Lymphopenia # Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) It is characterized by elevated reticulocyte counts, low haptoglobin levels, increased indirect bilirubin concentration and a positive direct Coombs' test. It has been noted in up to 10% of patients with SLE. Presence of hemolytic anemia may associate with manifestations of severe disease such as renal disease, seizures and serositis. Presence of both immunoglobulin and complements on red blood cells is usually associated with some degree of hemolysis, while presence of complements alone (C3 and /or C4) is often not associated with hemolysis AIHA responds to steroids (1 mg/kg per day prednisone or its equivalent in divided doses) in 75 to 96% of patients. Once the hematocrit begins to rise and the reticulocyte count falls, steroids can be rapidly tapered.SLICC CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUSRequirements: > criteria (at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory criteria.

Prevalence of lymphopenia in SLE ranges from 20 to 81% and its degree may correlate with disease activity. Both T and B lymphocytes are reduced, while natural killer cells are typically increased. Reduced surface expression of complement regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 has been found in leucopenic patients with SLE. Deficiency of these proteins may make these cells susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. There is increasing evidence that endogenous production of type 1 interferons (IFNs) is implicated in the pathogenesis of neutropenia and lymphopenia in SLE. Elevated serum levels of IFN-a in SLE correlate inversely with leucocyte numbers# Neutropenia It is a common feature of SLE, with a prevalence rate of 47%, it may be mediated by anti-neutrophil antibodies. Increased levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in SLE and may contribute to Neutropenia (through excessive neutrophil apoptosis mediated neutropenia).# Thrombocytopenia It has a reported prevalence ranging from 7 to 30% in large series of patients with SLE. Increased peripheral destruction of platelets and presence of anti-platelet antibodies, is the most likely pathogenic mechanism. Thrombocytopenia is an independent risk factor for increased mortality in SLE.",B
Hypercalciuria is seen in -,Hyperparathyroidism,VitD intoxication,Sarcoidosis,All,"<p>Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH. The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorptionHypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intakeIn patients with sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis and fungal infections, excess 1,25(OH) 2 D is synthesized in macrophages or other cells in the granulomas.Indeed, increased 1,25(OH) 2 D levels have been repoed in anephric patients with sarcoidosis and hypercalcemia. Macrophages obtained from granulomatous tissue conve 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D at an increased rate. There is a positive correlation in patients with sarcoidosis between 25(OH)D levels (reflecting vitamin D intake) and the circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH) 2 D, whereas normally there is no increase in 1,25(OH) 2 D with increasing 25(OH) D levels due to multiple feedback controls on renal 1a-hydroxylase(harrison 18 pg 3108)</p>",D

"A patient has dyspnea, syncope and angina. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic stenosis,Aortic regurgitation,Atrial septal defect,Ventricular septal defect,"Ans. a. Aortic stenosis (Ref: Harrison 19/e p1529. 18/e p 1939)Patients of aortic stenosis have dyspnea, syncope and angina.'Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exertional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual curtailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability.: Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in non-exercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

Which of the following is true regarding thyrotoxicosis?,"In Grave’s disease, antibodies are formed to TSH receptors, which result in excessive thyroxine secretion",Hashimoto's thyroiditis occur in young males,"In primary hypothyroidism, decreased TSH levels are seen",All of the above,"Pathophysiology of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis
The thyrotoxicosis results from the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies directed against the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular cell, which stimulate thyroid hormone production and proliferation of follicular cells, leading to goitre in the majority of patients. These antibodies are termed thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins or TSH receptor antibodies (TRAb) and can be detected in the serum of 80–95% of patients with Graves’ disease. 
The concentration of TRAb in the serum is presumed to ﬂuctuate to account for the natural history of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid failure seen in some patients may result from the presence of blocking antibodies against the TSH receptor, and from tissue destruction by cytotoxic antibodies and cell-mediated immunity.
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is characterised by destructive lymphoid inﬁltration of the thyroid, ultimately leading to a varying degree of ﬁbrosis and thyroid enlargement. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis increases in incidence with age and affects approximately 3.5 per 1000 women and 0.8 per 1000 men each year.
In the vast majority of cases, hypothyroidism results from an intrinsic disorder of the thyroid gland (primary hypothyroidism). In this situation, serum T 4  is low and TSH is elevated, usually in excess of 20 mIU/L. Measurements of serum T 3  are unhelpful since they do not discriminate reliably between euthyroidism and hypothyroidism.

The drug used in both Hepatitis B & HIV,Telbivudine,Tenofovir,Entecavir,Ribavarin,"Tenofovir belongs to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NIs) class of anti-HIV drug.The HBV genome is a paially double-strand DNA genome that is repaired in infected cells to a fully double-strand circular DNA by the virion polymerase. ViralmRNAs are transcribed from the closed circular viral episome by the cellular RNA polymerase II and are translated to yield HBV proteins. In addition, a full-genome-length mRNA is packaged into viral core paicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells as an intermediate for viral DNA replication.This RNA associates with the viral polymerase, which also has reverse transcriptase activity and conves the full-length encapsidated RNA genome into paially double-strand DNA. Thus, nucleos(t)ide analogs that inhibit reverse transcription (e.g., tenofovir) are commonly used to treat HBV infection. Harrison 19e pg: 214e-5",B

A patient of left hemiplegia with previous history of right deep vein thrombosis. Cause hemoptysis in this patient is?,Pulmonary thromboembolism,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Fat Embolism,Superior Vena Cava Syndrome,"ANSWER: (A) Pulmonary thromboembolismREF: Harrisons Internal Medicine 17th edition Chapter 256. Deep Venous Thrombosis andPulmonary ThromboembolismPULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM:PathophysiologyWhen venous thrombi dislodge from their site of formation, they embolize to the pulmonary arterial circulation or, paradoxically, to the arterial circulation through a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect. About half of patients with pelvic vein thrombosis or proximal leg DVT develop PE, which is usually asymptomatic.With increased use of chronic indwelling central venous catheters for hyperalimentation and chemotherapy, as well as more frequent insertion of permanent pacemakers and internal cardiac defibrillators, upper extremity venous thrombosis is becoming a more common problem. These thrombi rarely embolize and cause PE.Pathophysiological abnormalities include:The most common gas exchange abnormalities are hypoxemia (decreased arterial P02) and an increased alveolar-arterial 02 tension gradient, which represents the inefficiency of 02 transfer across the lungsIncreased pulmonary vascular resistance due to vascular obstruction or platelet secretion of vasoconstricting neurohumoral agents such as serotonin.Impaired gas exchange due to increased alveolar dead space from vascular obstruction, hypoxemia from alveolar hypoventilation relative to perfusion in the nonobstructed lung, right-to-left shunting, and impaired carbon monoxide transfer due to loss of gas exchange surface.Alveolar hyperventilation due to reflex stimulation of irritant receptorsIncreased airway resistance due to constriction of airways distal to the bronchiDecreased pulmonary compliance due to lung edema, lung hemorrhage, or loss of surfactantSigns & SymptomsSudden-onset dyspnea (shortness of breath)Tachypnea (rapid breathing)Chest pain of a ""pleuritic"" nature (worsened by breathing)Cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood).More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability due to decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart.Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct)A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is transudativeA low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarctionAbout 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PERisk factorsThe most common sources of embolism are proximal leg deep venous thrombosis (DVTs) or pelvic vein thromboses.The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchows triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.Alterations in blood flow: immobilization (after surgery, injury or long-distance air travel),pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant)Factors in the vessel wall: of limited direct relevance in VTEFactors affecting the properties of the blood (procoagulant state)Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptionGenetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders)Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)DiagnosisD-dimer is highly sensitive but not very specific (specificity around 50%), In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PEThe gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) is pulmonary angiographyCT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are clinical equivalence, its non-invasive nature, its greater availability to patientsVentilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung scintigraphy), which shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is used less often because of the more widespread availability of CT technology, however, it may be useful in patients who have an allergy to iodinated contrast or in pregnancy due to lower radiation exposure than CT",A

"All of the following are true about break point chlorination, except –",Free chlorine is released in water after break point chlorination,"Chlorine demand is the amount needed to kill bacteria, oxidize organic matter and neutralize ammonia",1 ppm free chlorine should be present in water after break point has reached,Contact period of 1 hour is necessary,"Principles of chlorination                                                                               

Water should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.
The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water.
The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If further chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water.
The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria and virus.
The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5mg/i for one hour. This free residual chlorine provides margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination.
The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of .5 mg/L constitutes the correct does of chlorine to be applied.
It is worth noting here that recommended residual chlorine level for drinking water is 0.5 mg/ litre, while for swimming pool sanitation it is 1.0 mg/ litre and for water bodies & post disaster it is 0.7 mg/litre",C

All of the following are approaches to health education except :,Service approach,Regulatory approach,Health education approach,Mass media,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Mass media According to Alma-Ata declaration (1978), ""Health education is a process aimed at encouraging people to want to be healthy to know how to stay healthy to do what they can individually and collectively to maintain health and seek help when needed"".Health education is the act of getting people to do something for themselves to attain better health.Health education involves teaching about reducing health risk factors, increasing a person's level of wellness and taking specific protective health measures.There are 4 well-known approaches to health education:Regulatory approach (Managed prevention)There are occasions when people are indifferent to their own health thus endangering the health of the community, in which case the regulatory or legal approach seeks to protect the health of the public through the enforcement of laws and regulations.The regulatory approach involves governmental intervention designed to alter human behaviour through regulations ranging from prohibition to imprisonment. This approach seeks change in health behaviour and improvement in health through a variety of external controls or legislations. E.g. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, compulsory seat beltsService approachThe service approach involves providing necessary health services needed by the people as and when required through the spirit of volunteerism or social obligation.This is mainly the responsibility of the health department and health workers both in government and nongovernment health agencies.The service or administrative approach aims at providing all the health facilities needed by the community so that the people will make use of them in order to improve their own health.The service approach will be a failure when it is not based on the ""felt needs"" of the people.Health education approachThe health education approach involves changing the behavioral patterns of the people through planned learning experiences without conflicting with the masses. It involves proper communication and motivation of the community to make the right decision in order to attain health.Though it is a good method, it is a slow perseverance to have permanent and enduring results. E.g. cessation of smoking, use of safe water supply, fertility control.Primary health care approachThe primary health care approach involves enabling individuals to become self-reliant in matters of health.This is a radically new approach starting from the people with their full participation and active involvement in the planning and delivery of health services based on principals of primary health care, viz community involvement and intersectoral coordination.The underlying objective is to help individuals become self-reliant in matters of health.Mass media is a method of health communication.

False regarding Health For All by 2000 A.D. is –,All people will be healthy by 2000 A.D.,All people are accessible to health care services,All will have socially and economically productive life,Equal health status for people and countries,"Health for All 

Health for all' is defined as ""attainment of a level of health that will enable every individual to lead a socially and economically productive life"".
The fundamental principle of HFA strategy is equity, that is, an equal, health status for people and countries, ensured by an equitable distribution of health resources.
The best approach to achieve the goal for HFA is by providing primary health care.
At least essential health care should be accessible to all individuals in an acceptable and affordable way.

Teeth bite marks are a type of: March 2011,Contusion,Pressure abrasion,Graze,Linear abrasion,"Ans. B: Pressure Abrasion Teeth marks in biting and ligature marks in hanging and strangulation are example of imprint, pressure or contact abrasion Abrasion It as also known as - Graze or Scratch or Impression. An abrasion is a superficial injury to the skin which involves the loss of superficial epithelial layer (Uppermost layers of the cells of skin) of skin. Abrasions are produced by ? - Blow - Fall on some rough and hard substance - Dragging as in vehicular accidents. - Scratching with finger nails, bites and thorns etc. - Friction on some hard substance. Pressure of rope or cord as is found in strangulation and hanging etc. - Rubbing. - Indenting of the objects. Varieties of Abrasions Scratches- They are due to a sharp or a pointed object pressing across the skin, moving the surface layers in front of it and causing the heaping up of layers of skin. Grazes- They are modified scratches. - In this, the broader surface of skin comes in contact with the uneven rough object. - In this, the depth may vary at different places. - The direction is indicated by presence of clean commencement and tag at the finishing end. Impact Abrasions/Pressure Abrasions - They are also known as ""Imprint abrasions"". - They are caused by the stamping of some object against the skin like radiators of cars in vehicular accidents or - They may be caused by pressure on the skin which is accompanied by movements as found in? Ligature in cases of hanging or strangulation. Injuries caused by lashes with whip Sites of Abrasions ? The abrasions resulting from friction against rough surface during a fall are generally found on the bony pas and are accompanied with contusions or lacerations The abrasions caused by finger nails are seen on the exposed of body like - Face near forearm, hands, thighs etc. They are cresentric in shape, when finger nails are used. Ecchymosis is a common accompaniment. The abrasions caused by teeth bite are elliptical or circular in shape and often present separate marks. Typical impression of teeth by different sets of teeth (Deciduous or permanent) is marked. The intervening area is only a bruised area. The abrasions from radiators are honey-comb in appearance and are .commonly found in vehicular accidents Difference between Antemoem and Postmoem Bruise Antemoem abrasions will show signs of inflammation and repair whereas these will be absent in postmoem abrasions.",B

Which among the following is the most effective form of Chlorine for water disinfection?,Hypochlorite ion,Hydrogen chloride,Hypochlorous acid,Chloride ion,"(C) Hypochlorous acid[?]Chlorination:oChlorination is one of the greatest advances in water purification. It is supplement, not a substitute to sand filtration.oAction of chlorine: When chlorine is added to water, there is formation of Hydrochloric & Hypochlorous acids.oHydrochloric acid is neutralized by the alkalinity of the water.oDisinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to the hypochlorous acid, & to a small extent due to the hypochlorite ions.oIt is more effective (70-80 times) than the hypochlorite ion.oChlorine acts best as a disinfectant when the pH of water is around 7 because of the predominance of hypochlorous acid.oWhen the pH value exceeds 8.5 it is unreliable as a disinfectant because about 90 per cent of the hypochlorous acid gets ionized to hypochlorite ions.oPrinciples of chlorination: Mere addition of chlorine to water is not chlorination.oRules to ensure proper chlorination:-First of all, the water to be chlorinated should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination-Secondly, ""chlorine demand"" of the water should be estimated.-Thirdly the contact period.-Presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria & viruses-Chlorine has no effect on spores, protozoal cysts and helminthic ova, except in higher doses.-The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5mg/L for one hour.-Free residual chlorine provides a margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination such as may occur during storage and distribution.-Sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of 0.5mg/L constitutes the correct dose of chlorine to be applied.[?]Break Point Chlorination-Addition of chlorine to ammonia In water produces chloramines which do not have the same efficiency as free chlorine.-If chlorine dose in the water is increased, a reduction in the residual chlorine occurs, due to the destruction of chloramine by the added chlorine.-End products do not represent any residual chlorine.-Fall in residual chlorine will continue with further increase in chlorine dose and after a stage, the residual chlorine begins to increase in proportion to the added dose of chlorine.-This point at which the residual chlorine appears and when all combined chlorines have been completely destroyed is the breakpoint and corresponding dosage is the breakpoint dosage.-Breakpoint chlorination achieves the same results as superchlorination in a rational manner and can therefore be construed as controlled superchlorination.[?]Super ChlorineoSuperchlorination followed by dechlorination comprises the addition of large doses of chlorine to the water, & removal of excess of chlorine after disinfection, this method is applicable to heavily polluted waters whose quality fluctuates greatly.[?]Ortho Tolidine (OT) Test-Enables both free & combined chlorine in water to be determined with speed and accuracy.-Reagent consists Orthotolidine, dissolved in 10% solution of hydrochloric acid.-Reagent is added to water containing chlorine, it turns yellow & intensity of the colour varies with the concentration of the gas.-Yellow colour is produced by both free & combined chlorine residuals.-OT reacts with free chlorine instantaneously but reacts more slowly with combined chlorine.-Test is carried out by adding 0.1 ml of the reagent to 1 ml of water.-Yellow colour produced is matched against suitable standards or colour discs.-It is essential to take the reading within 10 seconds after addition of reagent to estimate free chlorine in water-Colour that is produced after a lapse, say 15-20 minutes, is due to the action of both free and combined chlorine.[?]Ortho Tolidine-Arsenite (OTA) Test-Modification of the OT test to determine free & combined chlorine residuals separately.-Errors caused by the presence of interfering substances such as nitrites, iron & manganese all of which produce a yellow colour with Orthotolidine, are overcome by the OTA test.",C

Severe hypothermia characterized by all the following EXCEPT-,J waves in ECG,Tachycardia,Hypotension,Dysrhythmias,"Hypothermia is defined as a body core temperature below 35.0 degC (95.0 degF) in humans.Symptoms depend on the temperature.In mild hypothermia there is shivering and mental confusion In moderate hypothermia shivering stops and confusion increasesIn severe hypothermia, there may be paradoxical undressing, in which a person removes their clothing, as well as an increased risk of the hea stopping Hypothermia has two main types of causes. It classically occurs from exposure to extreme cold. It may also occur from any condition that decreases heat production or increases heat loss. Commonly this includes alcohol intoxication but may also include low blood sugar, anorexia, and advanced age.Body temperature is usually maintained near a constant level of 36.5-37.5 degC (97.7-99.5 degF) through thermoregulation. Effos to increase body temperature involve shivering, increased voluntary activity, and putting on warmer clothing. Hypothermia may be diagnosed based on either a person's symptoms in the presence of risk factors or by measuring a person's core temperature. The treatment of mild hypothermia involves warm drinks, warm clothing, and physical activity. In those with moderate hypothermia, heating blankets and warmed intravenous fluids are recommended. People with moderate or severe hypothermia should be moved gently. In severe hypothermia, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass may be useful. In those without a pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated along with the above measures. Rewarming is typically continued until a person's temperature is greater than 32 degC (90 degF). If there is no improvement at this point or the blood potassium level is greater than 12 mmol/liter at any time, resuscitation may be discontinued As the temperature decreases, fuher physiological systems falter and hea rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure all decrease. This results in an expected hea rate in the 30s at a temperature of 28 degC (82 degF). There is often no shivering, cold, inflamed skin, hallucinations, lack of reflexes, fixed dilated pupils, low blood pressure, and pulmonary edema. Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly, but fast hea rates (ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation) can also occur. Atrial fibrillation is not typically a concern in and of itself Ref Davidson 23rd edtion pg 1218",B
The most common viral cause of Acute liver failure worldwide is:,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,Hepatitis E,"Answer is B (Hepatitis B) Hepatitis B remains the most common viral agent responsible for Acute Liver Failure Worldwide Fulminant Viral Hepatitis leading to acute liver failure is typically seen with Hepatitis B infection (Increased by co-infection or super-infection with Hepatitis D) and Hepatitis E infection. The most common hepatitis virus responsible for fulminant disease and acute liver failure varies from one geographic region to the other. Hepatitis B is the most common cause of Acute Liver Failure in USA, Europe and Japan and accounts fbr a significant percentage of cases in the rest of the world thereby being the single most impoant virus implicated in Acute Liver Failure (Liver failure occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients with Acute Hepatitis B). Note: Hepatitis E is the most common cause of Acute Liver Failure in India 'In India, over 95% of acute liver failure is due to viruses, with 40% secondary to hepatitis E and 25-30% to hepatitis B.

A study revealed lesser incidence of carcinoma colon in pure vegetarians than non-vegetarians by which it was concluded that b-carotene is protective against cancer. This may not be true because the vegetarian subjects may be consuming high fibre diet which is protective against cancer. This is an example of:,Multifactorial causation,Causal association,Confounding factor,Common association,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Confounding factor In an epidemiological study, in addition to the exposures that the study is investigating, there may be other factors that is associated with the exposure and independently affects the risk of developing disease. If the prevalence of these other factors differ between groups being compared, they will distort the observed association between the disease and exposure under study. These distorting factors are called confounding factors or variables. In the study given, protective factor is being studied. But as high fibre content of vegetarian food is protective against CA colon, it can confound or distort the observed protective role of b-carotene present in vegetarian food. Thus this is an example of confounding factor. Causal association: There are 2 types- 1. One to one causal relationship - Two variables are causally related if a change in one variable is followed by a change in the other. So when the disease is present, the factor must also be present. In the given study causative factor is not being studied rather preventive factor is being studied.Multifactorial causation - There can be multiple factors acting independently or cumulatively to produce a disease (non-communicable). As stated above causal factors are not being observed in this study so both causal association and multifactorial causation are ruled out.Common association is not an epidemiological term, it is just a casual term.",C

"In which of the following chronic Conditions, degenerative changes in the brain are Seen which are not a pa of normal ageing?",Dementia,Pseudodementia,Amnestic synrome,Delirium,"Amnesia is a deficit in memory caused by brain damage or disease, but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs. The memory can be either wholly or paially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a paicular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the sho-term store into the long-term store. People with this type of amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously People with amnesia can learn new information, paicularly non-declarative knowledge. However, some people with dense anterograde amnesia do not remember the episodes during which they previously learned or observed the information. Declarative information Some patients with anterograde amnesia can still acquire some semantic information, even though it might be more difficult and might remain rather unrelated to more general knowledge. H.M. could accurately draw a floor plan of the home in which he lived after surgery, even though he had not lived there in years. The reason patients could not form new episodic memories is likely because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was a lesion, and thus the hippocampus could not make connections to the coex. After an ischemic episode following surgery, an MRI of patient R.B. showed his hippocampus to be intact except for a specific lesion restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells. Non-declarative information Some retrograde and anterograde amnesics are capable of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor coex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated with the formation of declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2134",C

IgM Anti- HbcAg Non- reactive IgG Anti- HbcAg Reactive HbsAg Non-Reactive HBeAg Non-Reactive Anti-HCV Reactive,HBV DNA,Anti- HbsAg,HCV-RNA-PCR,Liver biopsy,"The serological status of this patient shows HCV infection since anti-HCV antibody is reactive. Hepatitis B surface antigen is negative and IgG Anti- HBcAg is reactive indicating remote infection with hepatitis B. Recovery is the rule in hepatitis B. In contrast hepatitis C results in development of cirrhosis. Even if transaminases are normal, hepatitis C results in long term damage to the liver. Hence the reason for elevated liver enzymes with development of liver fibrosis points to HCV being the culprit. The next step shall be to perform a PCR-HCV RNA and initiate treatment based on prevalent genotype in the area. Liver biopsy is ruled out as question says patient is already having fibrosis",C
Treatment of methemoglobinemia is done with -,Methylene blue,Hydroxyurea,Fava beans,Exchange tranfiision,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Methylene blue Methemoglobinemias* Methemoglobin is generated by oxidation of the heme iron moieties to the ferric state, causing a characteristic bluish-brown muddy color resembling cyanosis.* Methemoglobin has such high oxygen affinity that virtually no oxygen is delivered. Levels >50-60% are often fatal.* Congenital methemoglobinemia arises from globin mutations that stabilize iron in the ferric state or from mutations that impair the enzymes that reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin (e.g., methemoglobin reductase, NADP diaphorase).*Acquired methemoglobinemia is caused by toxins that oxidize heme iron, notably nitrate and nitrite-containing compounds, including drugs commonly used in cardiology and anesthesiology.* Methemoglobin should be suspected in patients with hypoxic symptoms who appear cyanotic but have a PaO2 sufficiently high that hemoglobin should be fully saturated with oxygen.* A history of nitrite or other oxidant ingestions may not always be available; some exposures may be inapparent to the patient, and others may result from suicide attempts.* The characteristic muddy appearance of freshly drawn blood can be a critical clue. The best diagnostic test is methemoglobin assay, which is usually available on an emergency basis.* Methemoglobinemia often causes symptoms of cerebral ischemia at levels >15%; levels >60% are usually lethal.* Intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of methylene blue is effective emergency therapy.* Milder cases and follow-up of severe cases can be treated orally with methylene blue (60 mg three to four times each day) or ascorbic acid (300-600 mg/d).",A

Carcinoma pancrease attains largest size when it is sited in -,Head,Ampulla,Body & tail,Periampullary,"Some 90% of pancreatic neoplasms are adenocarcinomas that arise from the pancreatic ducts. These tumours involve local structures and metastasise to regional lymph nodes at an early stage. Most patients have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Neuro-endocrine tumours also arise in the pancreas but tend to grow more slowly and have a better prognosis; these are discussed in detail on page 678. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma affects 10-15 per 100 000 in Western populations, rising to 100 per 100 000 in those over the age of 70. Men are affected twice as often as women. The disease is associated with increasing age, smoking and chronic pancreatitis. Between 5% and 10% of patients have a genetic predisposition: hereditary pancreatitis, HNPCC and familial atypical mole multiple melanoma syndrome (FAMMM). Overall survival is only 3-5%, with a median survival of 6-10 months for those with locally advanced disease and 3-5 months if metastases are present. Clinical features Many patients are asymptomatic until an advanced stage, when they present with central abdominal pain, weight loss and obstructive jaundice . The pain results from invasion of the coeliac plexus and is characteristically incessant and gnawing. It often radiates from the upper abdomen through to the back and may be eased a little by bending forwards. Almost all patients lose weight and many are cachectic. Around 60% of tumours arise from the head of the pancreas, and involvement of the common bile duct results in the development of obstructive jaundice, often with severe pruritus. A few patients present with diarrhoea, vomiting from duodenal obstruction, diabetes mellitus, recurrent venous thrombosis, acute pancreatitis or depression.Physical examination reveals clear evidence of weight loss. An abdominal mass due to the tumour itself, a palpable gallbladder or hepatic metastasis is commonly found. A palpable gallbladder in a jaundiced patient is usually the consequence of distal biliary obstruction by a pancreatic cancer (Courvoisier's sign). Ref Davidson edition23rd pg842",C

The severity of mitral regurgitation is decided by all of the following clinical findings except -,Presence of mid- diastolic murmur across mitral Valve,Wide split second hea sound.,Presence ofloft ventricular S3 gallop,Intensity of systolic murmur across mitral valve,"Mitral regurgitation (MR), mitral insufficiency, or mitral incompetence, is a form of valvular hea disease in which the mitral valve does not close properly when the hea pumps out blood. It is the abnormal leaking of blood backwards from the left ventricle, through the mitral valve, into the left atrium, when the left ventricle contracts, i.e. there is regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium.MR is the most common form of valvular hea disease.severity is determined by intensity of systolic murmer across mitral valve The degree of severity of MR can be quantified by the regurgitant fraction, which is the percentage of the left ventricular stroke volume that regurgitates into the left atrium. regurgitant fraction = {\displaystyle {\frac {V_{mitral}-V_{aoic}}{V_{mitral}}}\times 100\%} \frac{V_{mitral} - V_{aoic}} {V_{mitral}} \times 100\% where Vmitral and Vaoic are, respectively, the volumes of blood that flow forward through the mitral valve and aoic valve during a cardiac cycle. Methods that have been used to assess the regurgitant fraction in mitral regurgitation include echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, fast CT scan, and cardiac MRI. The echocardiographic technique to measure the regurgitant fraction is to determine the forward flow through the mitral valve (from the left atrium to the left ventricle) during ventricular diastole, and comparing it with the flow out of the left ventricle through the aoic valve in ventricular systole. This method assumes that the aoic valve does not suffer from aoic insufficiency. Another way to quantify the degree of MR is to determine the area of the regurgitant flow at the level of the valve. This is known as the regurgitant orifice area, and correlates with the size of the defect in the mitral valve. One paicular echocardiographic technique used to measure the orifice area is measurement of the proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA). The flaw of using PISA to determine the mitral valve regurgitant orifice area is that it measures the flow at one moment in time in the cardiac cycle, which may not reflect the average performance of the regurgitant jet.

Pathognomic lesion in HIV is: September 2011,Gingivitis,Oral leukoplakia,Herpes simplex,Aphthous ulcers,"Ans. B : Oral leukoplakia Oral hairy leukoplakia is viually pathognomic of HIV disease in the context of HIV risk factors. AIDS and HIV Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load, the level of HIV in the blood. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count and viral load. The stages of HIV infection are acute infection (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various oppounistic infections, cancers and other conditions. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level of 200 cells per uL, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of oppounistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis), prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common oppounistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then sta to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibility to oral candidiasis (thrush) and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma. Pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with cytomegalovirus (another herpes virus) or Mycobacterium avium complex is more prominent.",B

In Children*. Reproductive effects*. Growth retardation*. Hypertension?*. Behavioural problems* Anemia[?]Chronic Lead Poisoning or Plumbism or Saturnism:oChronic lead poisoning results from a daily intake of one to two mg. of lead; Lead vapour is more dangerous than dust & it is a typical cumulative poison.[?]Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Lead Poisoning:oFacial Pallor: mouth is one of the earliest and most consistent sign due to vasospasm.oAnaemia: There may be polycythaemia with polychromatophilia in early stages, but later there is anaemia which is associated with polychromasia, punctate basophilia, reticulocytosis, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, nucleated red cells (sideroblasts) and an increase in mononuclear cells, whereas polymorphonuclear cells and platelets are decreased.-Anaemia is probably due to decreased survival time of red blood cells and inhibition of haeme synthesis by interference with the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin.-Punctate basophilia or basophilic stippling means the presence of many dark blue-coloured pinhead sized spots in the cytoplasm of red blood cells, due to toxic action of lead on porphyrin metabolism.-Reticulocytes and basophilic stippled cells result from the inhibition of 5 pyrimidine nucleotidase, an impaired ability to rid the cell of RNA degradation products and the aggregation of ribosome.-Eosinophilia is more common than basophilic stippling. Porphyrins excreted in urine may be 500 micrograms per day.oLead Line: A stippled blue line, called Burtonian line, is seen on the gums in 50 to 70% of cases. It appears due to subepithelial deposit of granules at the junction with teeth, only near dirty or carious teeth, within a week of exposure, especially on upper jaw. It is due to formation of lead sulphide by the action of hydrogen sulphide formed by decomposed food in the mouth.-A similar blue line may be seen in cases of poisoning by mercury, copper, bismuth, iron and silver.oColic and Constipation: It is usually later symptom. Colic of intestines, ureters, uterus and blood vessels occur in 85% of cases. The colic occurs at night and the pain may be very severe.-Individual attacks last only a few minutes, but may recur for several days or weeks. Constipation is usual but diarrhoea or vomiting may occur.oLead Palsy: It usually occurs late, and is seen in less than 10% of cases.-There may be tremors, numbness, hyperaesthesia, and cramps before the actual muscle weakness. It is commoner in adults than in children, and men are particularly affected.-Muscle groups affected are those most prone to fatigue. Usually the extensor muscles of the wrist (wrist drop; radial nerve is affected), are affected, but the deltoid, biceps, anterior tibial (foot drop), and rarely muscles of eye or intrinsic muscles of hand or foot are affected.-Paralysis is associated with degeneration of the nerve and atrophy of the muscles.-Recovery may be complete but is usually slow.oEncephalopathy: Lead encephalopathy, in some form is said to be present in almost every case of plumbism. It is common in children often associated with tetraethyl lead.-Symptoms are vomiting, headache, insomnia, visual disturbances, irritability, restlessness, delirium, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death. Lead encephalopathy is usually irreversible and about 85% have permanent brain damage.-Death occurs in about 25% cases.oCardiovascular System and Kidneys: Lead causes vascular constriction, leading to hypertension and permanent arteriolar degeneration. Chronic arteriosclerotic nephritis and interstitial nephritis occur.oReproductive System: Menstrual derangements, such as amenorrhoea, dysmenonhoea, I menorrhagia, sterility of both sexes, and abortion are, frequent. Abortion occurs in pregnant women between 3 to 6 months.oOther Systems: They are dyspepsia, anorexia, emaciation, general weakness, exhaustion, irritability, foul breath, headache, vertigo, loss of hair and drowsiness. Peripheral neuritis is rare. Retinal stippling is noticed by ophthalmoscopic examination showing presence of greyish glistening lead particles in the early phase of poisoning.",B

Decreased activity of type I 5'-monodeiodinase could lead to which physiologic effects,Increased plasma triiodothyronine (T3),Increased plasma reverse T3,Decreased plasma thyroxine T4,Increased TSH,"Type I 5'-monodeiodinase is the enzyme responsible for the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), primarily in liver and kidney. This enzyme also paicipates in the breakdown of reverse T3 (rT3) by conveing it to 3,3'-diiodothyronine. Decreased activity of type I 5'-monodeiodinase will, therefore, decrease plasma levels of T3 and increase plasma levels of rT3 (by decreasing its breakdown). Type II 5'-monodeiodinase is present in the anterior pituitary and central nervous system. Conversion of T 4 to T 3 within the anterior pituitary by this enzyme is responsible for normal feedback inhibition of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. With decreased type, I 5'-monodeiodinase activity, plasma levels ofT4 and TSH usually stay within normal limits because the type II enzyme continues to ensure normal feedback inhibition by anterior pituitary T 3.

AB trans retinoic acid is useful in the treatment of-,Myelodysplastic leukemia,Promyelocytic leukemia,Myelomonocytic leukemia,Chronic myelocytic leukemia,"APL is unique among leukemias due to its sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin), the acid form of vitamin A.Treatment with ATRA dissociates the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allows DNA transcription and differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes by targeting the oncogenic transcription factor and its aberrant action. Unlike other chemotherapies, ATRA does not directly kill the malignant cells. ATRA induces the terminal differentiation of the leukemic promyelocytes, after which these differentiated malignant cells undergo spontaneous apoptosis on their own. ATRA alone is capable of inducing remission but it is sho-lived in the absence of concurrent ""traditional"" chemotherapy.As of 2013 the standard of treatment for concurrent chemotherapy has become arsenic trioxide, which combined with ATRA is referred to ATRA-ATO; before 2013 the standard of treatment was anthracycline (e.g. daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin or mitoxantrone)-based chemotherapy. Both chemotherapies result in a clinical remission in approximately 90% of patients with arsenic trioxide having a more orable side effect profile. ATRA therapy is associated with the unique side effect of retinoic acid syndrome. This is associated with the development of dyspnea, fever, weight gain, peripheral edema and is treated with dexamethasone. The etiology of retinoic acid syndrome has been attributed to capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating promyelocytes Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 922",B

Natural history of disease can be studied from,Community trials,Quasi-controlled trials,Cross-sectional studies,Longitudinal studies,"Longitudinal studies There is an increasing emphasis on the value of longitudinal studies in which observations are repeated in the same population over a prolonged period of time by means of follow-up examinations. Cross-sectional studieshave been likened to a photograph, and longitudinal studies to a cine film. Longitudinal studies are useful (i) to study the natural history of disease and its future outcome {ii) for identifying risk factors of disease, (iii) for finding out incidence rate or rate of occurrence of new cases of disease in the community. Longitudinal studies provide valuable information which the cross-sectional studies may not provide, but longitudinal studies are difficult to organize and more time-consuming than cross-sectional studies. Measurement can also be extended to health states and events. For example, the study of blood pressure levels in a population will reveal the normal values, rather than abnormal ones related to disease. Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 69",D

Surgical causes of hyper Cai+ -,Hyperparathyroidism,MEN,Hypehyroidism,Pheochromocytoma,"A decline in serum calcium occurs within 24 hours after suc- cessful surgery; usually blood calcium falls to low-normal values for 3-5 days until the remaining parathyroid tissue resumes full hormone secretion. Acute postoperative hypocalcemia is likely only if severe bone mineral deficits are present or if injury to all the normal parathyroid glands occurs during surgery. In general, there are few problems encountered in patients with uncompli- cated disease such as a single adenoma (the clear majority), who do not have symptomatic bone disease nor a large deficit in bone mineral, who are vitamin D and magnesium sufficient, and who have good renal and gastrointestinal function. The extent of postoperative hypocalcemia varies with the surgical approach. If all glands are biopsied, hypocalcemia may be transiently symp- tomatic and more prolonged. Hypocalcemia is more likely to be symptomatic after second parathyroid explorations, paicularly when normal parathyroid tissue was removed at the initial operation and when the manipulation and/or biopsy of the remaining normal glands are more extensive in the search for the missing adenoma(Harrison 17 pg 2384)",A

In Wilsons disease copper deposition occurs in,Pons,Medulla,Cerebellum,Basal ganglia,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Normally, dietary copper is absorbed from the stomach and proximal small intestine and is rapidly taken into the liver, where it is stored and incorporated into caeruloplasmin, which is secreted into the blood. The accumulation of excessive copper in the body is ultimately prevented by its excretion, the most impoant route being bile. In Wilson's disease, there is almost always a failure of synthesis of caeruloplasmin; however, some 5% of patients have a normal circulating caeruloplasmin concentration and this is not the primary pathogenic defect. The amount of copper in the body at bih is normal but thereafter it increases steadily; the organs most affected are the liver, basal ganglia of the brain, eyes, kidneys and skeleton .

"A baby girl presents with bilateral inguinal masses, thought to be hernias but are found to be tested in the inguinal canals. Which karyotype would you expect to find in the child -","46,XX","46, XY","47, XXY","47, XYY","It is a case of Testicular feminisation syndrome.
The characteristic features of these disorders are that they are genotypically male (X19 while phenotypically they are female.
These cases usually present as a female with abdominal testis.
Prepubertal children with this disorder are often detected when inguinal masses prove to be a testis or when a testis is unexpectedly found during herniorrhapy in phenotypically female.
It is called testicular feminisation syndrome but the name is both stigmatising and inaccurate (the testes do not produce feminising factors).
The preferred name, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) reflects the underlying aetiology.

The cause of androgen insensitivity syndrome is the abnormality of the androgen receptor.

In the fetus with CAIS testes forms normally due to the presence of the (SRY gene) on chromosome Y.
At the appropriate time, these testes secrete anti-Mullerian hormone leading to the regression of Mullerian ducts. Hence CAIS 'women' do not have a uterus.
Testosterone is also produced at the appropriate time. However, due to the complete inability of the androgen receptor to respond, the external genitalia do not virilise and instead undergo female development.
These patients have a vagina instead of a penis.
Other areas where testosterone may have important fetal effects, such as the brain, will also develop along the female path.

The result is a female (both physically and psychologically) with no uterus, testis present which is found at some point in their line of descent through the abdomen from the pelvis to the inguinal canal.

During puberty, breast development will be normal; however, the effects of androgens will not be seen, so pubic and axillary hair growth will be minimal.
Majority of women with CAIS have shortened vagina when compared with the normal average length of 10-12 cm.
The cause of this lies in the embryological development of the vagina,

The upper portion of vagina → develops from Mullerian ducts
The lower portion of vagina → develops from urogenital sinus.


In CAIS Mullerian duct regresses, under the effect of the mullerian inhibiting hormone, leaving just the part derived from the urogenital sinus.

Clinical features of CAIS

Female external genitalia
46 XY karyotype
Intrabdominal or inguinal testes
Absent uterus
Primary amenorrhoea
Reduced or absent sexual hair (pubic and axillary)

The type of Diphtheria with highest mortality is,Pharyngeal,Nasal,Laryngeal,Conjuntival,"Clinical manifestations of diphtheria 
1. Faucial (tonsillo pharyngeal) diphtheria

It is the commonest type of diphtherial infection.
Incubation period is 2-5 days.
Patients present with malaise, sore throat and moderate fever.
A thick adherent pseudomnembrane (gray or white) is present on one or both tonsils or adjacent pharynx.
Dislodging the membrane is likely to cause bleeding.
A small percentage of patients present with massive swelling of the tonsils and uvula with cervical lymphadenopathy (bull neck) and severe toxemia → Malignant diphtheria.
Systemic toxicity (toxemia) is usually most severe when pseudomembrane extends from tonsil and pharynx (faucial diphtheria) to adjacent areas.

2. Laryngeal diphtheria

Presents as hoarseness and cough.
It is the most severe form of respiratory diphtheria.
Trocheostomy may be required.

3.Nasal diphtheria

Presents with unilateral or bilateral nasal discharge.
Mildest form of respiratory diphtheria

4. Cutaneous diphtheria

"In disaster situation, how many colour codes are used for triage: September 2009",1,2,3,None.,"Ans. D: None of the above Triage in a non-combat situation is conducted much the same as in civilian medicine. A battlefield situation, however, requires medics and corpsmen to rank casualties for precedence. The 4 triage categories (with corresponding color codes), in precedence, are: Red/ Immediate: The casualty requires immediate medical attention and will not survive if not seen soon. Any compromise to the casualty's respiration, hemorrhage control, or shock control could be fatal. Yellow/Delayed: The casualty requires medical attention within 6 hours. Injuries are potentially life-threatening, but can wait until the immediate casualties are stabilized and evacuated. Green/ Minimal: ""Walking wounded,"" the casualty requires medical attention when all higher priority patients have been evacuated, and may not require stabilization or monitoring. Black/ Expectant: The casualty is expected not to reach higher medical suppo alive without compromising the treatment of higher priority patients. Care should not be abandoned, spare any remaining time and resources after Immediate and Delayed patients have been treated.",D

Disadvantage to calculate mean-,Difficult to calculate,Difficult to understand,May be influenced by abnormal high or low values,None.,"Advantage of mean

It is easy to calculate and understand.

Disadvantage of mean

Sometimes it may be unduly influenced by abnormal values (either very high or very low) in the distribution.

For example, the income of seven people per day in rupees was as follows -
5, 5, 5, 7,10, 20, 300 = 352
Mean = 352/7 = 50.3

It has seriously affected mean because the income of 6 people is very low than the calculated mean and income of one is very high than calculated mean.

Opisthotonus posture is caused by wof,Ricinus communis,Papaver somniferum,Coccaine,Strychnous nux vomica,"STRYCHNOS NUX VOMICA Strychnine ( kuchila) is a powerful alkaloid obtained from the seeds of strychnos nux vomica. The seeds contain two principal alkaloids; strychnine and brucine. Mech of Action: It competitively blocks ventral horn motor neurone postganglionic receptor sites in the spinal cord and brainstem and prevents the effects of glycine (the presumed inhibitory transmitter). Widespread inhibition in the spinal cord results in &;release&; excitation. The action is paicularly noted in the anterior horn cells. It stimulates the cerebralcoex. GABA, the neurotransmitter for presynaptic inhibitory neurons is not affected. Signs and Symptoms: When crushed seeds are taken, the symptoms are delayed for an hour or more. If the alkaloid is swallowed, the symptoms occur very rapidly, usually within five to fifteen minutes. Bitter taste in the mouth, sense of uneasiness and restlessness, feeling of suffocation and fear, and difficulty in swallowing occur. The convulsions are preceded by such prodromal symptoms as increased acuity of perception, increased rigidity of muscles, and muscular twitchings. Convulsions are produced due to direct action on the reflex centres of spinal cord, and affect all the muscles at a time. These are at first clonic, but eventually become tonic. During the convulsions, the face is cyanosed and has anxious look, eyes are staring, eyeballs prominent and pupils are dilated. Risus sardonicus results from contraction of the jaws and facial muscles in which the corners of the mouth are drawn back. The mouth is covered with froth, frequently bloodstained. The convulsions are most marked in anti-gravity muscles, so that the body typically arches in hyperextension (opisthotonos). In supine position, the body is suppoed by the heels and head. The legs are adducted and extended, the arms are flexed over the chest or rigidly extended, and the hands are tightly clenched. The head is bent backwards, and the whole of the body becomes rigid, often assuming a bow-like form. Sometimes, the spasm of the abdominal muscles may bend the body forward (emprosthotonos), or to the side (pleorosthotonos). Consciousness is not lost and the mind remains clear till death.

Protein present in brown adipose tissue is -,Thermogenin,Dinitroprotein,Leptin,Adipocin,"The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance. Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves. In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus. Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control. When the tissue is active, high amounts of lipids and glucose are combusted in the tissue. The development of brown adipose tissue with its characteristic protein, uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), was probably determinative for the evolutionary success of mammals, as its thermogenesis enhances neonatal survival and allows for active life even in cold surroundings.

"In malarial eradication programme, the basis of using insecticide is to reduce lifespan of mosquito by less than",1 day,3 days,6 days,10 days,"VECTOR CONTROL STRATEGIES Vector control is still one of the primary weapons to control malaria in endemic areas. (a) Anti-adult measures (i) Residual spraying : The discovery of DDT in 1940s and followed by other insecticides revolutionized malaria control. The spraying of the indoor surfaces of houses with residual insecticides (e.g., DDT, malathion, fenitrothion) is still the most effective measure to kill the adult mosquito. It has been observed that discontinuation of spraying has very often led to the resurgence of malaria. This implies that spraying once applied may need to be continued for an indefinite period. If indoor spraying is to have any effect, then exhaustive coverage is needed. Indoor house spraying Reduces the longevity of the vector. Malathion and fenitrothion are organophosphate insecticides which are being used with increasing frequency For malaria control following the development of vector resistance to DDT (ii) Space application : This is a major anti-epidemic measure in mosquito-borne diseases. It involves the application of pesticides in the form of fog or mist using special equipment. The ultra-low-volume method of pesticide dispersion by air or by ground equipment has proved to be effective and economical. Outdoor space sprays reduce vector population quickly. {iii) Individual protection : Man-vector contact can be reduced by other preventive measures such as the use of repellents, protective clothing, bed-nets* (preferably impregnated with safe, long-acting repellent insecticides), mosquito coils, screening of houses etc. The methods of personal protection are of great value when properly employed.

Wolf Chaikoff effect -,Excess iodine intake causes hypothyroidism,Iodine induced hyper thyroidism,Thyrotoxicosis due to excessive amount of iodineingestion,Drug induced hyperthyroidism,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Excess iodine intake causes hypothyroidism o The effect of iodine on thyroid function is quite complex.o The most obvious effect of administering a high dose of iodine is a decrease in the release ofthyroid hormones.This effect is very prompt and is quicker than the action of antithyroid drugs.Hence, iodine ivas used in the treatment ofthyrotoxicosis and is still used in preparing patients for thyroid surgery.o However, the effect is not observed on repeated administration of iodine a phenomenon called ""iodine escape"" the cause of which is not understood.o Administration of iodine has a triphasic response on the organification of iodine.o Inhally there is a brief increase in iodine organification.o Shortly therafter, the high intrathyroid iodide concentration inhibits iodine organification an effect known as wolff-ch iakoffeffect.o Prolonged adminstration of high dose of iodine, however produces an escape from the wolfchiakoff effect (not to be confused with iodine escape) due to autoregulation of iodine uptake by the thyroid.When iodine organification decreases due to the wolfchiakoff effect it results in inthrathyroid accumulation of iodine.The rise in intrathyroid iodide, reduces the iodine uptake (due to autoregulation).The intrathyroid iodide therefore reduces and with it the wolf-chiakoff effect subsides.If however the autoregulation is absent due to thyroid dysfuntion the wolf-chiakoff effect will persist and keep the iodine organification suppressed.Increased concentrationof plasma iodide|Increased uptake ofiodide by thyroid|iIncreased conceniraionof intrathyroid iodine|Increased organificationof iodine|Increased synthesis of T, and T4|Increased release of F, and T,",A

b) Live attenuated - Administered as nasal drops
c) Newer vaccines - Split virus vaccine (sub-virion vaccine)

Used subcutaneously


Recombinant vaccine
Neuraminidase vaccine


A trivalent, live attenuated influenza vaccine administered as a single dose intranasal spray is a effective as inactivated vaccine. It is approved for use in otherwise healthy individuals between the age of 2 years and 49 years.

2. Chemoprophylaxis

Type A → Amantadine and rimantidine
Both Type A & B → Zamamivir, Osteltamivir
The current recommendations are that influenza A be treated with zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine. Influenza B can be treated with either oseltamivir or zanamivir.
For chemoprophylaxis against influenza A, Zanamivir should be used. If this is contraindicated, rimantidine should be given. For influenza B, oseltomivir is used.

Low doses of aspirin therapy is essentially advised for all of the following conditions except:,SLE,IUGR,Post myocardinal infarction,Pre ecclampsia,"Answer is A (SLE) Low dose aspirin therapy has definite indication in preecclampsia, IUGR and post MI. There appears no rationale of using low dose aspirin for manifestation of SLE. Neveheless low dose aspirin is of definite benefit in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. SLE is thus the single best answer of exclusion here. Low dose aspirin therapy markedly decreases thromboxane production but only paially blocks prostocyclin and prostaglandin E2 production. Pre-ecalmpsia: In preeclamptic woman, thromboxane is increased and prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin are decreased, resulting in vasoconstriction and sensitivity to infused angiotensin II. Low dose aspirin as explained above enhances concentration of vasodilating prostanoids and restores refractoriness to infused angitensin II. Post MI: No confusions on this one. Low dose aspirin is advised to such patients. IUGR: Early antiplatelet therapy with low dose aspirin may prevent uteroplacental thrombosis, placental infarction, and idiopathic fetal growth retardation in women with a history of recurrent severe fetal growth restriction. -Williams 20`""/ 849 Fuher Williams 21st/1212 says: ""Low dose aspirin & Dipyridamole are beneficial in reducing incidence of superimposed preeclampsia & growth restriction"".

Severity of mitral stenosis Is assessed by -,Loud opening snap,Loud opening snap Length of murmur,Loud S1,Splitting of sounds,"In MS The first hea sound (S 1 ) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second hea sound (P 2 ) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second hea sound (S 2 ) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aoic valve closure (A 2 ) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A 2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. ( Harrison&;s principle of internal medicine,18th edition,pg no. 1931 )",B

Most common type of gastric tumor in adults:,Adenocarcinoma,Stromal tumor,Leiomyosarcoma,Lymphoma,"About 85% of stomach cancers are adenocarcinomas, with 15% due to lymphomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and leiomyosarcomas. 
Gastric adenocarcinomas may be subdivided into two pathologically defined categories:

Diffuse type, in which cell cohesion is absent, so that individual cells infiltrate and thicken the stomach wall without forming a discrete mass.
Intestinal type, characterized by cohesive neoplastic cells that form gland-like tubular structures. 

The diffuse carcinomas occur more often in younger patients, develop throughout the stomach (including the cardia), result in a loss of distensibility of the gastric wall (so-called linitis plastica, or “leather bottle” appearance), and carry a poorer prognosis.

Low haptoglobin in haemorrhage is masked by concurrent presence of,Malnutrition,Pregnancy,Obstructive biliary disease,Liver parenchymal disease,"D i.e Liver parenchymal disease Haptoglobin (Hp) binds extracorpuscular (i.e. extracellular) hemoglobin (Hb), preventing free Hb from entering the kidney. Hp-Hb complex is removed from plasma by haptocytes. Levels of haptoglobin falls rapidly in situations where hemoglobin is constantly being released from RBC such as occurs in hemolytic anemia (haemorrhage). But in case of parenchymal liver disease, Hp-Hb complex removal is deranged so reduction in haptoglobin level is masked. Haptoglobin It is a plasma glycoprotein that binds extracapsular hemoglobin (Hb) in a tight non-covalent complex. Its amount ranges from 40mg- 180 mg of hemoglobin binding capacity / deciliter. Only 10% of degraded hemoglobin is released in circulation (i.e. extra corpuscular) the remaining 90% is present in old damaged RBCs, which are degraded by histiocytic system. Free Hb (molecular mass 65KDa) passes through glomerulus and precipitate in tubules. However, after binding with haptoglobin (90 KDa) the Hb-Hp complex (155KDa) becomes too large to pass through glomerulus. So the function of haptoglobin is to prevent loss of free hemoglobin into kidney and conserve the valuable iron present in hemoglobin, which would otherwise be lost to the body. Humans have 3 polymorphic forms, k/a Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1, Hp 2-2. Low levels of haptoglobins are found in patients with hemolytic anemia. This is explained by the fact that where the life of Hp is 5 days, the t1/2 of Hb-Hp complex is 90 minutes, the complex being rapidly removed by hepatocytes. So when the hepatoglobin is bound to Hb, it is cleared from plasma about 80 times faster than normally. Hb is an acute phase protein & is elevated in variety of inflammatory states. * Haptoglobin related protein binds hemoglobin; hemopexin binds free heme; and albumin binds metheme (ferric heme)",D
"A 24-year-old woman presents 6 months after the delivery of her first child, a healthy girl, for evaluation of fatigue.

She recalls having a tremor and mild palpitations for a few weeks, beginning 3 months after delivery. On examination, her BP is 126/84 and her pulse rate is 56. The thyroid gland is two times normal in size and nontender. The rest of the physical examination is normal. Laboratory studies reveal a free T4 level of 0.7 ng/mL (normal 0.9-2.4) and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 22 microU/mL (normal 0.4-4). What is the likely course of her illness?",Permanent hypothyroidism requiring lifelong replacement therapy,Eventual hyperthyroidism requiring methimazole therapy,Recovery with euthyroidism,Infertility,"This patient has postpartum thyroiditis, a condition that follows 5% to 8% of all pregnancies. Like other forms of destructive thyroiditis (including subacute or de Quervain thyroiditis), this illness is triphasic. Initially there is hyperthyroidism due to inflammation and release of preformed thyroid hormone from the inflamed follicles; this phase usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks. In subacute thyroiditis, the initial phase is usually noticed because of pain and tenderness over the thyroid gland, but in postpartum thyroiditis the thyroid is usually painless, and the hyperthyroid phase may be overlooked. This phase is then followed by transient hypothyroidism, usually lasting 1 to 3 months. The third phase is resolution and euthyroidism. Whereas Hashimoto thyroiditis usually leads to permanent autoimmune hypothyroidism, most patients with destructive thyroiditis have a full recovery. Some will be symptomatic enough to require thyroid supplementation for 1 to 3 months until the process resolves. Although the initial hyperthyroid phase can suggest Graves' disease, in thyroiditis the absence of infiltrative ophthalmopathy and a suppressed radioiodine uptake will make the distinction.Antithyroid drug treatment of thyroiditis is ineffective and puts the patient at unnecessary risk of toxicity such as agranulocytosis. Although hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea and hence impair fertility, the hypothyroid phase of postpartum thyroiditis is transient. Low-level radiation exposure, but not thyroiditis, increases the risk of subsequent development of thyroid cancer. Interestingly, therapeutic radioactive iodine, such as is given for Graves' disease, does not increase the long-term risk of cancer, probably because the thyroid cells are destroyed.",C

She also repos occasional hoarseness, which also come and go. Vital signs and physical examination are normal. Most appropriate next step in diagnosis is?","Blood, urine, and CSF analysis",MRI of the head,EEG recording,Electromyography under repetitive stimulation,"The clinical manifestations are highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis. This disorder has three general features: the fluctuating nature of muscle weakness, predominant involvement of ocular muscles (with diplopia and ptosis), and positive clinical response to administration of cholinergic agents. Crisis of weakness involving respiratory muscles was the most frequent cause of death before the advent of positive pressure respirators. The disease is autoimmune-mediated and results from autoantibodies to the muscular nicotinic receptors. Besides the pharmacologic test, a progressive decrease in the amplitude of muscle potential is the diagnostic feature of myasthenia gravis. Electromyography is therefore very useful in the diagnosis of this condition. Blood, urine, and CSF analysis are entirely within normal limits in myasthenia gravis, although they are indeed frequently performed in the initial screening. MRI of the head and EEG recording would be entirely useless in this setting. Since the disorder is due to impaired cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction, skeletal muscle biopsy is within normal limits at the light microscopic level. Occasionally muscle biopsy is performed to rule out other causes of muscle weakness, such as myopathic processes.",D

False about case fatality rate: March 2011,Represents the killing power of disease,Denominator is mid-year population,Indicates virulence power of causative agent,Not much useful for chronic diseases,"Ans. B: Denominator is mid-year population Case fatality rate= Total number of deaths due to a disease X 100/ Total number of cases due to that disease Case fatality/Fatality rate: It is the ratio of deaths within a designated population of people with a paicular condition, over a ceain period of time. An example of a fatality rate would be 9 deaths per 10,000 people at risk per year. This means that within a given year, out of 10,000 people formally diagnosed with a disease, 9 died. Rabies, if contracted by an unvaccinated individual who does not seek prophylactic treatment, is also an extremely deadly virus, with a case fatality rate approaching 100%. Moality rate: It is a measure of the number of deaths (in general, or due to a specific cause) in a population, scaled to the size of that population, per unit time. Moality rate is typically expressed in units of deaths per 1000 individuals per year; thus, a moality rate of 9.5 in a population of 100,000 would mean 950 deaths per year in that entire population, or 0.95% out of the total. It is distinct from morbidity rate, which refers to the number of individuals in poor health during a given time period (the prevalence rate) or the number of newly appearing cases of the disease per unit of time (incidence rate). The term ""moality"" is also sometimes inappropriately used to refer to the number of deaths among a set of diagnosed hospital cases for a disease or injury, rather than for the general population of a country or ethnic group. This disease moality statistic is more precisely referred to as ""case fatality"". One Distinguishes: The crude death rate, the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people. The perinatal moality rate, the sum of neonatal deaths and fetal deaths (stillbihs) per 1000 bihs. The maternal moality ratio, the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live bihs in same time period. The maternal moality rate, the number of maternal deaths per 1,000 women of reproductive age in the population (generally defined as 15-44 years of age). The infant moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1000 live bihs. The child moality rate, the number of deaths of children less than 5 years old per 1000 live bihs. The standardized moality rate (SMR)- This represents a propoional comparison to the numbers of deaths that would have been expected if the population had been of a standard composition in terms of age, gender, etc. The age specific moality rate (ASMR) - This refers to the total number of deaths per year per 1000 people of a given age.",B

Claviceps fusiformis is responsible for,Neurolatyrism,Ergotism,Epidemic dropsy,Endemic ascites,"Ergot Unlike Aspergillus, ergot is not a storage fungus, but a field fungus. Foodgrains such as bajra, rye, sorghum, and wheat have a tendency to get infested during the flowering stages by the ergot fungus (Claviceps purpurea). Fungus grows as a blackish mass and the seeds become black and irregular and are harvested along with food grains. Consumption of ergot infested grain leads to ergotism. Sporadic outbreaks of ergot poisoning in human population have been repoed from time to time in areas where bajra is consumed as a staple. The symptoms are acute but rarelyfatal and include nausea, repeated vomiting, giddiness and drowsiness extending sometimes for periods upto 24 to 48 hours after the ingestion of ergoty grain. In chronic cases, painful cramps in limbs and peripheral gangrene due to vasoconstriction of capillaries have been repoed. However, the long-term effects of consuming small amounts of the Toxin are not known. A disquieting feature is that the recently introduced high-yielding varieties of bajra are more susceptible to infestation. Ergot-infested grains can be easily removed by floating them in 20 per cent salt water. They can also be removed by hand-picking or air floatation. The upper safe limit for the ergot alkaloids has been estimated to be 0.05 mg per 100 grams of the food material. Ref: Park 25th edition Pgno : 694",B

Which a vehicular injury is not caused by direct contact of vehicle ?,Primary impact,Secondary impact,Secondary injury,Rolling over,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Secondary injury Pedestrian injuries Following patterns of injuries are seen :? 1) Primary impact injuries : It is caused due to initial impact between vehicle and pedestrian. The height of the pedestrian often determines the site of impact and injuries, for example, they are usually found on head in children and on the trunk and legs in adults. Overall, the most common site is leg (85%), followed by head (50-80%) > arms > pelvis > chest or abdomen > neck and spine. 2) Secondary impact injuries : These are due to subsequent impact with the same vehicle, as may result from being lifted on to the vehicle after the initial impact:- Secondary impact injuries are also usually seen on the same side as the primary impact injuries (side facing the vehicle) when the body is thrown on the vehicle although they may be seen on other surfaces such as during ran over injuries. If the initial impact was below the centre of gravity (as occurs in adult and older child), it tends to lift the victim up onto bonnet/hood of vehicle (scooping up) or even on road behind the vehicle and cause severe head injuries, laceration (due to secondary impact or contact with windshield) and run over by passing vehicle. If the initial point of impact was at or above the centre of gravity (as occurs in children), he is directly thrown to ground (due to primary impact) and is run over by same car with consequent secondary impact under carriage injuries which may include burns from hot exhaust pipe and stains from grease oil etc. 3) Secondary injuries : These are caused by person violently falling on ground or on stationary object. These are found on pas opposite to primary impact or on head. Injuries due to contact with ground include abrasion and bruises over the face, hand, hips and legs, and laceration over the bony prominences. 4) Rolling/Runover (degloving injuries) : Caused by wheel of vehicle or rolling over the victim. Children are oftenly involved.",C
Bilirubin is absent in urine because it is,Distributed in the body fat,Conjugated with giucoronide,Not filterable,Lipophilic,"Bilirubin metabolism and bile The liver plays a central role in the metabolism of bilirubin and is responsible for the production of bile (Fig. 22.6). Between 425 and 510 mmol (250-300 mg) of unconjugated bilirubin is produced from the catabolism of haem daily. Bilirubin in the blood is normally almost all unconjugated and, because it is not water-soluble, is bound to albumin and does not pass into the urine. Unconjugated bilirubin is taken up by hepatocytes at the sinusoidal membrane, where it is conjugated in the endoplasmic reticulum by UDP-glucuronyl transferase, producing bilirubin mono- and diglucuronide. Impaired conjugation by this enzyme is a cause of inherited hyperbilirubinaemias . These bilirubin conjugates are water-soluble and are expoed into the bile canaliculi by specific carriers on the hepatocyte membranes. The conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the bile and passes into the duodenal lumen. Once in the intestine, conjugated bilirubin is metabolised by colonic bacteria to form stercobilinogen, which may be fuher oxidised to stercobilin. Both stercobilinogen and stercobilin are then excreted in the stool, contributing to its brown colour. Biliary obstruction results in reduced stercobilinogen in the stool, and the stools become pale. A small amount of stercobilinogen (4 mg/day) is absorbed from the bowel, passes through the liver and is excreted in the urine, where it is known as urobilinogen or, following fuher oxidisation, urobilin. The liver secretes 1-2 L of bile daily. Bile contains bile acids (formed from cholesterol), phospholipids, bilirubin and cholesterol. Several biliary transpoer proteins have been identified . Mutations in genes encoding these proteins have been identified in inherited intrahepatic biliary diseases presenting in childhood, and in adult-onset disease such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and gallstone formation. Urine tests If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process.

All of the following are true about para hemophilia except?,Due to fracture V deficiency,X-link recessive,Prolonged PTT and PT,All are true,"Ans. B. X-link recessivea. Deficiency of factor V is an autosomal recessive, mild to moderate bleeding disorder that has also been termed parahemophilia. Hemarthroses occur rarely; mucocutaneous bleeding and hematomas are the most common symptoms.b. Severe menorrhagia is a frequent symptom in women. Laboratory evaluation shows prolonged PTT and PT. specific assays for factor V show a reduction in factor V levels.c. FFP is the only currently available therapeutic product that contains factor V. Factor V is lost rapidly from stored FFP.d. Patients with severe factor V deficiency are treated with infusions of FFP at 10mL/kg every 12hr. Rarely, a patient with a negative family history of bleeding has an acquired antibody to factor V. Often, these patients do not bleed because the factor V in platelets prevents excessive bleeding.",B

"Which of the following shows ""cyclodevelopmental"" type of biological transmission: September 2011",Filarial parasite,Malarial parasite,Plague bacilli,All of the above,"Ans. A: Filarial parasite Cyclodevelopmental biological transmission is shown by filarial parasite in culex mosquito and guineaworm embryo in Cyclops (when the disease agent undergoes cyclical changes but do not multiply in the body of the ahropod) Propagative transmission In the case of viruses, rickettsiae, bacteria and parasites, the parasites reproduce (i.e. propagate) in the vector, but do not pass through developmental stages. Transmission cannot occur until the parasite population has increased many fold and been disseminated, e.g. to the salivary glands. Cyclopropagative transmission In this case, protozoan parasites undergo both development and reproduction within the vector. These parasites both increase in number and transform to a different life stage before transmission can occurs. However, the veebrate stages of these parasites can invoke a new infection if they are directly transferred to another veebrate host blood transfusion or across the placenta (e.g. malaria parasites) or through sexual intercourse. (e.g. trypanosomes). Cyclodevelopmental transmission Microfilarial parasites ingested by the vector with the blood meal undergo development to 3rd stage larvae (L3) before being transferred back to another veebrate host. There is no replication and not all ingested microfilaria survive to L3. Thus, the number of parasites leaving the vector is always less than the number entering.",A

It is caused a tumor of the pineal gland which compresses the vertical gaze center at the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF). The eyes lose the ability to move upward.# Parinaud's Syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction, characterized by:> Paralysis of upgaze: Downward gaze is usually preserved. This vertical palsy is supranuclear, so Doll's head maneuver should elevate the eyes, but eventually all upward gaze mechanisms fail.> Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils: Accommodative paresis ensues, and pupils become mid-dilated and show light-near dissociation.> Convergence-Retraction nystagmus: Attempts at upward gaze often produce this phenomenon. On fast up-gaze, the eyes pull in and the globes retract. The easiest way to bring out this reaction is to ask the patient to follow down-going stripes on an optokinetic drum.> Eyelid retraction (Collier's sign) Conjugate down gaze in the primary position: ""setting-sun sign"".

Drug preferred in treatment of 'Restless leg' syndrome?,Propranolol,Ropinirole,Bupropion,Diazepam,"Ans. B. Ropinirole. (Ref. Harrison 18,h/ch. Table 27-l;Katzung pharmacology 11th7 Ch. 28)Restless Legs Syndrome# It is an unpleasant creeping discomfort that seems to arise deep within the legs and occasionally the arms. It occur particularly when patients are relaxed, especially when they are lying down or sitting, and they lead to an urge to move about. Such symptoms may delay the onset of sleep. A sleep disorder associated with periodic movements during sleep may also occur. The cause is unknown, but the disorder is especially common among pregnant women and also among uremic or diabetic patients with neuropathy. In most patients, no obvious predisposing cause is found, but several genetic loci have been associated with it (12ql2-q21, 14ql3-q31, 9p24-p22, 2q33, and 20pl3).# Symptoms may resolve with correction of coexisting iron-deficiency anemia and often respond to dopamine agonists, levodopa, diazepam, clonazepam, gabapentin, or opiates.# Dopaminergic therapy is the preferred treatment for restless legs syndrome and should be initiated with long-acting dopamine agonists (eg, pramipexole 0.125-0.75 mg or ropinirole 0.25-4.0 mg once daily) to avoid the augmentation that may be associated with levodopa-carbidopa (100/25 or 200/50 taken about 1 hour before bedtime).# Augmentation refers to the earlier onset or enhancement of symptoms; earlier onset of symptoms at rest; and a briefer response to medication. When augmentation occurs in patients receiving an agonist, the daily dose should be lowered or divided, or opioids substituted. Oxycodone is often effective; the dose is individualized.# Gabapentin is an alternative to opioids.Initial dopamine agonists were ergot derivatives (e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergoline) and were associated with ergot-related side effects, including cardiac valvular damage. They have largely been replaced by a second generation of non-ergot dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine). In general, dopamine agonists do not have comparable efficacy to levodopa.Evaluation of the Patient with the Complaint of Excessive Daytime SomnolenceFindings on History and Physical ExaminationDiagnostic EvaluationDiagnosisTherapyObesity, snoring, hypertensionPolysomnography with respiratory monitoringObstructive sleep apneaContinuous positive airway pressure; ENT surgery (e.g., uvulopalatopharyngoplasty); dental appliance; pharmacologic therapy (e.g., protriptyline); weight lossCataplexy, hypnogogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, family historyPolysomnography with multiple sleep latency testingNarcolepsy- cataplexy syndromeStimulants (e.g., modafinil, methylphenidate); REM-suppressant antidepressants (e.g., protriptyline); genetic counselingRestless legs, disturbed sleep, predisposing medical condition {e.g., iron deficiency or renal failure)Assessment for predisposing medical conditionsRestless legs syndromeTreatment of predisposing condition, if possible; dopamine agonists (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole)Disturbed sleep, predisposing medical conditions (e.g., ioralasthma), and/or predisposing medical therapies (e.g., theophylline)Sleep-wake diary recordingInsomnias (see text)Treatment of predisposing condition and/ or change in therapy, if possible; behav-therapy; short-acting benzodiazepine receptor agonist (e.g., zolpidem)",B
Me Naughten's rule is?,Person is not responsible if he is not of a sound mind,Person is held responsible even if he is not of sound mind,Person is always held responsible,Any of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Person is not responsible if he is not of a sound mind o According to Me Naughtcn's rule, a person is not responsible for his act, if has unsound mind at the time of act.o The criminal responsibility of an insane is judged as per the following rules :1) MC Naughten rule (legal test or right or wrong test):# Accused danieal MC Nauthten (probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and having persecutory delusions) shot Sir Peel's private secretory, Edward Drummond, mistaking him for the prime minister Sir Robert Peel. He was found not guilty on grounds of insanity. The answers given by panel of 14 judges to house of lords to clarify the legal position (on 19 june 1843) as known as MC Naughten rule.# It states that an accused person is not legally responsible, if it is clearly proved that at the time of commiting the crime, person was suffering from such a defect of reason from abnormality of mind that he didn't know the nature and quality of act he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong i.e. a person is not responsible if he is not of sound mind.# It is accepted in india as law of criminal responsibility and is embodied in section 84 IPC as - ""nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind is incapable of knowing the nature of act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law"".# The primary defect is that the criteria for deciding insanity is purely intellectual (reason based). And there is no place for delusional beliefs, hallucinations, emotional and volitional factors and the ability of an individual to control the impulses. This is because the abnormality of mind (term used in this rule) is a legal and not a psychiatric concept and is concerned with the mind (i.e. reason, memory and understanding) not with the brain.# Clearly proved (term) means that the mental abnormality had a direct causal relation to the offence (i.e. it would not have occurred in absence of mental abnormality).# Crime consists of actus reus (i.e. guilty act) and mens rea (wrong intention). So if at the time of crime, the accused had the capacity to know that his act was wrong, he will be fully responsible, even if he was mentally ill, and unable to refrain from doing the act at that time.# If an accused commits a crime under the influence of delusion, he is j udged as if the delusionary facts were real. So if due to an insane delusion, a person kills a man in self defence (thinking that he is attempting to kill him or thinking that he is a wild animal) or as a part of job (thinking that he is a state executioner and has to execute the victim) he has no criminal responsibility and is exempt from punishment. But due to an insane delusion, if a person thinks that another person has caused a serious injury to his fortune and character and kills him, he becomes responsible as under the law no one can kill a person in revenge.2) Doctrine of partial responsbility# If a person is suffering from some weakness or aberration of mind (though not completely insane), he is only partially responsible for his actions, e.g. obsessional states or depressions.3) Durban rule# Accused is not responsible for the act, if his act resulted from mental disease or defect.4) Currens rule# A person is not responsible if at the time of committing the crime, he did not have the capacity to regulate his conduct according to the requirments of law, as a result of his mental disease or defect.5) American law institute test# Insane lacks the capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to confirm to the requirements of law, therefore he is not responsible for crimes committed.6) Norwegion system# No defendent considered insane or unconscious at the time of offence, may be punished.",A

Alveolar hyproventilation is observed in ?,Gullian-Barre syndrome,Acute asthma,Bronchiectasis,CREST syndrome,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Guillian-Barre syndrome Neuromuscular diseases that can cause alveolar hypoventilation include myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillian-Barre syndrome, and muscular dystrophy. Patients with neuromuscular disorders have rapid, shallow breathing secondary to severe muscle weakness or abnormal motor neuron function. The central respiratory drive is maintained in patients with neuromuscular disorders. Thus, hypoventilation is secondary to respiratory muscle weakness. Chest wall deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, fibrothorax, and those occurring postthoraco-plasty are associated with alveolar hypoventilation leading to respiratory insufficiency and respiratory failure. Hypoventilation is not uncommon in patients with severe COPD. Alveolar hypoventilation in COPD usually does not occur unless the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is less than IL or 35% of the predicted value. However, many patients with severe airflow obstruction do not develop hypoventilation",A

Hyperextensibility with normal elastic recoil is a feature of-,Ehlers Danlos syndrome,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,Cutis laxa,Scleroderma,"Ehler Danos syndrome EDS is characterized by hyper-extensible skin and hypermobile joints but the category includes rare patients with other distinctive features. Mutations in different types of collagen are found in many patients but other genes are at fault in rare forms. Contrary to initial expectations, no patients have been found with mutations in the gene for elastin in EDS. Incidence The overall incidence of EDS is about 1 in 5000 bihs, with a higher rate for blacks. Classical and hypermobile types of EDS are the most common. Patients with milder forms frequently do not seek medical attention. Clinical features Skin Skin changes vary from thin and velvety to skin that is either dramatically hyperextensible (""rubber person"" syndrome) or easily torn or scarred. Patients with classical EDS develop characteristic ""cigarettepaper"" scars. In vascular-type EDS, extensive scars and hyperpigmentation develop over bony prominences, and the skin may be so thin that subcutaneous blood vessels are visible. In the periodontotic type of EDS, the skin is more fragile than hyperextensible, and it heals with atrophic, pigmented scars. Easy bruisability occurs in several types of EDS. Ligament and Joint Changes Laxity and hypermobility of joints vary from mild to unreducible dislocations of hips and other large joints. In mild forms, patients learn to avoid dislocations by limiting physical activity. In more severe forms, surgical repair may be required. Some patients have progressive difficulty with age.Other Features Mitral valve prolapse and hernias occur, particularly with Type I. Pes planus and mild to moderate scoliosis are common. Extreme joint laxity and repeated dislocations may lead to degenerative ahritis. In the ocular-scoliotic type of EDS, the eye may rupture with minimal trauma, and kyphoscoliosis can cause respiratory impairment. Also, sclerae may be blue.

Right 12th nerve damage leads to?,Tongue deviation to left on protrusion,Tongue deviation to right on protrusion,Nasal twang to voice,Scanning speech defects,"Ans. (b) Tongue deviation to right on protrusionRef: Harrison 19th ed. / Ch 367Following a lesion of the hypoglossal nucleus or nerve* ATROPHY of the muscles of the IPSILATERAL one-half of the tongue occurs.* FASCICULATIONS (tiny, spontaneous contractions) can be seen.* Upon protrusion, the tongue will deviate TOWARD the side of the lesion (i.e.} same side). This is due to the unopposed action of the genioglossus muscle on the normally innervated side of the tongue (the genioglossus pulls the tongue forward).The corticobulbar input to the hypoglossal nucleus arises from motor cortex and is predominantly CROSSED. Thus, a lesion in motor cortex will result in deviation of the tongue toward the opposite side or CONTRALATERAL to the lesion. In contrast to the atrophy and fasciculations seen in lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nerve (lower motor neuron), NO such signs are present after lesions of the corticobulbar tract.",B

A graphical presentation of a frequency distribution for grouped data for a continuous variable is known as:,Histogram,Bar chart,Pictogram,Line diagram,"Answer: A. Histogram. (Ref Park's PSM 22nd/Pg.788; biostatistics by B K Mahajan, Vlth /pg.20 )A graphical presentation of a frequency distribution for grouped data for a continuous variable is known as Histogram.# A frequency polygon is a line graph for the graphical representation of frequency distribution.# A bar diagram is a graphical representation of frequency distributions of ungrouped data.# A histogram is the pictoral diag/graphical representation of the frequency distribution of the data.Type of data--Qualitative data 4Quantitative dataDefinitionCharacteristics same only frequency variesCharacteristics as well as frequency both variesExampleMales, femalesHeight, weight, blood pressureMethod of presentation of dataBar diagramLength of the bars, drawn vertical or horizontal, indicates the frequency of a character. Bar may be drawn in ascending or descending order of magnitude. Spacing between any two bars should be nearly equal to half of the width of the bar. There are four types of bar diagrams.a) Simple bar diagram: Here bars can be arranged vertically or horizontally. A suitable scale must be used to present the length of the bars.b) Multiple bar diagram: Here two or more bars are grouped together.c) Component bar diagram: The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part represents a certain item.d) Proportional bar diagram: Each bar represents 100%. The bars may be divided into two or more parts. Each part is proportional to the magnitude of that particular itemHistogram - To construct a histogram the class intervals are plotted along x axis and corresponding frequencies (or no. of observations) on Y-axis . Rectangles are constructed such that height of a rectangle is proportional to the frequency of class and width is equal to length of the class. If all classes are of equal length then all the rectangles will have equal width. Histogram is an area diagram. Pie diagram - The frequencies of the groups are shown in a circle. Degrees of angle denote the frequency and area of the sector.Size of each angle is calculated by the formula as: Angle (Degrees) = Class frequency X 360?/Tota! observationsFrequency polygon- It is an area diagram of frequency distribution developed over a histogram. Join the midpoints of class intervals at the height of frequencies by straight lines.It gives a polygon i.e. figure with many angles.Pictogram- It is a popular method of presenting data to the layman. Here each picture indicates a unit of characteristic. These charts can be used for illiterate persons. Because of its attractive presentation it can be utilized for the man on the street.Frequency curve- when the no. of observations is very large and group intervals are reduced, the frequency polygon tends to loose angulations giving place to a smooth curve known as frequency curve. Spot map- These maps are prepared to show geographical distribution of frequencies of characteristicLine chart - This is a frequency polygon presenting variations by line. It shows the trend of an event occurring over a period of time-rising, falling or showing fluctuations. Cumulative frequency curve(Ogive)- Successive class frequencies are added and a frequency polygon is drawn. Number or percent of observation falling below or above a specific value can be presented in this graph. Any point below which there are certain percent of observations is called as percentile and graph drawn out of such points is a 'percentile graph' Scatter (Correlation) diagram- It is graphic representation made to show the nature of correlation between two variable characters X and Y in the same person(s) or group(s) such as height and weight in men aged 20 years, hence it is also called correlation diagram. The characters are read on the base(X --axis) and vertical (Y-axis) and the perpendiculars drawn from these readings meet to give one scatter point. Varying frequencies of the characters give a number of such points or dots that show a scatter. A line is drawn to show the nature of correlation at a glance.",A

A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked Twaves on ECG. Most rapid way to decreased serum potassium level.-,Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Management Treatment of hyperkalaemia depends on its severity and the rate of development, but opinions vary as to what level ofserum potassium constitutes severe hyperkalaemia and requires urgent treatment. Patients who have potassium concentrations <6.5 mmol/L in the absence of neuromuscular symptoms or ECG changes can be treated with a reduction of potassium intake and correction of predisposing factors. However, in acute and/ or severe hyperkalaemia (plasma potassium >6.5-7.0 mmol/L), more urgent measures must be taken . The first step should be infusion of 10 mL 10% calcium gluconate to stabilise conductive tissue membranes (calcium has the opposite effect to potassium on conduction of an action potential). Measures to shift potassium from the ECF to the ICF should also be applied, as they generally have a rapid effect and may ave arrhythmias. Ultimately, a means of removing potassium from the body is generally necessary. When renal function is reasonably preserved, loop diuretics (accompanied by intravenous saline if hypovolaemia is present) may be effective. In renal failure, dialysis may be required. Oral ion exchange resins, such as sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS), have traditionally been used to bind and excrete gastrointestinal potassium. Thereare concerns, however, with regard to SPS's lack of proven efficacy and safety, with a number of repos of intestinal necrosis associated with its use. Alternative cation exchanges have been developed and are currently being trialled, with the aim of providing more effective and safer alternatives for the treatment of hyperkalaemia.

To overcome this problem 't' test was devised by W.S. Cassette whose pen name was 'student' and hence this test was called student 't' test. Application of test : o It is applied to find the significance of difference between two means, when sample size is less than 30. o It is applied on a standard population either as : 1. Unpaired 't' test : Applied when data is unpaired, i.e. when separate observations are made on inidividuals of two separate groups, and these need to be compared : Null hypothesis is assumed Observed diference between means of two samples is found. Standard error or difference between two means is calculated. t value is estimated. This is the ratio between points 2 and 3. Degrees of freedom are next calculated Calculated values are compared with the 't' table values at the calculated degree of freedom (option d) P values are obtained and if it is more than 0.05, it has no significance. 2.

Which of the folloing virus is the commonest cause of sporadic encephalitis?,Rubeola Virus,Japanese B Virus,Herpes Simplex Virus,Human Immunodeficiency Virus,"Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis. It mainly involves individuals more than 40 years of age. Primary HSV 1 often present as stomatitis and HSV type 2 manifest as venereally transmitted genital eruption. These virus then migrates along nerve axons to sensory ganglia, and persists in a latent form and may be reactivated later. In adults encephalitis is caused by HSV type 1. In neonates HSV encephalitis is caused by type 2 virus during passage through the bih canal of a mother with active genital lesions. HSV type 2 in adults causes meningitis, rather than encephalitis.

This constellation of clinical findings strongly suggests syringomyelia, which most commonly affects the cervical spinal cord. Syringomyelia refers to a fluid-filled space within the cervical spinal cord that produces (1) cervical cord enlargement, best visualized with magnetic resonance imaging; (2) cape-like neurologic abnormalities involving the shoulders and upper extremities; (3) decreased pain and temperature sensation from involvement of the crossed lateral spinothalamic tracts, with preservation of light touch and proprioception; (4) atrophy of the small muscles of the hands from anterior horn cell involvement, simulating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; (5) involvement of the lateral coicospinal tract with upper motor neuron findings; (6) Horner's syndrome, consisting of pupillary constriction, lid lag, and anhidrosis; (7) and associations with Arnold-Chiari malformation and Dandy-Walker cysts. Regarding the other choices: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis involves motor neurons producing upper and lower motor neuron disease. Sensory findings are not present.

In very simple words ""we observe a difference when it is not true"" false positive. o One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. o Probability of type-I error is given by '13-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). o Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. o Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. o If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . o Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or error or false negative. o This type of error accept/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false -->False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one --4 False negative. o An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",A
"Human milk as compared to cow's milk is: March 2011,March 2013 (b)",Rich in lactose,Rich in Vitamin D,Rich in minerals,Rich in proteins,"Ans. A: Rich in lactose Lactose content of human milk is 7.4g/100 gm whereas that of cows milk is 4.4 g/100 grams Human milk The initial milk produced is often referred to as colostrum, which is high in the immunoglobulin IgA, which coats the gastrointestinal tract. This helps to protect the newborn until its own immune system is functioning properly, and creates a mild laxative effect, expelling meconium and helping to prevent the build up of bilirubin (a contributory factor in jaundice). During the first few days after delivery, the breasts produce colostrum. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at bih). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly. After 3 to 4 days, breasts will begin producing milk that is thin, watery, and sweet. This quenches the baby's thirst and provides the proteins, sugar, and minerals that the baby needs. Foremilk, the milk released at the beginning of a feed, is watery, low in fat, and high in carbohydrates relative to the creamier hindmilk, which is released as the feed progresses. The breast can never be truly ""emptied,"" since milk production is a continuous biological process. The level of Immunoglobilin A (IgA) in breast milk remains high from day 10 until at least 7.5 months post-paum. Human milk contains 1.1% protein, 3.4% fat, 7.4% carbohydrates, and 0.1% ash (minerals). Carbohydrates are mainly lactose. The fat fraction contains specific triglycerides of palmitic and oleic acid (0-P-0 triglycerides), and also quite a large quantity of lipids with trans bonds. They are vaccenic acid, and Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat. The principal proteins are casein (homologous to bovine beta-casein), alpha-lactalbumin, lactoferrin, IgA, lysozyme, and serum albumin. In an acidic environment such as the stomach, alpha-lactalbumin unfolds into a different form and binds oleic acid to form a complex called HAMLET. Non-protein nitrogen-containing compounds, making up 25% of the milk's nitrogen, include urea, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, amino acids, and nucleotides. It is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk. In addition to the appropriate amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, breast milk provides vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, and hormones - all of the things that a growing infant will require. Breast milk also contains antibodies and lymphocytes from the mother that help the baby resist infections. The immune function of breast milk is individualized, as the mother, through her touching and taking care of the baby, comes into contact with pathogens that colonize the baby, and, as a consequence, her body makes the appropriate antibodies and immune cells. This is the reason why breast milk contains very little iron, as iron is an essential precursor to the activation of micro bacteria and gut flora; providing iron in the milk would lead to infection. However, the internal iron supplies of the infant, held in the hepatic cells of the liver, are exhausted at 4-6 months, hence this is the time that complimentary feeding is introduced, as to prevent anemia (recommended by WHO). Whole cow's milk It does not contain sufficient vitamin E, iron, or essential fatty acids, which can make infants fed on cow's milk anemic. Whole cow's milk also contains excessive amounts of protein (3.2 g/ 100 gram), sodium, and potassium, which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys. In addition, the proteins and fats in whole cow's milk are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. A significant minority of infants are allergic to one or more of the constituents of cow's milk, most often the cow's milk proteins. These problems can also affect infant formulas derived from cow's milk.",A

Clinical features and investigations After an incubation period of 1-3 weeks, there is diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weakness, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, there may be abdominal distension and tenderness. Chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption may occur, with bulky stools that float. Stools obtained at 2-3-day intervals should be examined for cysts. Duodenal or jejunal aspiration by endoscopy gives a higher diagnostic yield. The 'string test' may be used, in which one end of a piece of string is passed into the duodenum by swallowing and retrieved after an overnight fast; expressed fluid is then examined for the presence of G. lamblia trophozoites.

Pathophysiology Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro- oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Abnormalities of the lower oesophageal sphincter The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing (p. 766). Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time.

Study done on a group of patients showed coefficient of variance for BP and serum creatinine to be 20%& 15% respectively. Inference is that -,Variation in BP is more than in serum creatinine,Variation in serum creatinine is more than in BP,Standard deviation of BP is more than of creatinine,Standard deviation of creatinine is more than of BP,"Coefficient of variance

Coefficient of variance indicates how large standard deviation is relative to mean, i.e. Coefficient of variance is a relative comparison of a standard deviation to its mean. It is expressed as percentage.

CV = Standard deviation / mean x 100


For example, if the standard deviation of a sample is 8 and the sample mean is 44. The CV will be 18.2% . That means the standard deviation is 18.2% of the value of mean.

Significance of coefficient of variance

CV is a measure used to Compare relative variability when the mean is different in sample to be compared or in character (variables) to be compared —


CV compares variability of two different characteristics (e.g., BP, Serum creatinine, height, weight etc.) in the same group of subjects. In this situation mean BP of the sample will have different value (e.g., 120) and mean creatinine level will have different value (e.g., 0.8) in the same group (sample).
CV can compare variability of the same character in two or more different groups (samples). For example taking the height in a group from India and in other group from USA. Both the samples will have different mean height.


In these situations, when the mean is different for characteristics to be compared, CV is used to compare the relative variability.
Taking the example of given question :
CV for BP in a group is 20%.
CV for serum creatinine in the same group is 15%.
That means for BP, standard deviation is 20% of the mean; and for creatinine, standard deviation is 15% of the mean.
It has already been explained that standard deviation is measure of variation (deviation). Therefore, in the given question variability is more in BP than in serum creatinine value.
So, Coefficient of variance is used to compare variability of two different characteristic in same group or to compare variability of the same character in different groups (as the mean is different in both these situations).
Since coefficient of variance is a ratio, it has no units of measurement (dimensionless). It can be used to compare variability irrespective of the units of measurement used in two or more different group.
For example
It can compare variability if height measures as cm in one group & inches in another group.

About option 'c & d'


We cannot comment on standard deviation by knowing just only the coefficient of variance because we don’t know the mean BP and mean creatinine level of the sample group → In three related variables (Here CV, SD & mean) you must know the value of two variables to comment on value of the third one.
However, in this question we can say that the standard deviation relative to mean is large for BP than for serum creatinine.
So, we cannot comment on absolute value of standard deviation (whether SD of BP is more or SD of creatinine is more), But we can comment on standard deviation relative to mean.",A

Which of the following agents is the drug of choice for Central Diabetes Insipidus -,Desmopressin,Demeclocycline,Thiazide Diuretics,Lithium,"A primary deficiency of AVP(vasopressin) secretion usually results from agenesis or irreversible destruction of the neurohypophysis. It is referred to variously as neurohypophyseal DI, neurogenic DI, pituitary DI, cranial DI, or central DI. The signs and symptoms of uncomplicated central DI can be eliminated by treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of AVP. DDAVP acts selectively at V2 receptors to increase urine concentration and decrease urine flow in a dose-dependent manner. It is also more resistant to degradation than is AVP and has a three to fourfold longer duration of action. DDAVP can be given by IV or SC injection, nasal inhalation, or orally by means of a tablet of melt.

Treatment of acute cardiac tamponade is,Emergency paracentesis,Emergency thoracotomy,Pericardiactomy,IV fluids,"Initial management in hospital is by pericardiocentesis. This involves the inseion of a needle through the skin and into the pericardium and aspirating fluid under ultrasound guidance preferably. This can be done laterally through the intercostal spaces, usually the fifth, or as a subxiphoid approach.A left parasternal approach begins 3 to 5 cm left of the sternum to avoid the left internal mammary aery, in the 5th intercostal space. Often, a cannula is left in place during resuscitation following initial drainage so that the procedure can be performed again if the need arises. If facilities are available, an emergency pericardial window may be performed instead] during which the pericardium is cut open to allow fluid to drain. Following stabilization of the person, surgery is provided to seal the source of the bleed and mend the pericardium. In people following hea surgery the nurses monitor the amount of chest tube drainage. If the drainage volume drops off, and the blood pressure goes down, this can suggest tamponade due to chest tube clogging. In that case, the person is taken back to the operating room for an emergency reoperation. If aggressive treatment is offered immediately and no complications arise (shock, AMI or arrhythmia, hea failure, aneurysm, carditis, embolism, or rupture), or they are dealt with quickly and fully contained, then adequate survival is still a distinct possibility.

Therapeutic aboion was accepted by -,Declaration of Geneva (1948,Declaration of Oslo (1970),Declaration of Helsinki,Declaration of Tokyo,"Therapeutic aboion In 1970 the World Medical Association drew up a Statement on Therapeutic Aboion. This code, known as the Declaration of Oslo, was amended by the 35th World Medical Assembly, Venice, Italy in October 1983 and states: The first moral principle imposed upon the physician is respect of human life from its beginning. Circumstances which bring the vital interests of a mother into conflict with the vital interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated. Diversity of response to this situation results from the diversity of attitudes towards the life of the unborn child. This is a matter of individual conviction and conscience which must be respected. It is not the role of the medical profession to determine the attitudes and rules of any paicular state or community in this matter, but it is our duty to attempt both to ensure the protection of our patients and to safeguard the rights of the physician within society. Therefore, where the law allows therapeutic aboion to be performed, the procedure should be performed by a physician competent to do so in premises approved by the appropriate authority. If the physician considers that his convictions do not allow him to advise or perform an aboion, he may withdraw while ensuring the continuity of (medical) care by a competent colleague. This statement, while it is endorsed by the General Assembly of the World Medical Association, is not to be regarded as binding on any individual member association unless it is adopted by that member association.

Carcinoid syndrome produces valvular disease primarily of the,Venous valves,Tricuspid valve,Mitral valve,Aoic valve,"Answer is B (Tricuspid valve); The most common site of involvement is the - Ventricular surface of Tricuspid valve. 'Cardiac manifestations in carcinoid syndrome are due to fibrosis involving the endocardium, primarily on the right side although left side lesions also occur. Dense fibrous deposits are most commonly on the ventricular aspect of the tricuspid valve and less commonly on the pulmonary valve cusps.'

Therapeutic hypothermia is useful in preventing neurological complication in,Sepsis,Poly trauma,Cardiac arrest,Ischemic stroke,"Therapeutic hypothermia (also called targeted temperature management) refers to deliberate reduction of the core body temperature, typically to a range of about 32deg to 34deg C (89.6deg to 93.2deg F) in patients who don't regain consciousness after return of spontaneous circulation following a cardiac arrest. Hypothermia also is used to treat newborns with perinatal asphyxia; however, this aicle focuses on its use in adults. Hypothermia counteracts neuroexcitation in brain cells by stabilizing calcium and glutamate release, reducing the degree of cell death. It also stabilizes the blood-brain barrier and suppresses the inflammatory process, reducing cerebral edema. Cerebral metabolism decreases 6% to 10% for every degree Celsius that body temperature drops. As cerebral metabolism declines, the brain needs less oxygen. In essence, hypothermia counteracts many of the destructive mechanisms of cardiac arrest. Its effects resemble those of cardiac defibrillation, which makes the hea stop and then reset itself to a normal rhythm. Similarly, hypothermia halts destructive brain mechanisms and lets the brain reset itself to normal functioning. Therapeutic hypothermia occurs in three phases--induction, maintenance, and rewarming. Clinicians must control hypothermia and rewarming to prevent potential adverse effects, such as arrhythmias and skin breakdown during the cold phases (induction and maintenance) and rapid electrolyte shifts during the rewarming phase. Temperature should be monitored with a method that measures core temperature, such as use of an esophageal, bladder, or pulmonary aery catheter. REF - pubmed.com , medlineplus.com",C

"Amount of free residual chlorine in drinking water: September 2007, March 2010",0.1 mg/L,0.5 mg/L,1.0 mg/L,1.5 mg/L,"Ans. B: 0.5 mg/L Chlorine readily combines with chemicals dissolved in water, microorganisms, small animals, plant material, tastes, odors, and colors. These components ""use up"" chlorine and comprise the chlorine demand of the treatment system. It is impoant to add sufficient chlorine to the water to meet the chlorine demand and provide residual disinfection. The contact (retention) time in chlorination is that period between introduction of the disinfectant and when the water is used. A long interaction between chlorine and the microorganisms results in an effective disinfection process. Contact time varies with chlorine concentration, the type of pathogens present, pH, and temperature of the water. The chlorine that does not combine with other components in the water is free (residual) chlorine, and the breakpoint is the point at which free chlorine is available for continuous disinfection. An ideal system supplies free chlorine at a concentration of 0.5 mg/1.",B

Which of the following is not a feature of Syndenham's chorea?,Hypotonia,Unintelligible speech,Emotional lability,Seizures,"Sydenham chorea (SC) is a neurological disorder of childhood resulting from infection Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the bacterium that causes rheumatic fever. SC is characterized by rapid, irregular, and aimless involuntary movements of the arms and legs, trunk, and facial muscles. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset (sometimes within a few hours) of neurologic symptoms, classically chorea, usually affecting all four limbs. Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, dysahria, gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, headache, slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and hypotonia. Also, there may be tongue fasciculations (""bag of worms"") and a ""milk sign"", which is a relapsing grip demonstrated by alternate increases and decreases in tension, as if hand milking. Non-neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever are carditis, ahritis, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. The PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) syndrome is similar, but is not characterized by Sydenham's motor dysfunction. PANDAS presents with tics and/or a psychological component (e.g., OCD) and occurs much earlier, days to weeks after GABHS infection rather than 6-9 months later. It may be confused with other conditions such as lupus and Tourette syndrome. Movements cease during sleep, and the disease usually resolves after several months. Unlike in Huntington's disease, which is generally of adult onset and associated with an unremitting autosomal dominant movement disorder and dementia, neuroimaging in Sydenham's chorea is normal and other family members are unaffected. Other disorders that may be accompanied by chorea include abetalipoproteinemia, ataxia-telangiectasia, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease, Fahr disease, familial dyskinesia-facial myokymia (Bird-Raskind syndrome) due to an ADCY5 gene mutation, glutaric aciduria, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, Wilson disease, hypehyroidism, lupus erythematosus, pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), and side effects of ceain anticonvulsants or psychotropic agent Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 1025",D

They are 2nd generation IUDs. THIRD GENERATION IUDs A third generation of IUDs *based on still another principle, i.e., release of a hormone have become available on a limited scale. The most widely used hormonal device is progestase, which is a T -shaped device filled with 38 mg of progesterone, the natural hormone. The hormone is released slowly in the uterus at the rate of 65 mcg daily. It has a direct local effect on the uterine lining, on the cerl mucus and possibly on the sperms. Because the hormone supply is gradually depleted, regular replacement of the device is necessary. Another hormonal device LNG-20 (Mirena) is a T-shaped IUD releasing 20 mcg of levonorgestrel (a potent synthetic steroid); it has a low pregnancy rate (0.2 per 100 women) and less number of ectopic pregnancies. Long-term clinical experience with levonorgestrel releasing IUD has shown to be associated with lower menstrual blood loss and fewer days of bleeding than the copper devices. The levonorgestrel releasing IUD has an effective life of 10 years . The hormonal devices would be paicularly valuable for women in developing countries in whom excess blood loss caused by ine devices have been shown to result in significant anaemia.

LVH is commonly seen with :,Pure mitral stenosis,ASD with fossa-ovalis,Aoic incompetance,Carcinoid syndrome,"Answer is C (Aoic incompetance) 195.Aoic regurgitation is associated with LV dilatation, LV hyperophy and LVfitilure AR The total volume ejected by the ventricle (forward stroke + volume of blood that regurgitates back into L.V.) is increased in A.R. Also, here, the entire L.V. stoke volume is ejected into a high pressure zone, the Aoa. This leads to dilatation of LV, followed by deterioration of LV function i.e. LVF; Considerable thickening of LV wall (LV hyperophy) also occurs with chronic AR. - Harrison 14th / 1321 M.S.

Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a diverse group of disorders with many subtypes categorized by disease gene and inheritance. LGMD usually manifests in the proximal muscles around the hips and shoulders. (The proximal muscles are those closest to the center of the body; distal muscles are faher away from the center -- for example, in the hands and feet). The shoulder girdle is the bony structure that surrounds the shoulder area, and the pelvic girdle is the bony structure surrounding the hips. Collectively, these are called the limb girdles, and it is the observed weakness and atrophy (wasting) of the muscles connected to the limb girdles that has given this group of disorders its name. Weakness in the shoulder area may make reaching over the head, holding the arms outstretched, or carrying heavy objects difficult. It may become increasingly hard to keep the arms above the head for such activities as combing one's hair or arranging things on a high shelf. Some people find it harder to type on a computer or other keyboard and may even have trouble feeding themselves. Some of the LGMD subtypes also are characterized by additional symptoms. For example, the hea can be affected in some types of LGMD, with weakness of the hea muscle (cardiomyopathy) and/or abnormal transmission of signals that regulate the heabeat (conduction abnormalities or arrhythmias). Some disease subtypes also involve the muscles used for breathing, and for that reason, respiratory function, along with cardiac function, should be monitored regularly.

All these features assist in distinguishing clinical syndromes within the category of aspiration pneumonia.o The three syndromes that are most frequently seen clinically and best studied are -# Chemical pneumonitis,# Bacterial infection, and# Airway obstruction.Chemical pneumonitiso The term chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of substances that are toxic to the lower airways, independent of bacterial infection.o The prototype and best studied clinical example is chemical pneumonitis associated with the aspiration of gastric acid first described by Mendelson and sometimes referred to as Mendelson's syndrome.The production of chemical pneumonitiso Require an inoculum that has a pH of < 2-5 and that is relatively large (usually I to 4 mL/kg).o This would translate to an inoculum of at least 25 mL of gastric acid in adult humans. It is probable that smaller volumes produce a more subtle process that either escapes clinical detection or causes a less fulminant form of pneumonitis.o The clinical observation that patients with esophageal or gastric reflux experience frequent bouts of recurrent pneumonitis, often accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis, supports this concept.Clinical featureso The following clinical features should raise the possibility of chemical pneumonitis# Abrupt onset of symptoms with prominent dyspnea# Fever, which is usually low grade# Cyanosis and diffuse crackles on lung auscultation# Severe hypoxemia and infiltrates on chest imaging involving dependent pulmonary segments. The dependent lobes in the upright position are the lower lobes. However, aspiration that occurs while patients are in the recumbent position may result in infection in the superior segments of the lower lobes and the posterior segments of the upper lobes.",A

You are asked to assume care of this patient. What is the best next step in management?",Arrange for emergent cardiac catheterization,Begin intravenous thrombolytic therapy,Admit the patient to a monitored cardiac bed and repeat cardiac enzymes and ECG in 6 hours,Begin intravenous beta-blocker therapy,"The patient's history suggests acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The combination of elevated troponin and lack of ST segment elevation on ECG is most consistent with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Initial therapy for acute coronary syndrome includes aspirin, nitroglycerin, anticoagulation, and morphine. An intravenous beta-blocker, such as metoprolol, is frequently given in the immediate management of ACS to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, limit infarct size, reduce pain, and decrease the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Elevated blood pressure also increases myocardial oxygen demand. Given this patient's increased blood pressure and continued pain, administration of a beta-blocker is the appropriate next step in his management. Administration of intravenous morphine would also be appropriate.Cardiac catheterization may well be necessary at some point during his evaluation, but there is no mortality benefit for emergent catheterization in NSTEMI. There is no role for thrombolytic therapy in patients with ACS without ST segment elevation. All patients with ACS should be admitted to a monitored cardiac unit with serial cardiac biomarkers to estimate the extent of cardiac damage, but the patient's continued pain demands urgent treatment, not just further observation. Clopidogrel therapy is indicated for patients with ACS who will not be undergoing immediate coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Clopidogrel therapy, however, will not improve this patient's elevated blood pressure nor promptly decrease myocardial oxygen demand. The correct dose of clopidogrel is a loading dose of 300 to 600 mg, then 75 mg po daily.",D

"Size range of dust, which is regarded as health hazard: September 2011",0.1 to 0.3 microns,0.3 to 0.5 microns,0.5 to 3 microns,3 to 5 microns,"Ans. C: 0.5 to 3 microns Dust paicle within the range of 0.5-3 micron, is a health hazard producing, after a variable exposure, a lung disease known as pneumoconiosis Common Occupational Lung Diseases Asbestosis, caused by exposure to asbestos paicles. Often found among people who worked in shipyards, asbestos mines, and factories that refined or used asbestos to manufacture products. Black lung (Coalworker's pneumoconiosis) which affects coal workers Chronic Beryllium disease (CBD), which affects workers in a variety of metallurgical occupations Byssinosis (brown lung disease), often occurs in cotton and textile workers when bacteria released from cotton or other materials is inhaled and grows with the lungs. This is often associated with poor ventilation systems. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, this can affect people who work in office buildings whose air-conditioning systems are contaminated by ceain fungi and bacteria. Occupational asthma, can affect people who work with a variety of materials. This includes animals (dander), carbamates (urethanes), dyes, epoxy resins and enzymes used in detergent, leather goods, latex, and automotive paints Silicosis often developed by people who worked with clay, sand and stone dust including miners, stone cutters and sandblasters. How Diseases Develop Pneumoconiosis is the classification of diseases that develop as the result of occupational exposure to dust. Occupational lung diseases develop based on the size and type of paicles inhaled and where the inhaled paicle end up. Larger paicles are more likely to get stuck in the nose and larger airways but smaller paicles can reach the alveoli where they can potentially be absorbed into the bloodstream. When inhaled paicles come in contact with the wall of the airway they do not become airborne again. This is called deposition and can occur in one of four ways: - Sedimentation: When gravity causes paicles to settle, tends to occur in larger airways. - Ineial impaction: Often occurs in the nose and larger airways, it happens when an airway changes direction - Interception: This form of deposition occurs with fibrous dust paicles (including asbestos fibers) or any other irregular shaped paicles. Due to their shape they often avoid deposition by sedimentation or ineial impaction but are deposited in the walls of the bronchioles which are lined with epithelial cells. - Diffusion: Behavior of small aerosol paicles which encounter and are affected by molecules of air. During regular breathing (at rest) about 10% of compact paicles of 0.5 to 1 micron diameter are deposited in the alveoli with the vast majority being exhaled.",C

"Variables in form of mild, moderate and severe is given.Method used to analyse is:",Nominal,Ordinal,Interval,Variance,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Ordinal This is one of the important question and one of the easiest too. (only if you know how to solve if).There are four scales of measurement:NominalOrdinalIntervalRatioNOMINAL;Nominal scale is used where data is divided into qualitative categories or group such as male/female, black/white, urban/suburban/rural.There is no implication of order or ratio.ORDINAL :Ordinal scale is used where the data can be placed in a meaningful order (eg. Students may be ranked 1st, 2nd & 3rd in their class).However there is no information about the size of the interval-no conclusion can be drawn about whether the difference between the first and second student is same as the difference between the second and third.Variables in the form of mild, moderate and severe are analysed by ordinal scale as they can be arranged in a meaningful order but there is no information about the size of the interval between them.INTERVAL:Interval scale data have the same quality as do ordinal data, in that they can be placed in a meaningful order. In addition these data have meaningful intervals between items which are usually measured quantities.for e.g. on the Celsius scale the difference between 100 degree and 90 degree is the same as the difference between 50 degree and 40 degree. However because interval scales do not have absolute 0, ratios of scores are not meaningful; i.e. 100 degree C is not twice as hot as 50 degree C because 0 degree C does not indicate the complete absence of heat.RATIO:A ratio scale has the same properties as an interval scale; but because it has an absolute zero, meaningful ratios do exist.e.g Weight in grams or pounds, time in seconds or days, B.P in millimeters of mercury and pulse rate are all ratio scale data.The only ratio scale of temperature is the Kelvin scale in which zero degrees indicate an absolute absence of heat, just as zero pulse rate indicate an absolute lack of pulse. Therefore, it is correct to say that a pulse rate of 120 is twice as fast as pulse rate of 60.",B

Most important vectors are mosquitos and ticks.These viruses are maintained in nature principally, or to an important extent through biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropods; they multiply in the tissues of arthropods, and are passed on to new vertebrates by the bites of arthropod after a period of incubation.Although arboviruses are many, only a small number of them are known to be capable of producing disease. A high proportion of the infection is inapparent. Three clinical syndromes have been described:Febrile illness- Chikungunya, DengueHaemorrhagic fever- Dengue, Chikungunya, KFDEncephalitis- Japanese encephalitisChikungunya virus is transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquito (commonly Aedes aegypti).

D: Urinary incontinence The MCA is by far the largest cerebral aery and is the vessel most commonly affected by cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The MCA supplies most of the outer convex brain surface, nearly all the basal ganglia, and the posterior and anterior internal capsules. Patients with middle cerebral aery stroke syndrome (MCA stroke syndrome) may have some basic physical findings, as follows: Main trunk occlusion of either side yields contralateral hemiplegia, eye detion toward the side of the MCA infarct, contralateral hemianopia, and contralateral hemianesthesia. Trunk occlusion involving the dominant hemisphere causes global aphasia, whereas involvement of the nondominant hemisphere causes impaired perception of deficits (anosognosia) resulting from the stroke and more qualitative deficits of speech. Superior division infarcts lead to contralateral deficits with significant involvement of the upper extremity and face and paial sparing of the contralateral leg and foot. Inferior division infarcts of the dominant hemisphere lead to Wernicke's aphasia. Such infarcts on either side yield a superior quadrantanopsia or homonymous hemianopia, depending on the extent of infarction. Right inferior branch infarcts also may lead to a left visual neglect. Finally, resultant temporal lobe damage can lead to an agitated and confused state Dysahria is common because of facial weakness.",D

A 30 year old patient with H/O antibodies to HCV for 6 months duration and his AST/ALT is normal. There is no symptom or stigmata of liver disease. The most appropriate approach:,Reassure the patient,Repeat titre every three years,Repeat enzymes every year,Do liver biopsy & sta antiviral drugs accordingly.,"Answer is D (Do liver biopsy and sta antiviral treatment accordingly): Antibodies against HCV (anti- HCV) in the blood indicate infection with the HCV. Persistance of antibodies fir 6 months suggests a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. Patients with chronic hepatitis C, even with normal ALT levels are candidates for Liver biopsy to establish a histo-pathological diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. Patients with at least moderate grade and stage are candidates for antiviral therapy with PEG IFN and ribararin regardless of the ALT levels 'Although patients with persistantly normal ALT levels tend not to progress histologically, they respond to antiviral therapy just as well as do patients with elevated ALT levels. Such patients are potential candidates for antiviral therapy' Chronic hepatitis : 'Evidence Based medicine Guidelines' Increased serum ALT 6 months after the onset of symptoms: (normal ALT does not, however, rule out chronic hepatitis). A patient with a positive HCV-PCR-test and permanently elevated ALT most probably has a mild chronic hepatitis and treatment decisions can be made without liver biopsy in genotypes 2 and 3. Liver biopsy is indicated in a patient with positive HCV-PCR- test and normal ALT, and with genotypes 1 and 4 before considering therapy. Signs of chronic hepatitis in the biopsy are an indication for treatment. Information on the genotype of the virus is impoant to guide treatment decisions. Treatment is more effective for genotypes 2 or 3 than for genotypes 1 and 4. Treatment with a combination of interferon alpha or pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin is used for 48 weeks for genotypes 1 and 4 and for 24 weeks for genotypes 2 and 3.

The metered-dose inhaler remains the most widely prescribed . For patients with mild intermittent asthma (symptoms less than once a week for 3 months and fewer than two nocturnal episodes per month), it is usually sufficient to prescribe an inhaled sho-acting b2-agonist, such as salbutamol or terbutaline, to be used as required. However, many patients (and their physicians) under-estimate the severity of asthma. A history of a severe exacerbation should lead to a step-up in treatment. (BUD), fluticasone, mometasone or ciclesonide) should be staed in addition to inhaled b2-agonists taken on an as-required basis for any patient who: * has experienced an exacerbation of asthma in the last 2 years * uses inhaled b2-agonists three times a week or more * repos symptoms three times a week or more * is awakened by asthma one night per week. For adults, a reasonable staing dose is 400 ug beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) or equivalent per day in adults, although higher doses may be required in smokers. Alternative but much less effective preventive agents include chromones, leukotriene receptor antagonists and theophyllines.

Apnea- hypopnea index > ______ is used for diagnosis of OSAHS in absence of symptoms?,5 episodes/ hr,10 episodes/ hr,15 episodes/ hr,20 episodes/ hr,"OSAHS is defined on the basis of nocturnal and daytime symptoms as well as sleep study findings. Diagnosis requires the patient to have (1) either symptoms of nocturnal breathing disturbances (snoring, snoing, gasping, or breathing pauses during sleep) or daytime sleepiness or fatigue that occurs despite sufficient oppounities to sleep and is unexplained by other medical problems; and (2) five or more episodes of obstructive apnea or hypopnea per hour of sleep (the apnea-hypopnea index , calculated as the number of episodes divided by the number of hours of sleep) documented during a sleep study. OSAHS also may be diagnosed in the absence of symptoms if the AHI is >15 episodes/h. Each episode of apnea or hypopnea represents a reduction in breathing for at least 10 s and commonly results in a >=3% drop inoxygensaturation and/or a brain coical arousal. OSAHS severity is based on the frequency of breathing disturbances (AHI), the amount of oxyhemoglobin desaturation with respiratory events, the duration of apneas and hypopneas, the degree of sleep fragmentation, and the level of daytime sleepiness or functional impairment.

"When orthotoludine reagent is added to water, and if free chlorine is present, what colour will be produced?",Pink,Yellow,Green,Red,"Ans. B. Yellow. (Ref. Park's 22nd/pg. 664; style=""font-size: 1.04761904761905em; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif"">)Discussion:OT test enables both free and combined chlorine in water. Add 0.1ml of reagent to 1 ml of water. Yellow colour produced is matched against suitable standard colour.Modification is Orthotoludine Arsinite (OTA) test - to determine the free and combined chlorine separately. Also errors caused by the presence of interfering substances like nitrites, iron, manganese which also produce yellow colour to OT is overcome by OTA test.CHLORINATION# Chlorine kills pathogenic bacteria but it has no effect on spores and certain viruses (e.g., polio, viral hepatitis, protozoal cyst, helementhic).# The disinfecting action of chlorine is mainly due to hypochlorus acid.0# Chlorine acts best as a disinfectant when pH of water is around 7, because of the predominance of hypochlorus acid.# When pH value exceeds 8.5, it is unreliable as a disinfectant because about 90% of the hypochlorous acid gets ionized.# One tablet of chlorine, chlorinates 20 litres of water.0# Principles of chlorination- Water should be clear and free from turbidity because turbidity impedes efficient chlorination.- The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. If further chlorine is added to the water beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in the water.- The pesence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is essential to kill bacteria and viruses; the chlorine has no effect on spores, protozoal cysts and helminthic ovas.- The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5 mg/L for one hour. The point at which the residual chlorine appears and all combined chlorines have been completely destroyed is the breakpoint and corresponding dosage is the break-point dosage. Presence of free residual chlorine for contact period of at least 1 hour.Orthotolidine Test# The yellow colour is produced by both free and combined chlorine residuals. The test is carried out by adding 0.1 mL of the reagent to 1 mL of water. The colour produced after 15-20 minutes is due to the action of both free and combined chlorine.# In this test, 10 ml of chlorinated sample of water is taken after the required contact period, in a glass tube. To this 0.1 mL of orthotolidine solution is added. The colour formed is observed after 5 minutes.# The formation of yellow colour normally indicates the presence of chlorine (either combined or free) in the water.# The more yellow the colour, the greater, is the chlorine residual.# The amount of residual chlorine can be ascertained by comparing the colour developed in the glass tube with the standard colours already kept in the laboratory.# This test, is therefore, very simple and does not require much technique or time. Under normal conditions, a lemon yellow colour is satisfactory for public water supply.# The orthotolidine test will normally give the total residual chlorine present in water. However, it may be adjusted so as to give separately the quantities of free residual as well as combined residual of chlorine.# The free residual chlorine forms the yellow colour during the first 5 seconds of the addition of orthotolidine, while the combined residual chlorine goes on forming the colour for about 5 minutes. Hence, the colour after 5 seconds will give the quantity of free residual chlorine, and the colour after 5 minutes will give the free and combined chlorine. The difference in value between the two values is the combined chlorine.# The orthotolidine test, however, is not accurate, because the impurities such as iron, manganese, nitrate etc., are likely to cause a false yellow colour, and indicating wrong and increased chlorine residual. To overcome this problem Orthotolidine - Arsenite (OT A) test is carried out.Now the different chlorine residuals can be easily determined as follows:# Free residual chlorine = (X2) - (XI)# Combine residual chlorine = (X3) - (X2)# In the orthotolidine test as well as in the OT A test, the temperature of water is to be controlled to room temperature.",B

Taking off ones clothes and running naked in a public race is called ?,Mooning,Exhibitionism,Voveyrism,Undinism,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Exhibitionism Incent means sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is closely related to him by blood. eg a daughter, granddaughter. Sexual perversions -These are persistently indulged sexual acts in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. These include :? a) Sadism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased from acts of physical cruelty or infliction of pain on one's paner. It is seen more commonly in men. To obtain sexual gratification, the sadist may bite, beat, whip, produce cuts on the victim, etc. b) Lust murder : In extremes of sadism, murder serves as a stimulus for the sexual act and becomes the equivalent of coitus, the act being accompanied by erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. c) Necrophagia : (Necros =corpse; phagia = to eat) : This is extreme degree of sadism in which the person after mutilating the body, sucks or licks the wounds, bites the skin, drinks blood, and eats the flesh of his victim to derive sexual pleasure. d) Masochism : Sexual gratification is obtained or increased by the suffering of pain. Masochists get pleasure from being beaten, abused, toured, humiliated, enslaved, degraded, or dominated by their sexual paner. e) Necrophilia : In this condition, there is a desire for sexual intercourse with dead bodies. It is said to have sadomasochistic foundation and that decomposition, foul smell and coldness act as stimulants. f) Fetishism : A fetish is an abnormal stimulus or object of sexual desire. Fetishism means the use of such objects of sexual gratification leading to orgasm. eg underclothing, brassiere, petticoat, stocking, shoes, etc. g) Transvestism = Fonism: A transvestite (trans = opposite, vista = clothing) is a person whose whole personality is dominated by the desire of being identified with the opposite sex. His dress, manner, occupational interest, and associations are all designed to increase his feeling of being a woman. There is no hormonal disturbance or genital abnormality. h) Masturbation = Onanism = Ipsation is the deliberate self-stimulation that effects sexual arousal. In males, it is done by moving the penis against a bed or other object. In females, finges are gently and rhythmically moved over clitoris or labia minora or steady pressure is applied over these pas with several fingers or whole hands (it is an offence when done in public). i) Exhibitionism (Sec 294 IPC): It is a willful and intentional exposure of the genitalia in a public place while in the presence of others to obtain sexual pleasure. May or may not be associated with masturbation (punishment = 3 months + fine). j) Voyeurism = Scoptophilia = Peeping tom : Sexual gratification is obtained by looking at the sexual organs of other persons, watching the act of sexual intercourse, or witnessing undressing by a woman. k) Frotteurism : Sexual satisfaction is obtained by rubbing against persons in crowd. If they attempt intercourse, they have a premature ejaculation or they are impotent. It is an uncommon perversion and rarely occurs alone. l) Undinism : In this, the sexual pleasure is often obtained by witnessing the act of urination by someone of the same or opposite sex. m) Indecent assault (Sec 354 IPC) is any offence committed on a female with the intention or knowledge to outrage her modesty. Usually, the act involves the sexual pa of either or is sexually ored. In such assaults, a man may try to kiss a woman, press or fondle with her breasts, touch or expose the genitalia or thighs, try to put a finger in her vagina, play with vulva. A medical practitioner can be accused of indecent assault if he examines a female patient by stripping her clothes without her consent or even with her consent in the absence of a female attendant. Such assaults are punishable under Sec 354 IPC, upto 2 years imprisonment and/or fine. n) Uranism : General term for perversion of the sexual instinct. o) Satyriasis : Incessant sexual desire. p) Priapism : Painful penile erection in absence of sexual desire.",B

Cirrhosis of liver with poal hypeension is a complication of all of the foUowing e\cept-(,Wilson's disease,Hemochromatosis,Gilbe's syndrome,Hepatitis C,"Gilbe's syndrome Gilbe's syndrome is by far the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism (see Box 22.17, p. 860). It is an autosomal recessive trait when caused by a mutation in the promoter region of the gene for UDP-glucuronyl transferase enzyme (UGT1A1), which leads to reduced enzyme expression. It can be inherited in a dominant fashion when there is a missense mutation in the gene. This results in decreased conjugation of bilirubin, which accumulates as unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. The levels of unconjugated bilirubin increase during fasting, as fasting reduces levels of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Clinical features The typical presentation is with isolated elevation of bilirubin, typically, although not exclusively, in the setting of physical stress or illness. There are no stigmata of chronic liver disease other than jaundice. Increased excretion of bilirubin and hence stercobilinogen leads to normal-coloured or dark stools, and increased urobilinogen excretion causes the urine to turn dark on standing as urobilin is formed. In the presence of haemolysis, pallor due to anaemia and splenomegaly due to excessive reticulo-endothelial activity are usually present. Investigations The plasma bilirubin is usually less than 100 umol/L (~6 mg/ dL) and the LFTs are otherwise normal. There is no bilirubinuria because the hyperbilirubinaemia is predominantly unconjugated. Hepatic histology is normal and liver biopsy is not recommended for the investigation of patients with possible Gilbe's syndrome. The condition is not associated with liver injury and thus has an excellent prognosis, needs no treatment, and is clinically impoant only because it may be mistaken for more serious liver disease Ref Davidson edition23rd pg ,807",C
Prolonging a person's life through technological means is known as,Dysthanasia,Novus actus interveniens,Euthanasia,Orthotanasia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Dysthanasia * In medicine, dysthanasia means ""bad death"" and is considered a common fault of modern medicine: Dysthanasia occurs when a person who is dying has their biological life extended through technological means without regard to the person's quality of life.* Dysthanasia is the term for futile or useless treatment, which does not benefit a terminal patient. It is a process through which one merely extends the dying process and not life per se. Consequently, patients have a prolonged and slow death, frequently accompanied by suffering, pain and anguish. When one invests in healing a patient who has no chance of cure, s/he is actually undermining the person's dignity. Advanced measures and their limits should be assessed to benefit the patient and not to hold science as an end in itself.* Euthanasia is currently conceptualized as an action that aims to end the life of a human being taking into account humanistic considerations in relation to the person or society; it is unethical and illegal in Brazil. Nurses should be aware of their ethical code, which clearly prohibits (article 29): ""Promoting euthanasia or participating in practice intended to facilitate a patient's death"".* Orthotanasia refers to the art of promoting a humane and correct death, not subjecting patients to misthanasia or dysthanasia and not abbreviating death either, that is, subjecting them to euthanasia.

Fluid containing which of the following substance is used in peritoneal dialysis,NaCl,Urea,Heparin,Dextrose,"In peritoneal dialysis, 1.5-3 L of a dextrose-containing solution is infused into the peritoneal cavity and allowed to dwell for a set period of time, usually 2-4 h. Peritoneal dialysis solutions are available in volumes typically ranging from 1.5 to 3 L. The major difference between the dialysate used for peritoneal rather than hemodialysis is that the hypeonicity of peritoneal dialysis solutions drives solute and fluid removal, whereas solute removal in hemodialysis depends on concentration gradients, and fluid removal requires transmembrane pressure. Typically, dextrose at varying concentrations contributes to the hypeonicity of peritoneal dialysate. Icodextrin is a nonabsorbable carbohydrate that can be used in place of dextrose. Studies have demonstrated more efficient ultrafiltration with icodextrin than with dextrose-containing solutions. Icodextrin is typically used as the ""last fill"" for patients on CCPD or for the longest dwell in patients on CAPD. The most common additives to peritoneal dialysis solutions are heparin to prevent obstruction of the dialysis catheter lumen with fibrin and antibiotics during an episode of acute peritonitis. Insulin may also be added in patients with diabetes mellitus ref - harrisons internal medicine 20e pg2124",D

Which laboratory determinations would be most helpful in distinguishing iron deficiency anemia from anemia of chronic disease?,Erythrocyte: granulocyte ratio in bone marrow,Presence or absence of polychromatophilic target cells,Presence or absence of stippled erythrocytes,Serum ferritin,"This is a common clinical scenario in real life. Serum ferritin is markedly decreased in iron deficiency anemia and is normal to modestly elevated in anemia of chronic disease. This difference makes this test very useful in this setting. You should be aware that serum ferritin may behave like an acute phase reactant. Therefore, in an acute inflammatory situation, erythrocyte ferritin may be more reliable if serum ferritin is equivocal. Also, do not forget that iron deficiency anemia can complicate the anemia of chronic disease (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding can complicate gastrointestinal cancers); in this situation, most physicians treat the apparent iron deficiency anemia and see to what degree the anemia corrects. The erythrocyte: granulocyte ratio in bone marrow is slightly decreased in both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, but may be markedly increased in sideroblastic anemias. Polychromatophilic target cells and stippled erythrocytes are absent in both iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease, but may be present in sideroblastic anemias and other iron-utilization anemias.

"Conduction velocity of nerve is reduced in all of the following conditions, except:",Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN),Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Neuropathy (AIDP),Hereditary Sensory Motor Neuropathy (HSMN),Multifocal Motor Neuropathy,"Answer is A (Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy Preserved conduction velocity (No/minimal reduction in conduction velocity) is a feature of Axonal neuropathies. Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN) is pure axonal neuropathy characterized by normal motor conduction velocity. Demyelinating neuropathies are typically associated with reduced conduction velocities. AIDP, HSMN and MMN are all demyelinating neuropathies characterized by reduced conduction velocity on nerve conduction studies. Demyelinating Versus Axonal Neuropathies The primary function of myelin is to increase axonal conduction velocity without a significant increase in axonal diameter. This function is achieved by a process of saltatory conduction, in which nerve impulses jump between electrically excitable regions of the axon, called nodes of Ranvier located between elctrically insulated areas ensheathed by myelinating Schwann cells. A demyelinating process disrupts the normal saltatory conduction along some axons within the nerve slowing the conduction velocity of these axons. As demyelination becomes more profound, conduction through some areas is blocked completely (conduction block), functionally disconnecting the motor neuron from the innervated muscle resulting in weakness. In axonal neuropathies the conduction velocity is typically either preserved or only midly reduced.

True about simple randomization is: March 2011,Every person has an equal chance of selection,Also known as systemic randomization,Less number of samples is obtained,Groups are not distributed,"Ans. A: Every person has an equal chance of selection In simple random sampling, every unit of population has equal chances of being selected Randomized controlled trial (RCT) It is a type of scientific experiment - a form of clinical trial - most commonly used in testing the safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy or effectiveness of healthcare services (such as medicine or nursing) or health technologies (such as pharmaceuticals, medical devices or surgery). The key distinguishing feature of the usual RCT is that study subjects, after assessment of eligibility and recruitment, but before the intervention to be studied begins, are randomly allocated to receive one or other of the alternative treatments under study. Random allocation in real trials is complex, but conceptually, the process is like tossing a coin. After randomization, the two (or more) groups of subjects are followed up in exactly the same way, and the only differences between the care they receive, for example, in terms of procedures, tests, outpatient visits, follow-up calls etc. should be those intrinsic to the treatments being compared. The most impoant advantage of proper randomization is that it minimizes allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments."" The advantages of proper randomization in RCTs include: ""It eliminates bias in treatment assignment,"" specifically selection bias and confounding. ""It facilitates blinding (masking) of the identity of treatments from investigators, paicipants, and assessors."" ""It permits the use of probability theory to express the likelihood that any difference in outcome between treatment groups merely indicates chance. There are two processes involved in randomizing patients to different interventions. First is choosing a randomization procedure to generate an unpredictable sequence of allocations; this may be a simple random assignment of patients to any of the groups at equal probabilities, may be ""restricted,"" or may be ""adaptive."" A second and more practical issue is allocation concealment, which refers to the stringent precautions taken to ensure that the group assignment of patients are not revealed prior to definitively allocating them to their respective groups. Non-random ""systematic"" methods of group assignment, such as alternating subjects between one group and the other, can cause ""limitless contamination possibilities"" and can cause a breach of allocation concealment. Randomization procedures An ideal randomization procedure would achieve the following goals: Equal group sizes for adequate statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses. Low selection bias. That is, the procedure should not allow an investigator to predict the next subject's group assignment by examining which group has been assigned the fewest subjects up to that point. Low probability of confounding (i.e., a low probability of ""accidental bias""), which implies a balance in covariates across groups. Simple randomization: This is a commonly used and intuitive procedure, similar to ""repeated fair coin-tossing."" Also known as ""complete"" or ""unrestricted"" randomization, it is robust against both selection and accidental biases. However, its main drawback is the possibility of imbalanced group sizes in small RCTs. It is therefore recommended only for RCTs with over 200 subjects.

Dementia in a patient with chronic renal failure with chronic hemodialysis is due to?,Aluminium toxicity,Uremia,Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy,A Beta-amyloid deposition,"Patients undergoing long-term dialysis acquire dialysis dementia. Dialysis dementia -leading cause is A-Beta 2 amyloid deposition. But it is not given in choices. A-Beta amyloid deposition is seen with Alzheimer's disease and hence is ruled out. Aluminium toxicity either from aluminum in the dialysate or consumption of aluminium containing drugs is linked to the pathogenesis of dialysis dementia. Dialysis dementia is a unique neurologic complication of renal failure associated with chronic dialysis. While many questions remain about the pathophysiology of the disease, aluminum toxicity is probably the major factor in the pathogenesis of the dementia. Reducing dialysate aluminum levels and minimizing oral aluminum intake has markedly decreased the incidence of the disease. Deferoxamine, a chelating agent, is effective if it is given early; however, chronic use may lead to serious complications, although they are rare.",A

'Teichopsia' is seen in,Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD),Migraine,Vitreous hemorrhage,Optic atrophy,"Ans. B. Migrane. (Ref Victor Adams Neurology, pg. 182-183.)Classic migraine is usually familial, involves a unilateral, throbbing head pain, and diminishes in fre- quency with age. The blind spot, or scotoma, that may develop as part of the aura of a classic migraine attack will involve the same visual field in both eyes. This defect usually changes over the course of minutes. It typically enlarges and may intrude on the central vision. The margin of the blind spot is often scintillating or dazzling. If this margin has a pattern like the battlement of a castle, it is called a fortification spectrum, or teichopsia. Homonymous hemianoptic defects of the sort that develop during the aura of a classic migraine indicate an irritative lesion that is affecting one part of the occipital cortex in one hemisphere of the brain. The changes in the scotoma over the course of minutes indicate that the irritative phenomenon sets off a cascade of events in the visual cortex that temporarily disturbs vision in a progressively larger area. Other focal neurologic phenomena may precede classic migraine; the most common are tingling of the face or hand, mild confusion, transient hemiparesis, and ataxia. Fatigue, irritability, and easy distractibility often develop before a migraine. Affected persons usually also have hypersensitivity to light and noise during an attack.",B

"A young, tall, thin male with arachnodactyly has ectopia lentis in both eyes. The most likely diagnosis is",Marfan's Syndrome,Marchesani's Syndrome,Homocystinuria,Ehler's Danlos syndrome,"Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissues,manifested principally by changes in the skeleton, eyes,and cardiovascular system. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 5000. Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial and transmitted by autosomal dominant inheri- tance. The remainder are sporadic and arise from new mutations. Pathogenesis. Marfan syndrome results from an inherited defect in an extracellular glycoprotein called fibrillin 1. There are two fundamental mechanisms by which loss of fibrillin leads to the clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome: loss of structural suppo in microfibril rich connective tissue and excessive activation of TGF-b signaling. Each of these is discussed below. * Fibrillin is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix . These fibrils provide a scaffolding on which tropoelastin is deposited to form elastic fibers. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin occurs in two homologous forms, fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, encoded by two separate genes, FBN1 and FBN2, mapped on chromo- somes 15q21.1 and 5q23.31, respectively. Mutations of FBN1 underlie Marfan syndrome; mutations of the related FBN2 gene are less common, and they give rise to congenital contractural arachnodactyly, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities. Mutational analysis has revealed more than 600 distinct mutations of the FBN1 gene in individuals with Marfan syndrome. Most of these are missense mutations that give rise to abnormal fibrillin-1. These can inhibit polymerization of fibrillin fibers (dominant negative effect). Alternatively, the reduction of fibrillin content below a ceain threshold weakens the connective tissue (haploinsufficiency). * While many clinical manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be explained by changes in the mechanical propeies of the extracellular matrix resulting from abnormalities of fibrillin, several others such as bone overgrowth and myxoid changes in mitral valves cannot be attributed to changes in tissue elasticity. Recent studies indicate that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), since normal microfibrils sequester TGF-b and thus control the bioavailability of this cytokine. Excessive TGF-b signaling has deleterious effects on vascular smooth muscle development and it also increases the activity of metalloproteases, causing loss of extracellular matrix. This schema is suppoed by two sets of observations. First, in a small number of individuals with clinical features of Marfan syndrome (MFS2), there are no mutations in FBN1 but instead gain-of-function mutations in genes that encode TGF-b receptors. Second, in mouse models of Marfan syndrome generated by mutations in Fbn1, administrationof antibodies to TGF-b prevents alterations in the aoa and mitral valves. Clinical Features. Although mitral valve lesions are more frequent, they are clinically less impoant than aoic lesions. Loss of connective tissue suppo in the mitral valve leaflets makes them soft and billowy, creating a so-called floppy valve . Valvular lesions, along with lengthening of the chordae tendineae, frequently give rise to mitral regurgitation. Similar changes may affect the tricuspid and, rarely, the aoic valves. Echocardiography greatly enhances the ability to detect the cardiovascular abnormalities and is therefore extremely valuable in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. The great majority of deaths are caused by rupture of aoic dissections, followed in impoance by cardiac failure. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 145",A

"A family suffering a hereditary form of severe emphysema, with some family members also showing hepatic disease. Liver biopsy in one of the family members demonstrates increased reactivity with antibodies directed against a-1-antitrypsin. Serum levels of the enzyme are low, leading to increased activity of a number of serine proteases. Increased activity of which of the following serine proteases has been most closely tied to the emphysema that develops in these patients?",Chymotrypsin,Elastase,Plasmin,Thrombin,"The autosomal recessive disease is a-1-antitrypsin deficiency, in which an abnormal form of a-1-antitrypsin can be produced by, but not released from, liver cells. This enzyme was named when it was found in vivo to function as a good inhibitor of the pancreatic protease trypsin. However, it actually inactivates a wide variety of enzymes with protease activity that have an essential serine residue in the catalytic centers. Examples of these serine proteases include all of the question choices, and additionally, cathepsin G and plasminogen. Surprisingly, a-1-antitrypsin disease specifically targets only the liver and the lungs. The liver disease, which can be mild to life-threatening (either due to cirrhosis or, rarely, massive acute hepatic failure), is related to retained a-1-antitrypsin with residual enzymatic activity. The lung disease seems to be the specific result of an inability to turn off elastase produced by neutrophils during lung infections. Neutrophil elastase is one of the few enzymes that can successfully destroy the heavily cross-linked, insoluble, elastin that is presented in the lung interstitium and contributes to its elasticity. With destruction of this lattice-like elastic tissue suppo structure, emphysema can develop in the lungs. Chymotrypsin is a pancreatic enzyme formed in the intestinal lumen that cleaves aromatic aminoacyl bonds. Plasmin is an enzyme in the blood-clotting cascade. Thrombin is an enzyme in the blood-clotting cascade.",B

Which of the following is not an accepted method of randomization-,Computer drawn randomization,Odd/even day hospital admission,Lottery,Random number table,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Odd/even day hospital admission Methods of Randomization o Randomization is accomplished in a number of classic ways 1. Lottery method Suppose 10 patients are to be put in a control group or the trial group out of 100 available. The serial numbers of patients are noted on 100 cards and then shuffled well. The cards are drawn one by one and thus patients are allocated into trial and control groups. 2. Table of Random Numbers Published tables of Random numbers are used. This is considered to be the best method of randomization. A computer program is used for randomization o Randomization methods , which may at first seem reasonable (odd-even day randomization or daytime-nighttime convenience randomization), may actually suppo bias, paicularly if the study is open-label or the operator or subject are not blinded as to the nature of the intervention. For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they ""just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation."" This is a very common error in otherwise well-designed clinical studies.",B

Which of the following is a favorable prognostic indicator in Bell's palsy?,Hyperacusis,Severe taste impairment,Persistence of the stapedial reflex,Complete paralysis within a week,"BELL'S PALSY 
The most common form of facial paralysis is Bell's palsy. The annual incidence of this idiopathic disorder is ~25 per 100,000 annually, or about 1 in 60 persons in a lifetime. Risk factors include pregnancy and diabetes mellitus. 
Clinical Manifestations 
The onset of Bell's palsy is fairly abrupt, with maximal weakness being attained by 48 hrs as a general rule. Pain behind the ear may precede the paralysis for a day or two. Taste sensation may be lost unilaterally, and hyperacusis may be present. In some cases, there is mild cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal swelling and uniform enhancement of the geniculate ganglion and facial nerve and, in some cases, entrapment of the swollen nerve in the temporal bone. Approximately 80% of patients recover within a few weeks or months. Electromyography may be of some prognostic value; evidence of denervation after 10 days indicates there has been axonal degeneration, that there will be a long delay (3 months as a rule) before regeneration occurs, and that it may be incomplete. The presence of incomplete paralysis in the first week is the most favorable prognostic sign. Recurrences are reported in approximately 7% of cases. 
Note: Persistence of the stapedial reflex is considered as favourable prognosis.

The objective is to prevent the transition of the disease proecess from impairment to handicap. The sequence of events leading to disability and handicap are: Disease ---> impairment -4 disability -4 handicap Impairment - is defined as any loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological or anatomical structure or function eg. loss of foot, defective vision or mental retardation. Disability - it is inability to carry out ceain activities considered normal for human beings, because of his 'impairment'. Handicap means that the individual with 'disability' is not able to perform his duties and obligations expected of him in the society. For example: Accident is the disease (or disorder) Loss of foot is the impairment Cannot walk is the disability Unemployed is the handicap Lets see other Modes of intervention in the disease process. Modes of Intervention Modes of intervention can be defined as any attempt to interrupt the usual sequence of any disease process (right from the risk factors to handicap) There are 5 modes of intervention: Health promotion Specific protection Early diagnosis Disability limitation Rehabilitation I. Health promotion Health promotion is not directed against any paicular disease, but is intended to improve the health of people through a variety of interventions like: i) Health education ii) Environmental modifications - Like provision of safe water, installation of sanitary latrines, control of insects and rodents etc. iii) Nutritional interventions - Like food foification, child feeding programmes. iv) Lifestyle and behavioural changes 2. Specific protection is directed against specific disease through interventions such as : - Immunization - Chemoprophylaxis - Protection from carcinogens etc. 3. Early diagnosis and treatment It involves detecting and treating the disease while the biochemical morphological and functional changes are still reversible. Thus it prevents ove disease and disablement. Early diagnosis and treatment are the only effective mode of intervention in following diseases. - Tuberculosis - Leprosy - STD 4. Disability limitation - Already described 5. Rehabilitation It is the combined and coordinated use of medical, social, educational and vocational measures for enabling the handicapped persons to achieve social integration (social integration is defined as the active paicipation of disabled and handicapped people in the mainstream of community life) Option 'a' - Reducing occurence of polio by immunization is specific protection Option 'b' - Arranging for schooling of child suffering from PRPP is rehabilitation Option 'c' - Resting affected limbs in neutral position disability limitation Option 'd' - Providing calipers for walking rehabilitation",C

Hence typical findings of wet drowning in the form of froth and oedema aquosun: of lungs are not found. Atypical drowning may be : Dry drowning : On contact with water, especially cold water, there results intense laryngospasm, so that water does not enter the lungs. Death is due to asphyxia because of laryngospasm. Immersion syndrome (hydrocution/submersion inhibition/vagal inhibition) : Sudden death occurs due to vagal inhibition as a result of (a) sudden impact with cold water, (b) duck diving (falling in water with feet first), and (c) horizontal entry in water with impact on epigastrium. Submersion of unconscious : If person is unconscious since before submersion in water, little or no water enters respiratory passages. It may occur in MI, cerebrovascular accident, hypeension, epilepsy, cerebral aneurysm and in drunk state. Near drowning (secondary drowning syndrome/post immersion syndrome) : In this drowning is survived and death occurs at a later stage after removal from water. Either the person himself comes out of water or he is recovered alive, but due to complications of submersion, he dies at a later stage. It is due to hypoxic encephalopathy and fibrosing alveolitis.

"A patient has angina, dyspnea and syncope. Whatis the most likely diagnosis?",Aoic stonosis,Aoic regurgitation,ASD,VSD,"Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms of AS. Often, there is a history of insidious progression of fatigue and dyspnea associated with gradual cuailment of activities. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

It estimates chloride content of blood from both sides of heart. Normally the chloride content is equal in the right and left chambers of the heart (600 mg/100 ml). In fresh water drowning due to hemodilution the chloride content is decreased and in salt water drowning due to hemoconcentration the chloride content is increased in left side of heart. A 25% difference in chloride is significant but the test is of doubtful value.o Limitations of gettler test:-1. No value in atypical drowning; congenital cardiac defects as shunts and patent foramen ovale; and if drowning medium contains same amount of chloride.2. There is progressive loss of Cl- from blood after death. Therefore the test has to be made within a reasonably short time after death.",D

WHO recommends the &;Danish 1331&; strain for vaccine production. Stable for several weeks at ambient temperature in a tropical climate and for upto 1 year if kept away from direct light and stored in a cool environment below 10 deg celcius. Vaccine must be protected from light ( wrapped up in a double layer of red/ black cloth). Normal saline is recommended as diluent for reconstituting the vaccine as distilled water may cause irritation. Reconstituted vaccine may be used within 3 hours. Dosage-0.1 mg in 0.1 ml volume. The dose of newborn below 4 weeks is 0.05 ml. Afministered intradermally using tuberculin syringe. Injected slightly above the inseion of left deltoid. If injected too high / too low adjacent lymph nodes may become involved and tender. The vaccine must not be contaminated with an antiseptic/detergent. If alcohol is used to swab the skin , it must be allowed to evaporate before the vaccine is given. Phenomenon after vaccination:/ 2-3 weeks after a correct intradermal injection of a potent vaccine, a papule develops at the site of vaccination. It increases slowly in size and reaches a a diameter of about 4-8 mm in 5 weeks. It then subsides or breaks into a shallow ulcer but usually seen covered by a crust. Healing occurs within 6-12weeks leaving a permanent,tiny, round scar (4-8 mm in diameter).This is a normal reaction. Normally the individual become mantoux postive after 8 weeks has elapsed. Adverse reactions: prolonged severe ulceration at the site of vaccination, suppurative lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis and disseminated BCG infection. Contraindications: BCG should not be given to patients with generalised eczema, infective dermatosis, hypogammaglobulinemia , those with history of deficient immunity, patients under immunosuppressive treatment and in pregnancy. {Reference: park&;s textbook of preventive and social medicine, 23rd edition, pg no.196}</p>",D

Most cases arise from a mutation or deletion of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome, which encodes type IV collagen, resulting in inheritance as an X-linked recessive disorder (p. 48). Mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes are less common and cause autosomal recessive disease. The accumulation of abnormal collagen results in a progressive degeneration of the GBM (Fig. 15.14). Affected patients progress from haematuria to ESRD in their late teens or twenties. Female carriers of COL4A5 mutations usually have haematuria but less commonly develop significant renal disease. Some other basement membranes containing the same collagen isoforms are similarly involved, notably in the cochlea, so that Alpo's syndrome is associated with sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities.

Drug of choice in sarcoidosis is,Cyclophosphamide,Methotrexate,Prednisolone,Cyclosporine,"Management of sarcoidosis Patients who present with acute illness and erythema nodosum should receive NSAIDs and, on occasion, a sho course of glucocoicoids. The majority of patients enjoy spontaneous remission and so, if there is no evidence of organ damage, systemic glucocoicoid therapy can be withheld for 6 months. However, prednisolone (at a staing dose of 20-40 mg/day) should be commenced immediately in the presence of hypercalcaemia, pulmonary impairment, renal impairment and uveitis. Topical glucocoicoids may be useful in cases of mild uveitis, and inhaled glucocoicoids have been used to shoen the duration of systemic glucocoicoid use in asymptomatic parenchymal sarcoid. Patients should be warned that strong sunlight may precipitate hypercalcaemia and endanger renal function. Features suggesting a less ourable outlook include age over 40, Afro-Caribbean ethnicity, persistent symptoms for more than 6 months, the involvement of more than three organs, lupus pernio and a stage III/IV chest X-ray. In patients with severe disease, methotrexate (10-20 mg/week), azathioprine (50-150 mg/day) and specific tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors have been effective. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose thalidomide may be useful in cutaneous sarcoid with limited pulmonary involvement.

"In basic life suppo (BLS), suppo is given to which of the following organ-",Lung,Hea,Kidney,Skeletal muscle,"Basic life suppo, more popularly known as CPR, is intended to maintain organ perfusion until definitive interventions can be instituted. The elements of CPR are the maintenance of ventilation of the lungs and compression of the chest. Mouth-to-mouth respiration may be used if no specific rescue equipment is immediately available (e.g., plastic oropharyngeal airways, esophageal obturators, masked Ambu bag). Conventional ventilation techniques during single-responder CPR require that the lungs be inflated twice in succession after every 30 chest compressions. Recent data suggest that interrupting chest compressions to perform mouth-to-mouth respiration may be less effective than a continuous chest compression strategy. Chest compression is based on the assumption that cardiac compression allows the hea to maintain a pump function by sequential filling and emptying of its chambers, with competent valves maintaining forward direction of flow. The palm of one hand is placed over the lower sternum, with the heel of the other resting on the dorsum of the lower hand. The sternum is depressed, with the arms remaining straight, at a rate of approximately100 per minute.

Brain death is said to occur if there is: March 2008,Absent spinal reflexes,Coical death following widespread brain injury,Absence of brainstem reflexes,Core temperature of the body is below 35 degree C,"Ans. C: Absence of brainstem reflexes Brainstem is responsible for the respiratory drive and mostly for the maintenance of BP. All motor outputs from the brain travel through the brainstem. Apa from smell and vision. All sensory traffic coming into the brain comes through the brainstem. The brainstem also mediates the cranial nerve reflexes. Hence a properly functioning brain stem is a precondition for full consciousness.

Which of the following in involved in tumor metastasis cascade -,Fibronectin,E-Cadherin,Type IV collagenase,Tyrosine kinase,"Cadherin-1 also known as CAM 120/80 or epithelial cadherin or uvomorulin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDH1 gene. CDH1 has also been designated as CD324. It is a tumor suppressor gene. Cadherin-1 is a classical member of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion glycoprotein composed of five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Mutations in this gene are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid, and ovarian cancers. Loss of function is thought to contribute to progression in cancer by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells, and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization. Identified transcript variants arise from mutation at consensus splice sites Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 570",B
Community physician takes action based on :,Population attributable risk,Relative risk,Attributable risk,Odds ratio,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Population attributable risk Attributable risk = 100 x (Incidence of disease rate among exposed-incidence of diseases rate among not exposed) / (Incidence of diseases rate among exposed)Attributable risk indicates to what extent the disease under study can be attributed to the exposure.Population attributable risk (PAR) = 100 x (Incidence of diseases in the total population-incidence of diseases among those not exposed to causal factor) / (Incidence of diseases in the total population)PAR provides an estimate of the amount by which the disease could be reduced in that population if the suspected factor was eliminated or modified. For e.g. , 86% is the PAR, then 86% of deaths from lung cancer could be avoided if the risk factor of cigarettes were eliminated.Thus we see that the best indices for community physicians would be PAR because they have to take care of the whole population. From PAR they come to know clearly how much of a disease could be wiped out by a particular action.",A

Khesari dhal (lathyrus sativus), is consumed in pas of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, excessive consumption of which is associated with lathyrism. Pulses contain 20 to 25 per cent of proteins, which is double that found in wheat and three times that found in rice. II') fact, pulses contain more protein than eggs, fish or flesh foods. But in regard to quality, pulse proteins are inferior to animal proteins. Pulse proteins are poor in methionine and to a lesser extent in cysteine. On the other hand they are rich in lysine. Soyabean is exceptionally rich in protein, containing up to 40 per cent. In addition, pulses are rich in minerals and B-group vitamins such as riboflavin and thiamine. In the dry state, pulses do not contain vitamin C. Germinating pulses, however, contain higher concentration of vitamins, especially vitamin C and B vitamins. Fermentation also modifies the nutritive value of pulses .in that the vitamin content paicularly that of riboflavin, thiamine and niacin is enhanced.

Renin plays impoant role in,Renovascular hypeension,Malignant hypeension,Coronary aery disease,Essential hypeension',"Stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leads to vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, sympathetic nervous system activation. This is mediated by angiotensin II, a potent constrictor of aerioles in both the kidney and the systemic circulation . Activation of the sympathetic nervous system may initially maintain cardiac output through an increase in myocardial contractility, hea rate and peripheral vasoconstriction. However, prolonged sympathetic stimulation leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, hyperophy and focal myocardial necrosis.renin also has an essential role in renovascular hypeension.Renovascular hypeension is another renin-mediated form of hypeension. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin dependent. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2044",A

Fluid used in hypovolemic shock-,RL,DNS,Blood,5%Dextose,"Initial resuscitation requires rapid reexpansion of the circulating intravascular blood volume along with interventions to control ongoing losses. In accordance with Starling's law, stroke volume and cardiac output rise with the increase in preload. After resuscitation, the compliance of the ventricles.may remain reduced due to increased interstitial fluid in the myocardium. Therefore, elevated filling pressures are frequently required to maintain adequate ventricular performance. Volume resuscitation is initiated with the rapid infusion of either isotonic saline (although care must be taken to avoid hyperchloremic acidosis from loss of bicarbonate buffering capacity and replacement with excess chloride) or a balanced salt solution such as Ringer's lactate (being cognizant of the presence of potassium and potential renal dysfunction) through large-bore intravenous lines. Data, paicularly on severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), regarding benefits of small volumes of hypeonicsaline that more rapidly restore blood pressure are variable, but tend to show improved survival thought to be linked to immunomodulation. No distinct benefit from the use of colloid has been demonstrated, and in trauma patients it is associated with a higher moality, paicularly in patients with TBI.

A patient Shweta with raised serum alkaline phosphatase and raised parathormone level along with low calcium and low phosphate level is likely to have-,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Paget's disease,Osteoporosis,Vitamin D deficiency,"clinical syndrome of vitamin D deficiency can be a result of deficient production of vitamin D in the skin, lack of dietary intake, accelerated losses of vitamin D, impaired vitamin D activation, or resistance to the biologic effects of 1,25(OH) 2 D The elderly and nursing home residents are paicularly at risk for vitamin D deficiency, since both the efficiency of vitamin D synthe- sis in the skin and the absorption of vitamin D from the intestine decline with age. Similarly, intestinal malabsorption of dietary fats leads to vitamin D deficiency.The most specific screening test for vitamin D deficiency in oth- erwise healthy individuals is a serum 25(OH)D level. Although the normal ranges vary, levels of 25(OH)D <37 nmol/L (<15 ng/ mL) are associated with increasing PTH levels and lower bone density; optimal vitamin D levels are >80 nmol/L (>32 ng/mL). Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium val- ues. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. With prolonged vitamin D deficiency resulting in osteomalacia, calcium stores in the skeleton become relatively inaccessible, since osteoclasts cannot resorb unmineralized osteoid, and frank hypocalcemia ensues( Harrison 17 pg 2376)",D

Most efficient ani-larval measure to prevent urban malaria is,Clean drainage and sewage system,Cover overhead tank,Filling cesspools and ditches,Cover pits,"Anti-larval measures of plasmodium (i) Larvicides : During the first half of the 20th century, anti-larval measures such as oiling the collections of standing water or dusting them with paris green effectively controlled malaria (but the measures were eclipsed at the end of World War II). With the increase in insecticide resistance, the older methods of mosquito control have now become promising. Some modern larvicides such as temephos which confer long effect with low toxicity are more widely used. However larviciding must be repeated at frequent intervals and for this reason it is a comparatively costly operation. (ii) Source reduction : Techniques to reduce mosquito breeding sites (often called source reduction) which include drainage or filling, deepening or flushing, management of water level, changing the salt content of water and intermittent irrigation are among the classical methods of malaria control to which attention is being paid again. Whenever practicable, measures for the improvement of the environment by the permanent reduction of sources should be instituted. {iii) Integrated control : In order to reduce too much dependance on residual insecticides, increasing emphasis is being put on ""integrated"" vector control methodology which includes bioenvironmental and personal protection measure .This approach is impoant because there is no single and simple method that would ensure control of transmission. By mid 1995 all malaria endemic countries in the region had adopted the revised malaria control strategy to reduce morbidity and moality and to reduce its area of distribution, paicularly of multidrug resistant malaria. The use of stratification approach by the majority of anti-malaria programmes in the Region has led to more cost-effective interventions. Vector resistance to insecticides has necessitated the use of more expensive pyrethroid, thereby limiting the coverage. Malaria control added impetus as Roll Back Malaria initiative was launched by WHO, UNICEF, UNDP and the World Bank in 1998.",B

Homocystinuria, endovascular intervention, and surgery can produce vascular endothelial damage. Dehydration, which is more common among male patients, is a common cause of stasis in the pediatric population. Stasis also can result from compression and kinking of the renal veins from retroperitoneal processes such as retroperitoneal fibrosis and abdominal neoplasms. Thrombosis can occur throughout the renal circulation, including the renal veins, with antiphospholipid syndrome. Renal vein thrombosis can also be secondary to nephrotic syndrome, paicularly membranous nephropathy. Other hypercoagulable states less commonly associated with renal vein thrombosis include proteins C and S, antithrombin deficiency, factor V Leiden, disseminated malignancy, and oral contraceptives.

C wave in JVP is due to -,Atrial contraction,Tricuspid valve bulging into right atrium,Right atrial filling,Rapid ventricular filling,"Atrial pressure rises during atrial systole and continues to rise during isovolumetric ventricular contraction when the AV valves bulge into the atria. When the AV valves are pulled down by the contracting ventricular muscle, pressure falls rapidly and then rises as blood flows into the atria until the AV valves open early in diastole. The return of the AV valves to their relaxed position also contributes to this pressure rise by reducing atrial capacity. The atrial pressure changes are transmitted to the great veins, producing three characteristic waves in the record of jugular pressure . The a wave is due to atrial systole. As noted above, some blood regurgitates into the great veins when the atria contract. In addition, venous inflow stops, and the resultant rise in venous pressure contributes to the a wave. The c wave is the transmitted manifestation of the rise in atrial pressure produced by the bulging of the tricuspid valve into the atria during isovolumetric ventricular contraction. The v wave mirrors the rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens during diastole. The jugular pulse waves are superimposed on the respiratory fluctuations in venous pressure. Venous pressure falls during inspiration as a result of the increased negative intrathoracic pressure and rises again during expiration. Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",B

The methods used areGustafson's method : Useful only in persons older than 21 years of age, depending on the physiological changes in each of the dental tissues.1. Attrition - due to wear and tear from mastication, upper surface of teeth destroyed gradually, first involving the enamel - dentine - pulp (depending on the functional use of teeth and hardness of enamel).2. Paradentosis - recession of gums and periodontal tissue surrounding the teeth, exposing the neck and adjacent part of root - teeth fall off (poor hygiene increases paradentosis).3. Secondary dentine formation - develop within the pulp cavity and decrease size of the cavity, start from base - apex, obliterate the cavity, increase with age, caries and paradentosis.4. Cementum apposition - near the end of root, increase cementum, increase thickness, deposited throughout life, and form incremental lines (devised by Boyde).5. Root resorption - because of cementum and dentine, absorption of root start at apex and extend upward (may be pathological).6. Transparency of the root - seen after 30 years of age, canal in the dentine at first widen, increase with age because of deposition of minerals. They become invisible and dentine becomes transparent (Most reliable of all the criteria).Mile's method : Age can be known by changes of root transparency.C) Boyde' method : On enamel of the tooth, there is a line at birth (neonatal line).

Which one of the following oral hypoglycemic agents is not an insulin secretogogue ?,Gliclazide,Glimiperide,Repaglinide,Rosiglitazone,"Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione which reduce insulin resistance by binding to the PPAR-g (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g) nuclear receptor (which forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor). The PPAR-g receptor is found at highest levels in adipocytes. Agonists of this receptor regulate a large number of genes, promote adipocyte differentiation, reduce hepatic fat accumulation, and promote fatty acid storage. Thiazolidinediones promote a redistribution of fat from central to peripheral locations. Thus it enhances the actions of endogenous insulin.

By reducing production of angiotensin II, ACE inhibitors allow blood vessels to widen, which lowers blood pressure and improves hea output. The available ACE inhibitors include benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril. Side effects -- In some patients, ACE inhibitors cause a persistent dry hacking cough that is reversible when the medication is stopped. Less common side effects include dry mouth, nausea, rash, muscle pain, or occasionally, kidney dysfunction and elevated blood potassium. A potentially serious complication of ACE inhibitors is angioedema, which occurs in 0.1 to 0.7 percent of people. People with angioedema rapidly (minutes to hours after taking the medication) develop swelling of the lips, tongue, and throat, which can interfere with breathing. These symptoms are a medical emergency, and the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued. oral enalapril may also be used in young hypeensives who presents with ususually high levels of blood pressure to overcome the end stage damages that can happen. ref:Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine,ed 18,pg no 2057",C

False about Japanese encephalitis is:,Transmitted by Culex mosquitoes,Overhead tanks serve as breeding site,Pigs are amplifiers,Primary dose of vaccine consists of two dose,"Overhead tanks serve as breeding site Japanese encephalitis Is a mosquito borne encephalitis caused by a group B arbovirus (Flavivirus). It is a zoonotic disease i.e infecting mainly animals and accidentally man. The disease is transmitted to man by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Man is an incidental 'dead-end' host. Man to man transmission has not so far been recorded. Available evidences indicates that the basic cycles of transmission are: a)Pig -4 Mosquito Pig b)Ardeid bird --> Mosquito --> Ardeid Bird Culex mosquitoes are its main vectors. C. tritaeniorhynchus has been implicated as the most impoant vector in South India. It breeds in the rice paddy fields, shallow ditches and pools. These mosquitoes are zoophilic, feeding primarily on veebrate hosts. Not all individuals bitten by infected mosquitoes develop disease. The ratio of ove disease to inapparent infection varies from 1:300 to 1:1000. Thus cases of encephalitis represent only the tip of the iceberg compared to the large no. of inapparent infections. Case fatality rate varies between 20-40% Other relevant impoant facts Pigs are the major veebrate hosts of JE* Infected pigs do not manifest any ove symptoms of illness but circulate the virus. Pigs are considered as amplifiers of the virus Cattle and buffaloes may also be infected with the JE virus; although they may not be natural hosts of JE virus, they act as mosquito attractants. Among domestic animals, horses are only known so far to show signs of encephalitis due to JE virus*. Vaccination Vaccination of the population at risk is recommended. Currently there are three types of JE vaccines in large-scale use: a. The mouse brain-derived inactivated vaccine b.The cell culture-derived inactivated vaccine c. The cell culture-derived live attenuated vaccine based on SA 14-14-2 strain of the JE virus Immunization schedule: The mouse brain-derived inactivated vaccine - When immunizing children 1-3 years of age 2 primary doses of vaccine are given 4 weeks apa. Boosters are given after 1 yr and then subsequently at 3 years interval, until the age of 10-15 yrs. This schedule provides protection throughout childhood. - The vaccine is best used in the inter-epidemic period. The cell culture-derived live attenuated vaccine - Only a single dose of vaccine is needed, followed by a single booster after 1 yr. - This vaccine is an integral pa of Universal Immunization programme in 11 endemic districts of UP, Assain, West Bengal and Karnataka. Vaccination of travellers: - For travellers aged more than one year, visiting rural areas of endemic countries, vaccination is required. - The schedule is of 3 primary doses at days 0, 7 and 28 (alternative schedule is of 2 primary doses 4 weeks apa). - If continued protection is required, boosters can be given after 1 yr and then after every 3 years. Vaccination is not recommended for children before the age of 6 months as infants are likely protected by maternal antibodies. Also Know",B

"A neurological examination of a 47 year old woman reveals a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, but no consensual corneal reflex in her left eye. Which of the following additional findings might be expected?",Absence of pupillary light reflex of the left eye,Hyperacusis of the left ear,Inability to abduct the right eye,Loss of pain and temperature of the left face,"The first trick to this question is to determine where the lesion is. The corneal reflex is tested by touching a cotton wisp to the eye. A normal response would be blinking of the ipsilateral eye as well as the contralateral eye (consensual reflex). The afferent limb of the corneal reflex is contained within the ophthalmic division of the ipsilateral ophthalmic nerve (V1), the efferent limb is by both (right and left) facial nerves (VII). This woman had a normal corneal reflex in her right eye, indicating a normal right V1 and right VII. However, she lacked a consensual reflex, indicating an abnormal left VIIth nerve. The next trick to this question is to determine what other signs a lesion in the left VIIth nerve could produce. A lesion in the left VIIth would also produce hyperacusis (increased sensitivity to sound) in the left ear because of paralysis of the stapedius muscle, which ordinarily dampens sound transmission through the middle ear. The absence of a pupillary light reflex of the left eye could be caused either by a lesion of the left optic nerve (CN II; afferent limb) or by a lesion of the left oculomotor nerve (CN III; efferent limb). The inability to abduct the right eye could be caused by a lesion of the right abducens nerve (CN VI), which innervates the lateral rectus muscle. Loss of pain and temperature of the left face could be caused by a lesion of the spinal nucleus of V. This nucleus is located in the medulla, and receives pain and temperature information from the face the trigeminal nerve (CN V). Ref: Rosenga A.J., Novakovic R.L., Frank J.I. (2005). Chapter 67.

In congestive cardiac failure all are true used except-,Spironlactone,Nitrates,Nesiritide,Trimetazidine,"ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, captopril) Angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the amount of hea-damaging hormones your body produces. They also dilate blood vessels and lower blood pressure to lessen the workload of your hea Angiotensin receptor blockers (losaan) Angiotensin receptor blockers are similar to ACE inhibitors, but they don't cause the cough that some people have when taking ACE inhibitors. Common side effects of angiotensin receptor blockers: Dizziness Changes in kidney function Combination medicines (Entresto, or sacubitril/valsaan) Entresto is a medicine that combines the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsaan with a substance known as sacubitril that causes the hea to squeeze harder and can help your body eliminate excess fluid. The effect of this combination can be more powerful than either drug alone. Entresto is usually staed after a person has been able to tolerate target doses of either an angiotension conveing enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), so this is not usually the first medicine used to treat hea failure. It is currently only used if other medicines have not improved the hea's ability to pump effectively. If you are taking an ACEI (such as lisinopril or enalapril) you will need to stop that medication for 36 hours before staing Entresto. This is very impoant; not doing so could result in a serious reaction. Digoxin (Lanoxin) This medicine slows hea rate and might improve the pumping ability of your hea. You'll get a blood test to make sure the dose you're taking is right for you. Hydralazine and nitrates (Apresoline, Nitrobid, Imdur, Isordil) Hydralazine and nitrates are often used together to treat hea failure. They dilate blood vessels so it's easier for your hea to receive and pump blood.

All are true in chronic constrictive pericarditis except-,Kussamauls sign in present,Ascites is not in propoion to edema,Commonest cause is idiopathic,Right ventricular and diastolic pressure is raised,"Constrictive pericarditis is a medical condition characterized by a thickened, fibrotic pericardium, limiting the hea's ability to function normally.In many cases, the condition continues to be difficult to diagnose and therefore benefits from a good understanding of the underlying cause The pathophysiological characteristics of constrictive pericarditis are due to a thickened, fibrotic pericardium that forms a non-compliant shell around the hea. This shell prevents the hea from expanding when blood enters it. This results in significant respiratory variation in blood flow in the chambers of the hea. During inspiration, pressure in the thoracic cavity decreases but is not relayed to the left atrium, subsequently a reduction in flow to the left atrium and ventricle happens. During diastole, less blood flow in left ventricle allows for more room for filling in right ventricle and therefore a septal shift occurs. During expiration, the amount of blood entering the right ventricle will decrease, allowing the interventricular septum to bulge towards the right ventricle, and increased filling of the [[left ventricle and subsequent increased pressure generated by the left ventricle during systole.This is known as ventricular interdependence, since the amount of blood flow into one ventricle is dependent on the amount of blood flow into the other ventricle. Signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis are consistent with the following: fatigue, swollen abdomen, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), swelling of legs and general weakness. Related conditions are bacterial pericarditis, pericarditis and pericarditis after a hea attack Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1436",C
"All are features, seen in cardiac tamponade ,EXCEPT-",Raised jvp,Muffled hea sounds,Rapid x descent,Pulses pardoxus,"Rapid Y descent seen in cardiac tamponade Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade, is when fluid in the pericardium (the sac around the hea) builds up, resulting in c of the hea. Onset may be rapid or gradual.Symptoms typically include those of cardiogenic shock including shoness of breath, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough. Other symptoms may relate to the underlying cause A very large pericardial effusion resulting in tamponade as a result of bleeding from cancer as seen on ultrasound. Closed arrow - the hea; open arrow - the effusion Common causes of cardiac tamponade include cancer, kidney failure, chest trauma, and pericarditis. Other causes include connective tissues diseases, hypothyroidism, aoic rupture, and complications of cardiac surgery. In Africa, tuberculosis is a relatively common cause. Diagnosis may be suspected based on low blood pressure, jugular venous distension, pericardial rub, or quiet hea sounds. The diagnosis may be fuher suppoed by specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, chest X-ray, or an ultrasound of the hea.If fluid increases slowly the pericardial sac can expand to contain more than 2 liters; however, if the increase is rapid as little as 200 mL can result in tamponade Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1523",C

Which of the following is the drug of choice for the treatment of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion-,Frusemide,Hydrochlorothiazide,Spironolactone,Demeclocycline,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Demeclocycline The drug most commonly used to t/t hyponatremia in syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion is Demeclocycline.Demeclocycline is a tetracycline and is used in the t/t of chronic hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) when water restriction therapy has failed.Demeclocycline produces a state of unresponsiveness to ADH, probably by inhibiting the formation and action of cyclic AMP in the renal tubule.It is effective and convenient to use in SIADH because this action is both dose-dependent and reversible.Role of Frusemide in SIADHSIADH may be treated with frusemide if there is a dangerous degree of volume overload.Also go through the following text from Harrison which discusses the future drug therapy for SIADH.""One or more nonpeptide AVP antagonists that block the antidiuretic effect of AVP may soon be approved for use in United States. Preliminary studies with these antagonists in acute or chronic SIADH indicate that they produce a dose dependent increase in urinary free water excretion, which, if combined with a modest restriction of fluid intake, gradually reduces body water and corrects the hyponatremia without any recognized adverse effect. Thus they may become the t/t of choice for those forms of SIADH in which there is inappropriate secretion of AVP that cannot be corrected by other more specific therapy",D

Schilling test is Abnormal in:,Intrinsic factor deficiency,Amylase deficiency,Lipase deficiency,Pancreatic endocrine insufficiency,"Answer is A (Intrinsic factor deficiency) Shilling's test is typically done to determine the cause of cobalamine malabsorption (Vitamin B12 malabsorption) Vitamin B12 absorption (Schilling) test is typically used to diagnose conditions in which intrinsic factor (IF) may be absent, such as pernicious anemia or gastric atrophy. A diagnosis of Intrinsic factor deficiency can be established if radiolabelled cobalamine (Vitamin B12) appears in urine after administration of Intrinsic factor. Since cobalamine absorption requires multiple steps including gastric, pancreatic and ileal processes, the Schilling test can also be used to assess the integrity of these other organs. Dietary vitamin B 12 is bound in the stomach to an endogenous protein called R protein. Pancreatic enzymes degrade the R protein in the proximal small bowel and lower its affinity for vitamin B12 resulting in the rapid transfer of B 12 to IF; The IF-B12 Complex continues to the terminal ileum, where it binds to specific receptors on the surface of the epithelial cells. Thus lack of intrinsic factor, lack of sufficient pancreatic enzymes (pancreatic exocrine dysfunction) or presence of terminal heal mucosal disease may all result in abnormal vitamin B12 excretion.",A

Vitamin E causes,Hemorrhagic stroke,Cardiac failure,Ataxia,Megalablastic anemia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ataxia Vitamin E (tocopherol) is a fat-soluble vitamin with antioxidant propeies; It protects cell membranes from oxidation and destruction. Vitamin E is found in a variety of food including oils, meat, eggs, and leafy vegatables. There are multiple forms and isomers of tocopherol and the related compounds, tocotrienols. The current evidence the primary bioactive form of Vitamin E is alfa-tocopherol. Serum vitamin E levels are strongly influenced by concentration of serum lipids, and do not accurately reflect tissue vitamin levels. Effective vitamin E levels are calculated as the ratio of serum alpha-tocopherol per gram total lipids. Absorption of dietary vitamin E requires effective pancreatic exocrine function and fat absorption, unless provided in a synthetic water-soluble form. Vitamin Vitamin E deficiency is uncommon in humans except in special circumstances. This is due to the abundance of tocopherols in the diet.",C

Asymptomatic hyper - calcemia in a 30 year old young male is due to-,Occult primary malignancy,Primary Hyperparathyroidism,Familial hypocalciuria,Hyper-nephroma,"<p>Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH. The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. There is great variation in the manifestations. Patients may present with multiple signs and symptoms, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, peptic ulcers, mental changes, and, less frequently, extensive bone resorption. However, with greater awareness of the disease and wider use of multiphasic screening tests, including measurements of blood calcium, the diagnosis is frequently made in patients who have no symptoms and minimal, if any, signs of the disease other than hypercalcemia and elevated levels of PTH. The manifestations may be subtle, and the disease may have a benign course for many years or a lifetime. This milder form of the disease is usually termed asymptomatic HPT . Rarely, hyperparathyroidism develops or worsens abruptly and causes severe complications such as marked dehydration and coma, so-called hypercalcemic parathyroid crisis. The annual incidence of the disease is calculated to be as high as 0.2% in patients >60, with an estimated prevalence, including undiscovered asymptomatic patients, of >=1%; some repos suggest the incidence may be declining. If confirmed, these changing estimates may reflect less frequent routine testing of serum calcium in recent years, earlier overestimates in incidence, or unknown factors. The disease has a peak incidence between the third and fifth decades but occurs in young children and in the elderly.(harrison 18 pg 3100)</p>",B

It occurs when the vaccination of a poion of the population (or herd) provides protection to unprotected (non-vaccinated) individuals. How does herd immunity provide protection to nonimmunized person ? o Infection is spread from person to person. o If a large number of population are immune, it is more difficult to maintain a chain of infection. o The more immune individuals present in a population, the lower the likelihood that a susceptible person will come into contact with an infected individual. o For example, if person 'A' had a disease and exposed person 'B' who was immune because of vaccination, person `B' would not get ill and could not pass on the disease to person 'C' when he comes into contact with him. So, even if person 'C' is not vaccinated, He indirectly gets protection from the disease. o Hence herd immunity may be used to reduce spread of an infection and to protect a vulnerable, un-vaccinated subgroup.",B

It is the statistical analysis of a collection of individual studies,o Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for amalgamating, summarising, and reviewing previous quantitative research. By using meta-analysis, a wide variety of questions can be investigated, as long as a reasonable body of primary research studies exist. Selected parts of the reported results of primary studies are entered into a database, and this ""meta-data"" is ""meta-analyzed"", in similar ways to working with other data - descriptively and then inferentially to test certain hypotheses.o The appeal of meta analysis is that it in effect combines all the research on one topic into one large study with many participants. The danger is that in amalgamating a large set of different studies the construct definitions can become imprecise and the results difficult to interpret meaningfully,o In a meta-analysis, research studies are collected, coded, and interpreted using statistical methods similar to those used in primary data analysis. The result is an integrated review of findings that is more objective and exact than a narrative review. By accumulating results across studies, one can gain a more accurate representation of the population relationship than is provided by the individual study estimators.",A

Active immunity is when we produce our own antibody. Aificial refers to the fact that the stimulus was the vaccination with the antigens in question. Adoptive immunity involves the patient receiving cells from another host who had been stimulated to produce their products. Aificial passive immunity refers to the immunity produced by receiving an injection of antibody. An example is the administration of immunoglobulin directed against hepatitis A after an individual had been exposed to it. Active immunity means that we are stimulated to produce our own antibodies. The term natural active refers to the fact that we received the stimulus (antigen) by a natural means, such as exposure to the organism. Ref: Levinson W. (2012). Chapter 66.

Signs of chronic liver failure are all except -,Subcutaneous nodules,Palmer erythema,Spider nevi,Testicular atropy,"Pathophysiology Any cause of liver damage can produce acute liver failure, provided it is sufficiently severe . Acute viral hepatitis is the most common cause worldwide, whereas paracetamol toxicity is the most frequent cause in the UK. Acute liver failure occurs occasionally with other drugs, or from Amanita phalloides (mushroom) poisoning, in pregnancy, in Wilson's disease, following shock and, rarely, in extensive malignant disease of the liver. In 10% of cases, the cause of acute liver failure remains unknown and these patients are often labelled as having 'non-A-E viral hepatitis' or 'cryptogenic' acute liver failure Clinical assessment Cerebral disturbance (hepatic encephalopathy and/or cerebral oedema) is the cardinal manifestation of acute liver failure, but in the early stages this can be mild and episodic, and so its absence does not exclude a significant acute liver injury. The initial clinical features are often subtle and include reduced aleness and poor concentration, progressing through behavioural abnormalities, such as restlessness and aggressive outbursts, to drowsiness and coma . Cerebral oedema may occur due to increased intracranial pressure, causing unequal or abnormally reacting pupils, fixed pupils, hypeensive episodes, bradycardia, hyperventilation, profuse sweating, local or general myoclonus, focal fits or decerebrate posturing. Papilloedema occurs rarely and is a late sign. More general symptoms include weakness, nausea and vomiting. Right hypochondrial discomfo is an occasional feature. The patient may be jaundiced but jaundice may not be present at the outset (e.g. in paracetamol overdose), and there are a number of exceptions, including Reye's syndrome, in which jaundice is rare. Occasionally, death may occur in fulminant cases of acute liver failure before jaundice develops. Fetor hepaticus can be present. The liver is usually of normal size but later becomes smaller. Clinical grading of Clinical signs Grade 1 Poor concentration, slurred speech, slow mentation, disordered sleep rhythm Grade 2 Drowsy but easily rousable, occasional aggressive behaviour, lethargic Grade 3 Marked delirium, drowsy, sleepy but responds to pain and voice, gross disorientation Grade 4 Unresponsive to voice, may or may not respond to painful stimuli, unconscious Ref Davidson edition23rd pg857",A

True about correlation coefficient:,Denoted by r2,Its value can never be Zero,Can be used to calculate value of one variable if other is known,Value lies between -1 to +1,"Ans. D. Value lies between -1 to +1Correlation: Often we wish to know if there is linear relation between two variables, e.g. height and weight. To find out the strength of association between the two variables we calculate the coefficient of correlation and it is denoted by V.The value of r can lie between -1 to +1If r = 0 then there is no association between the two variables.Regression: Used when we wish to calculate unknown value of a variable, when we know value of another variable.The known variable is called independent variable and denoted by x and the unknown variable is called dependent variable denoted by y.Equation for linear regression is given byy = a + bxWhere y is dependent variable, a is constant, b is the regression coefficient and x is independent variable.Coming to the present questionOption a is wrong as correlation coefficient is denoted by r and not r2.Option b has to be false if option d is correct. In such questions, where there are two mutually exclusive options, i.e. of the two statement one explains the other and only one can be true, you easily rule out the other two even if you do not know about them. Thus, in this question even if you do not know a thing about correlation (which by now you do pretty well) you can conclude answer has to be either option c or d.Option d is the only true statement among all four.Option c is the definition of regression.",D

Active method to detect undiagnosed cases in apparently healthy people is -,Case finding,Surveillance,Screening,Monitoring,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Screening Screening is defined as the search for unrecognized disease or defect in apparently healthy individuals by means of rapidly applied tests, examinations or other procedures.Explanation of various termsScreening - screening is testing for infection or disease in population or in individuals who are not seeking health care; for eg., serological testing for AIDS virus in blood donors, neonatal screening, premarital screening for syphilis.Case finding - this is use of clinical and/or laboratory tests to detect disease in individuals seeking health care for other reasons; for eg., the use of VDRL testing for syphilis in pregnant women.Diagnostic tests - this is the use of clinical and/or lab procedures to confirm or refute the existence of disease or true abnormality in patients with signs and symptoms presumed to be caused by the disease; for example - VDRL testing in patients with lesion suggestive of syphilis.Monitoring & SurveillanceMonitoring - is the performance and analysis of routine measurements aimed at detecting changes in the environment or health status of population eg. monitoring of air pollution, water quality, growth & nutritional status.Surveillance - mean continuous scrutiny of the factors that determine the occurrence and distribution of disease and other conditions of ill-health.Thus monitoring is one specific and essential part of the broader concept of surveillance. Monitoring requires careful planning and the use of standardized procedures and methods of data collection, and can then be carried out over extended periods of time by technicians and automated instruments. Surveillance in contrast, requires professional analysis and sophisticated judgement of data leading to recommendations for control activities.",C

The most sensitive among the following tests for diagnosis of malaria is -,Thin peripheral blood smear,Quantitative buffy coat test,PfHRP2 antigen,Pan plasmodial LDH,"Investigations Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films should be examined whenever malaria is suspected. In the thick film, erythrocytes are lysed, releasing all blood stages of the parasite. This, as well as the fact that more blood is used in thick films, facilitates the diagnosis of low-level parasitaemia. A thin film is essential to confirm the diagnosis, species and, in P. falciparum infections, to quantify the parasite load (by counting the percentage of infected erythrocytes). P. falciparum parasites may be very scanty, especially in patients who have been paially treated. With P. falciparum, only ring forms are normally seen in the early stages; with the other species, all stages of the erythrocytic cycle may be found. Gametocytes appear after about 2 weeks, persist after treatment and are harmless, except that they are the source by which more mosquitoes become infected. Immunochromatographic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria antigens, such as OptiMAL (which detects the Plasmodium LDH of P. falciparum and vivax) and Parasight-F (which detects the P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2), are extremely sensitive and specific for falciparum malaria but less so for other species. They should be used in parallel with blood film examination but are especially useful where the microscopist is less experienced in examining blood films (e.g. in the UK). They are less sensitive for low-level parasitaemia and positivity may persist for a month or more in some individuals. The QBC Malaria Test is a fluorescence microscopy-based malaria diagnostic test that is also widely used. DNA detection (PCR) is used mainly in research and is useful for determining whether a patient has a recrudescence of the same malaria parasite or a reinfection with a new parasite. Diagnostic uses Quantitative buffy coat (QBC) is a laboratory test to detect infection with malaria or other blood parasites. In such cases the medical technologist may obtain a buffy coat, from which a blood smear is made. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1056",B

All of the following are true regarding DNA repair defect syndrome EXCEPT,HNPCC,Fanconi,AT-Tcl,Fragile X,"(D) Fragile X # HNPCC is caused by mutations in one of several different mismatch repair (MMR) genes including MutS homologue 2 (MSH2) and MutL homologue 1 (MLH1). These enzymes are involved in the detection of nucleotide mismatches and in the recognition of slipped-strand trinucleotide repeats. Germline mutations in these genes lead to microsatellite instability and a high mutation rate in colon cancer. This syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant transmission of colon cancer, young age (50 years) of presentation, predisposition to lesions in the proximal large bowel, and associated malignancies such as uterine cancer and ovarian cancer. Fanconi's anemia is also associated with an increased risk of multiple acquired genetic abnormalities. It is characterized by diverse congenital anomalies and a strong predisposition to develop aplastic anemia and acute myelogenous leukemia. Cells from these patients are susceptible to chromosomal breaks caused by a defect in genetic recombination. A least eight different complementation groups have been identified, and several loci and genes associated with Fanconi's anemia have been mapped or cloned. Ataxia telangiectasia causes large telangiectatic lesions of the face, cerebellar ataxia, immunologic defects, and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. The discovery of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene reveals tha: it is homologous to genes involved in DNA repair and control of cell cycle checkpoints. Mutations in the ATM gene give rise to defects in meiosis as well as increasing susceptibility to damage from ionizing radiation. Trinucleotide expansion was first recognized as a cause of the fragile X syndrome, one of the most common causes of mental retardation.",D

"In the UIP, blindness can be prevented by the administration of-",Measles vaccines,Rubella vaccines,BCG vaccines,Diphtheria vaccines,"Amongst the respiratory tract infection, measles is related to malnutrition.
It is related to malnutrition in both ways, i.e. -


Measles tends to be more severe in the malnourished child.
In a healthy child, measles precipitates malnutrition.


That means measles predisposes malnutrition and vice versa.
All cases of severe measles and all cases of measles in areas with high case-fatality rates should be treated with vitamin A, as many children develop an acute deficiency of vitamin A, which may lead to keratomalacia and blindness from corneal scarring.
So, vitamin 'A' should be administered along with the measles vaccine.
A high dose of vitamin A is given immediately on diagnosis of measles and repeated the next day. The recommended age-specific daily doses are 50,000 IU for infants aged < 6 months, 100,000 IU for infants aged 6-11 months, and 200,000 IU for children aged 12 months. If the child has clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency (Such as Bitot's spots) a third dose should be given 4-6 weeks later.",A

Metabolic acidosis is compensated by,Hyper ventilation,|HCO3 loss,|Cl- loss,|ammonia excretion in kidney,"i.e. (Hyperventilation): (289-90-H17th) (860-CMDT-l1)Metabolic acidosis is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much acid or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body.Those in metabolic acidosis may exhibit deep, rapid breathing called Kussmaul respirations which is classically associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Rapid deep breaths increase the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled,Arterial blood gas sampling is essential for the diagnosis. If the pH is low (under 7.35) and the bicarbonate levels are decreased (<24mmol/l), metabolic acidemia is present, and metabolic acidosis is presumed. Due to respiratory compensation (hyperventilation), carbon dioxide is decreased and conversely oxygen is increased, thus lowering the serum carbon dioxide levels, resulting in some degree of compensation.Compensatory mechanismsMetabolic acidosis is either due to increased generation of acid or an inability to generate sufficient bicarbonate.The body regulates the acidity of the blood by four buffering mechanisms.* bicarbonate buffering system* intracellular buffering by absorption of hydrogen atoms by various molecules, including proteins, phosphates and carbonate in bone.* Respiratory compensation* Renal compensationBufferThe decreased bicarbonate that distinguishes metabolic acidosis is therefore due to two separate processes the buffer (from water and carbon dioxide) and additional renal generation. The buffer reactions are:H+ + HCO3' - H2CO3 - CO2 + H2OThe Henderson - Hasselbalch equation mathematically describes the relationship between blood pH and the components of the bicarbonate buffering system.",A

"A child with Acute myeloid Leukemia presents with Hyperleukocytosis. Treatment'includes all of the following, Except:",IV fluids,Allopurinol,Alkalinization,Immediately sta induction chemotherapy,"Answer is D (Immediately sta induction chemotherapy) Immediate treatment of Hyperleukocytosis is leukocytoreduction which is generally achieved by Leukopharesis or administration of Hydroxyurea. Induction chemotherapy is initiated early in treatment after attempts at leukocytoreduction but not immediately. Immediate induction chemotherapy is the single best answer of exclusion. Immediate Administration of induction chemotherapy to a patient with hyperleukocytosis carries a high risk of Acute tumor lysis syndrome and hence induction chemotherapy is often not initiated immediately but generally follows attempts at cytoreduction. IV hydration, Allopurinol and alkalinization of urine are measures to reduce the metabolic complications of tumor lysis syndrome and are indicated as preventive measures in patients with Leukostasis and hyperleukocytosis. Hyperleukocytosis and Leukostasis (Independent poor prognostic factor in acute leukemia) Hyperleucocytosis is a condition in which patients with acute leukemia present with an extraordinary high leukocyte count usually greater than 100,000. The high number of circulating blasts increase the blood viscocity and predispose to the development of Leukostasis. Leukostasis refers to sludging of leukemia blasts in the microcirculation leading to obstruction of small vessels especially in the cerebral and pulmonary circulations. Once identified leukostasis requires immediate and effective treatment to lower the blast count rapidly.",D

Which of the following is a major criteria for diagnosis of poycythemia vera:,Presence of JAK-2 mutation,Low Erythropoetin levels,High Leucocyte Alkaline Phosphatase (TLAP score),Thrombocytosis,"Answer is A (Presence of JAK-2 mutation) Presence of JAK-2 mutation is a Major criterion fir diagnosis of polycythemia Vera according to the proposed new WHO criteria for the diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera. Low Erythropoetin levels, Thrombocytosis and increased LAP scores are all minor criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia Vera. JAK-2 Mutation and Polycythemia Vera JAK-2 is a member of an evolutionarily well conserved, non receptor tyrosine kinase family and serves as the cognate tyrosine kinase for the erythropoietin receptors A mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK-2 appears to have a central role in the pathogenesis of PV by causing constitutive activation of the kinase The presence of JAK -2 mutation thus allows for the exclusion of a reactive erythrocytosis. The 2001 WHO criteria for diagnosis of PV were however developed prior to the discovery of this impoant mutation and hence revised WHO criteria have been developed that include presence of JAK-2 mutation as a major criterion for diagnosis of PV Note : Although presence of JAK-2 mutation is a major criterion for diagnosis of PV, the presence of JAK-2 mutation alone is not diagnostic of PV. JAK-2 mutations may also be seen in other myeloproliferative disorders such as Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and Chronic Idiopathic Myelojlbrosis (CIMF).

Therefore it is started one week before a smoker s target quit date,o Bupropion monotherapy doubles the likelihood of smoking cessation compared to placebo.Varenicilineo Vareniciline is a partial agonist at the alpha-4 beta-2 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The receptor that appears to produce the reinforcing effects of nicotine and leads to nicotine dependence.It aids smoking cessation in two ways# Firstly, as a partial agonist it binds to and produces the partial stimulation of the alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor thereby reducing the symptoms of nicotine withdrawl.# Secondly since vareniciline binds to the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor subunit with high affinity it blocks the nicotine in tobacco smoking from binding to the receptor.; there ????",B
A patient presents with features of ataxia. He gives a h/o a painless penile ulcer around 3 years ago that was followed by a maculopapular rash. He is staed on treatment. The MOST sensitive test to monitor him while on treatment is:,VDRL (Veneral Disease Research Laboratory),RPR,TPI,CSF pleocytosis,"This is case of Tabes dorsalis. It is a late manifestation of syphilis that presents as symptoms and signs of demyelination of the posterior columns, dorsal roots, and dorsal root ganglia. Symptoms: Ataxic wide-based gait and foot drop Paresthesia Bladder disturbances Impotence Areflexia Loss of positional, deep-pain, and temperature sensations. The activity of neurosyphilis (symptomatic or asymptomatic) correlates best with CSF pleocytosis, and this measure provides the most sensitive index of response to treatment. Efficacy of treatment in patients with primary or secondary syphilis assessed by clinical evaluation and monitoring of the quantitative VDRL or RPR titer for a fourfold decline.

A median is described as the value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.
It does not depend on the total, and number of items.
To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or descending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median.
For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows -

83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84
Now data is arranged in ascending order -
71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95

Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from lower four values, so it is the median.
If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values.
For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows :-

83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90
Data is arranged in ascending order -
71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95


Here two values are separating the upper half of values from lower half. So the median here is -

Median = (79 + 81) / 2 = 80
Advantage of median

The value of median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value.
Taking the example as was taken in mean -
The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows
5, 5, 5, 7,10, 20, 300 = (Total 352)
Here mean = 50.3
median = 7
The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas median is not affected, and median is more nearer to the truth.
So, median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values → median is used for skewed distribution.",B

These organisms are foreign to potable water. Therefore their presence is looked upon as evidence of fecal contamination.* They are easily detected by culture methods* Longer survival as compared to other water borne pathogens* They have greater resistance to the forces of natural purification, as compared to water borne pathogensOther Indicators Include* Faecal streptococci: Faecal streptococci regularly occur in faeces, but in much smaller numbers than E. coll. Their presence is regarded as important confirmatory evidence of recent faecal pollution of water.* Cl. perfringens: They also occur regularly in faeces and their spores are capable of surviving in water for a longer time than organisms of the coliform group. So, the presence of spores in the absence of the coliform group, suggests that faecal contamination occurred at some remote time.",D

Clinically characterised by insidious onset with mild fever and an irritating cough, gradually becoming paroxysmal with the characteristic whoop often with cyanosis and vomiting. Also known as ""Hundred day cough"". AGENT FACTORS:- 1. Agent-B.peussis. Small percentage of case are caused by B.parapeussis, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus. 2. Source of infection- B.peussis infects only man. The source of infection is a case of peussis. Chronic carrier state doesn&;t exist. 3. Infective material- Nasopharyngeal and bronchial secretions. Objects freshly contaminated by such discharges are also infective. 4. Infectious period- most infectious during catarrhal stage. Infective period may be considered to an extend from a week after exposure to about 3 weeks after the onset of paroxysmal stage although communicability dimnishes after catarrhal stage. 5. Secondary attack rate-90% in unimmunized household contacts. HOST FACTORS:- 1. Age- primarily affects infants and pre-schoolchildren. Highest incidence found below 5 years of age. Infants below 6 months have highest moality. 2. Sex- more among female. 3. Immunity-Recovery from whooping cough/adequate immunization is followed by immunity. Infants are susceptible to infection from bih because maternal antibody doesn&;t appear to give protection. 4. No cross immunity with B.parapeussis. Mode of transmission:- Mainly by droplet infection and direct contact. Each time the patient coughs,sneezes or talks, the bacilli are sprayed into the air. The role of fomites in the spread of disease appears to be very small , unless they are freshly contaminated.

The bacilli spread through blood, being protected from phagocytes by their capsule. Haemophilus meningitis is the most important infection in this group, others being laryngoepiglottits, conjunctivitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, arthritis, endocarditis and pericarditis. These infections are usually seen in children and are caused by the capsulated strains, type b accounting for most cases. In the second group, the bacillus spreads by local invasion along mucosal surfaces and causes secondary or superadded infections, usually of the respiratory tract. These include otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. These are usually seen in adults and are often caused the non-capsulated strains.

A 50-year-old know asthmatic develops sudden onset right-sided chest pain with dyspnea. Chest X-ray reveals hyperlucency on right side with shift of trachea to left side. The best option of treatment for immediate relief of symptoms is,Intravenous morphine,"Nebulization of beta 2 agonist, Ex salbutamol",Intravenous aminophylline,Water seal intercostal drainage on right side of chest,"Patient might have developed pneumothorax , Pathophysiology Airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) - the tendency for airways to narrow excessively in response to triggers that have little or no effect in normal individuals - is integral to the diagnosis of asthma and appears to be related, although not exclusively, to airway inflammation . Other factors likely to be impoant in the behaviour of airway smooth muscle include the degree of airway narrowing and neurogenic mechanisms. The relationship between atopy (the propensity to produce IgE) and asthma is well established and in many individuals there is a clear relationship between sensitisation and allergen exposure, as demonstrated by skin-prick reactivity or elevated serum-specific IgE. Common examples of allergens include house dust mites, pets such as cats and dogs, pests such as cockroaches, and fungi. Inhalation of an allergen into the airway is followed by an early and late-phase bronchoconstrictor response . Allergic mechanisms are also implicated in some cases of occupational asthma . In cases of aspirin-sensitive asthma, the ingestion of salicylates results in inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes, preferentially shunting the metabolism of arachidonic acid through the lipoxygenase pathway with resultant production of the asthmogenic cysteinyl leukotrienes. In exercise-induced asthma, hyperventilation results in water loss from the pericellular lining fluid of the respiratory mucosa, which, in turn, triggers mediator release. Heat loss from the respiratory mucosa may also be impoant. In persistent asthma, a chronic and complex inflammatory response ensues, characterised by an influx of numerous inflammatory cells, the transformation and paicipation of airway structural cells, and the secretion of an array of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Examination of the inflammatory cell profile in induced sputum samples demonstrates that, although asthma is predominantly characterised by airway eosinophilia, neutrophilic inflammation predominates in some patients while in others scant inflammation is observed: so-called 'pauci- granulocytic' With increasing severity and chronicity of the disease, remodelling of the airway may occur, leading to fibrosis of the airway wall, fixed narrowing of the airway and a reduced response to bronchodilator medication. Chest drains also known as under water sealed drains (UWSD) are inseed to allow draining of the pleural spaces of air, blood or fluid, allowing expansion of the lungs and restoration of negative pressure in the thoracic cavity. The underwater seal also prevents backflow of air or fluid into the pleural cavity Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 568",D

The causative agent is -",Trichinella spiralis,Giardialamblia,Enterobius vermicularis,Wuchereria bancrofti,"Enterobius vermicularis (threadworm) This helminth is common worldwide and affects mainly children.After the ova are swallowed, development takes place in thesmall intestine but the adult worms are found chiefly in the colon. Clinical features The female lays ova around the anus, causing intense itching, especially at night. The ova are often carried to the mouth on the fingers and so reinfection or human-to-human infection occurs . In females, the genitalia may be involved. The adult worms may be seen moving on the buttocks or in the stool. Investigations Ova are detected in stool samples or by applying the adhesive surface of cellophane tape to the perianal skin in the morning. This is then examined on a glass slide under the microscope. A perianal swab, moistened with saline, also allows diagnosis. Management A single dose of mebendazole (100 mg), albendazole (400 mg), pyrantel pamoate (11 mg/kg) or piperazine (4 g) treats infection and is repeated after 2 weeks to control auto-reinfection. If infection recurs in a family, each member should be treated. All nightclothes and bed linen are laundered during treatment. Fingernails must be kept sho and hands washed carefully before meals. Subsequent therapy is reserved for family members with recurrent infection. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1077",C

Cause of vasodilatation in spider nevi,Hepatotoxins,FSH,Estrogen,Testosterone,"Spider angiomas form due to failure of the sphincteric muscle surrounding a cutaneous aeriole. The central red dot is the dilated aeriole and the red ""spider legs"" are small capillaries carrying away the freely flowing blood. If momentary pressure is applied, it is possible to see the emptied capillaries refilling from the center. No other angiomas show this phenomenon. The dilation, in turn, is caused by increased estrogen levels in the blood. Many pregnant women and women using hormonal contraception have spider angiomas, which is due to high estrogen levels in their blood. Individuals with significant liver disease also show many spider angiomas, as their liver cannot metabolize circulating estrogens, specifically estrone, which derives from the androgen androstenedione Ref - Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_angioma",C

Res ipsa loquitar is?,Common knowledge,Medical maloccurance,Fact speaks for itself,Oral evidence,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Fact speaks for itself o It means ""the thing or fact speaks for itself"".o In a case of professional negligence of a physician, the patient need not prove negligence.Doctrines related with negligence1) Resp Ipsa Loquitar (fact speaks for itself):# Generally the innocence of doctor is assumed and patient has to establish the guilt# However, it is not required to prove negligence in case where doctrine of resp ipsa loquitar applies; rather the doctor has to defend himself.2) Calculated risk doctrine:# It is a defence to doctor. It states that 'resp ipsa loquitar should not be applied when the complained injury may have occured even through proper care has been taken.3) Doctrine of common knowledge:# Is a varient of res ipsa loquitar in which patient has to prove the negligence but he need not produce evidence to establish the standard of care (in res ipsa loquitar both are not required).# It is based on assumption that the doctor will be held responsible for negligence in particular case which are within the common knowledge of medical practioner e.g. not giving fluids in dehydrated or ATS in injuries.4) Diagnostic or Therapeutic misadvanture:# It is the occurance of misadvanture causing injury or death of the patient due to inherent risk of procedure or drug, e.g. adverse effects of a drug. It is unintetional.5) Medical maloccurance (inevitable accident or Act of god):# On certain occasions, despite all proper care given by doctor during treatment, the patient may fails to respond properly or may suffer adverse reactions of drug. It is due to biological variations in different people.6) Novus Actus Interveniens :# A person is responsible for his actions and its consequences. This principle applies to cases of assault or accidental injuries. However, sometime such continuty of events is broken by an entirely new and unexpected happening, due to negligence of some other person, i.e. ""novus actus intervenien"" (an unrelated action intervening).# For example, If a person has been assaulted due to which he has sustained large liver laceration, for which he is operated by a surgeon. If the patient dies intraoperatively or postopratively due to complications related to surgery or injury, the person who has assaulted the patient will be held responsible. But, if the doctor has done some negligent act during surgery, e.g. left the swab or instrument in abdomen during surgery; and patient dies because of that act (sepsis due to swab), then the resposibility may pass from original incident to later negligent act of doctor by principle of 4novus actus intervention' (an unrelated action intervening). Thus doctor is responsible for negligent act, i.e. criminal negligence, and the assailant will not be fully responsible for the ultimate harm.7) Contributory negligence:# It is defined as concurrent or simultaneous negligence of doctor and patient so as to lead to damage to the patient.# Normally it is only a partial defence and court has right to fix liabilities between doctor and patient (doctrine of comparative negligence) and damages awarded may be reduced accordingly.# Contributory negligence can be used as defence by the doctor, but in civil cases only. It cannot be used as defence in followingi) Criminal negligenceii) Last clear chance doctrine; i.e. if doctor has discovered it before causing injury and failed to avoid that.iii) Avoidable consequences rule; i.e. due to negligence of doctor, there occurs damage to patient, but due to later damage of patient, damage becomes more.Good samartion doctrine: One who assisted another in serious need cannot be charged for contributory negligence, provided that the assistance is not rash and reckless.8) Vicarious responsibility (Liability):# It means master is liable for negligent acts of his servants, even inspite of absence of blame-worthy conduct on his part.# Thus hospital and senior medical staff are responsible for negligent act of junior medical staff (interns and resident doctors). This responsibility is there because of master servant relationship, i.e. the senior can dictate the line of treatment to be followed. However, hospital is not responsible for senior medical staff as master servent relationship does not exist.# The vicarious responsibility is there only in civil negligence cases and not in criminal cases.9) Borrowed servant doctrine (captain of the ship doctrine):# The private practitioner, who is not a staff of a private hospital, will be held responsible for all the negligent acts by any of the hospital staff on the patient admitted by him.# The hospital will not be held here liable, because all the instructions for the patient admitted is carried on by hospital staff as told by private practitioner (i.e. he is the captain of the ship).10) Product liability:# Manufacturer is liable for quality of drug and medical equipment.",C

Which is the least affected joint in Ankylosing spondylitis,Wrist and hand,Sacroiliac joint,Costochondral joint,Acromio-clavicular joint,"In patients eventually diagnosed with AS, symptoms are usually first noticed in late adolescence or early adulthood, at a median age in the mid-twenties. In 5% of patients, symptoms begin after age 40. The initial symptom is usually dull pain, insidious in onset, felt deep in the lower lumbar or gluteal region, accompanied by low-back morning stiffness of up to a few hours' duration that improves with activity and returns following inactivity. Within a few months, the pain has usually become persistent and bilateral. Nocturnal exacerbation of pain often forces the patient to rise and move around. In some patients, bony tenderness (presumably reflecting enthesitis or osteitis) may accompany back pain or stiffness, whereas in others it may be the predominant complaint. Common sites include the costosternal junctions, spinous processes, iliac crests, greater trochanters, ischial tuberosities, tibial tubercles, and heels. Hip and shoulder (""root"" joint) ahritis is considered pa of axial disease. Hip ahritis occurs in 25-35% of patients. Shoulder involvement may be at least as common, but is usually less symptomatic. Severe isolated hip ahritis or bonychest pain may be the presenting complaint, and symptomatic hipdisease can dominate the clinical picture. Ahritis of peripheral joints other than the hips and shoulders, usually asymmetric, may occur at any point in the disease course. Neck pain and stiffness from involvement of the cervical spine are usually relatively late manifestations, but are occasionally dominant symptoms. Ref Harrisons 20e p2567",A

"Arterial blood gas analysis of a patient reveals-pH 7.2, HCO3 36 mmol/L pCO2 60 mm of Hg. The abnormality is -",Respiratory acidosis with metabolic alkalosis,Respiratory acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis with,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic acidosis,"In this patient
pH → decreased (acidosis) N → 7.4
HCO3- → Increased (N → 24 mm Hg ± 2)
PCO2 → Increased (N → 40 Hg ± 2 )
First step

Determine whether it is acidosis or alkalosis
Decreased pH (7.2) suggests acidosis.

Second step

observe HCO3-/PCO2 to determine the cause of acidosis or alkalosis
PCO2 is increased which indicates respiratory acidosis.
HCO3- is increased which indicates metabolic alkalosis
The abnormality which is in sync with the change in pH is increased pCO2 i.e., increased pCO2 is responsible for decreased pH or acidosis So the primary abnormality in this case is respiratory acidosis.

Third step

This step requires determining whether the patient's compensation is appropriate 
Change in PCO2 → 20 mm Hg. (N — 40, observed 60)
Expected change in HCO3- → 2 mmol/L for 20 mm Hg change in PCO2
(For every 10 mm increase in PCO2, HCO3- increases to 1 mmol/L)
So the expected value of HCO3- → 26 mmol/L
But the observed value of HCO3- → 36 mmol/L
This suggests that some other abnormality other than respiratory acidosis exists which has increased the HCO3- value to more than expected.
A disorder which increases the HCO3- concentration is metabolic alkalosis
Thus this is a case of mixed disorder, where respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis exist together.",A

Contralateral hemiplegia suggests brainstem involvement. Impoant: Contralateral hemiplegia suggests brainstem involvement. In cases of isolated oculomotor palsy, the subarachnoid space is the most likely site of pathology. The differential includes a posterior communicating aery aneurysm, uncal herniation, compressive neoplasms, inflammatory lesions, or trauma. Causes for third-nerve palsy within the cavernous sinus include neoplasms, carotid aery aneurysm, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and carotid-cavernous fistula. Orbital lesions causing third-nerve palsies may be due to inflammation, trauma, neoplasms, and mucoceles.

Normal parent with 2 siblings having osteogenesis imperfecta. Pattern of inheritance is,Mutation,Anticipation,Genomic imprinting,Germline mosacism,"D i.e. Germline mosacism Differential expression of same gene depending on parent of origin is referred to as genomic imprinting. Germline (Gonadal) mosaicism results from a mutation only affecting cells destined to form gonads - postzygotically during early embryonic development. So the individual (parent) is phenotypically normal but can transmit the disease to offsprings through mutant gametesQ. And because the progenitor cells of gametes carry mutation, there is a high possibility that more than 1 child of such parent would be affected.",D

"Due to an effective prevention program, the pre valence of an infectious disease in a community has been reduced by 90%. A physician continues to use the same diagnostic test for the disease that she has always used. How have the test’s characteristics changed?",Its sensitivity has increased,Its positive predictive value has increased,The test’s characteristics have not changed,Its negative predictive value has increased,"PPV and NPV of a screening test depends on:

– Sensitivity
– Specificity
– Prevalence of disease in the population
In this question, since a physician continues to use the same diagnostic test for the disease that she has always used, sensitivity and specificity of the test will remain same
But predictive value of a test (PPV and NPV) depends on prevalence of a disease in a population

PPV is directly proportional to prevalence of disease in the population

– PPV á Prevalence of disease
– As the prevalence of a disease increases in a population, PPV increases for the screening test

NPV is inversely proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population

– NPV α 1/ Prevalence of disease
– As the prevalence of a disease increases in a population, NPV decreases for the screening test
Therefore, since the prevalence of an infectious disease in a community has been reduced by 90%, its PPV will reduce and its NPV will increase",D

All of the following statements about purificationof water are true except:,Presence of Clostridial spores indicate recent contamination of water,Coliforms must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample of drinking water,Sodium thiosulphate is used to neutralize chlorine,Coliforms may be detected by multiple tube method & indole production,"Presence of Clostridial spores indicate recent contamination of water Repeat from May 10 Presence of Clostridial spores indicate remote fecal contamination of water The spores of Clostridium perfringens survive in water for a longer time and usually resist chlorination at the doses normally used in water works. So, ""The presence of spores of Cl. perfringens in a natural water suggest that fecal contamination has. occured and their presence, in the absence of the coliform group suggests that .fecal contamination occured at some remote time"" -Park 20/e, p 630 Rest of the three options are true, as explained below Bacteriological quality of drinking water (WHO guidelines) Organism Guideline value All water intended for drinking . - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria * Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. * Treated water entering the distribution system - E. coli or thermotolerant coliform bacteria - Total coliform bacteria . - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample - Must not be detectable in any 100 ml sample. In case of large supplies, where sufficient samples are examined, must not be present in 95% of sample taken throughout any 12- month period. Note - Although E. coli is the more precise indicator of faecal pollution, the count of thermotolerant coliform bacteria is an acceptable alternative. If necessary, proper confirmatory test must be carried out. Total coliform bacteria are not acceptable indicators of the sanitary quality of rural water supplies, paicularly in tropical areas where many bacteria of no sanitary significance occur in almost all untreated supplies. So it is evident that colifonns should not be detectable in any 100 ml sample except for 5% of samples of large supplies taken over 12-month period. Surveillance of drinking water quality Sanitary survey - On-the-spot inspection and evaluation of the entire water supply system. Sampling - Collection of water samples has to be done with through aseptic precaution and according to guidelines. Bacteriological surveillance - A complete bacteriological examination consists of - (1) Presumptive coliform test (a) Multiple tube method - Estimation of the most probable number (MPN) of coliform organisms in 100 ml of water Confirmatory tests: In chlorinated water, presence of coliform organism is to be confirmed by Eijkman's test: Subculturing each presumptive positive tube in 2 tubes of brillian green bile broth. One tube is incubated at 37degC x 48 hrs to confirm coliform organism Other tube is incubated at 44degC x 6-24 hrs to confirm E. coli which produces gas from lactose at 44degC. - Fuher confirmation of E. coli can be obtained by testing for indole production at 44degC. (b) Membrane filtration technique (2) The detection of faecal streptococci and Cl. perfringens in doubtful cases of faecal pollutionof water. (3) Colony count - provides an estimate of the general bacterial purity of water. Counts from the same source at frequent intervals may be of considerable value in comparison to single count. A sudden increase in the colony count may give the earliest indication of contamination. Biological examination - The microscopic organisms such as algae, fungi, yeast, protozoa, rotifers, crustaceans, minute worms etc. are called as 'plankton'. They are an index of pollution of water. Chemical surveillance: Basic tests include test for pH, color, turbidity, chlorides, ammonia, chlorine demand and residual chlorine. Complete analysis will include analysis for toxic metals, pesticides, persistent organic chemical and radioactivity too. Sodium thiosulphate an antidote of cynanide poisoning is also used in water purification: - For dechlorination to reduce chlorinous taste after superchlorination of highly polluted waters, swimming pool or spas - To dechlorinate tap water for aquarium or treat effluent from waste water treatment prior to release into rivers.",A

Death can occur within minutes as a result of ventricular fibrillation, and immediate treatment is mandatory. Intravenous calcium is given to combat the membrane effects of the hyperkalemia, and measures to shift, potassium acutely into the cells must be instituted as well. IV regular insulin 10 units and (unless the patient is already hyperglycemic) IV glucose (usually 25 g) can lower the serum potassium level by 0.5 to 1.0 mEq/L. Nebulized albuterol is often used and is probably more effective than IV sodium bicarbonate. It is crucial to remember that measures to promote potassium loss from the body (Kayexalate, furosemide, or dialysis), although important in the long run, take hours to work. These measures will not promptly counteract the membrane irritability of hyperkalemia. IV normal saline will not lower the serum potassium level.",D

In Homosexual, it is done by a male on another male. Heterosexual sodomy is anal intercourse with a women. The person who does the act is knowm as active agent and the person, on wrhom the act is done, is known as passive agent. If the passive agent is adult/elderly the act is knowTi as Gerontophilia. If the passive agent in sodomy is a child, act is called Paederasty, the passive agent is labelled as catamite, and the active agent is known as Paedophile,o Examination findings of sodomy areIn active agent: (i) Peculiar smell of anal gland secretion on penis, (ii) Fecal soiling, lubricant (if used) and blood on penis, (iii) Penis shaft is elongated and constricted in habitual sodomites with consequent twisting/ angulation of urethra, (iv) Abrasions on prepuce and glans penis, tearing of frenulum, swelling and redness of penis.In passive agent: Passive agent may beHabitual: (i) Funnel shaped anus with deeply situated ana! opening, (ii) Dilatation and laxity of anal sphincter, (iii) Shaved anal skin, (iv) Anal fissures and piles, (v) Lateral buttock truction test positive: On applying lateral traction on anus in normal person, there will be reflex contraction of anus, but in habitual sodomine there is comple relaxation of sphincter with dilatation of opening.Non-habitual (forcibly victimized) : (i) Presence ofsemen in anus is the only confirmatery evidence, (ii) Signs of violence around anus, i.e. abrasions, fisures, contusion or triangular bruised tear of posterior part of anus (in sudden violence).Other unnatural sexual offenceso Bestiality: is the sexual intercourse by a human being with a lower animal.o Tribadism (Lesbianism or female homosexuality): Sexual gratification of a women is obtained by another woman by kissing, body contact, manipulation of breast and genitalia.

A 60 year old man is suspected of having bronchogenic ca: TB has been ruled out in this pt. What should be the next investigation,CT guided FNAC,Bronchoscopy and biopsy,Sputum cytology,X-Ray chest,"Answer is B (Bronchoscopy and biopsy) : Fibreoptic bronchoscopy with a brochial or transbronchial biopsy is the better option here as it also allows direct visualization of the tumor mass 'The screening of lung cancer by means of sputum cytology & chest radiographs is not very effective'-H1401/255 Once signs/symptoms or screening studies suggest a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma it is necessary to establish a tissue diagnosis of malignancy. From the options provided tumor tissues can be obtained by a bronchial or transbronchial biopsy during fibreoptic bronchoscopy or CT guided FNAC. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy is the preferred initial investigation to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Approach to diagnosis The first investigation while investigating a case of haemoptysis: should be 'X-Ray chest'. Once X-Ray chest suggests bronchogenic carcinoma (i.e. suspected mass) the next investigation should be Bronchoscopy An HR-CT should be done only if bronchoscopy is negative. In this question we already suspect the diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma. The investigation protocol, therefore expects us to proceed fuher from this point, hence a bronchoscopy should be the next investigation. HRCT and guided FNAC is done only if bronchoscopy is negative. As TB has already been ruled out sputum cytology is not the investigation to be done.",B

Reactivation tuberculosis is usually seen at -,Apical and posterior segments of upper lobes,Middle lobe,Lower lobe,Pleural space,"Ans is 'a' i.e., Apical and posterior segments of upper lobes Postprimary (adult-type) disease/Reactivation (Secondary) tuberculosis* Also referred to as reactivation or secondary TB, postprimary TB is probably most accurately termed adult-type TB, since it may result from endogenous reactivation of distant latent infection or recent infection (primary infection or reinfection).* It is usually localized to the apical and posterior segments of the upper lobes, where the substantially higher mean oxygen tension (compared with that in the lower zones) favors mycobacterial growth.* The extent of lung parenchymal involvement varies greatly, from small infiltrates to extensive cavitary disease. With cavity formation, liquefied necrotic contents are ultimately discharged into the airways and may undergo bronchogenic spread, resulting in satellite lesions within the lungs that may in turn undergo.* Massive involvement of pulmonary segments or lobes, with coalescence of lesions, produces caseating pneumonia.* While up to one-third of untreated patients reportedly succumb to severe pulmonary TB within a few months after onset (the classic ""galloping consumption"" of the past), others may undergo a process of spontaneous remission or proceed along a chronic, progressively debilitating course (""consumption"" or phthisis).* Early in the course of disease, symptoms and signs are often nonspecific and insidious, consisting mainly of diurnal fever and night sweats due to defervescence, weight loss, anorexia, general malaise, and weakness. However, in up to 90% of cases, cough eventually develops--often initially nonproductive and limited to the morning and subsequently accompanied by the production of purulent sputum, sometimes with blood streaking.* Hemoptysis develops in 20-30% of cases, and massive hemoptysis may ensue as a consequence of the erosion of a blood vessel in the wall of a cavity.* Hemoptysis, however, may also result from rupture of a dilated vessel in a cavity (Rasmussen's aneurysm) or from aspergilloma formation in an old cavity.* The most common hematologic findings are mild anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis with a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein level.",A

"A 35-year-old woman complains of aching all over. She sleeps poorly and all her muscles and joints hurt. Her symptoms have progressed over several years. She reports that she is desperate because pain and weakness often cause her to drop things. Physical examination shows multiple points of tenderness over the neck, shoulders, elbows, and wrists. There is no joint swelling or deformity. A complete blood count and ESR are normal. Rheumatoid factor is negative. Which of the following is the best therapeutic option in this patient?",Graded aerobic exercise,Prednisone,Weekly methotrexate,Hydroxychloroquine,"The patient's multiple tender points, associated sleep disturbance, and lack of joint or muscle findings make fibromyalgia a likely diagnosis. Patients with fibromyalgia often report dropping things due to pain and weakness, but objective muscle weakness is not present on examination. The diagnosis hinges on the presence of multiple tender points in the absence of any other disease likely to cause musculoskeletal symptoms. CBC and ESR are characteristically normal. Cognitive behavioral therapy and graded aerobic exercise programs have been demonstrated to relieve symptoms. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered if medication is needed and may help restore sleep. Cyclobenzaprine is a next step medication. If both of those fail, then a trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, or duloxetine can be undertaken. Aspirin, other anti-inflammatory drugs (including corticosteroids), and DMARDs (such as methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine) are not helpful, nor are simple stretching/flexibility exercises. Of note, rheumatoid factor and ANAs occur in a small number of normal individuals. They are more frequent in women and increase in frequency with age. It is not uncommon for an individual with fibromyalgia and an incidentally positive RF or ANA to be misdiagnosed as having collagen vascular disease. Therefore, it is necessary to be careful to separate subjective tenderness on examination from objective musculoskeletal findings and to assiduously search for other criteria before diagnosing RA, SLE, or other collagen vascular disease.",A

Thiamine deficiency is seen in all except,Chronic diarrhoea,Chronic alcoholism,Homocystinemia,Food faddist,"Homocysteinemia Thiamine was the first vitamin to be identified and is therefore called as vitamin Bl. Thiamine deficiency or beriberi refers to the lack of thiamine pyrophosphate, the active form of the vitamin . Thiamine pyrophosphate acts as a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism through the decarboxylation of alphaketoacids and in the formation of glucose by acting as a coenzyme for the transketolase in the pentose monophosphate pathway Causes of Thiamine deficiency Persons may become deficient in thiamine either by not ingesting enough vitamin B-1 through the diet or by excess use, which may occur in hypehyroidism, pregnancy, lactation, or fever (sates of high energy consumption, such as hypehyroidism, pregnancy, or severe illness, require more thiamine and other nutrients.) Prolonged diarrhea may impair the body's ability to absorb vitamin B-1, and severe liver disease impairs its use. Decreased absorption is seen in - Diarrhea - Chronic intestinal disease - Alcoholism - Malnutrition - Gastric bypass surgery - Malabsorption syndrome - Celiac and tropical sprue - Hyperemesis gravidarum - Long term starvation - Fad diets( Fad diets often do not contain necessary amounts of thiamine) Increased depletion is seen in - Diuretic therapies - Peritoneal dialysis - Hemodialysis(Dialysis robs thiamine from the circulation) Alcohol is known to interfere directly with the absorption of thiamine and with the synthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate.( thiamine should always be replenished when refeeding a patient with alcoholism, as carbohydrate repletion without adequate thiamine can precipitate acute thiamine deficiency.) Beriberi has been repoed among refugees who are relying on emergency food aids. This is due to the lack of available micronutrition supplementation Food faddism and fad diet are terms which refer to the tendency for idiosyncratic diets and eating patterns. A fad diet is supposed and promoted to improve health but may do nothing at all, or even have the opposite results if it is nutritionally unbalanced and unconfirmed by scientific studies Developing countries are known to have more vitamin deficiency problems in general Pathophysiology (Beriberi) In healthy individuals who are deprived of thiamine, thiamine stores are depleted in approximately 1 month. However, within a week of no thiamine intake, healthy people develop a resting tachycardia, weakness, and decreased deep tendon reflexes and some people develop a peripheral neuropathy. Nervous system involvement is termed dry beriberi. Dry beriberi involves both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. - Peripheral nerve involvement is typically a symmetric motor and sensory neuropathy with pain , parasthesias, and loss of reflexes. The legs are affected more than the arms. - Central nervous system involvement results in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. - Wernicke's encephalopathy consists of nystagmus progressing to ophthalmoplegia, truncal ataxia, and confnsion. When there is additional loss of memory and a confabulatory psychosis, the syndrome is known as WernikeKorsakoff syndrome. Wet beriberi is the term used for the cardiovascular involvement of thiamine deficiency. Wet beriberi is characterized by marked peripheral vasodilation resulting in high-output hea .failure with dyspnea, tachycardia, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary and peripheral edema, with warm extremities mimicking cellulitis. Diagnosis In most instances, the clinical response to empiric thiamine therapy is used to suppo a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency. The most commonly used and widely available biochemical tests are measurement of erythrocyte transketolase activity and urinary thiamine excretion",C

Gastric lavage is contraindicated in:,Sulphuric acid poisoning,Organophosphorus poisoning,Datura poisoning,Salicylate poisoning,"Ans: a (Sulphuric acid poisoning)Ref: Reddy, 29th ed., Pg. 492Gastric lavage or gastric irrigation, is the process of cleaning out the contents of the stomach. Apart from toxicology, gastric lavage (or nasogastric lavage) is sometimes used to confirm levels of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal tract.Gastric lavage is used infrequently in modem poisonings and some authorities have suggested that it notbe used routinely, if ever, in poisoning situations. Lavage should only be considered if the amount of poison ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.Lavage is contraindicated when patients have a compromised, unprotected airway and in patients at risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation. Relative contraindications include when the poisoning is due to a corrosive substance , hydrocarbons, or for poisons that have an effective antidote.",A
Group of 4-8 expes talking in front of a large group of audience is known as: September 2011,Symposium,Workshop,Seminar,Panel discussion,"Ans. D: Panel Discussion In a panel discussion, 4-8 persons who are qualified to talk about the topic sit and discuss a given problem, or the topic, in front of a large group of audience Panel Discussion A panel consists of a small group of four or eight persons, who carry on a guided and informal discussion before an audience as if the panel were meeting alone. The proceedings of the panel should be the same as those described for informal discussion: volunteering of facts, asking questions, stating opinions-all expressed with geniality, with respect for the contributions of other members, without speech making, and without making invidious personal references. This primary function should occupy approximately two-thirds of the allotted time-say foy minutes of an hour's meeting. The secondary function of the panel is to answer questions from the audience. This discussion method is suitable for use when a relatively large audience is anticipated. The disadvantage of the method is that it confines most of the discussion to the panel itself. The audience listens and is given a chance to ask questions, but for the most pa is passive and receptive. Panel discussions, if well conducted, are usually more interesting to the audience than is the single-speaker forum. They provide sufficiently varied clash of opinion and presentation of facts to give even the quiet members of the audience a feeling of vicarious paicipation. Quality and tasks of leadership in panel discussion are similar to those described for informal discussion. The leader must in addition take special care to select panel members who can think and speak effectively. He must also be sure that they prepare themselves to discuss the subject. During the discussion by the panel the leader has substantially the same duties as in informal discussion except that he should keep himself more in the background as chairman of the panel. He can do so because each member of the panel is in reality an assistant to the leader and is responsible for specific contributions to the proceedings. When the subject is thrown open to the house, it is the leader's job to recognize appropriate questions and to reject those not bearing on the subject or involving personalities. Some questions he may answer himself, but usually he should repeat the question and call upon one of the panel to answer it. By preliminary announcement the leader may also tell the audience that they may direct questions at paicular members of the panel if they choose. In any case, during the question period the leader needs to maintain strict control.On many occasions this may be the toughest pa of his assignment to carry off efficiently and with good humor. While it is customary to confine audience questions to a specific period, some leaders permit questions from the floor at any time. Unless very carefully limited by the leader, this practice may interfere with effective discussion by the panel. Arranging the panel properly will lend effectiveness to this form of discussion.The members should face the audience.It is impoant that each panel member adjust his chair so that he can see every other member without effo the chairman will also find that the best places for his readiest speakers are at the extreme ends of the table.He should keep the more reticent members close to, him so that he can readily draw them out with direct questions. If the quieter ones sit on the fringes of the panel, the more voluble members are quite likely to monopolize the discussion.",D

The purpose of using anti-tubercular drug therapy in combination is:,To reduce the dosages of drugs,To reduce the adverse effects of the drugs,To reduce the possibility of drug resistance,All,"Ans. c (To reduce the possibility of drug resistance). (Ref. KDT, Pharmacology, 6th ed., p 739)PRINCIPLES OF ANTI-TB CHEMOTHERAPY# Multiple drugs used in combination will reduce the possibility of selecting drug-resistant strains and hence chances of relapse. Among the first-line drugs, pyrazinamide, being active in an acidic environment, takes care of the persistent intracellular bacilli.# In general, regimens that are adequate for treating pulmonary TB are also effective for treating extrapulmonary TB. The problem lies in deciding on the appropriate duration of treatment. By WHO criteria, all caries spine cases should be treated for a minimum of 6 months.# For the purpose of rationalizing and initiating treatment, WHO categorizes TB patients into four categories depending upon clinical severity and priority.# Treatment in a category is divided into initial, intensive, and subsequent continuation phases.# The intensive phase comprises maximum number of drugs given daily (preferably under supervision) and is intended to bring about rapid clinical amelioration and achieve non-infectivity. Treatment is then continued with 2 or 3 drugs given daily or intermittently to eliminate residual bacilli and prevent relapse.# The initial intensive phase drugs may need to be maintained into the continuation phase. It is recommended that for infants and children with miliary TB or bone and joint TB treatment should last at least 12 months. For adults with these forms of extrapulmonary TB, the patient's response to therapy should be monitored closely. If response is slow or inadequate, treatment may be prolonged on a case-by-case basis.# Treatment in HIV-positive individuals:# The treatment regimens as outlined above are also effective in the presence of HIV infection. Unfortunately, complex interactions between rifampicin and antiretroviral drugs may force withdrawal of conventional regimens. Rifabutin has been used as an alternative to rifampicin in such situations.",C

45-year-old man complains of back pain and multiple joints pain. X-Ray shows bilateral sacroilitis. Diagnosis could be: March 2005,Rheumatoid ahritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,Psoriatic ahritis,Osteoahritis,"Ans. B: Ankylosing spondylitis Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease, primarily affecting the axial skeleton of which sacroilitis is the hallmark. The disease pathogenesis is immune mediated as evident by raised IgA and close relationship with HLA B27. Immunologically there is interaction between class I HLA molecule B27 and T lymphocytes. Tumor necrosis factor has been identified as key regulatory cytokine.The age of onset is second or third decade of life and males are affected two to three times more than females. The risk factors for the disease are presence of HLA B27, male sex, positive family history, etc. Of them HLA B27 is most impoant as there is almost sixteen times increased chance of developing the disease amongst HLA B27 positive relatives. HLA B27 is present in almost 90%-95% cases. The clinical features are insidious onset, dull pain felt in lower lumber region, associated with morning stiffness lasting for few hours, there may be asymmetric ahritis of other joints mainly of lower limbs. Neck pain and stiffness is present in advanced cases. Physical findings include loss of spinal flexion, extension, lumber lordosis, diminished chest expansion, and exaggerated thoracic kyphosis.",B

Occurence of disease in excess of expected frequency is known as -,Endemic disease,Epidemic disease,Ecdemic disease,Sporadic,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Epidemic disease Epidemic The unusual occurrence in a community or region of disease, specific health-related behaviour (e.g., smoking) or other related events clearly in excess of expected frequency (expected occurrence). o The key words in the definition of epidemic are ""in excess of expected occurrence"" (for expected occurence frequency see above explanation). o The amount of disease occuring in the past, in the absence of an epidemic, defines expected frequency. So, when disease occurs in expected frequency in the absence of epidemic --> Endemic disease. o When conditions are ourable for disease agent, it may occur in excess of expected occurrence, i.e., endemic disease bursts into epidemic. o If normal expectancy is zero, even one case is considered epidemics. That means occurence of new disease in a community is an epidemic. Similarly reoccurrence of an eradicated/eliminated disease is an epidemic. Statistically speaking, epidemic is said to occur when number of cases exceed 'twice the standard detion' Some times term outbreak is used. for a small, usually localized epidemic. o Diseases causing epidemics are measles, chickenpox, and cholera. o Besides these there is modern slow epidemic of non-communicable diseases like CHD. Pandemic o An epidemic usually affecting a large propoion of population over a large geographic area such as a nation, e.g., influenza, Cholera El Tor and acute hemorrhagic conjuctivitis. Ecdemic o Disease that originates outside the geographic area in which it occurs. Sporadic o The cases occur irregularly, haphazardly from time to time ,and generally infrequently. o The cases are so few and separated widely in space and time that they show little or no connection with each other, nor a recognizable common source of infection. o Examples - Polio, Tetanus, meningococcal meningitis, Herpes Zoster. For easy to remember Sporadic ---> Disease occuring irregularly from time to time. Endemic --> Disease occuring regularly in expected frequency. Epidemic --> Disease occuring in excess of expected frequency. Pandemic --> Epidemic affecting a large propoion of population over a wide geographic area.",B

The best possible intervention for acute myocardial infarction is -,Streptokinase,Streptokinase and aspirin,Early primary coronary intervention,Streptokinase and heparin,"Ref : harrisons-manual-of-medicine-16th-edition pg no: 622-624 TREATMENT Initial Therapy Initial goals are to: (1) quickly identify if patient is candidate for reperfusion therapy, (2) relieve pain, and (3) prevent/treat arrhythmias and mechanical complications. * Aspirin should be administered immediately (162-325 mg chewed at presentation, then 162-325 mg PO qd), unless pt is aspirin-intolerant. * Perform targeted history, exam, and ECG to identify STEMI (1 mmST elevation in two contiguous leads or new LBBB) and appropriateness of reperfusion therapy , which reduces infarct size, LV dysfunction, and moality. * Primary PCI is generally more effective than fibrinolysis and is preferred at experienced centers capable of performing procedure rapidly , especially when diagnosis is in doubt, cardiogenic shock is present, bleeding risk is increased, or if symptoms have been present for 3 h. * Proceed with IV fibrinolysis if PCI is not available or if logistics would delay PCI 1 h longer than fibrinolysis could be initiated (Fig. 123-1). Dooo- needle time should be  30 min for maximum benefit. Ensure absence of contraindications before administering fibrinolytic agent. Those treated within 1-3 h benefit most; can still be useful up to 12 h if chest pain is persistent or ST remains elevated in leads that have not developed new Q waves. Complications include bleeding, reperfusion arrhythmias, and, in case of streptokinase (SK), allergic reactions. Heparin should be initiated with fibrinolytic agents other than SK ; maintain aPTTT at 1.5-2.0 control (50-70 s). * If chest pain or ST elevation persists 90 min after fibrinolysis, consider referral for rescue PCI. Later coronary angiography after fibrinolysis generally reserved for pts with recurrent angina or positive stress test. The initial management of NSTEMI (non-Q MI) is different . In paicular, fibrinolytic therapy should not be Additional Standard Treatment (Whether or not reperfusion therapy is undeaken): * Hospitalize in CCU with continuous ECG monitoring. * IV line for emergency arrhythmia treatment. * Pain control: (1) Morphine sulfate 2-4 mg IV q5-10min until pain is relieved or side effects develop ; (2) nitroglycerin 0.3 mg SL if systolic bp  100 mmHg; for refractory pain: IV nitroglycerin (begin at 10 g/min, titrate upward to maximum of 200 g/min, monitoring bp closely); do not administer nitrates within 24 h of sildenafil or within 48 h of tadalafil (used for erectile dysfunction); (3) -adrenergic antagonists * Oxygen 2-4 L/min by nasal cannula (maintain O2 saturation  90%). * Mild sedation (e.g., diazepam 5 mg PO qid). * Soft diet and stool softeners (e.g., docusate sodium 100-200 mg/d). * -Adrenergic blockers reduce myocardial O2 consumption, limit infarct size, and reduce moality. Especially useful in pts with hypeension, tachycardia, or persistent ischemic pain; contraindications include active CHF, systolic bp  95 mmHg, hea rate  50 beats/min, AV block,or history of bronchospasm. Administer IV (e.g., metoprolol 5 mg q5-10min to total dose of 15 mg), followed by PO regimen (e.g., metoprolol 25-100 mg bid). * Anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents: Pts who receive fibrinolytic therapy are begun on heparin and aspirin as indicated above. In absence of fibrinolytic therapy, administer aspirin, 160-325 mg qd, and low-dose heparin (5000 U SC q12h for DVT prevention). Full-dose IV heparin (PTT 2 control) or low-molecular-weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h) followed by oral anticoagulants is recommended for pts with severe CHF, presence of ventricular thrombus by echocardiogram, or large dyskinetic region in anterior MI. Oral anticoagulants are continued for 3 to 6 months, then replaced by aspirin. * ACE inhibitors reduce moality in pts following acute MI and should be prescribed within 24 h of hospitalization for pts with STEMI--e.g., captopril (6.25 mg PO test dose) advanced to 50 mg PO tid. ACE inhibitors should be continued indefinitely after discharge in pts with CHF or those with asymptomatic LV dysfunction ; if ACE inhibitor intolerant, use angiotensin receptor blocker (e.g., valsaan or candesaan). * Serum magnesium level should be measured and repleted if necessary to reduce risk of arrhythmias.",C

Raised calcium and phosphorus are seen in -,CRF,Vitamin D intoxication,Hyperparathyroidism,pseudohypoparathyroidism,"<p>Primary hyperparathyroidism is a generalized disorder of calcium, phosphate, and bone metabolism due to an increased secretion of PTH. The elevation of circulating hormone usually leads to hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia.Hypercalcemia in vitamin D intoxication is due to an excessive biologic action of the vitamin, perhaps the consequence of increased levels of 25(OH)D rather than merely increased levels of the active metabolite 1,25(OH) 2 D (the latter may not be elevated in vitamin D intoxication). 25(OH)D has definite, if low, biologic activity in the intestine and bone. The production of 25(OH)D is less tightly regulated than is the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D. Hence concentrations of 25(OH)D are elevated severalfold in patients with excess vitamin D intake. The diagnosis is substantiated by documenting elevated levels of 25(OH)D >100 mg/mL. Hypercalcemia is usually controlled by restriction of dietary calcium intake and appropriate attention to hydration. These measures, plus discontinuation of vitamin D, usually lead to resolution of hypercalcemia.

"A 20 year old female patient has non exeional chest pain. On auscultation, she had multiple non-ejection clicks. Investigation of choice would be: September 2008",Serum markers,Chest X-ray,Electrocardiography,Echocardiography,"Ans. D: Echocardiography Ejection clicks/ ejection sounds are high-pitched sounds that occur at the moment of maximal opening of the aoic or pulmonary valves. They are heard just after the first hea sound. The sounds occur in the presence of a dilated aoa or pulmonary aery or in the presence of a bicuspid or flexible stenotic aoic or pulmonary valve. The diastolic correlate of the ejection click is the opening snap, which occurs at maximal opening of a flexibly stenotic mitral or tricuspid valve. Non ejection clicks/ midsystolic clicks occurring with or without a late systolic murmur (crescendo-decrescendo), often denotes prolapse of one/both leaflets of the mitral valve.They are best heard along the lower left sternal border and at the left ventricular apex. ECG is normal commonly in MVP, but may show biphasic/ inveed T waves inleads II, III and aVF. Echocardiography is paicularly effective in identifying the abnormal position and prolapse of the mitral valve leaflets.",D

Most common cause of precipitation of renal failure in multiple myeloma is,Hyperurecemia,Infection,Hypercalcaemia,Amyloidosis,"(C) Hypercalcaemia # Renal failure is seen in 25% patients and hypercalcaemia is the most common cause of renal failure.> Quite often renal failure develops rapidly even at an unchanged ratio of production and serum concentration of light chains. Various factors can favour renal cast formation in myeloma patients. Dehydration, sometimes due to diuretics, reduces the glomerular filtaration rate (GFR) and causes an increase in the plasma concentration of light chains which then exceeds the capacity for reabsorption and catabolism of light chains in the proximal tubuli.> Hypercalcaemia may induce vasoconstriction followed by a decrease in GFR. Several drugs, in particular non- steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), reduce renal blood flow. Radiographic contrast agents may induce acute renal failure in myeloma patients, particularly if patients are dehydrated and ionic contrast media are used.> The osteoclasts respond to osteoclast activating factors (OAF) made by the myeloma cells . leading to hypercaicaemia. Renal failure occurs in nearly 25% of myeloma patients, and some renal pathology is noted in over half. Hypercalcemia is the most common cause of renal failure. Glomerular deposits of amyloid, hyperuricemia, recurrent infections, and occasional infiltration of the kidney by myeloma cells all may contribute to renal dysfunction. However, tubular damage associated with the excretion of light chains is almost always present. Normally, light chains are filtered, reabsorbed in the tubules, and catabolized. With the increase in the amount of light chains presented to the tubule, the tubular cells become overloaded with these proteins, and tubular damage results either directly from light chain toxic effects or indirectly from the release of intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The earliest manifestation of this tubular damage is the adult Fanconi syndrome (a type 2 proximal renal tubular acidosis), with loss of glucose and amino acids, as well as defects in the ability of the kidney to acidify and concentrate the urine. The proteinuria is not accompanied by hypertension, and the protein is nearly all light chains. Generally, very little albumin is in the urine because glomerular function is usually normal.",C

The most common cause of bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is -,Aspergillus fumigatus,Aspergillus clavatus,Aspergillus flavus,Aspergillus niger,"Pulmonary aspergillosis is most likely to develop in people who have chronic lung disorders or damaged lungs. These people are likely to have abnormal spaces in their lungs where the fungus can grow. The fungus can also rarely infect sinuses and ear canals. The mold spores can colonize (grow) inside lung cavities that developed as a result of chronic diseases, such tuberculosis, emphysema, or advanced sarcoidosis. The fibers of fungus might form a lump by combining with white blood cells and blood clots. This lump or ball of fungus is called an aspergilloma or mycetoma. In some cases, a fungus ball may be present in other organs of the body. Invasive aspergillosis, the most severe type, occurs when the infection travels from the lungs into the bloodstream. Other organs, such as the kidneys, liver, skin or brain, may become infected. This is a very serious condition that may result in death if not treated. People with very weakened immune systems are more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. Other risk factors include a low white blood cell count, long-term use of coicosteroids, or hospitalization. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an allergic reaction that happens to some people after exposure to Aspergillus fungus. The fungus causes inflammation in the lungs and air passages. ABPA is more common in people with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and/or asthma because they tend to have more mucus in their airways. Although it is unclear exactly why the allergic reaction occurs, the mucus in their airways may provide a good environment for the mold to grow. Unfounately, the allergic reaction may produce symptoms similar to those associated with asthma, including wheezing, coughing and difficulty with breathing Aspergillosis is an infection or allergic reaction caused by various kinds of mold (a type of fungus). Mold is often found outdoors on plants, soil, or rotting vegetable matter. Mold can also grow indoors on household dust, food items such as ground spices, and building materials. Aspergillus fumigatus is the type of mold that is most likely to cause aspergillosis in ceain people when they inhale (breathe in) its spores. Ref Harrison20th edition pg 1018",A

Although angina may remain unchanged in severity or paradoxically disappear with restoration of metabolic rate, exacerbation of myocardial ischaemia, infarction and sudden death are recognised complications of levothyroxine replacement, even using doses as low as 25 mg per day. In patients with known ischaemic hea disease, thyroid hormonereplacement should be introduced at low dose and increased veryslowly under specialist supervision. It has been suggested that T3 has an advantage over T4, since T3 has a shoer half-life and any adverse effect will reverse more quickly, but the more distinct peak in hormone levels after each dose of T3 is a disadvantage.

Most difficult criterion to establish Causal Association in aetiology of a disease is ?,Temporality,Strength of association,Specificity of association,Biological plausibility,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Specificity of association Specificity of association The concept of specificity implies a one to one relationship, i.e., disease under study is caused only by risk factor under study and risk factor under study causes only one disease which is under study. It is the weakest criteria of causal association because : ? i) Most diseases are due to multiple factors with no possibility of one to one relationship, e.g., lung cancer is associated with smoking, asbestos, nickle and air pollution. ii) A single cause can give rise to more than one disease, e.g., smoking can cause, Ca lung, Bronchitis, Bladder Ca, CHD, peptic ulcer. So, o Requirement of specificity is the most difficult criteria to establish. o But lack of specificity does not negate the causal relationship because : ? i) Though single cause can cause more than one disease, it may be associated in causation of disease under study, e.g., smoking is associated with so many diseases but it has been proved as the most impoant risk factor in causation of lung cancer. ii) Though most of the disease are due to multiple factor, disease under study may be associated with the risk factor under study, e.g., Lung cancer has multiple etiological risk factors, but smoking has been proved to be the most impoant risk factor. So, specificity suppo causal interpretation but lack of specificity does not negate it. Biological plausibility It implies biological credibility to the association, that is the association agrees with current understanding of the response of cells, tissues organs and system to stimuli. o For example, positive association of food intake with GI cancer is biological plausable (food enters it and causes cellular response), while positive association of food intake and skin cancer is not biological plausible.

True about antemortem wound is,No staining left after washing,No gaping,Uncoagulated blood,Arterial bleed,"Ans. d (Arterial bleed)The antemortem abrasions show signs of inflammation and repair and a little swelling is present in the area whereas these signs are absent in postmortem abrasions.As abrasions alone are not too significant; not much of importance is placed on them.The other part is that the ants attack the dead body and hence there may be additional injuries found in the form of abrasions besides those mentioned in the FIR. Thus there will be some difference between the two but this is not significant provided the additional abrasions are found in the areas described earlier (Post mortem) and thebody was examined after a lapse of time. Thus the characters of such abrasions should be noted and if found of PM nature, they should be ignored as they are of no value but if they are described as antemortem abrasions, the issue may be argued accordingly. Those points which cannot be argued out because the findings given are inadequate, such points may be elicited cunningly in scientific cross examination.",D

Static compliance is decreased in all of the following except:,ARDS,Pulmonary edema,Interstial fibrosis,Emphysema,"Answer is D (Emphysema): Emphysema is associated with an increased static compliance but decreased dynamic compliance. `The effect of emphysema on compliance is unique in that it results in an increase in static compliance but a decrease in dynamic compliance. Static compliance increases due to destruction of elastic tissues in the alveolar walls. The reduction in elastic tissue makes it easier for the lung to expand in response to distending pressure, However the loss of elastic tissue in the walls of smaller airways makes them vulnerable to dynamic airway compression. This increases the airway resistance with consequent decrease in dynamic compliance - 'Principles of Medical physiology' by Sircar 1"" (2008)/320 Common causes of Rhonchi include: Bronchial Asthma COPD -- Chronic bronchitis, Bronchiectasis, Emphysema Cardiac Asthma (Pulmonary Edema) Foreign body (Fixed monomorphic rhonchi - localized) Tumor (Fixed monomorrphic rhonchi -- localized.)

"True about OPV are all, EXCEPT:",We get quick immune response,It is a live vaccine,It is used in epidemic,Maternal antibody interferes with immune response,"Oral polio vaccine is live attenuated vaccine containing (type 1,2,3 polio strain) It was described by Sabin in 1957,i.e. it is also known as Sabin vaccine The vaccine progeny is excreted in the faeces and secondary spread occurs to household contacts and susceptible contacts in community. Non immunized persons may therefore, be immunized. Thus wide spread 'heard immunity' results even if only 66% of community is immunized. This propey of OPV has been exploited in controlling epidemics of polio by administrating the vaccine simultaneously ina sho period to all susceptibles ina community. Live vaccine stimulates antibody formation by inducing mild infection in epithelial cell and the payers patches. Then the virus spreads to the other areas of body and produce antibody.which prevent dissemination of the virus to the nesvus tissue and paralytic polio. The presence of circulating maternal antibodies may modify the infection created by the attenuated vaccine viruses and reduce both the serum and the gut response. Production of antibodies take some time thats why we cant get quick response. Ref: Park 22nd ed/p 187.",A

All of the following are features of Obstructive jaundice except: September 2007,Normal alkaline phosphatase,Mildly elevated serum aminotransferases level,Clay colour stools,Pruritis,"Ans. A: Normal alkaline phosphatase Obstruction to the flow of bile in common bile duct may result from choledocholithiasis, malignancy od head of pancreas, bile ducts or ampulla of Vater. Charcot's triad of intermittent fever, pain and jaundice is characteristic of ascending cholangitis and indicates biliary obstruction. Hepatomegaly is present in most cases of obstructive jaundice and is due to congestion and stretching out of intrahepatic biliary spaces. A palpable gall bladder usually indicates obstruction of the distal CBD, due to other causes like underlying malignancy, than stone (Courvoisier's law). Hepatic bile flow suppression leads to jaundice accompanied by dark urine (bilirubinuria) and light coloured (alcoholic) stools. Bile salts and pigments in urine and absent urobilinogen also our the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice. Serum albumin and prothrombin time are good indicators of liver function derangement. Serum bilirubin levels indicate severity of jaundice and high direct bilirubin rules out hemolytic jaundice. Mild elevation of SGPT levels are also seen in obstructive jaundice consistent with liver dysfunction. An elevated alkaline phosphatase is, always present in obstructive jaundice.",A

It occurs predominantly in females and usually involves the renal and carotid aeries but can affect extremity vessels such as the iliac and subclan aeries. The histologic classification includes intimal fibroplasia, medial dysplasia, and adventitial hyperplasia. Medial dysplasia is subdivided into medial fibroplasia, perimedial fibroplasia, and medial hyperplasia.fibroplasia is the most common type and is characterized by alternating areas of thinned media and fibromuscular ridges. The internal elastic lamina usually is preserved. The iliac aeries are the limb aeries most likely to be affected by fibromuscular dysplasia.It is identified angiographically by a ""STRING OF BEADS"" appearance caused by thickened fibromuscular ridges contiguous with thin, less-involved poions of the aerial wall. When limb vessels are involved, clinical manifestations are similar to those for atherosclerosis, including claudication and rest pain.

Which of the following is not abrasion?,Graze,Scratches,Impact,Avulsion,"Ans. is d i.e., Avulsion Types of abrasion are : ? 1) Scratches (linear abrasion) : It is an abrasion with legnth but no significant width produced by a sharp object e.g., pin, needles, knife, thorn and nail etc. Point scratch is a very superficial incision produced by a sharp or pointed object not sharp enough to incise but pointed enough to produce scratch. 2) Grazes (Sliding abrasion/scraping abrasion/grinding abrasion) : It is the most common type of abrasion, produced when a broad surface of skin slides against rough surface, e.g., during vehicular accidents. Injury is due to friction. The surface of injury show irregular parallel lines, i.e., furrows or grooves. A violent lateral graze, due to rubbing of skin (as in dragging) is known as brush burn (Gravel rash). Friction burn (Scuff or brush abrasion) occur due to tangential contact with a smooth surface or when the skin is covered by clothing. It is an extensive superficial, reddened excoriated area without bleeding and with little or no linear mark. 3) Pressure abrasions (crushing or friction abrasions) : Though it is called friction abrasion, it results from pressure of the object on the body with no or little friction (it is a misnomer). It is caused by crushing of superficial epidermis due to inward directed movement of object at around 90deg to skin. Example are ligature marks in hanging/strangulation, teeth bites and nail marks. 4) Impact abrasion (Imprint or contact abrasion) : It is caused by impact (but not pressure) with a rough object, when the force is applied at or near 90deg to skin surface. It is depressed below surface unless associated with contusion (bruise).",D

Measures involved in sentinel surveillance include all except,Identifying cases free of disability,Identifying new cases of infection,Identifying old cases and new cases of infection,Identifying missing cases in notification of disease,"Surveillance: Is the ongoing systematic collection and analysis of data and the provision of information which leads to action being taken to prevent and control a disease, usually one of an infectious nature
Surveillance is of many types:
Passive Surveillance: Data is itself reported to the health system; For e.g., A patient with fever coming on his own to the PHC, CHC, Dispensary, Private Practitioner, Hospital
Active Surveillance: Health system seeks out ‘actively’ the collection of data, i.e., goes out to community to collect data; For e.g., Stool sample collection from home in Polio Program.
Sentinel Surveillance: Monitoring of rate of occurrence of specific conditions to assess the stability or change in health levels of a population, It is also the study of disease rates in a specific cohort, geographic area, population subgroup, etc. to estimate trends in larger population; For e.g., Use of health practitioners to monitor trends of a health event in a population

WHich of the following is the most likely causative organism is",Staphylococcus,Klebsiella,Pneumocystis carinii infection,CMV,"Bulging fissure sign in x ray seen in klebsiella. image shows bulging fissure sign Clinical features Pneumonia, paicularly lobar pneumonia, usually presents as an acute illness. Systemic features, such as fever, rigors, shivering and malaise, predominate and delirium may be present. The appetite is invariably lost and headache frequently repoed. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, which at first is characteristically sho, painful and dry, but later is accompanied by the expectoration of mucopurulent sputum. Rust-coloured sputum may be produced by patients with Strep. pneumoniae infection and the occasional patient may repo haemoptysis Pleuritic chest pain may be a presenting feature and on occasion may be referred to the shoulder or anterior abdominal wall. Upper abdominal tenderness is sometimes apparent in patients with lower lobe pneumonia or those with associated hepatitis. Less typical presentations may be seen in the very young and the elderly. While different organisms often give rise to a similar clinical and radiological picture, it may be possible to infer the likely agent from the clinical context. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is more common in young people and rare in the elderly, whereas Haemophilus influenzae is more common in the elderly, paicularly if underlying lung disease is present. Legionella pneumophila occurs in local outbreaks centred on contaminated cooling towers in hotels, hospitals and other industries. Staph. aureus is more common following an episode of influenza. Klebsiella pneumonia has a specific association with alcohol abuse and often presents with a paicularly severe bacteraemic illness. Recent foreign travel raises the possibility of infections that may otherwise be unusual in the UK, e.g. MERS-coronavirus (Middle East ), melioidosis caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei (South-east Asia and nohern Australia and endemic fungal infection (Noh, Central or South America. Ceain occupations) may be associated with exposure to specific bacteria . Clinical examination should first focus on the respiratory and pulse rates, blood pressure and an assessment of the mental state, as these are impoant in forming a judgement as to severity of the illness . Chest signs vary, depending on the inflammatory response, which proceeds through stages of acute exudation, red and then grey hepatisation, and finally resolution. When consolidated, the lung is typically dull to percussion and, as conduction of sound is enhanced, auscultation reveals bronchial breathing and whispering pectoriloquy; crackles are heard throughout. An assessment of the state of nutrition is impoant, paicularly in the elderly. The presence of herpes labialis may point to streptococcal infection, as may the finding of 'rusty' sputum.

This often begins between six months and two years of age. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any pa of the body or no obvious symptoms.Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;however, it may develop at any age.It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus type 1 and thyroiditis, among others. The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, and greasy stool (steatorrhoea), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children. Fuher, many adults with subtle disease may only present with fatigue or anaemia. Many undiagnosed individuals who consider themselves asymptomatic are in fact not, but rather have become accustomed to living in a state of chronically compromised health. Indeed, after staing a gluten-free diet and subsequent improvement becomes evident, such individuals are often able to retrospectively recall and recognise prior symptoms of their untreated disease which they had mistakenly ignored.

When to do Retinopathy screening in a patient with Diabetic Neuropathy?,Immediately,After 4 weeks,After 4 months,After 1 year,"(A) Immediately# DIABETIC RETINOPATHY is a important cause of avoidable blindness in India. Treatment interventions at early stages of diabetic retinopathy can reduce burden of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy. With the available cost-effective methods of early screening, appropriate strategies/models need to be developed.> Diabetic retinopathy has no early warning signs.> Macular edema, which can cause rapid vision loss, may not have any warning signs for some time. A person with macular edema is likely to have blurred vision, making it hard to do things like read or drive and in some cases, the vision will get better or worse during the day.> Diagnosis of Diabetic retinopathy is detected during an eye examination that includes: Visual acuity test: This test uses an eye chart to measure how well a person sees at various distances (i.e., visual acuity). Pupil dilation: The eye care professional places drops into the eye to dilate the pupil. This allows him or her to see more of the retina and look for signs of diabetic retinopathy. After the examination, close-up vision may remain blurred for several hours. Ophthalmoscopy:(1) Looks through a slit lamp biomicroscope with a special magnifying lens that provides a narrow view of the retina, or(2) Wearing a headset (indirect ophthalmoscope) with a bright light, looks through a special magnifying glass and gains a wide view of the retina. Hand-held ophthalmoscopy is insufficient to rule out significant and treatable diabetic retinopathy. Fundus photography generally captures considerably larger areas of the fundus, and has the advantage of photo documentation for future reference, as well as availing the image to be examined by a specialist at another location and/or time.

What is the best management -",Angiogram,Aoic valve replacement,Aoic ballooning to prevent fuher derangement,Observation,"Aoic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the hea (where the aoa begins), such that problems result.It may occur at the aoic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If hea failure, loss of consciousness, or hea related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse. Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercise. Signs of hea failure include shoness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs.Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aoic sclerosis Treatment is generally not necessary in people without symptoms. In moderate cases echocardiography is performed every 1-2 years to monitor the progression, possibly complemented with a cardiac stress test.In severe cases, echocardiography is performed every 3-6 months.In both moderate and mild cases, the person should immediately make a revisit or be admitted for inpatient care if any new related symptoms appear.There are no therapeutic options currently available to treat people with aoic valve stenosis; however, studies have indicated that the disease occurs as a result of active cellular processes, suggesting that targeting these processes may lead to ble therapeutic approaches Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 453",D

It is commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which presents with symmetrical, immobility-associated neck and shoulder girdle pain and stiffness. Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery.

Proximal Bronchiectasis is feature of?,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Tuberculosis,Measles pneumonia,All of the above,"Ans. a (Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis) (Ref. Harrison's Medicine, 18thCh. 204)Bronchiectasis accompanying ABPA often involves proximal airways and is associated with mucoid impaction.Other features on high-resolution CT scanning can suggest a specific etiology of the bronchiectasis. For example, bronchiectasis of relatively proximal airways suggests ABPA, whereas the presence of multiple small pulmonary nodules (nodular bronchiectasis) suggests infection with M. avium complex.BRONCHIECTASISEtiologies of Bronchiectasis- Mycobacterial- Viral (Swyer-James syndrome)- Fungal (including ABPA)- Dyskinetic cilia syndromes (Kartagener's)- Cystic fibrosis- Alphal-antitrypsin deficiency- Mounier-Kuhn's syndrome- Williams-Campbell syndrome- Bronchopulmonary sequestration- AIDS- Acquired hypogammaglobulinemia- Selective or pangammaglobulinemia- Postobstructive (neoplasm, foreign body, stricture)- Chronic rejection (obliterative bronchiolitis)- Graft-versus-host disease- Aspiration- Inhalation of toxic gases- Collagen vascular diseases- Asthma- Yellow-nail syndrome- Sarcoidosis High-resolution CT (HRCT) is accepted accurate noninvasive means of diagnosing bronchiectasis. Signs described on CT include: tram-track sign, signet ring sign, string of pearls sign, and cluster of grapes sign. When a dilated bronchus is oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the section it is recognized in cross-section as a ring structure, with an internal diameter larger than that of its accompanying pulmonary artery branch. Termed the signet ring sign, the wall of the dilated bronchus represents the band of the ring, whereas the signet is the soft-tissue density produced by the artery. This is diagnostic sign.A wide spectrum of abnormalities may be identified at HRCT in patients with airway disease, including various distinctive patterns of bronchiectasis in specific clinical settings, such as ABPA, MAC infection, AIDS, and cystic fibrosis (CF). The predominant HRCT finding in CF is bronchiectasis, which is typically panlobar. Proximal and parahilar bronchiectasis are identified in all of these cases; in about a third of cases it is limited to these areas, a pattern termed CENTRAL OR PROXIMAL BRONCHIECTASIS, as seen in ABPA.",A

"All are used in bronchial asthma, except:",Salbutamol,Morphine,Aminophylline,Steroid,"Morphine is a drug of emergency, but due care has to be taken in its use. 

Infants and the elderly are more susceptible to the respiratory depressant action of morphine. 
It is dangerous in patients with respiratory insufficiency (emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, cor pulmonale); sudden deaths have occurred. Morphine accentuates sleep apnoea; hypoxic brain damage can occur. 
Bronchial asthma: Morphine can precipitate an attack by its histamine releasing action. A high potency opioid with lower histamine releasing potential (e.g. fentanyl) should be used, if unavoidable, in an asthmatic. 
Head injury: Morphine is contraindicated in patients with head injury. Reasons are—


By retaining CO2, it increases intracranial tension which will add to that caused by head injury itself. 
Even therapeutic doses can cause marked respiratory depression in these patients. 
Vomiting, miosis and altered mentation produced by morphine interfere with assessment of progress in head injury cases.

He woulld also present to clinician with",Recurrent chest infection,Recurrent bleeding upper GI,Recurrent colicky abdominal pain,Esophageal perforation,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux resulting in heaburn affects approximately 30% of the general population. Pathophysiology Occasional episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux are common in healthy individuals. Reflux is normally followed by oesophageal peristaltic waves that efficiently clear the gullet, alkaline saliva neutralises residual acid and symptoms do not occur. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease develops when the oesophageal mucosa is exposed to gastroduodenal contents for prolonged periods of time, resulting in symptoms and, in a propoion of cases, oesophagitis. Abnormalities of the lower oesophageal sphincter . The lower oesophageal sphincter is tonically contracted under normal circumstances, relaxing only during swallowing.Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have reduced lower oesophageal sphincter tone, permitting reflux when intra-abdominal pressure rises. In others, basal sphincter tone is normal but reflux occurs in response to frequent episodes of inappropriate sphincter relaxation. Hiatus hernia Hiatus hernia causes reflux because the pressure gradient is lost between the abdominal and thoracic cavities, which normally pinches the hiatus. In addition, the oblique angle between the cardia and oesophagus disappears. Many patients who have large hiatus hernias develop reflux symptoms but the relationship between the presence of a hernia and symptoms is poor. Hiatus hernia is very common in individuals who have no symptoms, and some symptomatic patients have only a very small or no hernia. Neveheless, almost all patients who develop oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus or peptic strictures have a hiatus hernia. Delayed oesophageal clearance Defective oesophageal peristaltic activity is commonly found in patients who have oesophagitis. It is a primary abnormality, since it persists after oesophagitis has been healed by acid-suppressing drug therapy. Poor oesophageal clearance leads to increased acid exposure time. Gastric contents Gastric acid is the most impoant oesophageal irritant and there is a close relationship between acid exposure time and symptoms. Pepsin and bile also contribute to mucosal injury. Defective gastric emptying Gastric emptying is delayed in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. The reason is unknown. Increased intra-abdominal pressure Pregnancy and obesity are established predisposing causes. Weight loss may improve symptoms. Dietary and environmental factors Dietary fat, chocolate, alcohol, tea and coffee relax the lower oesophageal sphincter and may provoke symptoms. The foods that trigger symptoms vary widely between affected individuals. Patient factors Visceral sensitivity and patient vigilance play a role in determining symptom severity and consulting behaviour in individual patients Clinical features The major symptoms are heaburn and regurgitation, often provoked by bending, straining or lying down. 'Waterbrash', which is salivation due to reflex salivary gland stimulation as acid enters the gullet, is often present. The patient is often overweight. Some patients are woken at night by choking as refluxed fluid irritates the larynx. Others develop odynophagia or dysphagia. A variety of other features have been described, such as atypical chest pain that may be severe and can mimic angina; it may be due to reflux-induced oesophageal spasm. Others include hoarseness ('acid laryngitis'), recurrent chest infections, chronic cough and asthma. The true relationship of these features to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease remains unclear Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 729",A
The regional aerial resistance of the mesentery and kidney vessels is reduced by,Dopamine,Dobutamine,Nor adrenaline,Isoprenaline,"In hyperdynamic sepsis, the peripheral aeriolar tone and BP are low but the cardiac output is often high; therefore the vasoconstrictor noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is appropriate to restore BP, usually at the price of some reduction in cardiac output.In most cases, a vasoconstrictor such as noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is necessary to increase SVR and BP, while an inotrope (dobutamine) may be necessary to maintain cardiac output. In the later stages of severe sepsis, the essential problem is at the microcirculatory level. Oxygen uptake and utilisation are impaired due to failure of the regional distribution of flow and direct cellular toxicity despite adequate global oxygen delivery. Tissue oxygenation may be improved and aerobic metabolism sustained by reducing demand, i.e. metabolic rate. ref:Davidsson&;s principles and practices of medicine,ed 21,pg no 598",C

Incised wound It is a clean cut through the tissues (usually, skin and subcutaneous tissue), caused by sharp-edged object, which is longer than its depth, when the weapon is struck or pressed and drawn across the body pa, i.e., there is pressure and friction. Examples of sharp edged object are knife, blade, razor, scalpel, sword, chopper etc. The characteristic features of incised wound are : Length is the greatest dimension (most impoant). Hair, hair bulb, nerve and vessels are cut bleeding is profuse as vessels are cut. Width of injury is more than the thickness of blade, due to gaping of wound.

HBV replication is indicated by -,HBV DNA,DNA polymerase,HBeAg,IgMAnti-HBc,"Hepatitis B e antigen Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is an indicator of viral replication. In acute hepatitis B it may appear only transiently at the outset of the illness; its appearance is followed by the production of antibody (anti-HBe). The HBeAg reflects active replication of the virus in the liver. Chronic HBV infection (see below) is marked by the presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc (IgG) in the blood. Usually, HBeAg or anti-HBe is also present; HBeAg indicates continued active replication of the virus in the liver. The absence of HBeAg usually implies low viral replication; the exception is HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (also called 'pre-core mutant' infection, ), in which high levels of viral replication, serum HBV-DNA and hepatic necroinflammation are seen, despite negative HBeAg.

A 14 yrs old girl on exposure to cold has pallor of extremities followed by pain and cyanosis. In later ages of life she is prone to develp?,Systemic lupus erythematosis,Scleroderma,Rheumatoid arthritis,Hisiocytosis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Scleroderma Pallor of extremities on exposure to cold that is followed by pain and cyanosis suggests Raynaud9s phenomenon. A Female patient with Raynaud9s phenomenon should be evaluated for possibility of scleroderma or any other connective tissue disease.Raynaud's phenomenon is the first manifestation of scleroderma in almost every patient with the disease and it precedes other symptoms in 70% of cases Q.The interval between Raynaud's phenomenon and appearance of other manifestations is generally brief (weeks to months) in diffuse scleroderma, while in limited scleroderma the period of onset between Raynaud's phenomenon and systemic manifestations is commonly several years.Scleroderma is a rare disorder but it initially presents with Raynaud's phenomenon which is quite frequent in the general population. Therefore it is important to keep scleroderma in mind while dealing with Raynaud's phenomenon.More on Scleroderma : - Scleroderma is primarily a disease of the female Q (female to male ratio of 3:1) with a peak incidence in the 50 - 60 year age group.Raynaud's phenomenon occurs due to microvascular involvement Q.Microvascular disease is consistently present early in the course of systemic sclerosis. Intimal proliferation is evident in 100% of digital arteries of patients with systemic sclerosis. Capillary dilatation with leaking as well as destruction is also common.Stress and cold temperature induce an exaggerated vasoconstriction of the small arteries, arterioles and arteriovenous shunts of the skin of the digits. This is manifested clinically as pallor and cyanosis of the digits followed by reactive hyperemia after rewarming. Unlike episodes of uncomplicated primary Raynaud's phenomenon, attacks of Raynaud phenomenon in patient with scleroderma are often painful and frequently lead to digital ulcerations, gangrenes or amputation.Also knowDiseases associated with Raynaud's phenomenon :Raynaud's phenomenon is associated with several connective tissue disease.Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)Systemic lupus erythematosusRheumatoid arthritisSjogren syndromeDermatomyositisPolymyositisVasculitisAll patients with history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be asked about symptoms suggestive of autoimmune disease such as arthritis, dry eyes or dry mouth, myalgias, fever, skin rash or cardiomyopathy abnormalities.If underlying autoimmune disease is suspected, the patient should be evaluated for presence of specific autoantibodies.Antinuclear antibody (ANA) assays are highly sensitive for the type of connective tissue disorders that are often associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. However, positive ANA, are quite nonspecific and therefore should be followed by testing for autoantibodies with higher positive predictive values for such conditions.",B

Which ofthe following drugs is used for Irritable Bowel Syndrome of the constipating type-,Lubiprostone,Cholestyramine,Alosetron,Rifaximin,"Management of IBS The most impoant steps are to make a positive diagnosis and reassure the patient. Many people are concerned that they have developed cancer. A cycle of anxiety leading to colonic symptoms, which fuher heighten anxiety, can be broken by explaining that symptoms are not due to a serious underlying disease but instead are the result of behavioural, psychosocial, physiological and luminal factors. In individuals who fail to respond to reassurance, treatment is traditionally tailored to the predominant symptoms. Dietary management is effective for many patients. Up to 20% may benefit from a wheat-free diet, some may respond to lactose exclusion, and excess intake of caffeine or aificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol, should be addressed. A more restrictive, 'low-FODMAP' diet, supervised by a dietitian, with gradual re-introduction of different food groups, may help some patients, as may a trial of a gluten-free diet. Probiotics, in capsule form, can be effective if taken for several months, although the optimum combination of bacterial strains and dose have yet to be clarified. Patients with intractable symptoms sometimes benefit from several months of therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant, such as amitriptyline or imipramine (10-25 mg orally at night). Side-effects include dry mouth and drowsiness but these are usually mild and the drug is generally well tolerated, although patients with features of somatisation tolerate the drug poorly and lower doses should be used. It may act by reducing visceral sensation and by altering gastrointestinal motility. Anxiety and affective disorders may also require specific treatment . The 5-HT4 agonist prucalopride, the guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist linaclotide, and chloride channel activators, such as lubiprostone, can be effective in constipation- predominant IBS. Trials of anti-inflammatory agents, such as ketotifen or mesalazine, and the antibiotic rifaximin may be considered in some patients with difficult symptoms but are best prescribed only after specialist referral. Psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation and gut-directed hypnotherapy, should be reserved for the most difficult cases. A range of complementary and alternative therapies exist; most lack a good evidence base but are popular and help some patients . Most patients have a relapsing and remitting course. Exac- erbations often follow stressful life events, occupational dissatisfaction and difficulties with interpersonal relationships. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 826",A

"An anesthetized patient is mechanically ventilated at her normal tidal volume but at twice her normal frequency. When mechanical ventilation is stopped, the patient fails to breathe spontaneously for 1 minute. This temporary cessation of breathing occurs because",The elevated aerial oxygen tension (Pao2) reduced peripheral chemoreceptor activity,The elevated (Pao2) reduced central chemoreceptor activity,Low levels of nitrogen are known to inhibit ventilation,The lowered carbon dioxide tension (Pao2) reduced central chemoreceptor activity,"The apnea observed in this patient following her removal from the ventilator resulted from a lowered cerebrospinal fluid carbon dioxide tension (PCO2), which, in turn, reduced central chemoreceptor activity. Doubling the frequency of breathing while maintaining the tidal volume doubles alveolar ventilation, according to the formula:VA = (V T - VD) f,where VA is the alveolar ventilation per minute, VT is the tidal volume, VD is the volume of the dead space, and f is the frequency of breathing.Increasing alveolar ventilation increases the aerial oxygen tension (Pao2) and lowers the aerial and cerebrospinal fluid PCO2. It is the low cerebrospinal fluid PCO2 and the concomitant alkalosis in the cerebrospinal fluid that is responsible for the apnea observed after periods of hyperventilation. Ventilation resumes after the cerebrospinal fluid PCO2 increases and returns the cerebrospinal fluid pH to normal. The peripheral chemoreceptors are relatively inactive at a normal Pao2 of 100 mm Hg. Hyperventilating and raising the Pao2 does little to influence the peripheral chemoreceptors and, therefore, ventilation.",D

– Spearman’s Rank Correlation coefficient

Coefficient of determination:

– Is the percentage of variation in a variable that is explained by one or more of the others
– Is generally obtained in a regression setup
– Coefficient of determination = (Correlation coefficient)2 = r2
In the given question, a cardiologist found a highly significant correlation coefficient (r = 0.90, p= 0.01) between the systolic blood pressure values and serum cholesterol values of the patients attending his clinic, Since r = + 0.90 (p = 0.01; implies significant relationship), it means there is a strong positive correlation between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and serum cholesterol (SC); therefore as SBP increases, SC will also increase and vice-versa. Thus, a patient with a high level of systolic BP is also likely to have a high level of serum cholesterol AND a patient with a low level of systolic BP is also likely to have a low level of serum cholesterol.

Dietary fibres include -,Pectin,Lignin,Cellulose,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above Dietary fibreo Dietary' fibre consists of unabsorbable cell w-all and other constitutents of vegetable food like cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose, gums, pectins, glycoproteins and other polysaccharides.o Dietary' fibre absorbs water in the intestine, swells, increase bulk of stood by increasing water content of faeces and soften it, decreases transit time by facilitating colonic transit.""Thepresence of fibre shortens the transit times and increases the stool bulk""o Dietary' fibre is of two types:i) Soluble fibres: It absorbs upto 15 times its weight in water as it moves through GIT, producing softer stools. Its good sources are oat, flaxseeds, peas, beans, apple, citrus fruits, carrots, barley and psyllium.ii) Insoluble fibre: It promotes movement of material through digestive system and increases stool bulk. Its good sources are wheat flour, wheat bran, nuts and vegetables.Advantages of fibreso Dietry fibre contribute bulk by absorbing water 1-15 times of its own weight and thus hastens the passage through the gut, decreasing the transient time.o By increasing the bulk, it provides a larger volume of indigestible material to colon.o Dietary fibre is known to be associated with reduced incidence of coronary artery diseases. The mechanism of its action is attributed to its binding to bile salts and preventing its absorption and thus reducing cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) level in circulation.o The fibre, particularly the gum and pectin, when ingested with a diet, are reported to reduce post-prandial glucose level in blood - helpful in DM.o Dietary fibre reduce the incidence of diverticulitis, constipation, hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.",D

Residual chlorine level after disaster like flood ?,0.7 mg/litre,1.5 mg/litre,2 mg/litre,3 mg/litre,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 0.7 mg/litre Principles of chlorination Water should be clear and free from turbidity. Turbidity impedes efficient chlorination. The chlorine demand of the water should be estimated. It is the amount of chlorine that is needed to destroy bacteria and to oxidize all the organic matter and ammoniacal substances present in water. Chlorine demand of water is the difference between the amount of chlorine added to the water and the amount of residual chlorine remaining at the end of specific period of contact (usually 60 minutes) at a given temperature and pH of the water. The point at which the chlorine demand of the water is met is called break point chlorination. If fuher chlorine is added beyond break point, free chlorine begins to appear in water. The presence of free residual chlorine for a contact period of at least one hour is esential to kill bacteria and virus. The minimum recommended concentration of free chlorine is 0.5mg/1 for one hour. This free residual chlorine provides margin of safety against subsequent microbial contamination. The sum of the chlorine demand of the specific water plus the free residual chlorine of .5 mg/L constitutes the correct does of chlorine to be applied. It is woh noting here that recommended residual chlorine level for drinking water is 0.5 mg/ litre, while for swimming pool sanitation it is 1.0 mg/ litre and for water bodies & post disaster it is 0.7 mg/litre.",A

Clinical features The cardinal symptom of GCA is headache, which is often localised to the temporal or occipital region and may be accompanied by scalp tenderness. Jaw pain develops in some patients, brought on by chewing or talking. Visual disturbance can occur (most specifically amaurosis) and a catastrophic presentation is with blindness in one eye due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary aery. On fundoscopy, the optic disc may appear pale and swollen with haemorrhages, but these changes may take 24-36 hours to develop and the fundi may initially appear normal. Rarely, neurological involvement may occur, with transient ischaemic attacks, brainstem infarcts and hemiparesis. In GCA, constitutional symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, malaise and night sweats, are common. With PMR, there may be stiffness and painful restriction of active shoulder movements on waking. Muscles are not otherwise tender, and weakness and muscle-wasting are absent . Ref Davidsons 23e p1042",C
Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with infection caused by -,Hepatitis C virus,Hepatitis E virus,Hepatitis G virus,Hepatitis A virus,"Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",A

Continuous murmur is seen in-,PDA,A-V malformation,AP Window,All of the above,"Continuous murmurs begin in systole, peak near the second hea sound, and continue into all or pa of diastole. Their presence throughout the cardiac cycle implies a pressure gradient between two chambers or vessels during both systole and diastole. The continuous murmur associated with a patent ductus aeriosus is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Large, uncorrected shunts may lead to pulmonary hypeension, attenuation or obliteration of the diastolic component of the murmur, reversal of shunt flow, and differential cyanosis of the lower extremities. A ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm creates a continuous murmur of abrupt onset at the upper right sternal border. Rupture typically occurs into a right hea chamber, and the murmur is indicative of a continuous pressure difference between the aoa and either the right ventricle or the right atrium. A continuous murmur also may be audible along the left sternal border with a coronary aeriovenous fistula and at the site of an aeriovenous fistula used for hemodialysis access. Enhanced flow through enlarged intercostal collateral aeries in patients with aoic coarctation may produce a continuous murmur along the course of one or more ribs. A cervical bruit with both systolic and diastolic component usually indicates a high grade carotid aery stenosis. ref : Harrison&;s principles of internal medicine 20 th edition,pg no.13-7)",D

Which of the following is not found in nephrotic syndrome-irrelevant,LDL - Cholesterol,TG,HDL - Cholesterol,VLDL - Cholesterol,"Nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is characterised by very heavy proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 hrs), hypoalbuminaemia and oedema . Blood volume may be normal, reduced or increased. Renal sodium retention is an early and universal feature . The diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome all affect the glomerulus , either directly, by damaging podocytes, or indirectly, by causingscarring or deposition of exogenous material such as amyloid into the glomerulus. Investigation of nephrotic syndrome usually involves renal biopsy, although non-invasive tests may also be helpful in suggesting the underlying cause . In children, minimal change disease is by far the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome and therefore renal biopsy is not usually required unless the patient fails to respond to high-dose glucocoicoid therapy. Similarly, most patients with diabetes presenting with nephrotic syndrome will have diabetic nephropathy, and so renal biopsy is usually not performed unless the course of the disease is atypical (rapidly increasing proteinuria or rapid decline in renal function). Management of nephrotic syndrome should be directed at the underlying cause. In addition, nephrotic syndrome is associated with a number of complications , which may require suppoive management unless the nephrosis is expected to resolve rapidly, such as in glucocoicoid-responsive minimal change disease.

"All the following features our ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia, except -",Fusion beats,Extreme left axis detion,Very broad QRS complexes,Response to carotid sinus massage,"Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a hea attack, especially if they have weak hea muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (""twisting of the spikes""). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",C

Greenish discoloration of the body first seen in the right iliac fossa after death is due to formation of ?,Sulph hemoglobin,Meth hemoglobin,Sulph - meth hemoglobin,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Sulph - meth hemoglobin Signs of putrefaction The signs and effects of putrefaction are as follows :? 1. Colour changes The earliest sign of decomposition is greenish discoloration of body, seen in right iliac fossa externally and under liver internally. This is due to involvement of caecum. Which contains more liquid and is full of bacteria. In these areas, it appears in 12-18 hours and slowly spreads to whole body in 24-48 hours. Greenish discoloration is due to formation of sulph-meth-haemoglobin. Morbling occurs when Hb dissociates from RBCs and the colour of Hb is taken up by vessels, which are seen as prominent lines having purple or green or brown colour. Marbling occurs in 24-48 hours. 2. Formation of foul smelling gases Due to action of bacteria, foul smelling gases are formed, e.g. SO, , H2S, ammonia, methane and CO2. 3. Effects of gases Bloating up of body occurs in 34-48 hours. At the same time following changes occurs : i) Appearance of stomach contents and froth on nose and mouth. ii) Degloving and destocking with appearance of putrefactive blisters. iii) Emptying of hea due to pressure of gas. In 48-72 hours prolapse of rectum and uterus occur and postmoem delivery may occur if the dead woman is pregnant. Color of postmoem staining also changes to brown and finally to black. False rigidity (putrefactive rigidity) may occur at this time. 4. Appearance of maggots Flies lay their eggs in wounds, exposed natural orifices and exposed moist pas of the body and folds of skin, e.g. neck, axilla, nostrils, mouth etc. Flies lay eggs in 6-12 hours after death and these eggs change in larva (maggot) in 1-2 days. Thus maggots appear in 2-3 days after the death. After fuher 4-5 days, the maggots change into pupa, which conve into adult flies in next 3-5 days. Thus adult flies will be coming out of the body after total 8-12 days of death. Thus appearance of maggot determine the time since death. 5. Other late changes In 3-5 days : Nails and teeth become loose and can be pulled out, sutures of skull may separate. In 7-12 days : Liquefaction of body (colliquative putrefaction) occurs. In 1-3 months : Skeletonization of dead body occurs. Finally : Bones also decompose : Exposed bones in 1-5 years and deep burried bone (> 2 meters) in 25-100 years. 6. Internal changes Liver becomes spongy and is called as foamy or swiss cheese or honeycombed liver. In 7-12 days lequefaction of internal organs occur. 7. Floatation of body (if body is in water) Floatation of body occurs due to occumulation of sufficient putrefactive gases. Abdomen is above (due to gases) and spine is below during floatation. Time required for floatation is ordinarily 24 hours after death in summers and 2-3 days in winter. Factors affecting floatation are :- i) Causing early.floatation : Newborn mature infant, females, in summer, clothed body, obese, in sea water and in still pond water. ii) Causing delayed floatation : Still bih/immature newborn, male, in winter, naked body, thin built, in fresh water and in running stream water. Inspiration and expiration before death has no effect on floatation as floatation is due to putrefactive gases (not due to respiratory air).",C

The severity of Mitral stenosis is clinically been decided by -,Length of diastolic murmur,Intensity of diastolic murmur,Loudness of first hea sound,Split of second hea sound,"In MS The first hea sound (S 1 ) is usually accentuated and slightly delayed. The pulmonic component of the second hea sound (P 2 ) also is often accentuated, and the two components of the second hea sound (S 2 ) are closely split. The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve is most readily audible in expiration at, or just medial to, the cardiac apex. This sound generally follows the sound of aoic valve closure (A 2 ) by 0.05-0.12 s. The time interval between A 2 and OS varies inversely with the severity of the MS. The OS is followed by a low-pitched, rumbling, diastolic murmur, heard best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position. In general, the duration of this murmur correlates with the severity of the stenosis in patients with preserved CO. ( Harrison&;s principle of internal medicine,18th edition,pg no. 1931 )",A

"A 58-year-old woman has a history of alcohol abuse, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. Her medications include metoprolol, lisinopril, simvastatin, and warfarin. She develops urinary urgency and frequency and is treated with oxycodone and ciprofloxacin. Three days later she develops a headache, dizziness, vomiting, and has difficulty walking. On neurological examination her strength, sensation (including vibratory sensation), and reflexes are normal. She walks with an uncoordinated, unsteady gait. On testing of coordination in the upper extremities, she displays past pointing and poor rapid alternating movements with her right upper extremity. In the lower extremities, her heel-shin testing also reveals poor coordination on the right. INR is 6.5 (normal <1, therapeutic for warfarin 2.0-3.0). What is the most likely cause of her neurologic findings?",Right cerebellar hemorrhage,Multiple small infarcts in the basal ganglia,Cerebellar degeneration due to chronic alcohol abuse,Posterior column degeneration as a result of vitamin deficiency,"This patient has evidence of cerebellar dysfunction, most likely due to cerebellar hemorrhage. Many drugs (including ciprofloxacin) interact with warfarin, excessively prolong anticoagulation, and may result in spontaneous hemorrhage. Cerebellar lesions are typically associated with ataxia and dizziness. This patient's bleeding can be localized to the right cerebellar hemisphere since a focal lesion in one lobe of the cerebellum (e.g., a cerebellar tumor, hemorrhage or infarct) causes dyscoordination on the same side of the body (ipsilateral) as the lesion. Infarcts in the basal ganglia would cause extrapyramidal signs with rigidity and uncontrolled movements in addition to discoordination. Midline cerebellar lesions (most commonly alcoholic cerebellar degeneration) cause midline signs (especially gait ataxia) out of proportion to the findings in the extremities. Posterior column disease would cause sensory abnormalities (especially, loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation) rather than problems with coordination. Acute alcohol ingestion and narcotic overdose can cause dizziness and ataxia, often with nystagmus, but would not be expected to cause unilateral dysmetria.",A

A 38 year old female presents to the physician with complaints of excessive thirst and urination for the past 4 weeks. Her appetite has been normal and she has not had diarrhea. Blood chemistry showed mildly elevated glucose and glucagon. Physical examination reveals tenderness in the left upper quadrant and an erythematous necrotizing skin eruption on her legs. Radiographic studies show a tumor in the pancreas. Which of the following cells is responsible for this lesion?,Acinar cell,Alpha cell,Beta cell,Delta cell,"The symptoms described are typical for a patient with glucagon excess. Glucagon is secreted by alpha cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Increased levels are rare, usually due to carcinoma (70%) or adenoma (30%) of the islets. Two-thirds of patients with carcinoma have liver metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Increased glucagon causes a syndrome similar to diabetes mellitus, due to antagonism of insulin effects. Patients also have migratory skin rashes, alopecia, hyperpigmentation of the skin, and glossitis. Diagnosis is made by measuring glucagon. The acinar cell , the main exocrine cell of the pancreas, contains digestive enzymes. Increases in the release of these enzymes (especially amylase and lipase) occur with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis is considered an emergent medical condition. Chronic pancreatitis is associated with fibrosis and atrophy of the acinar structures. Beta cells are responsible for insulin release. An adenoma of beta cells (insulinoma) would cause hyperinsulinism. 70% are solitary and 10% are multiple. Insulinomas cause hypoglycemia, dizziness, confusion, and excessive sweating. Glucose needs to be given promptly to avoid coma and death. Diagnosis is made by finding increased insulin and hypoglycemia. Delta cells are islet cells that secrete somatostatin. Tumors producing increased somatostatin are usually malignant. Clinically, a diabetes mellitus-like syndrome occurs along with diarrhea. Diagnosis is made from elevated serum somatostatin levels, but can be difficult because of the hormone's sho half-life. Ref: German M.S. (2011). Chapter 17. Pancreatic Hormones and Diabetes Mellitus.

"For the disposal of hospital refuse, the bag made with cadmium is not used because incineration of the bag causes poisonous toxic fumes evolution. The colour of the bag is –",Black,Red,Blue,Yellow,"Most medical waste is incinerated, a practice that is short-lived because of environmental considerations.
The burning of solid and regulated medical waste generated by health care creates many problems.
Medical waste incinerators emit toxic air pollutants and toxic ash residues that are the major source of dioxins in the environment.
The toxic ash residues sent to landfills for disposal have the potential to leach into groundwater.
Medical waste has been identified by US Environmental Agency as the third largest known source of dioxin air emission and contributor of about 10% of mercury emissions to the environment from human activities.
The air emissions affect the local environment and may affect communities hundreds or thousands of miles away.
Dioxin is one of the most toxic chemicals known to humankind.
Dioxins have been linked to cancer, immune system disorders, diabetes, birth defects and disrupted sexual develop­ment. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of WHO, acknowledged dioxins cancer causing potential and classified it as human carcinogen.
To avoid dioxin production, no chlorinated plastic bags (and preferably no other chlorinated corn pounds) should be introduced into the incinerator.


Red bags must not be incinerated as red colour contains cadmium, which causes toxic emissions.

If mercury-containing items are put into a red bag for infectious waste and sent to an incinerator or other waste treatment technology, mercury will contaminate the environment.
Airborne mercury then enters a global distribution cycle in the environment, contaminating fish and wildlife. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cross the blood- brain barrier as well as the placenta.
Public concerns about incinerator emissions, as well as the creation of federal regulations for medical waste incinerators, are causing many health care facilities to rethink their choices in medical waste treatment. As stated by Health Care without Harm, an international coalition of 470 organizations in 52 countries, non-incineration treatment technologies are a growing and developing field.

The patient often calls the headache ''the worst headache of my life '; however, the most important characteristic is sudden onset.The headache is usually generalized, often with neck stiffness, and vomiting is common.Sudden headache in the absence of focal neurologic symptoms is the hallmark of aneurysmal rupture.Focal deficits can occur rarely.Anterior communicating artery or MCA bifurcation aneurysms may bleed enough to produce mass effect. The deficits that result can include hemiparesis, aphasia, and abulia.A third cranial nerve palsy, particularly when associated with pupillary dilation, loss of ipsilateral (but retained contralateral) light reflex, and focal pain above or behind the eye, may occur with an expanding aneurysm at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the internal carotid artery.A sixth nerve palsy may indicate an aneury sm in the cavernous sinus, and visual field defects can occur with an expanding supraclinoid carotid or anterior cerebral artery aneurysm.Occipital and posterior cervical pain may signal a posterior inferior cerebellar artery or anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm.Pain in or behind the eye and in the low temple can occur with an expanding MCA aneurysm.",A

Usually it is present in axilla, groin region.INFECTIOUS AGENTSRickettsial infections are caused by various bacterial species from the genera Rickettsia, Orientia, Ehrlichia, Neorickettsia, Neoehrlichia, and Anaplasma. Rickettsia spp. are classically divided into the typhus group and spotted fever group (SFG). Orientia spp, make up the scrub typhus group. The rickettsial pathogens most likely to be encountered during travel outside the United States include R. africae (African tick- bite fever), R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever), R. rickettsii (known as both Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Brazilian spotted fever), O. tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), and R. typhi (murine or fleaborne typhus).TRANSMISSIONMost rickettsial pathogens are transmitted by ectoparasites such as fleas, lice, mites, and ticks. Organisms can be transmitted by bites from these ectoparasites or by inoculating infectious fluids or feces from the ectoparasites into the skin. Inhaling or inoculating conjunctiva with infectious material may also cause infection for some of these organisms. Transmission of some rickettsial diseases after transfusion or organ transplantation is rare but has been reported.EPEDIMIOLOGYEhrlichia, Neorickettsia, Neoehrlichia, and Anaplasma are not seen in Indian subcontinent.Rickettsial infections have been reported in India for several decades. During the World War II era, there were many deaths due to scrub typhus in this region. It was thought that these infections declined over time; however, several reports in the past decade indicate the presence of disease in various parts of India, such as the Himalayan region, the northeast, and the south.TREATMENTThe drug most commonly used is doxycycline or tetracycline, but Azithromycin or chloramphenicol is an alternative. As Rickettsial spp. Lack specific cell wall, so beta lactams and cephalosporins are not indicated in management of Rickettsial diseases.",C

Which of the following medication in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is an NMDA antagonist?,Entacapone,Amantadine,Ropinirole,Selegiline,"(B) Amantadine # N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors are a class of excitatory amino acid receptors, which have several important functions in the motor circuits of the basal ganglia, and are viewed as important targets for the development of new drugs to prevent or treat Parkinson's disease (PD). NMDA receptors are ligand-gated ion channels, which composed of multiple subunits, and each has distinct cellular and regional patterns of expression. Amantadine is a NMDA receptor Antagonist that is used in early Parkinson's disease to help tremor. In recent years, amantadine has also been found useful in reducing dyskinesia that occur with dopamine medication. Amantadine is well-tolerated, but its side effects include dry mouth, constipation, bladder problems, ankle swelling and skin rash.# COMT inhibitors such as Entacapone and Tolcapone represent the newest class of Parkinson's medications. These agents have no direct effect on PD symptoms but instead, are used to prolong the effect of levodopa by blocking its metabolism. COMT inhibitors are useful primarily to help with problem of wearing-off (effect of levodopa becomes short-lived).# Dopamine agonists: These are drugs that stimulate the parts of the human brain influenced by dopamine. In effect, the brain is tricked into thinking it is receiving the dopamine it needs. Dopamine agonists are not as potent as Carbidopa/Levodopa. These are less likely to cause dyskinesia and can be taken alone or in combination with medications containing levodopa. Two most commonly prescribed oral pill agonists are Pramipexole and Ropinirole.# MAO-B inhibitors -- Selegiline blocks an enzyme in the brain thereby breaks down levodopa. These drugs have a modest effect in suppressing the symptoms of Parkinson's.",B

Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) are seen in,Pteryglum,Hematochromatosis,Wilson's disease,Menke's kinked hair syndrome,"Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare but impoant autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by a variety of mutations in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13. Total body copper is increased, with excess copper deposited in, and causing damage to, several organs. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings are a common ophthalmologic finding in patients with Wilson disease. Initially thought to be due to the accumulation of silver, they were first demonstrated to contain copper in 1934. KF rings are seen in most of the patients with neurologic involvement from Wilson disease. These rings are caused by deposition of excess copper on the inner surface of the cornea in the Descemet membrane. A slit lamp examination is mandatory to make a diagnosis of KF rings paicularly in the early stages unless the rings are visible to the naked eye in conditions of severe copper overload. Kayser-Fleischer rings do not cause any impairment of vision but disappear with treatment and reappear with disease progression. KF rings not specific to Wilson disease alone, they are also seen in other chronic cholestatic disorders such as primary biliary cholangitis and children with neonatal cholestasis.

Systolic BP of a group of person follows normal distribution curve. The mean BP is 120 . The values above 120 are:,25%,75%,50%,100%,"Probability distributions. The values of a random variable can be summarized in a frequency distribution called a probability distribution. Three such distributions are impoant in medicine; Binomial and Poisson distributions are discrete probability distributions of a variable that can have only two outcomes (yes or no). The associated random variable can take only integer values, 0,1,2,3...n. Normal (Gaussian) distribution is continuous, so it can take on any values. The curve is inveed, bell shaped and smooth. The peak represents the mean, median and mode all of which coincide. The variation is measured by standard detion. The area under the curve is equal to 1(because it is a probability distribution). The area on the left half of the mean is equal to the area on the right half of the mean. We use the standard normal distribution curve, which has a mean of 0 and a standard detion of 1. It is also called the z-distribution. 68.2% of all values lie between -1 and + 1 SD around the mean. 95.4% of all values lie between -2 and +2 SD. Poisson's Distribution In probability theory and statistics Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed period of time if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. It can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume. The distribution was discovered by Simeon Denis Poisson. The work focused on ceain random variables N that count, among other things, a number of discrete occurrences (sometimes called arrivals) that take place during a time interval of given length.

"A 25-year-old woman complains of persistent bleeding for 5 days after a dental extraction.

She denies ecchymoses or bleeding into joints. Her father has noticed similar symptoms but has not sought medical care. Physical examination is normal except for mild oozing from the dental site. She does not have splenomegaly or enlarged lymph nodes. Her CBC is normal, with a platelet count of 230,000. Her prothrombin time is normal, but the partial thromboplastin time is mildly prolonged. The bleeding time is 12 minutes (normal 3-9 minutes). What is most appropriate way to control her bleeding?",Factor VIII concentrate,Fresh frozen plasma,Desmopressin (DDAVP),Whole blood transfusion,"This woman's lifelong history of excessive bleeding suggests an inherited bleeding problem, as does the positive family history. The prolonged PTT indicates a deficiency of factors VIII, IX, XI, or XII, but the commonest of these deficiencies (classic hemophilia A and Christmas disease, or hemophilia B) are vanishingly rare in women. Furthermore, the continued oozing from dental sites and the absence of ecchymoses or hemarthroses suggest a platelet function disorder, as does the prolonged bleeding time. Von Willebrand disease is an autosomal dominant condition that leads to both platelet and factor VIII dysfunction and is the likeliest diagnosis in this patient. Although factor VIII concentrates can be used for life-threatening bleeding, most will respond to desmopressin, which raises the von Willebrand factor level in the most common form (the so- called type 1 form) of this disease. Mild von Willebrand disease is fairly common (1 in 250 individuals). Fresh frozen plasma and whole blood are much less effective ways to deliver factor YIII.

Which of the following is the likely pathogenesis of this disease?",Autoantibodies directed against the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor causing neuromuscular transmission failure,Destruction of anterior horn cells by virus,Progressive muscular atrophy caused by spinal degeneration,Demyelinating disease,"The disease process described is myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disease marked by muscle weakness and fatigability. Myasthenia gravis results from a reduction in the number of junctional acetylcholine receptors as a result of autoantibodies. Antibodies cross-link these receptors, causing increased endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes. A decreased number of available acetylcholine receptors results in decreased efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. MG patients also have autoantibodies against muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) receptors. MG presents with weakness and fatigability, particularly of cranial muscles, causing diplopia, ptosis, nasal speech, and dysarthria. Proximal limb weakness also occurs. Diseases of the central nervous system (poliomyelitis, Friedreich ataxia, or multiple sclerosis, as in the option b, c, and d) cause changes in reflexes, sensation, or coordination. ALS, a pure motor disorder, causes fasciculations and muscle atrophy as a result of lower motor neuron involvement. McArdle disease, a glycogen storage disease, causes muscle cramping and occasionally rhabdomyolysis with heavy exertion but only very rarely with usual daily activities.Ten percent of myasthenia patients have thymic tumors. Surgical removal of a thymoma is necessary because of local tumor spread. Even in the absence of tumor, 85% of patients clinically improve after thymectomy. It is common practice to perform thymectomy in most patients with generalized MG who are between puberty and age 55.",A

False about Pulse polio immunization is,Mop up immunization is done in restricted geographical areas,It is carried out in all children less than 5 yrs of age,Mopping up is done in areas where wild polio virus is found,AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. AFP surveillance is done in all children < 5 years of age AFP surveillance is carried out in all children below 15 years of age AFP SurveillanceAcute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is carried out to identify all remaining infected areas, monitor progress towards eradication and target supplementary immunization appropriately.The term AFP means paralysis of acute onset involving limbs leading to flaccidity. Poliomylelitis is most important etiology of AFP, other are - GBS (Guillain-Barre syndrome), transverse myelitis and traumatic neuritis.AFP surveillance aims at detecting cases of AFP and reporting them immediately to district immunization officer.Surveillance is carried out for all cases of AFP and not just for poliomyelitis. All cases of AFP are reported, regardless of the final diagnosis. As paralytic poliomyelitis is one cause of AFP, maintaining a high sensitivity of AFP reporting will ensure that all cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are detected, reported and investigated, resulting in preventive central measures to interrupt the transmission of disease.The aim of AFP surveillance is to detect polio virus transmission, and the earlier the stool is collected, the greater the chance of detecting polio virus.WHO recommends the immediate reporting and investigation of every case of AFP in children less than 15 yrs (As AFP in a person > 15 yrs is unlikely to be polio. Still, AFP surveillance must be flexible enough to report any case of AFP in an adult, if suspected to be due to poliomyelitis)Cases of AFP are classified as Polio if:Wild polio virus is isolated from any stool specimen.Cases of AFP without isolation of wild polio virus may be classified as 'polio compatible' if:Stool specimens were inadequate andResidual weakness was present 60 days after onset of paralysis or 60-day follow-up was not done (due to death or absence) and'Expert review' concludes that these cases could not be discarded as 'non-polio' based on available data.WHO recommends obtaining 2 stool samples from AFP cases within 14 days of paralysis onset and sent to WHO accredited laboratory using Reverse cold chain.AFP surveillance is evaluated by 2 key indicators :the sensitivity of reporting (target being non-polio AFP rate of at least 1 case per 100,000 children aged less than 15 years, this is the 'background' rate of AFP among children. Non-polio causes of AFP such as GBS, transverse myelitis, & traumatic neuritis account for this background rate.)the completeness of specimen collection (target being 2 adequate stool specimens from at least 80 per cent of all AFP cases).Mop-up ActivityMop-up activity is a house-to-house activity where two rounds of polio immunization, 4-6 weeks apart are conducted to limit the transmission of wild poliovirus.Under the mop-up activity, children below 5 years of age are covered in affected and neighbouring districts around every detected positive polio case.The basic strategy for eradicating polio consists of:High infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral polio vaccine in the first year of life;National Immunization Days during which every child below 5 years gets 2 additional doses of OPV on 2 days separated by 4 to 6 weeks.Surveillance of AFP to identify all reservoirs of wild polio virus transmission through reporting and laboratory testing of all cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children under fifteen years of age;.Extensive house-to-house immunization mopping-up campaigns in the final stages where wild poliovirus transmission persists.",D

Screening for breast cancer using mammography is,Primordial prevention,Primary prevention,Secondary prevention,Teiary Prevention,"Secondary prevention is the identification and treatment of premalignant or subclinical cancers. Screening by means of mammography is a typical example of secondary prevention. Teiary prevention is defined as symptoms control and rehabilitation. Screening for breast cancer There is evidence that screening for breast cancer has a ourable effect on moality from breast cancer. The basic techniques for early detection of breast cancer are : (a} breast self-examination (BSE) by the patient (b) palpation by a physician (c) thermography (d) mammography. All women should be encouraged to perform breast self- examination. Breast cancers are more frequently found by women themselves than by a physician during a routine examination. Although the effectiveness of BSE has not been adequately quantified, it is a useful adjuvant to early case detection. In many countries, BSE will probably be the only feasible approach to wide population coverage for a long time to come. Palpation is unreliable for large fatty breasts. Thermography has the advantage that the patient is not exposed to radiation. Unfounately, it is not a sensitive tool. Mammography is most sensitive and specific in detecting small tumours that are sometimes missed on palpation. The use of mammography has three potential drawbacks: (i) exposure to radiation. This may amount to a dose of 500 milliroentgen compared to a 30-40 milliroentgen dose received in chest X-ray. Therefore, there has been concern about exposure to radiation from repeated mammographies and the risk of breast cancer developing as a result (ii) mammography requires technical equipment of a high standard and radiologists with very considerable experience - these two factors limit its more widespread use for mass screening purposes, and (iii) biopsy from a suspicious lesion may end up in a false-positive in as many as 5-10 cases for each case of cancer detected. Although recent evidence points to the superiority of mammography over clinical examination in terms of sensitivity and specificity, medical opinion is against routine mammography on the very young. Women under 35 years of age should not have X-rays unless they are symptomatic or a family history of early onset of breast cancer Ref : Park 23rd edition Pgno : 387",C

While handling a febrile neutropenic patient all are essential vccpf :,Repeated hand washing of hospital person,White cell infusion,Prophylactic antibiotic,Colony stimulating factor for macrophages,"Answer is B (White cell infusion) While all might be used, the best to be eliminated here is a 'white cell transfusion' as its exact role is yet to be established. White cell infusion (transfusion) as a measure is still controversial- Harrison Neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to infections, and therefore, surgical cleanliness is the first step to ensuring a decreased infection potential - Repeated hand washing Prophylactic antibiotics are ceainly required. Patients with luekopenias and leukocyte dysfunction often have delayed inflammatory responses to infection. Therefore clinical manifestations may be minimal despite overwhelming infection. This necessitates early and prompt institution of prophylactic antibiotics at the earliest suspected sign of infection. Prolonged antibiotics are often required. Recombinant G-CSF and M-CSF is indicated in the management of ceain forms of neutropenia due to depressed production. These enhance granulocyte recovery specially that after chemotherapy and consequently shoen the period of maximal vulnerability to fatal infections. Other agents used include INF which non specifically enhance phagocytic cell function and sho courses of Glucocoicoids.

Post-test probability = Pre-test probability x likelihood ratio The pre test probability depends on the prevalence of the disease and the clinical assessment. The likelihood ratio provides a direct estimate of how much a test result will change the probability of having the disease. Because tests can be positive or negative, there are two likelihood ratios for each test. The 'positive likelihood ratio' tells us how much to increase the probability of a disease if the test is positive, while the 'negative likelihood ratio tells us how much to decrease it if the test is negative. The likelihood ratio incorporates both the sensitivity and specificity of the test and can be calculated by following formulae: LR (+) sensitivity / 1 - specificity LR (-) = 1 - sensitivity / specificity",A

Hypocalcemia with hypophosphatemia is seen in:September 2006,Crush injury,Rhabdomyolysis,Vitamin D dependent rickets-II,Renal failure,"Ans. C: Vitamin D dependent rickets-IIIn rhabdomyolysis due to crush injury, hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia may occur. Severe intravascular hemolysis may lead to a similar syndrome.Hyperphosphatemia alters calcium and phosphate ion solubility products, and calcium deposition in soft tissue may occur. The lower circulating concentrations of 1, 25 (OH)2D may fuher aggravate the hypocalcemia by impairing intestinal absorption of calcium.Hyperphosphatemic-induced hypocalcemia inhibits vitamin D synthesis and results in an increase in PTH secretion. Secondary hyperparathyroidism from long-term hyperphosphatemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency. Treatment should be directed towards the hyperphosphatemia in order to correct the hypocalcemia.Hypophosphatemia is more severe than hypocalcemia in vitamin D deficiency states because of the increased secretion of PTH, which is only paly active in elevating blood calcium but is capable of phosphaturia.",C
For which of the following has the cytoxic effect of vitamin on human lymphocytes in vitro at high concentration been repoed -,Vitamin A,Vitamin D,Vitamin E,Vitamin K,"VITAMIN E (Tocopherol) Vitamin E is the generic name for a group of closely related and naturally occurring fat soluble compounds, the tocopherols. Of these alpha-tocopherol is biologically the most potent. Vitamin E is widely distributed in foods. By far the richest sources are vegetable oils, cotton-seed, sunflower seed, egg yolk and butter. Foods rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids are also rich in vitamin E. The usual plasma level of vitamin E in adults is between 0.8 and 1.4 mg per 100 ml. While there is no doubt that man requires tocopherol in his diet, there is no clear indication of dietary deficiency. The role of vitamin E at the molecular level is little understood. The current estimate of vitamin E requirement is about 0.8 mg/g of essential fatty acids. This roughly works out to 8-10 mg tocopherol per day depending on the edible oil used. Recently the cytotoxic effect of vitamin E on human lymphocytes in vitro at high concentrations has been repoed. This being so, caution should be exercised against the mega-dose consumption of vitamin E in clinical practice. Ref : Park 25th edition Pgno : 657",C

This patient does not have dementia, which requires impairment in memory and one other cognitive domain (language, spatial orientation, or executive function). The Folstein mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are screening tests for Alzheimer disease. Most authorities use MMSE and MoCA scores of less than 26 as a positive screen. This patient is on the borderline of a positive screen. Patients with isolated but significant cognitive impairment, but who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for dementia, are often classified as having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI is often accompanied by depression and can be due to vitamin B12 deficiency, for which the patient should be screened. Patients with mild cognitive impairment are at higher risk for progression to frank dementia (12% per year in some series), but some of these patients will never develop progressive memory loss.

Methods of pasteurisation:- 1. Holder method- milk is kept at 63-66 deg C for at least 30 minutes and then quickly cooled to 5 deg C. 2. HTST method- high temperature and sho time method. Very large quantities of milk can be pasteurized by this method. 3. UHT method- ultra high temperature method. Pasteurization kills 90% of bacteria in milk including the more heat resistant tubercle bacillus and Q fever organism. But it will not kill thermoduric bacteria or bacterial spores. Despite pasteurization, bacteria are bound to multiply. In order to check the growth of microorganisms, pasteurized milk is rapidly cooled to 4 deg C. Hygienically produced pasteurized milk has a keeping quality of not more than 8-12 hours at 18 deg C. Tests of pasteurized milk:- 1. Phosphatase test 2. Standard plate count 3.

Clinical Findings in Mitral Stenosis Upon auscultation of an individual with mitral stenosis, the first hea sound is usually loud and may be palpable (tapping apex beat) because of increased force in closing the mitral valve. The first hea sound is made by the mitral and tricuspid hea valves closing. These are normally synchronous, and the sounds are termed M1 and T1, respectively. M1 becomes louder in mitral stenosis. It may be the most prominent sign. If pulmonary hypeension secondary to mitral stenosis is severe, the P2 (pulmonic) component of the second hea sound (S2) will become loud. An opening snap that is a high-pitch additional sound may be heard after the A2 (aoic) component of the second hea sound (S2), which correlates to the forceful opening of the mitral valve. A mid-diastolic rumbling murmur with presystolic accentuation will be heard after the opening snap.The murmur is best heard at the apical region and is not radiated. Since it is a low-pitch sound, it is heard best with the bell of the stethoscope.Its duration increases with worsening disease.Rolling the patient toward left as well as isometric exercise will accentuate the murmur.
