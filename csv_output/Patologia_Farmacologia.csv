"A 55-year-old female with painful chronic diarrhea, multiple recurrent duodenal ulcers, and increased basal gastric acid output is most likely to hav",A gastrin-secreting tumor of the pancreas,A serotonin-secreting tumor of the ileum,A somatostatin-secreting tumor of the duodenum,An epinephrine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla,"Functional islet cell tumors of the pancreas secrete specific substances that result in several syndromes. Pancreatic gastrinomas (tumors of the G cells of the pancreas) secrete gastrin and are a cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This syndrome consists of intractable gastric hypersecretion, severe peptic ulceration of the duodenum and jejunum, and high serum levels of gastrin. The majority of gastrinomas are malignant. Insulinomas (tumors of b cells) are the most common islet cell neoplasm and are usually benign. Symptoms include low blood sugar, hunger, sweating, and nervousness. Glucagonomas (islet cell tumors of the a cells) secrete glucagon and are characterized by mild diabetes, anemia, venous thrombosis, severe infections, and a migratory, necrotizing, erythematous skin rash. d cell tumors, which secrete somatostatin, produce a syndrome associated with mild diabetes, gallstones, steatorrhea, and hypochlorhydria. The majority of d cell tumors are malignant. D1 tumors produce Verner-Morrison syndrome, which is characterized by explosive, profuse diarrhea with hypokalemia and hypochlorhydria. This combination of symptoms is referred to as pancreatic cholera Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

The drug used in petit mal seizures and has a narrow spectrum of antiepileptic activity is:,Lamotrigine,Ethosuximide,Sodium valproate,Primidone,"Ethosuximide is paicularly effective against absence seizures but has a very narrow spectrum of clinical activity. Documentation of its effectiveness in human absence seizures was achieved with long-term electroencephalographic recording techniques.Ethosuximide has an impoant effect on Ca2+ currents, reducing the low-threshold (T-type) current. This effect is seen at therapeutically relevant concentrations in thalamic neurons. The T-type Ca2+ currents are thought to provide a pacemaker current in thalamic neurons responsible for generating the rhythmic coical discharge of an absence attack. Inhibition of this current could, therefore, account for the specific therapeutic action of ethosuximide. A recently described effect on inwardly rectifying K + channels may also be significant.Reference: Katzung Pharmacology; 13th edition; Chapter 24; Antiseizure Drugs",B
Hemotoxylin bodies are seen in ?,SLE,PAN,RA,Wegners granulomatosis,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many pas of the body.

Dopamine is preferred over dobutamne in treatment of renal shock because: March 2011,Renal vasodilatory effect,Increased cardiac output,Peripheral vasoconstriction,Prolonged action,"Ans. A: Renal vasodilatory effect Dobutamine: In patients with low output cardiac fialure, dobutamine increases the cardiac output without increasing the hea rate. Unlike dopamine, it does not cause renal vasodilatation. Dopamine/ DA It is a catecholamine neurotransmitter In the brain, this substituted phenethylamine functions as a neurotransmitter, activating the five types of dopamine receptors -- D,, D,, D.,, D4, and D. - and their variants. Dopamine is produced in several areas of the brain, including the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Dopamine is also a neurohormone released by the hypothalamus. Its main function as a hormone is to inhibit the release of prolactin from the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, dopamine given as a drug does not directly affect the central nervous system. To increase the amount of dopamine in the brains of patients with diseases such as parkinson's disease and doparesponsive dystonia, 1-dopa (the precursor of dopamine) is often given because it crosses the blood-brain barrier relatively easily",A

True regarding ubiquitin is: September 2009,Required for apoptosis,It is found throughout the cell,Found only in eukaryotes,All of the above,"Ans. D: All of the above Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small protein that is composed of 76 amino acids. This protein is found only in eukaryotic organisms and is not found in either eubacteria or archaebacteria. Ub is a heat-stable protein that folds up into a compact globular structure. It is found throughout the cell (thus, giving rise to its name) and can exist either in free form or as pa of a complex with other proteins. Single Ub molecules can be conjugated to the lysine of these proteins, or more commonly, Ub-chains can be attached. Ub is involved in many cell processes. Ub is conjugated to the protein cyclin during the G1 phase of mitosis and thus plays an impoant role in regulating the cell cycle. Ub conjugation is also involved in DNA repair, embryogenesis, the regulation of transcription, and apoptosis (programmed cell death).",D

All are true about Exenatide except aEUR',>Decreases glucagon secretion,It is GLPI analogue,>Used in type 1 DM,>Given subcutaneously,"Used in type I diabetes mellitus Exenatide belongs to class of drugs called ""incretins"". Incretins are insulin stimulation hypoglycemic factor found in the duodenum. - Incretin hormones are produced in the gastrointestinal tract in response to nutrient entry. Incretins, in turn, stimulate insulin, secretion. - Glucagon like polypeptide (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) are two examples of incretins. Glucagon like peptide (GLP-1) is a naturally occurring peptide that enhances insulin secretion in response to raised plasma glucose concentrations. It can lower blood glucose level by other methods too. It does so by: ? - Increasing the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. - Slows absorption of glucose from the gut. - Reduces the action of glucagon (Glucagon increases glucose production by liver). These actions of GLP-1 lead to lowering of blood sugar levels. Thus, the compound has unique propeies to reduce postprandial glucose level. But these propeies are offset by very impoant adverse effect. - GLP-1 is rapidly (1-2 minutes) deactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV DPP (IV) enzyme. Thus GLP-1 must be infused continuously to have therapeutic benefits. Consequently, considerable work has been performed to produce GLP- 1 receptor agonist that maintain the physiological effects of native incretin but are resistant to the action of DPP IV. Exenatide is a synthetic GLP-1 receptor agonist that is resistant to DPP-IV and has full agonistic activity for GLP-1 receptors. Exenatide is approved only for use as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are taking metformin, sulfonylurea or a combination of both hut have not achieved adequate glycemic control. -This drug is effective in lowering glycosylated hemoglobin concentration and promotes weight loss in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide is injected ""subcutaneously"" within 60 minutes before meal. - When exenatide is added to preexisting sulfottylurea therapy the oral hypoglycemic dosage should be reduced to prevent hypoglycemia.",C

Which of the following would be the best therapy for this patient?",Theophylline,Steroids,Antibiotics,Isoniazid,") Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IF) may be a slowly progressive disease with no recognizable etiology. This disease entity has many names, such as chronic interstitial pneumonitis and diffuse fibrosing alveolitis, but the common name is usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP). The form of this disease that progresses very rapidly is called Hamman-Rich syndrome. The pathogenesis of UIP involves damage to type I pneumocytes with the subsequent proliferation of type II pneumocytes and secretion of factors by macrophages that cause fibrosis. The end-stage form of IF is characterized by large cysts with intervening fibrosis, which impas the gross appearance of a ""honeycomb lung."" There are several subtypes of IF, which are characterized by their histologic appearance. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) has numerous lymphocytes, Giant cell interstitial pneumonitis (GIP) has giant cells, and plasma cell interstitial pneumonitis (PIP) has numerous plasma cells. LIP is seen in patients with Sjogren's syndrome or AIDS and is associated with an increased risk of developing lymphoma. An impoant subtype is desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), which is characterized histologically by sheets of cells within the alveoli. This type of IF may respond to the use of steroids. UIP, in contrast, does not respond to therapy, and therefore treatment is symptomatic treatment only.

"A 32 year old female presents with pelvic pain, low back pain, and a sensation of ""pulling"" or ""stretching"" in her groin. Bimanual examination reveals a firm mass in the right adnexa. An ultrasound examination reveals the presence of fluid in the abdominal cavity and the right thoracic cavity. Which of the following conditions is most strongly suggested by this patient's presentation?",Ectopic pregnancy,Endometrial implant,Ovarian fibroma,Pelvic inflammatory disease,"Meigs syndrome is the unusual combination of hydrothorax (often right sided), ascites, and an ovarian tumor (often a benign fibroma). Low back pain and a stretching or pulling sensation are characteristic of ascites in some patients (ascites can also be asymptomatic). The etiology of the fluid accumulation in Meigs syndrome remains a mystery. Ectopic pregnancy would not be associated with hydrothorax. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptured, blood could accumulate in the abdominal cavity, but the patient would likely be hypotensive or dead. An endometrial implant could cause pain, or impair feility, but would not be expected to produce the combination of ascites and isolated right-sided hydrothorax. Pelvic inflammatory disease would be unlikely to produce the combination of ascites and isolated right-sided hydrothorax, although it might cause low back pain or pelvic pain.

The most common cause of beta thalassemia,Mutations  leading  to  aberrant  RNA  splicing.,Mutations  lie  within  the  β-globin  promoter  and lower  the  rate  of  β-globin  gene  transcription.,Mutations  involve  the  coding  regions  of  the  β-globin  gene,All of the above are equally common,"The  mutations  responsible  for  β-thalassemia  disrupt β-globin synthesis in several different ways
Mutations  leading  to  aberrant  RNA  splicing  are the most common cause of β-thalassemia. Some of these mutations disrupt the normal RNA splice junctions; as a result, no mature mRNA is made and there is a  complete  failure  of  β-globin  production,  creating  β 0 .
Other mutations create new splice junctions in abnormal positions—within  an  intron,  for  example.  Because  the normal splice sites are intact, both normal and abnormal splicing occurs, and some normal β-globin mRNA is made.

These alleles are designated β + .

Some  mutations  lie  within  the  β-globin  promoter  and lower  the  rate  of  β-globin  gene  ranscription.  Because some normal β-globin is synthesized, these are β +  alleles.
Other  mutations  involve  the  coding  regions  of  the  β-globin  gene,  usually  with  severe  consequences.  For example, some single-nucleotide changes create termination  (“stop”)  codons  that  interrupt  the  translation  of β-globin mRNA and completely prevent the synthesis of β-globin.",A

Examine the above pedigree cha. Which one of the following diseases is the most likely for this situation?,Neurofibromatosis,Beta-thalassemia,Colour blindness,Vitamin D resistant rickets,"Beta thalassemias (b thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders. They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at 1 in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation. HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads to the underproduction of HbA. Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB for sufficient red blood cell functioning. Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions to make up for the blockage in the beta-chains. Repeated blood transfusions can lead to build-up of iron overload, ultimately resulting in iron toxicity. This iron toxicity can cause various problems, including myocardial siderosis and hea failure leading to the patient's death.",B

Not a feature of hereditary Spherocytosis:March 2007,Autosomal dominant,Increased RBC surface area,Increased MCHC,Normal or decreased MCV,"Ans. B: Increased RBC surface areaIt's the only condition presenting with Increased MCHCSpherocytosis is caused by a molecular defect in one or more of the proteins of the red blood cell cytoskeleton, including, spectrin, ankyrin so blood cell contracts to its most surface-tension efficient and least flexible configuration, a sphere( spherocytes).They have a high osmotic fragility and are more prone to physical degradation.They are most commonly found in immunologically-mediated hemolytic anemias and in hereditary spherocytosis, but the former would have a positive direct Coombs test and the latter would not.The misshapen but otherwise healthy red blood cells are mistaken by the spleen for old or damaged red blood cells and it thus constantly breaks them down, causing a cycle whereby the body destroys its own blood supply (auto-hemolysis). Chronic symptoms include anemia and splenomegaly. As a result of the broken-down blood cells -- bilirubin -- accumulates in the gallbladder and can cause pigmented gallstones to develop.In peripheral blood smears, red blood cells will appear abnormally small.The CBC will show elevated MCHC.The bone marrow in its role of manufacturing red blood cells will display hyperplasia, the increased activity of replacing RBCs.

What is the best diagnosis?",Acute pyelonephritis,Acute tubular necrosis,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Chronic pyelonephritis,"Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) may produce oliguria, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased fractional excretion of sodium, and an abnormal urinary sediment. ATN may be caused by renal ischemia (ischemic ATN) or chemical toxins (toxic ATN). Renal ischemia is the most common cause of ATN, while toxic ATN may be caused by antibiotics (such as aminoglycosides and amphotericin B), heavy metals (such as cisplatin), radiographic agents, and endogenous toxins (such as myoglobin and hemoglobin). Both ischemic ATN and toxic ATN are characterized by the finding of eosinophilic hyalin or pigmented granular casts in the urine. Histologically, both ischemic and toxic ATN reveal interstitial edema, flattening of the tubular epithelial cells, and tubular epithelial cell necrosis. One difference between these two etiologies is that the tubular epithelial cell necrosis is extensive with toxic ATN, while the necrosis with ischemic ATN is patchy with interposed unaffected segments. This can be quite variable, however, and ceain causes may be associated with damage to specific poions of the kidney. Both ischemia and heavy metals primarily damage the epithelial cells of the proximal straight tubules, while aminoglycosides primarily affect the proximal convoluted tubule.

Benzodiazepines differ from barbiturates in the following aspects except:,They have a steeper dose response curve,They have higher therapeutic index,They have lower abuse liability,They do not induce microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes,"BENZODIAZEPINES (BZDs) BZDs produce a lower degree of neuronal depression than barbiturates. They have a high therapeutic index They have lower abuse liability: tolerance is mild, psychological and physical dependence, drug seeking and withdrawal syndrome are less marked BZDs do not alter disposition of other drugs by microsomal enzyme induction A specific BZD antagonist flumazenil is available which can be used in case of poisoning. The slope of the DRC is also impoant. A steep slope indicates that a moderate increase in dose will markedly increase the response (dose needs individualization), while a flat one implies that little increase in response will occur over a wide dose range (standard doses can be given to most patients). Barbiturates have steep DRC and BZDs have a flat DRC(dose response curve). Ref:- kd tripathi;pg num:-55, 401",A

True Statement about silicosis -,Produces pleural plaque,Associated with tuberculosis,Lower lobe infiltration,All,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Associated with tuberculosis Silicosis 3 Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica). o Currently, it is the most prevalent occupational disease in the world. Silicosis is a slowly progressive disease, usually presenting after decades of exposure as slowly progressive nodular fibrosing pneumoconiosis. Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms but crystalline forms are much more fibrogenic. The crystalline form are quaz, crystobalite. Silicosis is characterized in its early stages by nodules in the upper zones of the lung. As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars. o Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura. Sometimes thin sheets of calcification occur in the lymph nodes and are seen radiographically as eeg shell calcification i.e. (calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification. o It the disease continues to progress, expansion and coalescence of lesions produce progressive massive fibrosis. o Histologically the lesions of silicosis consists of concentric layers of hyalinized collagen surrounded by a dense capsule of more condensed collagen. o Examination of the nodules by polarized microscopy reveals the birefringent silica paicles. Silicosis is associated with an increased susceptibility to T.B. It is postulated that silicosis results in depression of cell mediated immunity and the crystalline silica may inhibit the ability of pulmonary macrophages to kill phagocytosed mycobacteria. o Nodules of silicotuberculosis often display a central zone of caseation.",B

Which of the following drugs is to be discontinued on the day of surgery,Atenolol,Amlodipine,Metformin,Statins,"Metformin If the patient is taking an oral hypoglycemic agent preoperatively the drug can be continued until the day of surgery, but sulfonylureas and nzetfornzin should not be used 24-48 h before surgery beause of their long half-lives. Patients with type 11 diabetes mellitus should be stopped oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic acidosis) About other options Antihypeensive agents With rare exceptions antihypeensive drug therapy should be continued upto the time of surgery. Some clinicians withhold ACE inhibitors on the morning of surgery because of their association with an increased incidence of intraoperative hypotension. However withholding these agents increases the risk of marked perioperative hypeension and the need for parenteral antihypeensive agents. Surgical procedures on patients with sustained preoperative diastolic blood pressure higher than 110 mmHg-paicularly those with evidence of endorgan damage should be delayed until blood pressure is better controlled over the course of several days. Beta blockers A sudden stop can result in rebound hypeension, tachycardia and recurrent myocardial ischemia. They are continued up to and including morning of surgery and restaed immediately afterwards. Antianginal drugs Antianginal drugs such as calcium channel blockers or nitrates (GTN) should not be stopped before surgery without a very specific reason or angina may recur. Calcium channel blockers They have antiischaemic propey despite a theoretical risk of increased bleeding. They should be continued upto including the day of surgery. Nitrates To be continued up to and including day of surgery. About other classes of drugs Statins They should have a beneficial effect on outcome especially after coronary aery bypass grafting thus they are continued up to the day of surgery. Alpha 2 agonists Abrupt withdrawl an result in extreme hypeension and myocardial ischemia. So it should be continued upto and including the day of surgery. Diuretics There is risk of hypovolemia and hypotension but still should be continued up to the day of surgery. Digoxin and antiarryhthmics Should be continued upto the day of surgery. ACE inhibitors Continued use can result in perioperative hemodynamic instability For hypeension: continued to the day of surgery For hea failure: discontinue on the day of surgery especially if baseline blood pressure is low. Drugs that should be stopped before surgery Lithium It should be stopped 2 days before major surgery as it potentiates the non depolarizing group of relaxants and in emergency cases suxamethonium and regional blocks should be considered as alternative. Oestrogen containing oral contraceptive pills They are stopped before surgery beause they increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis. Surgery and the combined pill both reduce the activity of antithrombin Combined pills, should if possible be discontinued 4 weeks before major elective surgery or leg surgery such as varicose veins and staed again at the first period following an interval of 2 weeks after the operation. Aspirin Use may be associated with increased bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. They should be stopped 5-7 days before surgery if possible. Oral anticoagulants (warfarin) Should be stopped 4 days prior to surgery and substituted by iv heparin. Oral hypoglycemics Patients with type II diabetes mellitus should stop oral hypoglycemics several days prior to surgery (especially metformin which is known to contribute to postoperative lactic (acidosis) Patients on insulin (SC or iv) should omit their morning dose. Also know about these Monoamine oxidase inhibitors These drugs irreversibly inhibit monoamine oxidase. Stopping these drugs three weeks prior to anaesthesia to allow resynthesis of the enzyme is no longer considered necessary. Tricyclic antidepressants It competitively blocks norepinephrine reuptake by postganglionis sympathetic nerve endings. Patients taking these drugs are therefore more sensitive to catecholamines so any sympathominetic given simultaneously may cause hypeension and arryhthmia. These drugs were discontinued earlier but nowdays they are used.",C

""Caseous necrosis (occuring in TB) is a distinctive forms of coagulative necrosis but unlike a coagulative necrosis the tissue architecture is completely obliterated"". - Robbins illustrated (basis), 6/e, p17. o Thus both gangrene and tuberculosis are variants of coagulative necrosis. You may choose your answer. Gangrenous necrosis o Gangrenous necrosis is of two types:? Dry gangrene Wet gangrene Dry gangrene It is a clinically distinct variant of coagulative necrosis. It occurs most commonly in the soft tissue of lower limbs (Leg, foot, toes) as a result of ischemia due to aerial occlusion, that leads to coagulative necrosis. Then, why is it called gangrenous necrosis not coagulative necrosis ? Lets see. Since the extent of vascular occlusion is frequently global in the lower limbs, which impedes or prevents the migration of leukocytes in to the area of coagulative necrosis, it is called gangrenous necrosis because the dead tissue is not digested and removed but remains mummified. Wet gangrene o When overlying skin of dry gangrenous tissue is devitalized, bacterial infection is superimposed and the coagulative necrosis is modified by liquifactive necrosis. So, o Dry gangrene --> Variant of Coagulative necrosis. Wet gangrene --> Liquifactive necrosis is superimposed on coagulative necrosis.",A

The term does not refer to the presence of inflammatory cells, abscess, or any special histologic type of breast carcinoma; rather, it refers to more of a clinical phenomenon, in that the breast is swollen, erythematous, and indurated and demonstrates a marked increase in warmth. These changes are caused by widespread lymphatic and vascular permeation within the breast itself and in the deep dermis of the overlying skin by breast carcinoma cells. The clinical induration and erythema are presumably related to lymphatic-vascular blockage by tumor cells; if present, these findings mean a worse prognosis.

Antibody against tumor cells-,MHC-I,MHC-II,Anti viral,Differentiated antigen,"MHC class I molecules are one of two primary classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (the other being MHC class II) and are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the bodies of jawed veebrates. They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of non-self proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a paicular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway. In humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Function Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I:peptide complex is then inseed endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular pas of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC:peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and ceain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing. PirB and Visual Plasticity Paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual coex.",A

"During an employment health check at Infosys, Bangalore, a 45-year-old man, Narayan, is noted to have a 3 cm palpable nodule in one lobe of an otherwise normal sized thyroid gland. Needle aspiration of the nodule demonstrates polygonal tumor cells and amyloid, but only very scanty colloid and normal follicular cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Follicular thyroid carcinoma,Hashimoto's disease,Medullary thyroid carcinoma,Papillary thyroid carcinoma,"The most distinctive clue is the presence of amyloid, which specifically suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma. This carcinoma is a tumor of the neuroendocrine parafollicular cells of the thyroid, rather than the follicular lining epithelium. These cells produce calcitonin, the precursor protein of which can precipitate, forming bands and nodules of amyloid that appear histologically identical to other forms of amyloid. The other thing to remember about medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is that it can be a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes type IIa (parathyroid disease, pheochromocytomas, medullary carcinoma) and type IIb (parathyroid disease, pheochromocytomas, medullary carcinoma, mucocutaneous ganglioneuromas, Marfanoid habitus).Because follicular thyroid carcinoma closely resembles normal thyroid tissue, it usually cannot be reliably diagnosed based on fine needle aspiration alone.

Hematopoietic stem cell differ from progenitor stem cell in that they can –,Form terminally differentiated cells,Produce growth factors,Have receptors for anchoring proteins,Long term reconstitution of bone marrow,"There are two major types of stem cells
1) Embryonic stem cells (ES)

These are pluripotent cells which can differentiate into all the tissues of the human body.

2) Adult stem cells

Adult stem cells have a more restricted differentiation capacity and are usually lineage-specific, i.e. multipotent or unipotent. There are two types of adult stem cells

A) Bone marrow stem cells

These are hematopoietic stem cells which reside in bone marrow and differentiate into various blood cells. Although residing mainly in the marrow, a subset circulates normally in the peripheral blood.
From 3 weeks to 3 months of intraembryonic life, hematopoietic stem cells in the yolk sac are the primary source of blood cells. From 3 months to just before birth stem cells, migrate to the liver, which is the major organ for hematopoiesis during that period. After birth bone marrow becomes the major source.
A remarkable observation about hematopoietic stem cells is that they may capable of giving rise to neurons, hepatocytes, myocardium, bile duct cells, endothelial cells and skeletal muscle. This change in stem cell differentiation from one cell type to another is called transdifferentiation.
Other types of bone marrow stem cells are bone marrow stromal cells which can differentiate, depending on the tissue environment, into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, myoblasts, endothelial cell precursors.

The TNM stage of a tumor is determined by the tumor size and extent (T for tumor), lymph node involvement (N for nodes), and metastasis (M for metastasis). N0 always means no lymph nodes are involved. An NI lesion has positive nodes, and only 2nd choice, positive bronchial lymph nodes, changes the patient's nodal status. Involvement of the chest wall is a feature of tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging. T2 lesions involve the chest wall. Histological features of the tumor, such as small cell morphology , are not considered in tumor stage, but rather in tumor grade. Small cell tumors are considered high-grade carcinomas. Tumor extending to the carina reflects the tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging: T3 lesions involve the carina .

INFARCTION An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis by occlusion of either the aerial supply or venous drainage in a paicular tissue. Pathogenesis Mostly it is caused by interrupted blood supply. ""Nearly 99% of all infarcts results from thrombotic or embolic events and almost all result from aerial occlusion"". Other causes of interrupted aerial supply are local vasospasm, extrinsic compression of a vessel by tumor, twisting of vessel e.g., in testicular torsion, expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage within the plaque. Venous obstruction usually cause congesion, edema, infarction does not occur because bypass channels rapidly open after the thrombus, providing some outflow from the area, which inturn improves aerial inflow. Infarct cause by venous thrombosis is more likely in organs with a single venous outflow channel, such as in testis and ovary. Types of infarct Infarcts are classified on the basis of their color. Infarcts are classified into either Red (Haemorrhagic) or White or Pale (anaemic) infarcts, reflecting the amount of haemorrhage. Red infarcts (Haemorrhagic) : occur with : Venous occlusions (eg ovarian torsion); In loose tissues (such as lungs); In tissues with dual circulation (e.g. Lung & S. intestine) In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish venous out flow. When flow is reestablilshed to a site of previous aerial occulusion and necrosis. White or Pale infarcts : occur with : Aerial occlusions, or In solid organs e.g. Hea, spleen, Liver, kidney and brain where the solidity of tissue limits the amount of haemorrhage that can seep into the area of ischaemic necrosis.",D

Chediak Higashi syndrome is characterized by following except -,Is autosomal recessive disorder,Mutation in LYST gene,Effective phagolysosome formation.,Oculocutaneous albinism,"Chediak Higashi syndrome

It is an autosomal recessive disorder.
Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to a mutation in the LYST gene.
This gene provides instructions for making a protein, known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transport of materials into lysosomes.
Lysosomes contain several enzymes. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins.
During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.
Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.
As a result, most people with the chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, starting in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life-threatening,
Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected.
The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes, Dense bodies of platelets, Granules of Schwann cells.
There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.
In pigment cells called melanocytes, the melanosome becomes abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism i.e the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced. 
Abnormality in platelets produces bleeding disorders.
Defective in platelets produce bleeding disorders.
Defective granules in Schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy,
Most children with Chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelerated phase, (lymphoma-like a stage).
This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelerated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs.
The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life-threatening and lead to death.",C

Hand-foot syndrome, resulting from infarction of bones in the hands and feet, is the most common presenting symptom in young children. 
Acute chest syndrome, in which sluggish blood flow in inflamed lung (e.g., an area of pneumonia) leads to sickling within hypoxemic pulmonary beds. This exacerbates pulmonary dysfunction, creating a vicious circle of worsening pulmonary and systemic hypoxemia, sickling, and vaso-occlusion. Acute chest syndrome may also be triggered by fat emboli emanating from infarcted bone. 

Patients with sickle cell disease also are predisposed to Salmonella osteomyelitis, possibly in part because of poorly understood acquired defects in complement function.

All occurs in chronic inflammation except -,Infiltration of macrophages,Fibrosis,Infiltration of neutrophils,Angiogenesis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Infiltration of neutrophils Chronic inflammation Chronic inflammation is of prolonged duration in which active inflammation, tissue destruction and attempts of repair are proceeding simultaneously. It may : ? Begins insdiously without acute inflammation (more common). or Follows acute inflammation, when the injurious stimulus is persistent. Chronic inflammation is characterized by A. Mononuclear cell infiltration The macrophages are the major cells involved in chronic inflammation. Macrophages are derived from monocytes i.e., when these cell circulate in the blood, they are known as monocytes and when they come out from the circulation and become pa of the tissue, they are called macrophages. Macrophage accumulation persists in chronic inflammation by following mechanisms. Recruitment of monocyte from the circulation (most common). Local proliferation of the macrophages. Immobilization of macrophages at the site of inflammation. Other cells involved in chronic inflammation are plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells. B. Tissue destruction The products of activated macrophages serve to eliminate injurious agents such as microbes and to initiate the process of repair. These mediators also cause tissue injury because some of these are toxic to host cells, (reactive oxygen species) or extracellular matrix (proteases) and a variety of other substances may contribute to tissue damage in chronic inflammation. So, tissue destruction is one of the hallmark of chronic inflammation. C. Healing and Fibrosis Attempt at healing by connective tissue replacement of damaged tissue is accomponied by proliferation of new small vessels (angiogenesis) and fibrosis.",C

A specimen from a lung biopsy reveals occasional plexiform lesions within pulmonary aerioles. This abnormality is most characteristic of,Churg-Strauss syndrome,Adult respiratory distress syndrome,Wegener's granulomatosis,Pulmonary hypeension,") Pulmonary vascular sclerosis refers to the vascular changes associated with pulmonary hypeension. Elevation of the mean pulmonary aerial pressure is the result of endothelial dysfunction and vascular changes. The vascular changes vary with the size of the vessel. The main aeries have atheromas that are similar to systemic atherosclerosis, but are not as severe. Medium-sized aeries show intimal thickening and neomuscularization. Smaller aeries and aerioles show intimal thickening, medial hyperophy, and reduplication of the internal and external elastic membranes. A distinctive aeriolar change, a plexiform lesion, consists of intraluminal angiomatous tufts that form webs. This pattern is thought to be diagnostic of primary hypeension The changes of pulmonary vascular sclerosis may be primary or secondary. Primary pulmonary vascular sclerosis almost always occurs in young women, who develop fatigue, syncope (with exercise), dyspnea on exeion (DOE), and chest pain. Secondary sclerosis may occur at any age, and symptoms depend on the underlying cause. Possible causes include ceain types of hea disease, such as mitral valve disease, left ventricular failure, and congenital valvular disease with left-to-right shunt, as well as ceain types of pulmonary disease, such as chronic obstructive or interstitial lung disease and recurrent pulmonary emboli.

All are seen in PNH except-,Aerial thrombosis,Venous thrombosis,Aplastic anemia,Hemolytic anemia,"PNH is paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.Its a disease results from acquired mutation in PIGA an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of ceain membrane associated complement regulatory proteins. Thrombosis is the leading cause of disease related death in PNH.About 40% patient suffer from venous thrombosis of hepatic, poal or cerebral veins. In PNH GPI linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutation that inactivate PIGA.In RBC proteins are attached to cell membrane through a linkage to a specialised phospholipid called GPI.It is hypothesised that bone marrow cells with PIGA mutation increase in numbers only in rare instances where they have selective advantages such as in setting autoimmune reaction against GPI linked antigens. This explains the frequent association of PNH with aplastic anaemia. Red cell deficient in these GPI linked factors are abnormally susceptible to lysis or injury by complement.

"An anemic patient has the following red cell indexes: mean corpuscular volume, 70 mm3 ; mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 22 pg; and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, 34%. These values are most consistent with a diagnosis of",Folic acid-deficiency anemia,Iron-deficiency anemia,Pernicious anemia,Thalassemia minor,"The differential diagnosis of microcytosis includes b thalassemia (due to a defect in globin chain synthesis) and iron-deficiency anemia. It is impoant to distinguish between these two disorders because therapy with iron benefits patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but harms patients with thalassemia because these patients are at risk for iron overload. Both thalassemia minor and iron-deficiency anemia are microcytic disorders in which the mean corpuscular hemoglobin is usually found to be reduced. Red blood cell indexes may be useful in differentiating the two disorders because, while the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is often normal or only slightly reduced in association with thalassemia minor, the MCHC is often definitely reduced in association with iron-deficiency anemia. (Both pernicious and folate-deficiency anemias lead to megaloblastic changes in erythrocytes.) The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of variation in the size of the red cells (anisocytosis). The RDW is increased in patients with iron-deficiency anemia, but is normal in patients with b thalassemia. Also unique to the microcytic anemias is the fact that patients with b thalassemia have increased red blood cell counts, while patients with all of the other microcytic anemias have decreased red blood cell counts. This increased red cell count in b thalassemia may be due to the increased hemoglobin F, which shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. This in turn causes an increased release of erythropoietin. Unlike iron-deficiency anemia, b thalassemia begins as a microcytic anemia. In contrast, irondeficiency anemia progresses through several stages. First there is decreased storage iron, which is followed by decreased circulating iron. At this time patients are still not clinically anemic. Next patients develop a normocytic normochromic anemia that transforms into a microcytic normochromic anemia and finally a microcytic hypochromic anemia.

N K cells activity is enhanced by ?,IL-1,TNF,1L-2,TGP-I3,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., IL-2 IL-2 acts as a growth factor for N K cells. Null cells (Large granular lymphocytes) Null cells are called so because they lack features of surface markers of both B and T lymphocytes. The account for 5 to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes. They are also called ""large granular lymphocytes (LGL)""as they contain large azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. They express Surface receptors for the Fc poion of IgG (CD-16) NCAM-I (CD56) They proliferate in response to IL-2 Many LGL express some lineage marker paicularly CD-8, CD-2. LGLs arise in both bone marrow and thymic microenvironment. Members of this group are : 1. Antibody dependent cytotoxic cells (ADCC) ADCC possess surface receptors for the Fc pa of Ig. Capable of lysing or killing target cells sensitized with IgG. 2. Natural killer cells (NK Cells) Possess spontaneous cytotoxicity towards various target cells : - Virus infected cells Malignant cells Transplanted foreign cells Cytotoxicity is not antibody dependent or MHC restricted Activity is nonimmune as it does not require sensitization by prior antigenic contact. They have CD-56 and CD-16 on their surface IL-2 acts as a growth factor Natural killer cell activity is augmented by interferon. They release perforin which causes transmembrane pores through which TNF-f3 enters the cell and induce apoptosis. NK cells are activated to LAK cells in the presence of IL-2 Usually CD-3 negative but subset of NK cells are CD-3 positive called NK/T cells. NK cells secrete TNF-a, GMCSF, perforin, IL-4. NK cells do not kill normal cells. Why is it so? lets see : ? The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur. 3. Lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells These are NK - cells treated with IL-2 Kill tumor cells more efficiently than unstimulated NK cents.",C

Which of the following is used for medical adrenalectomy: September 2009,Metyrapone,Ketoconazole,Aminoglutethimide,All of the above,"Ans. D: All of the above Medical care for Cushing syndrome can be summarized as follows: Agents that inhibit steroidogenesis, such as mitotane, ketoconazole, metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, trilostane, and etomidate, have been used to cause medical adrenalectomy. These medications are used rarely and often are toxic at the doses required to reduce coisol secretion. Efficacy of these medical interventions can be assessed with serial measurements of 24-hour urinary free coisol. - Patients receiving these medications may require glucocoicoid replacement to avoid adrenal insufficiency. - Metyrapone and trilostane are agents that competitively inhibit a single steroidogenic enzyme. Ketoconazole and aminoglutethimide act at several sites. Because ACTH production may persist or increase in patients with Cushing disease, radiation therapy of the pituitary is often required after unsuccessful initial therapy, either surgical or medical. These agents have higher efficacy when used in combination because they may act synergistically. Ketoconazole is probably the most popular and effective of these agents for long-term use and usually is the agent of choice",D

Reevaluation of the periodic acid-Schiff stain in acute leukemia with immunophenotypic analyses. Snower DP1, Smith BR, Munz UJ, McPhedran P. Author information Abstract To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain in the diagnosis of acute leukemia in light of the finer characterization of this disorder now available through immunophenotyping, we examined the blasts from 51 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia by morphological, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic analyses. The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively.",B

Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line. Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells). Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (cDNA) for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively conves thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. pharmacokinetics: Distribution: approximates plasma volume Metabolism: Primarily hepatic Half-life elimination: Biphasic: Initial: 20-24 minutes; Terminal: 90-130 minutes Excretion: Clearance: Plasma: 99-119 mL/minute Ref Robbins 9/e pg 234",B

An enzyme that recognizes a specific (palindromic) sequence and cuts within a DNA molecule is?,Exonuclease,Methylase,Modification enzyme,Restriction endonuclease,"ANSWER: (D) Restriction endonucleaseREF: Basic Genetics: Textbook and Activities by Ahmed Abouelmagd, Hussein M. Ageely page 117A palindromic sequence is a nucleic acid sequence {DNA or RNA) that is the same whether read 5' (five-prime) to 3' (three prime) on one strand or 5' to 3' on the complementary strand with which it forms a double helix.A restriction enzyme (or restriction endonuclease) is an enzyme that cuts DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences (with Type II restriction enzymes cutting double-stranded DNA) known as restriction sites. Such enzymes, found in bacteria and archaea, are thought to have evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up foreign DNA in a process called restriction; host DNA is methylated by a modification enzyme (a methylase) to protect it from the restriction enzyme's activity. Collectively, these two processes form the restriction modification systemRestriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. While recognition sequences vary betwreen 4 and 8 nucleotides, many of them are palindromic, wrhich correspond to nitrogenous base sequences that read the same backwards and forwards. In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA.The mirror-like palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backwards on a single strand of DNA strand, as in GTAATG.The inverted repeat palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backwards, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being complementary to CATATG). Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into four groups (Types I, II III, and IV) based on their composition and enzyme cofactor requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequenceCategoryFunctionCofactors requiredCleavageType IMultifunctional protein with both restriction and DNA modify-cation (methylase) activityMg2+, ATP SAM (S- adenosylmethionine)Cleave DNA at non specific sites usually remote from recognition siteType IISingle function (restriction) en-zymes independent of methylaseOnly Mg2+Site specific 8t cleave writhin or at short specific distances from recognition siteType IIICombine restriction and DNA modification (methylase) activity in a single enzyme complex with different subunitsMg2+, SAM stimulates reaction but is not requiredCleave at sites a short distance from recognition siteHere are some restriction enzymes and the palindromic sequences which they recognizeEnzymeSourceRecognition SequenceCutEcoRlEscherichia coli5'GAATTC3'CTTAAG5---G AATTC---3'3---CTTAAG---5'BamH1Bacillus amylobquefaciens5'GGATCC3'CCTAGG5'---G GATCC---3'3'---CCTAG G---5'Taq1Thermus aquaticus5'TCGA3'AGCT5'---T CGA--3'3'---AGC T---5'Alul*Arthrobacter luteus5'AGCT3'TCGA5'---AG CT---3'3'---TC GA---5'* = blunt ends",D

Which hormone is mainly responsible for prostatic hypertrophy?,Testosterone,FSH,LH,DHT,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., DHT ""DHT is one of the most important androgen responsible for the development and activity of the male sex organs and characteristics, and prostate growth."" -Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia p. 90Hormones in BPH* Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite of testosterone, is the most important mediator of prostatic growth.DHT is synthesized in the prostate from circulating testosterone by the action of the enzyme 5a-reductase, type 2. DHT can act in an autocrine fashion on the stromal cells or in paracrine fashion by diffusing into nearby epithelial cells. In both of these cell types, DHT binds to nuclear androgen receptors and signals the transcription of growth factors.* DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone because it dissociates from the androgen receptor more slowly.* Testosterone promotes prostate cell proliferation but relatively low levels of serum testosterone are found in patients with BPH.* Estrogen may also contribute to BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. Aging in men is associated with an increase in the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which converts testosterone into estrogen",D

"A three year old child is brought to the emergency depament having just ingested a large overdose of an antihistaminic drug. This drug is a weak base capable of entering most tissues including the brain. On physical examination the hea rate is 100/ minute, blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and the respiratory rate is 20/ minute. In this case of poisoning:","Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent","Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO 3, an alkalinizing agent",More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH,Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine.,"This question can be solved by the knowledge that basic drugs are ionized in the acidic medium and vice-a-versa. This antihistaminic drug is a weak base and will be highly ionized in the acidic urine. As ionized drugs cannot be reabsorbed in the nephron, urinary acidifying agents like NH4Cl will accelerate the excretion of this agent. On the other hand, NaHCO3 will decrease its excretion by increasing the unionized form. Blood pH is slightly alkaline (7.4) whereas gastric pH is highly acidic. Basic drugs are ionized more in the acidic pH, therefore option (c) is false.

True statement regarding Rifampicin is,Acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis,Dose adjustment is needed in renal failure,Gets concentrated intracellularly mainly in neutrophils,Increased metabolism of cyclosporine when given concomitantly,"Ans) d (Increased metabolism......) Ref KDT 6th ed p74l. KatzungRifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of mycobacteria and other microorganisms by forming a stable drug-enzyme complex, leading to suppression of initiation of chain formation (but not chain elongation) in RNA synthesis. More specifically, the b subunit of this complex enzyme is the site of action of the drug, although rifampin binds only to the holoenzyme. Nuclear RNA polymerases from a variety of eukaryotic cells do not bind rifampin, and RNA synthesis is correspondingly unaffected in eukaryotic cells. High concentrations of rifamycin antibiotics can inhibit RNA synthesis in mammalian mitochondria, viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases. Rifampin is bactericidal for both intracellular and extracellular microorganisms.A primary action of isoniazid is to inhibit the biosynthesis acids, branched lipids that are attached to a unique polysaccharide, arabino galactan, to form part of the mycobacterial cell wall.* Adjustment of dosageof rifampicin is not necessary in patients with impaired renal function.* It readily penetrates most tissues and into phagocytic cells. So they get concentrated mainly in lymphocytes and macrophages and not in neutrophils It can kill organisms that are poorly accessible to many other drugs, such as intracellular organisms and those that are sequestrated in abscesses and lung cavities.* Rifampicin, anticonvulsants including phenobarbitone, glucocorticoids induce CYP3 A soenzymes. Cyclosporine is metabolised in liver by CYP3A4 and excreted in bile. As rifampicin is an inducer of CYP3 A4, it lowers the blood levels of cyclosporine when given concomitantly",D

Kaposi sarcoma arise from,Muscles,Connective tissue,Vascular tissue,None of the above,"Explanation:
Ans. is ‘b’ i.e.,
Kaposi sarcoma is an intermediate grade, multicentric vascular, tumour
The pathogenesis of Kaposi sarcoma is complex, fundamentally it is an angio proliferative disease that is not a true neoplastic sarcoma.
It is a manifestation of excessive proliferation of spindle cells that are believed to be of vascular origin and have features in common with endothelial and smooth muscle cells.
Grossly → There stages of the disease can be identified
Patch (Ist stage)
Plaque (intermediate stage)
Nodule (last stage)
Histologically - The changes are nonspecific in the early patch stage and more characteristic in the nodular stage which show.
Sheets of plump proliferating spindle cells and endothelial in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue More on Kaposi Sarcoma C/f of Kaposi Sarcoma.
Kaposi sarcoma lesions most commonly appear as raised macules, however, they can also be papular or nodular.
Lesions often appear in the sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose. Confident lesions may give rise to surrounding lymphedema and may be disfiguring when they involve the face and disabling when they involve the lower extremities.
Apart from skin, Kaposi sarcoma can involve almost any other organ such as lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract and lung.
In contrast to most malignancies in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement is seen very early in Kaposi sarcoma and is of no special clinical significance.
Management of Kaposi Sarcoma.
Definitive treatment guidelines do not exist for the management of Kaposi sarcoma.
In the majority of cases, effective antiretroviral therapy achieves control. Spontaneous regression has been noted in several cases. Fewer than 10% of AIDS patient with KS die as a consequence of their malignancy. Thus whenever possible one should avoid t/t.
Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances
I. Single lesion or a limited number of lesions are causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problems e.g.
prominent facial lesions, lesions overlying joint or lesions in the oropharynx that cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing, t/t in these cases are Localized radiation Intralesional vinblastine Cryotherapy
II. Patients with large no lesions or in patients with visceral involvement - t/t in these cases
Interferon S is the first choice for single agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease other drugs which can be used in these cases are Liposomal daunorubicin Liposomal doxorubicin Paclitaxel
Liposomal daunorubicin has been approved as first-line therapy for a patient with advanced KS. Various forms of Kaposi Sarcoma.
There are at least four distinct epidemiological forms of Kaposi sarcoma.
I. Classic form is seen in older men of Mediterranean or Eastern European origin.
No recognized contributing factors (not associated with AIDS)
II. Equatorial African form that occurs in all ages
Without any recognized precipitating factor
II. Kaposi sarcoma associated with organ transplantation and its attendant iatrogenic immuno suppressed state

Pink’s disease is due to toxicity of:,Silver,Mercury,Lead,Tetracycline,"ACRODYNIA (Pink disease, Swift's disease)

Cause of the disease has been established as a mercurial toxicity reaction, either actual mercury poisoning or more likely, an idiosyncrasy to the metal.
The source of the mercury is usually a teething powder, ammoniated mercury ointment, calomel lotion, or bichloride of mercury disinfectant.
Occurs most frequently in young infants before the age of two years, although children are occasionally affected upto the age of five or six years.
The skin, particularly of the hands, feet, nose, ears and cheeks becomes red or pink and has a cold ""clammy feeling"".
The appearance has been described as resembling raw beef.

A 49-year-old male presents with symptoms that developed following a long weekend of binge drinking. His serum reveals a g-glutamyl transferase (GGT) level of 65 IU/L. A liver biopsy reveals fatty change (steatosis) of numerous hepatocytes. This patient's liver abnormality is most likely the result of,Decreased free fatty acid delivery to the liver,Decreased production of triglycerides,Increased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids,Increased NADH production,"Alcohol can produce hepatic steatosis several mechanisms, such as increased fatty acid synthesis, decreased triglyceride utilization, decreased atty acid oxidation, decreased lipoprotein excretion, and increased lipolysis. Ethanol is taken up by the liver and is conveed into acetaldehyde by either alcohol dehydrogenase (the major pathway), microsomal P-450 oxidase, or peroxisomal catalase. These pathways also conve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to NADH. This excess production of NADH changes the normal hepatic metabolism away from catabolism of fats and toward anabolism of fats (lipid synthesis), resulting in decreased mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids and increased hepatic production of triglyceride. Ethanol also increases lipolysis and inhibits the release of lipoproteins. Increased lipolysis increases the amount of free fatty acids that reach the liver.

Alpha thalassemia is due to ?,Alpha chain deficiency,Alpha chain excess,Beta chain deficienc,Beta chain excess,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Alpha chain deficiency Alpha-thalassemia People who do not produce enough alpha globin chain have alpha - thalassemia. Alpha globin chain is made by four genes, each gene contributes to 25% of the a-globin chains. The severity of a-thalassemia varies greatly depending on the number of a-globin genes affected - i) Silent carrier state Single a-globin gene is deleted. These individuals are completely asymptomatic. ii) a-thalassemia trait Two a-globin genes are deleted. These individuals are asymptomatic with some red cell abnormalities like b-thalassemia minor. iii) HbH disease Three genes of a-globin chain are deleted. With only one gene, the synthesis of a-chain is markedly reduced and tetramers of excess b-globin, called HbH, form. HbH has extremely high affinity for oxygen and therefore is not useful for oxygen exchange, leading to tissue hypoxia dispropoionate to the level of hemoglobin. Patients have moderate to severe anemia that may require occasional blood transfusion. iv) Hydrops fetalis There is deletion of all four a-globin genes. In the fetus, excess y-globin chains form tetramers, known as hemoglobin has. Hemolgobin ba has such a high affinity for oxygen that it delivers almost no oxygen to tissues. Most individuals die before or sholy after bih. In utero blood transfusion have allowed the bih of children with hydrops fetalis who then require life long blood transfusions.",A

Long acting insulin:,Lispro,Aspart,Glargine,Zn suspension of insulin,"Ans. C. GlargineRef: Essentials of Medical Pharmacology by KD Tripathi 7thled, p263ExplanationLente insulin is a combination of 30% semilente (amorphous) and 70% ultralente (crystalline) insulin zinc suspension.# One of the problems with regular insulin is it peaks 2 to 3 hours after administration and sustains over 6 to 8 hours, which does not mimic the physiological insulin response. This leads to postprandial hyperglycemia and intermittent hypoglycemia. To overcome this, long-acting 'modified' or 'retard' preparations of insulin were developed.# Retard preparations, are obtained by making insulin insoluble either by:# Complexing it with protamine (isophane) or# By precipitating it with excess zinc and increasing the particle size (ultralente, semilente, lente).Insulin-zinc suspensionIsophane (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn or NPH) insulinTwo types of insulin-zinc suspensions have been produced* Protamine is added in a quantity just sufficient to complex all insulin molecules* Neither of the two is present in free form* On S.C. injection, the complex dissociates slowly to yield an intermediate duration of action* Mostly used in combination with regular insulin (70:30 or 50:50)1.

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease features include:,Can be diagnosed intrauterine,Proceeds to renal failure till children reaches school going age,Can be palpated abdominally,Hypertension doesn't develop until late stages of the disease,"Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

Glioblastoma is type of infiltrating astrocytoma (Classified as Grade 4).
Necrosis in glioblastoma often results in a SERPENTINE pattern in areas of hyper-cellularity.
Tumor cells collect along the edges of the necrotic regions, producing histologic pattern referred to as pseudopalisading pattern.

GLIOMAS
Gliomas are tumors of the brain parenchyma that histologically resemble different types of glial cells. The major types of tumor in this category are:
a. Astrocytomas
b. Oligodendrogliomas
c. Ependymomas.

ASTROCYTOMAS

Two major categories of astrocytoma, infiltrating and non-infiltrating types.
Infiltrating astrocytomas account for about 80% of adult primary brain tumors.
They are most frequent in the fourth through sixth decades.
They are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres.
The most common presenting signs and symptoms are seizures, headaches and focal neurologic deficits related to the anatomic site of involvement.
Infiltrating astrocytomas show a spectrum of histologic differentiation that correlates well with clinical course and outcome.

Based on the degree of differentiation, they are classified into four groups:

Pilocytic astrocytoma - Grade I - Most common
Astrocytoma - Grade 2
Anaplastic astrocytoma - Grade 3
Glioblastoma multiforme - Grade 4 - Least differentiated

PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA

Pilocytic astrocytomas are relatively benign tumors, often cystic, that typically occur in children and young adults.
They are usually located in the cerebellum; also in the floor and walls of the third ventricle, the optic nerves, and occasionally the cerebral hemispheres.
A pilocytic astrocytoma is often cystic, with a mural nodule in the wall of the cyst; if solid, it is usually well circumscribed.
The tumor is composed of areas with bipolar cells with long, thin “'hairlike” processes that are GFAP positive: Rosenthal fibers, eosinophilic granular bodies, and microcysts are often present.
Necrosis and mitoses are absent.

OLIGODENDROGLIOMAS

These tumors constitute about 5% to 15% of gliomas and are most common in the fourth and fifth decades.
Patients may have had several years of neurologic complaints, often including seizures. The lesions are found mostly in the cerebral hemispheres, with a predilection for white matter.
Oligodendrogliomas are infiltrative tumors that form gelatinous, gray masses, and may show cysts, focal hemorrhage and calcification.
On microscopic examination, the tumor is composed of sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei containing finely granular chromatin (similar to normal oligodendrocytes) surrounded by a clear halo of cytoplasm.
The tumor typically contains a delicate network of anastomosing capillaries. Calcification, present in as many as 90% of these tumors, ranges from microscopic foci to massive depositions.
With increasing cell density, nuclear anaplasia, increased mitotic activity and necrosis, the tumor becomes higher grade (anaplastic oligodendroglioma.)
Patients with oligodendrogliomas have a better prognosis than do patients with astrocytomas.
Current treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy yields an average survival of 5 to 10 years.
Patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma have a worse prognosis.

EPENDYMOMAS

Ependymomas most often arise next to the ependyma-lined ventricular system, including the central canal of the spinal cord.
In the first two decades of life, they typically occur near the fourth ventricle and constitute 5% to 10% of the primary brain tumors in this age group.
In adults, the spinal cord is their most common location; tumors in this site are particularly frequent in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 2.
Because ependymomas usually grow within the ventricles. CSF dissemination is a common occurrence.
In the fourth ventricle, ependymomas are typically solid or papillary masses extending from the floor of the ventricle.
These tumors are composed of cells with regular, round to oval nuclei with abundant granular chromatin.
Between the nuclei there is a variably dense fibrillary background.
Tumor cells may form round or elongated structures (rosettes, canals) that resemble the embryologic ependymal canal, with long, delicate processes extending into a lumen. More frequently present are perivascular pseudo-rosettes in which tumor cells are arranged around vessels with an intervening zone consisting of thin ependymal processes directed toward the wall of the vessel.
Anaplastic ependymomas show increased cell density, high mitotic rates, necrosis and less evident ependymal differentiation.
The clinical outcome for completely resected supratentorial and spinal ependymomas is better than for those in the posterior fossa.",A

Regarding COX-2 which of the following is its function aEUR',Cell adhesion,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCell proliferation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n,Cell migration,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCell differentiation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n,"Cell proliferation ? ? ? The enzymes that conve arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 are named cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (original name was prostaglandin H synthase). The propeies of COX-1 are different from those of COX-2. It was originally thought that the. function of COX-1 was involved in physiological phenomena where as that of COX-2 was involved in various pathologies. COX-1 is considered as the constitutive enzyme or the housekeeping enzyme that is naturally expressed on all cell surfaces. COX-2 is known as inducible enzyme which is not naturally expressed on the cells but is expressed on stimulation of cells. Functions of COX-1 and COX-2 Inflammation During inflammation, COX-1 mRNA, protein and activity levels do not change, but COX-2 levels increase dramatically, and as a result prostaglandin production increases. - Moreover, when COX-2 specific inhibitors are administered, prostaglandin production and subsequent inflammation are significantly reduced. - These data have lead to the conclusion that COX-2 is involved in inflammation whereas COX-1 is not. - During the inflammation process, COX-I is though to contribute to resolution. The COX-2 gene is paicularly responsive to mediators of inflammation. - For example, IL-la, IL-I b, TNF-a and LPS induce COX-2 gene expression and subsequent prostaglandin production. Therefore COX-2 inhibitors have been used to attenuate the symptoms of inflammation such as osteoahritis, rheumatoid ahritis and musculoskeletal pains. Cardiovascular system It is well known that the platelet has COX-1 protein alone (no COX-2). The thromboxane A2 produced COX-1 has an impoant role in thrombosis. - It has been thought that vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells have COX-1 and that prostacyclin formed COX-1 has an impoant role in blood flow, blood pressure and antiaggregation of platelets. However, a recent work has shown that prostacyclin in vascular cells is produced by COX-2 as well as COX-1 under both physiological and pathological conditions. - These results raised the possibility of an increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with COX-2 specific inhibitors. However, trials have not confirmed these results. Tumorigenesis COX-2 causes tumorigenesis and tumour growth. - Overexpression of COX-2 in tumor cells causes cells to escape from apoptosis and to invade the matrix. - The contribution of COX-2 to tumorigenesis is mainly through three processes. a) Induction of angiogenic,factors such as VEGF b) Antiapoptosis and c) Development of malignancy In vivo, tumour associated macrophages as well as tumor cells produce ""PGE2 COX-2"" and the PGE2 produced, induces VEGF and finally VEGF stimulates angiogenesis. Renal function COX-1 is primarily expressed in podocytes and collecting duct cells and is involved in glomerulogenesis. COX-2 is detected in renal vasculature, medullary interstitial cells and the macula densa. COX-2 is involved in renal perfusion and glomerular hemodynamics. Cyclooxygenase function can also be assessed by disrupting COX-1 and COX-2 genes in mice COX-2 deficient mice demonstrates following :- Defect in female reproductive functions including ovulation, feilization and implantation and decidualization Reduction in brain injury induced by ischemia Suppression of tumorigenesis Renal nephropathy Cardiac.fibrosis Peritonitis Failure of ductus aeriosus closure Even after this extensive discussion, 1 am not sure about the answer. Since COX-2 has a role in the development of twnorigenesis, cell proliferation seems to be the appropriate answer. COX-2 causes tumorigenesis by induction of VEGF. VEGF is vascular endothelial growth factor and it causes endothelial proliferation. We are not sure of the answer. Go through the .following sites on internet. http//www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pubmed/18039779; http/Avvvw.ncbi.nlin.nih.gov/pubmed/12045254; Jun invest 2002 June 109 (11/1405=15); www.ncbi.nlm. gov/pubmed/16219005; http//www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pubmed/12444028 COX-2 seems to regulate all the ,functions mentioned in the question. We have looked into numerous texts and internet sites for this one. But we cannot come up with some conclusive material on this one. There are ceain texts which say that COX-2 is implicated in tumors genesis through all the following mechanisms Cellular proliferation Antiapoptosis Cellular differentiation Cellular migration Cellular adhesion If the question is repeated again with the same options we would go for cellular proliferation.",B

In wegners glomerulonephritis characteristic feature seen is aEUR',Granulomas in the vessel wall,Focal Necrotizing Glomerulonepluitis,Nodular Glomerulo Sclerosis,Interstitial Granuloma,"Focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis Wegener's granulomatosis is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular. An impoant point to note, Though it is called granulomatous vasculitis:? - Granulomas in Wegener's .granulomatosis are seen only in lungs or respiratory tract. Granulottm formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Robbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as ""necrotizing vasculitis"" (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of :? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e.g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's. glomerulonephritis is characterized by ""focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis"".

It is therefore difficult to define the stage beyond which the cell is doomed for destruction.However, two phenomenon consistently characterize irreversibilityFirst is the inability to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction.The second is the development of profound disturbances in membrane function.Membrane damage leads to massive leak of intracellular enzymes and massive influx of calcium.Injury to lysosomal membranes results in leakage of hydrolysis in the cytoplasm, which degrade cytoplasmic and nuclear components.Massive influx of calcium and release of calcium from intracellular stores result in activation of enzymes that can catabolize membranes, proteins, ATP and nucleic acid and cause irreversible damage to the cells.",B

Principle mediator of vasodilation in acute inflammation is,Serotonin,IL-1,Histamine,TNF,"Vasodilation is induced by chemical mediators such as histamine and is the cause of erythema and stasis of blood flow in acute inflammation.Histamine causes dilation of aerioles and increases the permeability of venules. Histamine is considered to be the principal mediator of the immediate transient phase of increased vascular permeability, producing interendothelial gaps in venules. Its vasoactive effects are mediated mainly binding to receptors, called H1 receptors, on microvascular endothelial cells. The antihistamine drugs that are commonly used to treat some inflammatory reactions, such as allergies, are H1 receptor antagonists that bind to and block the receptor.Ref: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease; 9th edition; Chapter 3; Acute inflammation; Page no: 75",C

Which one of the following statements about Hemoglobin S (HbS) is not true -,Hemoglobin HbS differs from hemoglobin HbA by the substitution of Val for Glu in position 6 of the beta chain,One altered peptide of HbS migrates faster towards the cathode (-) than the corresponding peptide of HbA,Binding of HbS to the deoxygenated HbA can extend the polymer and cause sickling of the red blood cells,Lowering the concentration of deoxygenated HbS can prevent sickling,"Sickle cell anemia is caused by replacement of normal Hemoglobin by sickled hemoglobin (HbS).
HbS is formed by replacement of Glutamine by Valine at position 6
This substitution replaces the polar Glutamine residue with a nonpolar Valine.
The replacement of Glutamine by Valine generates a sticky patch on the surface of HBS.
The sticky patch is present on both oxygenated and deoxygenated HbS
The deoxygenated HbS also contains a complementary site for the sticky patch.
In oxygenated hemoglobin this complementary site is masked.
When HbS is deoxygenated the sticky patch present on its surface binds to the complementary patch on another deoxygenated HbS molecules.
This binding leads to polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S forming long fibrous precipitates.
These extend throughout the erythrocyte and mechanically distort it, causing lysis and multiple secondary clinical effect.

So, if HbS can be maintained in an oxygenated state or if the concentration of deoxygenated HbS can be minimized, formation of these polymers will not occur and sickling can be prevented (Remember the complementary site for the sticky patch remains masked in case of Oxygenated HbS).
Role of HbA in polymerization —

Unlike HbS, A does not contain any sticky patch, but it does have a binding site for the sticky patch of 1,,S.
Thus it can bind to HbS through its receptor site but this binding cannot extend the polymer because HbA does not contain any sticky patch to promote binding to still another hemoglobin molecule.
So HbA interferes with the polymerization and aggregation of  HbS and reduces the intensity of sickle cell anemia.",C

"Acetazolamide is administered to a glaucoma patient. Given that this drug inhibits carbonic anhydrase in the renal proximal tubule, which of the following substances will be excreted at a lower rate?",Na+,H2O,HCO3-,NH4,"The primary effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide is to inhibit both H+ secretion and NaHCO3 reabsorption, making the urine alkaline. NH4+ excretion is reduced as a result of the diminished H+ secretion. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors restrict H+ secretion by inhibiting the intracellular hydration of CO2, a primary source of intracellular H+. The decline in H+ secretion inhibits the Na+-H+ exchange at the luminal membrane of the proximal tubule, which is the primary site of NaHCO3 diuresis. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also block the dehydration of H2CO3 formed in the tubular lumen. Chronic doses of such drugs can lead to hyperchloremic acidosis (metabolic acidosis). Ref: McNamara J.O.

Commonest thyroid tumor in MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasia),Follicular,Papillary,Anaplastic,Medullary,"Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma Medullary carcinoma is a less frequent type derived from parafollicular or C-cells present in the thyroid and comprises about 5% of thyroid carcinomas. It is equally common in men and women. There are 3 distinctive features which distinguish medullary carcinoma from the other thyroid carcinomas. They are : its familial occurrence, secretion of calcitonin and other peptides, and amyloid stroma. 1. Familial occurrence. Most cases of medullary carcinoma occur sporadically, but about 10% have a genetic background with point mutation in RET-protooncogene located on chromosome 10q. The familial form of medullary carcinoma in association with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma (multiple endocrine neoplasias, MEN II A), or with pheochromocytoma and multiple mucosal neuromas (MEN II B). 2. Secretion of calcitonin and other peptides. Like normal C-cells, tumour cells of medullary carcinoma secrete calcitonin, the hypocalcaemic hormone. In addition, the tumour may also elaborate prostaglandins, histaminase, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and ACTH. These hormone elaborations are responsible for a number of clinical syndromes such as carcinoid syndrome, Cushing's syndrome and diarrhoea. 3. Amyloid stroma. Most medullary carcinomas have amyloid deposits in the stroma which stains positively with usual amyloid stains such as Congo red. The amyloid deposits are believed to represent stored calcitonin derived from neoplastic C-cells in the form of prohormone. Most cases of medullary carcinoma present as solitary thyroid nodule but sometimes an enlarged cervical lymph node may be the first manifestation. Most medullary carcinomas are slow-growing. Regional lymph node metastases may occur but distant organ metastases are infrequent. The prognosis is better in familial form than in the sporadic form: overall 10-year survival rate is 60-70%.

The underlying pathogenesis of this patient's disease is",A degenerative disease involving the cerebellum,A defect in the synthesis of apolipoprotein B,"Degeneration of the posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts, and coicospinal tracts",An absence of high-density lipoproteins,"The patient has abetalipoproteinemia, which is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by an absence of apolipoprotein B. Apolipoprotein B is an integral component of chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Without the apoprotein, triglyceride and cholesterol cannot be packaged into chylomicrons and VLDL. The disease has its onset in childhood. Malabsorption occurs because dietary fat cannot be packaged into chylomicrons, and intestinal cells fill with lipid. This blocks the reabsorption of fat and other nutrients. Loss of essential fatty acids results in membrane abnormalities in red blood cells with production of acanthocytes (thorny-appearing cells). Neurologic findings, including ataxia, nystagmus, and sensory abnormalities, also occur..",B

Which among the following is a mechanism of action of colchicine?,Suppression of immunity,Increase in uric acid excretion,Decrease in uric acid synthesis,None of the above,"Colchicine is known to suppress many immune functions in the setting of crystal induced ahritis by 1. decreasing neutrophil chemotaxis 2. decreasing neutrophil adhesion 3. decreasing release of multiple inflammatory mediators 4. decreasing phagocytosis of urate crystals by neutrophils. Mechanism: Colchicine binds to tubulin and causing its depolymerization. This disrupts the mobility of granulocytes thereby decreasing its migration to the affected area. It also blocks cell division by binding to mitotic spindles. Uses: Colchicine is used in the treatment of acute gouty attacks as well as chronic gout. It is neither uricosuric nor an analgesic agent but it relieves pain in acute attacks of gout. It does not prevent progression of gout to acute gouty ahritis, but it has a suppressive, prophylactic effect that reduces the frequency of acute attacks and relieves pain.

The cause of oedema in Nephritic syndrome is-,Decreased in plasma protein concentration,Increased in plasma protein concentration,Reduced plasma osmotic pressure,Sodium and water retention,"there is a derangement in the capillary walls of the glomeruli that result in increased permeability to plasma proteins. Any increased permeability resulting from either structural or physicochemical alterations in the GBM allows proteins to escape from the plasma into the glomerular filtrate.With long-standing or extremely heavy proteinuria, serum albumin is decreased, resulting in hypoalbuminemia and adrop in plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Which results in a decrease of intravascular volume and renal blood flow triggers increased release of renin from renal juxtaglomerular cells. Renin, in turn, stimulates the angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which promotes the retention of salt and water by the kidney. This tendency is exacerbated by reductions in the cardiac secretion of natriuretic factors. In the face of continuing proteinuria, thesealterations fuher aggravate the edema.

Rigidity of facial muscles 'Risus sardonicus' is associated with:,Tetany,Tetanus,Leprosy,Actinomycosis,"Generalized tetanus is characterized by lock-jaw or trismus due to spasm of masseter, which is the initial symptom and a dental surgeon is the first person often to be consulted. Dysphagia, stiffness or pain in the neck, shoulder or back muscles appear concurrently. Marked rigidity interferes with the movement of chest and impairs cough and swallowing reflexes. Laryngeal spasms may lead to asphyxia. The involvement of various muscles produces rigid abdomen and stiff proximal limb muscles. Hands and feet are relatively spared and sustained contraction of facial muscles results in a grimace or sneer called risus sardonicus. The contraction of muscles of the back produces an arched back called opisthotonus. The spasms occur repetitively or spontaneously or provoked by slight stimulation.
Treatment
Antitoxin is injected to neutralize circulating toxin and unbound toxin. Human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000–6000 units IM individual doses. Though the optimum dose is not known, a 500 unit dose is as effective as higher doses.

Coomb's positive hemolysis is seen in -,TTP,SLE,ITP,PNH,"Ans. is b' i.e., SLE AUTOIMMUNEHEMOLYTICANEMIA(LVIMUNOIHEMOLYTICANEMIA) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by autoantibodies directed against a red cell antigen. The diagnosis of immunohemolytic anemia requires the detection of antibodies and/or complement on patients red cells. o This is done by using Coomb's test, therefore these anemia are also called coomb's positive hemolytic anemia. According to the temprature at which antibody reacts with RBC, autoimmune hemolytic anemia can be divide into:? Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia Cold agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. Warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia o This is the most common form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. o Antibody react with RBC at 37degC. o Most causative antibodies are of the IgG class, Some times IgA antibodies are culprit. o IgG antibodies attach to red blood cells, leaving there Fc poion sticking out. o These antibody coated RBCs pass through spleen. o The Fc poion of antibody - RBC complex is recognized by Fc receptor on monocyte-macrophages. This results in phagocytosis of RBCs in the spleen Extravascular hemolysis Impoant causes of warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia. o Autoimmune disorders SLE, RA, Ulcerative colitis, Scleroderma, Antiphospholipid antibodies. o Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) o Multiple myeloma o Hodgkin disease o Thymoma o Non-Hodgkin lymphoma o Drugs Methyldopa, penicillin, Cephalosporine, quinidine.",B

Loading dose of a drug depends upon,Volume of distribution,Clearance,Half life,bioavailability,"(a)Volume of distributionRef: Lippincott, 6th ed., pg. 21 and Katzung, 13th ed., pg. 50-51Sometimes rapid achievement of desired plasma concentrations of drugs is needed to produce the prompt response (e.g. in serious infections or arrhythmias). When the time to reach steady state is long, as it is for drugs with long half-lives and having high volume of distribution (Vd) due to their tissue affinities, it may be desirable to administer a large dose (loading dose) to achieve the desired plasma levels rapidly. The volume ot distribution is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma (Cp).LOADING DOSE= Vd X Desired steady state plasma concentrationLoading dose can be given as single dose or multiple doses over a short time. E.g. in case of treatment of AF by digoxin (longer acting drug with high Vd), loading dose is must to saturate the tissues and to achieve desired plasma concentration rapidly (otherwise it would take about a week for digoxin to achieve the steady state plasma concentration). Loading dose of Chloroquine is also required to treat the malaria.On the other hand, maintenance dose is dependent of the clearance (Cl) as we have to maintain the steady state concentration in view of the volume of the plasma cleared of drug per unit time. Hence, equation for maintenance dose isMAINTENANCE DOSE= Cl X Desired steady state plasma concentration",A

Spironolactone is least commonly used in which of the following: September 2011,Congestive hea failure,Cirrhotic edema,Hypeension,Primary hyperaldosteronism,"Ans. C: Hypeension As an add-on drug, spironolcatone may be useful in hypeensive patients with significant hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, or glucose intolerance Spironolactone It is a synthetic 17-lactone drug that is a renal competitive aldosterone antagonist in a class of potassium-sparing diuretics It used primarily to treat hea failure, ascites in patients with liver disease, low-renin hypeension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because its effects target the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where urine volume can only be slightly modified; but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. Due to its antiandrogen effect, it can also be used to treat hirsutism. It is also used for treating hair loss and acne in women, and can be used as a topical medication for treatment of male baldness. It is commonly used to treat symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) such as excess facial hair and acne. Spironolactone can cause gynecomastia in males and, unless regularly monitored, should not be given with potassium supplementation for fear of development of hyperkalemia. Spironolactone inhibits the effect of aldosterone by competing for intracellular aldosterone receptors in the coical collecting duct. This decreases the reabsorption of sodium and water, while decreasing the secretion of potassium. Spironolactone has a fairly slow onset of action, taking several days to develop, and, so, the effect diminishes slowly. Spironolactone has anti-androgen activity by directly binding to and blocking androgens from interacting with the androgen receptor, by blocking androgen production, and by increasing estrogen levels. Production of androgens is decreased by inhibiting 17alpha-hydroxylase and 17, 20-desmolase, which are enzymes in the testosterone biosynthesis pathway. Estrogen levels are increased by enhancing the peripheral conversion of testosterone to estradiol and by displacing estradiol from sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) Spironolactone is a synthetic steroid that acts as a competitive antagonist to aldosterone. Its onset and duration of action are determined by the kinetics of the aldosterone response in the target tissue. Substantial inactivation of spironolactone occurs in the liver and hepatitis or cirrhosis can lead to secondary aldosteronism, which is one indication for treatment. Spironolactone is associated with an increased risk of bleeding from the stomach and duodenum Because it also affects androgen receptors and other steroid receptors, it can cause gynecomastia, menstrual irregularities and testicular atrophy. Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, therefore, it is recommended that people using this drug avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of spironolactone bodies in the adrenal coex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.",C

Which of these is a Nephritic syndrome?,Minimal change disease,Membranous Glomerulopathy,Post infectious Glomerulonephritis,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,"The nephritic syndrome is characterized by hematuria, oliguria with azotemia, proteinuria, and hypeension. The most common causes are immunologically mediated glomerular injury; lesions are characterized by proliferative changes and leukocyte infiltration. Acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis typically occurs after streptococcal infection in children and young adults but may occur following infection with many other organisms; it is caused by deposition of immune complexes, mainly in the subepithelial spaces, with abundant neutrophils and proliferation of glomerular cells. Most affected children recover; the prognosis is worse in adults. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical entity with features of the nephritic syndrome and rapid loss of renal function. Nephrotic syndrome is caused by a derangement in glomerular capillary walls resulting in increased permeability to plasma proteins.

Let us discuss each findings -

H/o fever weakness and bleeding gum -

Most of the books agree that patients of acute leukemia present with nonspecific symptoms as fatigue, fever, weight loss. These are consequence of anemia or leucocytosis. Some patients may also present with signs of abnormal hemostatis such as bleeding gum.

Peripheral smear shows pancytopenia-

The no. of Leukemic cells in peripheral blood in AML is highly variable sometimes being more than 10000 cell/ ml but being under 10,000 in 50% of patients.


Occasionally the peripheral smear may not contain any blasts (aleukemic leukemia). So even in pts with ancytopenia bone marrow examination is essential to exclude acute leukemia.

Bone marrow examination reveals 26% blast/cells :-
Harrison says - ""The diagnosis of AML is' established by presence of more than 20% myeloblast in bone marrow.""
The blast cells were mature and contain Auer rods:


Auer rods are red staining rod like structures (representing abnormal azurophilic granules) present in myeloblast in AML. The presence of Auer rods is considered as definite evidence of myeloid differentiation. They are most numerous in M3 form of AML.

Neutrophil with Pseudo Pelger Huet anomaly :-

 Pseudo Pelger Huet cells are neutrophils with only 2 nuclear lobes and are frequently seen in myelodysplastic syndrome. Myelodysplatic syndrome progresses to AML in10% of cases so it can be assumed that in this patient AML has developed from myelodysplastic syndrome.",C

Because FXI has a half-life of 40-70 h, the replacement therapy can be given on alternate days. The use of antifibrinolytic drugs is beneficial to control bleeds, with the exception of hematuria or bleeds in the bladder.# Rx of Hemophilia A:- Factor replacement therapy for hemophilia can be provided either in response to a bleeding episode or as a prophylactic treatment.- Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains ~80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia; but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, it should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.# The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels,# Whereas the FIX half-life is longer, ~24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient.",D
A seasoned marathon runner drinks a cup of strong black coffee about an hour before his race to enhance his performance. By which of the following mechanisms does caffeine directly contribute to enhanced performance?,Allosteric activation of glycogen phosphorylase,Allosteric activation of hormone sensitive lipase,Inhibition of dephosphorylation of protein kinase A,Inhibition of phosphodiesterase,"Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase and thereby prevents cAMP from being degraded. Consequently, cAMP continues to activate protein kinase A, which results in both glycogen and triglyceride breakdown. Caffeine has no direct or indirect effect on adenyl cyclase. Caffeine does not directly interact with glycogen phosphorylase or hormone-sensitive lipase and cannot allosterically activate these enzymes. However, because cAMP is not degraded due to the action of caffeine on phosphodiesterase, the cAMP will continue to activate protein kinase A. In turn, activation of protein kinase A will lead to phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and hormone-sensitive lipase, resulting in glycogen and triglyceride breakdown. Ref: O'Brien C.P.

Classic example of missense mutation -,Thalassemia,Sickle cell disease,Sideroblastic anemia,Hemochromatosis,"Ans. is i.e., Sickle cell diseaseIn sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation.Mutationso A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA.o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease.o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations.o Mutations may be classified into three categories -1. Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations.o These may of different types depending w'hether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition.o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion.o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in [3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is [3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the readi ng frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation.o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three ffamshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome..Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",B

"A 29 year old medical student developed a positive PPD (purified protein derivative) test. She was staed on isoniazid (INH) and rifampin prophylaxis. Three months into her therapy, she began to experience muscle fasciculations and convulsions. Administration of which of the following vitamins might have prevented these symptoms?",Niacin,Pyridoxine,Riboflavin,Thiamine,"Pyridoxine, or vitamin B6, is sometimes depleted with isoniazid (INH) use. Patients with pyridoxine deficiency may experience neurologic symptoms, such as convulsions and fasciculations. The treatment of this disorder is slow IV administration of 2-5 g of pyridoxine. Niacin deficiency, also known as pellagra, is a disease that involves several organs, including the skin, the gastrointestinal system, and the nervous system. A useful mnemonic for remembering the symptoms of pellagra is the ""4 D's"": dermatitis, dementia, diarrhea, and death. These symptoms are not consistent with the patient history described in the question. Riboflavin deficiency is not typically seen alone, but rather in conjunction with other vitamin deficiencies. Dermatitis and glossitis are the most frequent clinical manifestations. Thiamine deficiency, or beri-beri, presents with dry skin and paralysis, rather than convulsions. Severe thiamine deficiency produces Wernicke's encephalopathy, with disorientation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. This deficiency is typically seen in alcoholic patients. Ref: Amato A.A., Barohn R.J.

Which virus is implicated in Burkitts lymphoma?,HTLV,HPV,EBV,HHV8,"Explanation: BURKITT LYMPHOMA There are three clinical types:
1. African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
2. Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
3. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV.
These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells,
the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages.
These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells.
It express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.
Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.
Molecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.
The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus  light-chain loci.
All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.
Clinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera,
particularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy",C

DEC (Di-ethyl-carbamazine) is used for the treatment of:,Filariasis,Dracunculiasis,Schistosomiasis,Taeniasis,"Diethyl carbamazine citrate (DEC): It is the first drug for filariasis. DEC is absorbed after oral ingestion, distributed all over the body (V = 3-5 L/kg), metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. Excretion is faster in acidic urine.Diethylcarbamazine has a highly selective effect on microfilariae (Mf). A dose of 2 mg/kg TDS clears Mf of W. bancrofti and B. malayi from peripheral blood in 7 days. However, Mf present in nodules and transudates (hydrocoele) are not killed. The most impoant action of DEC appears to be alteration of Mf membranes so that they are readily phagocytosed by tissue fixed monocytes, but not by circulating phagocytes. Muscular activity of the Mf and adult worms is also affected causing hyperpolarization due to the piperazine moiety, so that they are dislodged. Prolonged treatment may kill adult B. malayi and probably W. bancrofti worms also. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:812",A

Ultrastructural finding in case of paraganglionia ?,Deposition of glycogen,Enlarged mitochondria,Shrunken mitochondria,Dense core granules,"Dense core granules Paragangliomas The paragangliomas have been known historically by a variety of names including glomus tumours, chemodectonza, non chromaffin paraganglionza, glomercytomas, carotid body and tympanic body tumours and receptomas. Essentially these tumours make up a family of neoplasms that develop from the paraganglial tissues which are atually chemoreceptor organs that are distributed throughout the body. These chemoreceptor organs are of neural crest origin and have similar functions and similar histological appearance. Their cells of origin are a pa of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). Paragangliomas are composed of characteristic cell called 'C' cell. The chief cell is probably the principal component involved and seems to be the actual chemoreceptor of the paraganglia containing acetyl choline, catecholamine and serotonin. Chief cell is of neural crest origin and it contains hormone thus it is neuroendocrine in nature. It renders the paraganglia receptive to hypoxia and pH changes and to fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentration. These chief cells migrate with the autonomic ganglion cells. They are in close association with the sympathetic ganglia and Aoa in its main branches. Many head and neck paraganglia and their respective neoplasms are distributed in relation to the vessel and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches. Because of this they are also called branchiomeric paraganglioma. Pathology of paraganglioma : Like other neuroendocrine tumour the ultrastructure shows dense core granules (neurosecretory grangules) The tumour cells balls are arranged in distinctive cell balls called Zellaballen (the cell balls are composed of chief cells). These cells are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells. Immunohistochemistry of paraganglioma Chief cells are neuroendocrine cells and are thus positive for regular neuroendocrine markers e.g. Chromogranin Synaptophysin Neuron specific enolase Serotonin Neurofilament The chief cells are S-100 protein negative but the sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and are focally positive for glial fibrillary acid protein. On histochemistry they are argyrophilic. PAS negative, mucicarnzine negative and argentalfin negative. An impoant point in d/d is that they are never positive for cytokeratin like other neuroendocrine tumours.",D

The first step in the initiation of primary hemostasis for clot formation?,Fibrin deposition,Vasoconstriction,Platelet adhesion,Thrombosis,"Steps in hemostasis at the site of injury
i) Vasoconstriction • Immediate hemostasis following injury is achieved by brief arteriolar vasoconstriction.
It is due to the reflex neurogenic mechanism. This effect is transient. 
ii) Primary hemostasis • It is achieved by formation of the primary hemostatic plug (platelet plug).
Following an injury to endothelium, the thrombogenic subendothelial matrix is exposed and allows the platelets to adhere with collagen of ECM.
These platelets are activated and recruit other platelets by their secretions.
iii) Secondary hemostasis

Why fetal cells continue to divide but terminally differentiated adult cells do not divide,There are many cyclin inhibitors which prevent cell to enter into S phase in adult,Phosphatase absent in fetal cells,Proteinase is absent in fetus,Absence of CD kinase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. There are many cyclin inhibitors which prevent cell to enter into S phase in adult * After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells become arrested in a terminally non dividing state known as replicative senescence.How does normal cell count their divisions ??It is not entirely clear, how normal cells count their divisions but it has been noted that with each cell division there is some shortening of specialized structures called telomers at the ends of chromosomes.Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication of chromosomal ends and protecting chromosomal termini from fusion and degradation.When somatic cells replicate a small section of the telomere is not duplicated and telomeres become progressively shortened.As the telomers become shorter, the ends of chromosome cannot be protected and are seen as broken D.N.A., this signals cell cycle arrest.The loss of telomere function leads to activation of p 53 dependent cell cycle checkpoints causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis.Germ cells continue to divide because in these cells telomere shortening is prevented by sustained function of the enzyme Telomerase.Telomerase is an enzyme (specialized RNA-protein complex) that maintains the length of the Telomer by nucleotide addition.Telomerase activity is expressed in Germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells but it is usually absent in most somatic tissues.Therefore as cells age their telomers become shorter and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones.One more question which crops upIf loss of telomerase is the basis of the finite life span of cells, how do cancer cells continue to divide indefinitely ?In cancer cells telomerase is reactivated and thus the telomers are not shortened.",A
Which of the following statement is false about extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)?,"These can hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins as well as monobactams",Carbapenems are sensitive to ESBL,Amber classification of ESBL is based on structural differences,"Third and fouh generation cephalosporins are used for detection of ESBL,","Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are enzymes that confer resistance to most beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and the monobactam aztreonam. lmipenem(carbapenem): It is an extremely potent and broad-spectrum Beta-lactam antibiotic whose range of activity includes grampositive cocci, Enterobacteriaceae, Ps. aeruginosa, Listeria as well as anaerobes like Bact. fragilis and Cl. difficile. It is resistant to most Beta-lactamases; inhibits penicillinase producing staphylococci and some MRSA. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Members of the family commonly express plasmid encoded b-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, a new group of enzymes, the extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979).The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals.ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Thus ESBLs confer multi resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these b-lactamases. A broader set of b-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described.The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily eapenem resistant) isolates have recently been repoed. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.

i) Sudden death. Massive pulmonary embolism(60% or moreof pulmonary artery) results in instantaneous death, without occurrence of chest pain or
dyspnoea. However, if the death is somewhat delayed, the clinical features resemble myocardial infarction i.e. severe
chest pain, dyspnoea and shock.
ii) Acute cor pulmonale. Numerous small emboli may obstruct most of the pulmonary circulation resulting in acute
right heart failure. Another mechanism is by release of vasoconstrictor substances from platelets or by reflex
vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels.
iii) Pulmonary infarction. Obstruction of relatively smallsized pulmonary arterial branches may result in pulmonary
infarction . The clinical features include chest pain due to fibrinous pleuritis, haemoptysis and dyspnoea due
to reduced functioning pulmonary parenchyma.
iv) Pulmonary haemorrhage. Obstruction of terminal branches (endarteries) leads to central pulmonary
haemorrhage. The clinical features are haemoptysis, dyspnoea, and less commonly, chest pain due to central
location of pulmonary haemorrhage. Sometimes, there may be concomitant pulmonary infarction.
v) Resolution. Vast majority of small pulmonary emboli (60-80%) are resolved by fibrinolytic activity. These patients
are clinically silent owing to bronchial circulation so that lung parenchyma is adequately perfused.

Onion bulb appearance on nerve biopsy is seen in -,Amyloid neuropathy,Diabetic neuropathy,CIDP,Leprous neuritis,"chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) has been used to identify patients with a chronically progressive or relapsing symmetric sensorimotor disorder with cytoalbuminologic dissociation and interstitial and perivascular endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages. It can be considered the chronic equivalent of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, the most common form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Signs and symptoms CIDP typically stas insidiously and evolves slowly, in either a slowly progressive or a relapsing manner, with paial or complete recovery between recurrences; periods of worsening and improvement usually last weeks or months. Most expes consider the necessary duration of symptoms to be greater than 8 weeks for the diagnosis of CIDP to be made. Symptoms repoed include the following: Preceding infection (infrequent) Initial limb weakness, both proximal and distal Sensory symptoms (eg, tingling and numbness of hands and feet) Motor symptoms (usually predominant) In about 16% of patients, a relatively acute or subacute onset of symptoms In children, usually a more precipitous onset of symptoms Symptoms of autonomic system dysfunction (eg, ohostatic dizziness) Peinent physical findings are limited to the nervous system, except when the condition is associated with other diseases. Such findings may include the following. Signs of cranial nerve (CN) involvement (eg, facial muscle paralysis or diplopia) Gait abnormalities Motor deficits (eg, symmetric weakness of both proximal and distal muscles in upper and lower extremities) Diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes Sensory deficits (typically in stocking-glove distribution) Impaired coordination Diagnosis Laboratory studies that may be helpful include the following: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: Elevated protein levels are common (80% of patients); 10% of patients also have mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased gamma globulin Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA) level, biochemistry profile, and serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis (to exclude associated systemic disorders) In ceain instances, genetic testing Other tests and procedures that may be warranted are as follows: MRI of the spine with gadolinium enhancement Electromyography (EMG) is a critical test to determine whether the disorder is truly a peripheral neuropathy and whether the neuropathy is demyelinating Peripheral (sural) nerve biopsy (see the image below): This is considered when the diagnosis is not completely clear, when other causes cannot be excluded, or when profound axonal involvement is observed on EMG; biopsy was once commonly recommended for most patients before immunosuppressive therapy, but current guidelines no longer recommend it Electron micrograph of the peripheral nerve of a patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.

Exchange with H+ by Na+ /H+ exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete H+ with the help of carbonic anhvdrase. H+ ion exchanges with Na+ present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antiporter) and forms H2CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2CO3 is broken into H2O + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H2O diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H2CO3 is the source of H+. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transported to cortical E.C.F. by basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- symporter resulting in net reabsorption of NaHCO3.Carbonic anvdrase inhibitors (acetazoiamide) act predominantly in PCTand inhibit NaHCQ3 reabsorption.4. The disroportionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, particularly in the later PT. This takes Na+ and H2O along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic.o Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water:Site 11 Ascending limb of loop of Henleo The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct portion.Medullary portion lined by cuboidal cells.Cortical portion lined by flattened cells.o Both portions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid,o In the medullary portion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transports ions in ratio of Na+-K+-2Cl-. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na+ K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane,o This Na+ -K+--2Cl= symport is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide)o In addition, a Na+-Cl- symporter moves Cl- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along.Site III - cortical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DTo This segment is also impermeable to H2O and continues to absorb salt through Na+-Cl- symporter.o Thiazide diuretics act at this site.Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting ducto In late DT and CD, Na+ is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained partly by passive Cl- diffusion and partly by secretion of K+ and H+.o Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Na+ channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone.o K+- sparing diuretics act at this site.o Collecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic induced changes in K+ balance occur - as K+ secretion occurs in exchange of Na+, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine - Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absortion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine),o The principal cells are the major sites of Na+, K+, and water transport, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of H+ secretion.o The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed wrater channels (aquaporin-2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein - coupled cAMP - mediated process.o ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",A
True about oral iron supplements used for iron deficiency anaemia,The tolerable dose will deliver 40 to 60 mg of iron per day,Mass of total salt is important in determining daily dose,Treatment should be stopped as soon as normal haemoglobin level is reached,The desired rate of haemoglobin improvement is 0.5 mg  per day,"Tolerable dose of elemental iron is 200 mg per day in three divided doses i.e. app. 60 mg per dose.

Mass of elemental iron is more important in determining daily dose rather than a mass of total salt, because different salts provide a different amount of elemental iron.
Treatment with oral iron should be continued even after reaching the desired haemoglobin level to replenish the stores.
The desired rate of haemoglobin improvement is 0.5 to 1 mg per week (not day).",A

The following does not occur with asbestosis -,Methaemoglobinemia,Pneumoconiosis,Pleural mesothelioma,Pleural calcification,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh Mohan)6th edition page no. Overexposure to asbestos is associated with 3 types of lesions: asbestosis, pleural disease and ceain tumours. A.ASBESTOSIS. The gross pulmonary fibrosis caused by asbestos exposure and histologic demonstration of asbestos bodies on asbestos fibres is termed asbestosis. Grossly, the affected lungs are small and firm with cailage-like thickening of the pleura. The sectioned surface shows variable degree of pulmonary fibrosis, especially in the subpleural areas and in the bases of lungs . The advanced cases may show cystic changes. Histologically, the following changes are observed: 1.There is non-specific interstitial fibrosis. 2.There is presence of characteristic asbestos bodies in the involved areas . These are asbestos fibres coated with glycoprotein and haemosiderin and appear beaded or dumbbell-shaped. The coating stains positively for Prussian blue reaction. 3.There may be changes of emphysema in the pulmonary parenchyma between the areas of interstitial fibrosis. 4.The involvement of hilar lymph nodes in asbestosis is not as significant as in silicosis. B.PLEURAL DISEASE. Pleural disease in asbestos exposure may produce one of the following 3 types of lesions: 1.Pleural effusion. It develops in about 5% of asbestos workers and is usually serious type. Pleural effusion is generally accompanied by subpleural asbestosis. 2.Visceral pleural fibrosis. Quite often, asbestosis is associated with dense fibrous thickening of the visceral pleura encasing the lung. 3.Pleural plaques. Fibrocalcific pleural plaques are the most common lesions associated with asbestos exposure. Grossly, the lesions appear as circumscribed, flat, small (upto 1 cm in diameter), firm or hard, bilateral nodules. They are seen more often on the posterolateral pa of parietal pleura and on the pleural surface of the diaphragm. Microscopically, they consist of hyalinised collagenous tissue which may be calcified so that they are visible on chest X-ray. Asbestos bodies are generally not found within the plaques. C.TUMOURS. Asbestos exposure predisposes to a number of cancers, most impoantly bronchogenic carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma . A few others are: carcinomas of oesophagus, stomach, colon, kidneys and larynx and various lymphoid malignancies. 1.Bronchogenic carcinoma is the most common malignancy in asbestos workers. Its incidence is 5 times higher in non-smoker asbestos workers than the nonsmoker general population and 10 times higher in smoker asbestos workers than the other smokers. 2.Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon tumour but association with asbestos exposure is present in 30 to 80% of cases with mesothelioma. The exposure need not be heavy because mesothelioma is known to develop in people living near asbestos plants or in wives of asbestos workers",A

Skin cancers develop due to sunlight exposure induced by,UVA rays,UVD rays,UVC rays,UVB rays,"Ultraviolet radiation is of 3 types; UV-A, UV-B and UV-C.
• UVA causes melanin oxidation with transient immediate darkening. Repeated exposure to UV radiation cause degenerative changes in elastin and collagen leading to wrinkling increased laxity and a leathery appearance. It is however used therapeutically in PUVA therapy for the management of vitiligo, psoriasis and cutaneous T cell lymphomaQ.
• UVB can cause skin damage by formation of reactive oxygen species and formation of pyrimidine dimmers between adjacent pyrimidines on the same DNA strand. The latter can cause double base substitutions in the p53 resulting in
the development of skin cancers. So, it is the most dangerous for humans. Exposure to UV rays also induces DNA repair, apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. The absence of this protective mechanism is seen in patients of Xeroderma pigmentosum causing high incidence of skin cancers.
• UVC is not reaching earth because it gets filtered by the protective ozone layer.",D

"A 54-year-old woman is involved in an automobile accident and requires a blood transfusion. Five hours later, she becomes febrile and has severe back pain. Laboratory studies show evidence of intravascular hemolysis. It is discovered that type A Rh+ blood was given by mistake to this type B Rh+ patient. Which of the following best explains the development of intravascular hemolysis in this patient?",Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity,Antibody-mediated complement fixation,Delayed-type hypersensitivity,Immune complex disease,"Antibody-mediated complement fixation. Type II hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by antibodies directed against fixed antigens. In this case, preformed antibodies in the patient's blood attached to foreign antigens (oligosaccharides) on the membranes of the transfused erythrocytes. At sufficient density, bound immunoglobulins fix complement. Once activated, the complement cascade leads to the destruction of the target cell through formation of a membrane attack complex. This type of complement-mediated cell lysis occurs in autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC, choice A) involves cytolytic leukocytes that attack antibody-coated target cells. ADCC may be involved in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases (e.g., autoimmune thyroiditis). Delayed-type hypersensitivity (choice C) occurs over a period of days and does not involve preformed antibodies.Diagnosis: Hemolytic anemia, jaundice",B

Which of the following is the mechanism of action of bumetanide?,Angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitor,Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor,Loop diuretic,Potassium sparing diuretic,"Bumetanide is a loop diuretic. It inhibits the sodium, potassium, chloride cotranspoer in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitors include benazepril, captopril and lisinopril. They interfere with the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, act in the proximal convoluted tubule. They cause a self-limited sodium bicarbonate diuresis. They are used to alkalinize the urine, and for the treatment of metabolic alkalosis and glaucoma. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, and amiloride inhibit the action of aldosterone. They are used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism and potassium depletion. Also Know: Loop diuretics inhibit a specific ion transpo protein, the Na+-K+-2Cl- sympoer on the apical membrane of renal epithelial cells in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle to increase Na+ and fluid delivery to distal nephron segments. These drugs also enhance K+ secretion, paicularly in the presence of elevated aldosterone levels, as is typical in CHF. Ref: Maron B.A., Rocco T.P. (2011). Chapter 28.

Which of the following is a mast cell stabilizer: September 2005,Montelukast,Sodium chromoglycate,Cetrizine,Theophylline,"Ans. B: Sodium Chromoglycate Mast cell stabilizers are cromone medications used to prevent or control ceain allergic disorders. They block a calcium channel essential for mast cell degranulation, stabilizing the cell and thereby preventing the release of histamine and related mediators. Without intracellular calcium, the histamine vesicles cannot fuse to the cell membrane and degranulate. As inhalers they are used to treat asthma, as nasal sprays to treat hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and as eye drops for allergic conjunctivitis. Finally in oral form they are used to treat the rare condition of mastocytosis Cromoglicic acidicromolyrVcromoglycate/cromoglicate is traditionally described as a mast cell stabilizer, and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt sodium cromoglycate or cromolyn sodium.

As with all myeloproliferative diseases, the transformation occurs in a myeloid stem cell. In this form of myeloproliferative disease, the dominant cell type affected is the megakaryocyte, and there is thrombocytosis. Other myeloproliferative disorders, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera, also can be accompanied by an increased platelet count. The diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis can be made after other causes of reactive thrombocytosis are excluded, and if the bone marrow examination shows increased megakaryocytes with no evidence of leukemia. The throbbing, burning pain in the extremities is caused by platelet aggregates that occlude small arterioles. The major manifestation of this disease is thrombotic or hemorrhagic crises.

A study of aging shows that senescent cells have accumulated damage from toxic byproducts of metabolism. There is increased intracellular lipofuscin deposition. Prolonged ingestion of which of the following substances is most likely to counteract this aging mechanism?,Antioxidants,Analgesics,Antimicrobials,Antineoplastic agents,"Antioxidants may counteract the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may accumulate acutely and chronically within cells as a consequence of environmental insults and pathologic processes. Certainly, health food stores promote this concept with sales of products such as vitamin E. However, cellular damage is multifactorial, and proving that one compound has a significant effect is difficult. Analgesics ameliorate the perception of pain from cellular damage, but they do not prevent or diminish cell damage; they only mask it. Antimicrobials may help the body's own immune defenses against infectious agents and shorten and/or diminish tissue damage. However, long-term use of antimicrobials is discouraged because it may alter the body's own useful microbial flora, and it can promote development of drug-resistant strains that pose a serious health risk for the general population. (As Mr. Spock noted, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."") Antineoplastic agents are given for malignancies and rarely have benefit for cancer prevention. Glucocorticoids provide short-term improvement in well-being, but when used for longer periods, they have deleterious effects.",A

"A 67-year-old man has had increasing weakness, fatigue, and weight loss over the past 5 months. He now has decreasing vision in both eyes and has headaches and dizziness. His hands are sensitive to cold. On physical examination, he has generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory studies indicate a serum protein level of 15.5 g/dL and albumin concentration of 3.2 g/dL. A bone marrow biopsy is performed, and microscopic examination of the specimen shows infiltration by numerous small plasmacytoid lymphoid cells with Russell bodies in the cytoplasm. Which of the following additional laboratory findings is most likely to be reported for this patient?",Bence Jones proteinuria,Hypercalcemia,Karyotype with t (14;18) translocation,Monoclonal IgM spike in serum,"Hyperviscosity syndrome includes visual disturbances, dizziness, headache, and Raynaud phenomena. His bone marrow is infiltrated with plasmacytoid lymphocytes that have stored immunoglobulins in their cytoplasm (Russell bodies). All of these findings are consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia). In this disorder, neoplastic B cells differentiate to IgM-producing cells; there is a monoclonal IgM spike in the serum. These IgM molecules aggregate and produce hyperviscosity, and some of them agglutinate at low temperatures and produce cold agglutinin disease. Myeloma, which is typically accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy, most often does not cause liver and spleen enlargement, and morphologically, the cells resemble plasma cells. Light chains in urine (Bence Jones proteins) also are a feature of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia occurs with myeloma because myeloma cells produce MIP1-a that up-regulates RANKL production and increased osteoclastic activity, so punched-out lytic bone lesions are typical of multiple myeloma. A t (14;18) translocation is characteristic of a follicular lymphoma. There is typically no leukemic phase to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.",D
Antacid drug that typically causes diarrhea?,Sodium bicarbonate,Magnesium hydroxide,Calcium bicarbonate,Aluminium hydroxide,"Ans. b (Magnesium hydroxide) (Ref. KDT 6th/pg. 635).Mag. hydroxide has low water solubility: its aqueous suspension (milk of magnesia) has low concentration of OH- ions and thus low alkalinity. However, it reacts with HCI promptly and is an efficacious antacid (1 g mEq HCI). Rebound acidity is mild and brief. All Mg salts have a laxative action-by generating osmotically active MgCI, in the stomach and through Mg2+ ion induced cholecystokinin release. Soluble Mg salts are used as osmotic purgatives.Sodium bicarbonateIt reacts rapidly with HCI to produce carbon dioxide and NaCI. Formation of carbon dioxide results in gastric distention and belching. Unreacted alkali is readily absorbed, potentially causing metabolic alkalosis when given in high doses or to patients with renal insufficiency. Sodium chloride absorption may exacerbate fluid retention in patients with heart failure, hypertension, and renal insufficiency.Calcium carbonateIt is less soluble and reacts more slowly than sodium bicarbonate with HCI to form carbon dioxide and CaCI2. Calcium carbonate is used for a number of other indications apart from its antacid properties (bone mineral homeostasis). Excessive doses of either sodium bicarbonate or calcium carbonate with calcium-containing dairy products can lead to hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and metabolic alkalosis (milk-alkali syndrome).Magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxideReact slowly with HCI to form magnesium chloride or aluminum chloride and water.Because no gas is generated, belching does not occur.Metabolic alkalosis is also uncommon because of the efficiency of the neutralization reaction.Unabsorbed magnesium salts may cause an osmotic diarrhea and aluminum salts may cause constipation patients with renal insufficiency should not take these agents long-term.",B

Thus new patients in US should not be started on rotigotine and patients currently using rotigotine in the U.S. should be slowly tapered off the drug.Rotigotine should not be stopped abruptly because sudden withdrawal of Dopaminergic agonists has been associated with a syndrome resembling neurolept malignant syndrome.",B
"A 60-year-old woman with arthritis suffers a massive stroke and expires. At autopsy, the proximal phalangeal joint tissue shows pannus, synovial cell hyperplasia, and lymphoid follicles. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of pannus formation in this patient?",Calcification of the synovium,Chronic inflammation of synovium,Degeneration of cartilage,Dislocation of a portion of bone,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease in which chronic polyarthritis involves diarthrodial joints symmetrically and bilaterally. Synovial lining cells undergo hyperplasia. The result is a synovial lining thrown into numerous villi and frond-like folds that fill the peripheral recesses of the joint. As the synovium undergoes hyperplasia and hypertrophy, it creeps over the surface of the articular cartilage and adjacent structures. This inflammatory synovium is termed a pannus (cloak). The pannus covers the articular cartilage and isolates it from the synovial fluid. Synovial calcification (choice A) does not occur in RA. Pannus may destroy cartilage (choice C) by depriving it of nourishment.Diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis",B

Normal upper limit of CA - 125 is ?,25 U/ ml,45 U/ ml,65 U/ ml,85 U/ ml,"Ans. is `a' i.e., 25 U/ ml The normal value is less than 35 U/mL 1) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) It is a glycoprotein produced by fetal gut, pancreas and liver. It is used as tumor marker for colorectal cancer (major use), lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It is also increased in non-neoplastic conditions like alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis, IBD (CD, UC), smoking and pancreatitis. In colorectal cancer it is used for screening; response and follow up after surgery (CEA should diseapper in 6 weeks after resection), prognosis (higher levels suggests high tumor burden) and to see recurrence on follow up. CEA antigen has no correlation with hepatic metastasis. CEA lacks sensitivity as well as specificity, hence cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis. 2) Alpha-feto protein (AFP) It is a glycoprotein synthesized normally early in fetal life by yolk sac, fetal liver and fetal GIT. It is structurally and genetically related to albumin. AFP is raised in liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and non-seminoma germ cell tumor of testis/ovary (yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma). AFP is also raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pregnancy. 3) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) It is a placental hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts. It is glycoprotein with two subunits (dimer) : a-subunit and /3-subunit. But only the P subunit of HCG is typically measured as a tumour marker because of specificity of the 13 subunit. The i3 subunit of HCG has unique sequences that are not shared with other human glycoprotein hormones. It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the 13 chain. a-HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical. So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is 13 HCG. HCG (13-HCG) is raised in gestational trophoblastic disease (hydatidiform moles), gonadal germ cell tumor (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma), and pregnancy. 4) CA-125 Most impoant cancer with elevated CA-125 is epithelial ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also elevated in cancers of endometrium, cervix, fallopian tubes, pancreas, breast, lung and colon. Non-neoplastic conditions causing elevation of CA-125 are pregnancy, mensturation, endometriosis, PID, abdominal TB, peritonitis and uterine fibroid. Tumor markers for testicular/ovarian tumor AFP (alpha-feto protein) : Teratoma, Yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor), embryonal carcinoma.

Action of the alpha subunit of G-protein is:,Binding of antagonist,Breakdown of GTP to GDP,Conversion of GDP to GTP,All of the above,"The α-subunit has GTPase activity: the bound GTP is slowly hydrolysed to GDP: the α-subunit then dissociates from the effector to rejoin its other subunits, but not before the effector has been activated / inhibited for several seconds (much longer than the life-time of the activated receptor, which is in milliseconds) and the signal has been greatly amplified. The rate of GTP hydrolysis by the α subunit and thus the period for which it remains activated is regulated by another protein called ‘regulator of G protein signaling’ (RGS). The onset time of response through GPCRs is in seconds.
KEY CONCEPT:-
Alpha subunit of G protein contains GTPase which breaks GTP into GDP.

In marfan syndrome the defect is in,Fibrillin I,Fibrillin II,Collegen,Elastin,"In Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance, the basic biochemical abnormality is a mutation affecting fibrillin. This glycoprotein, secreted by fibroblasts, is the major component of microfibrils found in the extracellular matrix. Microfibrils serve as scaffolding for the deposition of tropoelastin, an integral component of elastic fibers. Fibrillin is encoded by the FBN1 gene, which maps to chromosomal locus 15q21. Mutations in the FBN1 gene are found in all patients with Marfan syndrome. Although microfibrils are widely distributed in the body, they are paicularly abundant in the aoa, ligaments, and the ciliary zonules that suppo the ocular lens; these tissues are prominently affected in Marfan syndrome.

"A 52 year old male presents to his physician with a chief complaint of a substantial increase in the size of his breasts over the past few months. Three months ago he was diagnosed with hypeension, and placed on antihypeensive medication. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed?",Captopril,Furosemide,Hydrochlorothiazide,Spironolactone,"All of the medications listed as answer choices can be effectively used in the treatment of hypeension. Spironolactone is a ""potassium-sparing"" diuretic that exes its action primarily as a competitive inhibitor of aldosterone receptors in the distal nephron. One of the repoed side effects of spironolactone is gynecomastia. None of the other choices have gynecomastia as a side effect. Captopril is an angiotensin-conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that causes a decrease in plasma angiotensin II concentration, resulting in decreased aldosterone secretion. Furosemide is a ""loop diuretic"" that acts by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the loop of Henle as well as in the proximal and distal renal tubules. Hydrochlorothiazide is a ""thiazide diuretic"" that inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the distal renal tubules. Ref: Snyder P.J. (2011). Chapter 41. Androgens. In B.C.

"Drug of choice for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia is: March 2010, September 2007and 2010, March 2013",Digoxin,Propranolol,Adenosine,Diltiazem,"Ans. C: Adenosine Initial measures to terminate SVT should include vagal maneuvers. If unsuccessful, termination can be achieved with antiarrhythmic drugs whose primary effects increase refractoriness and/ or decrease conduction (negative dromotropic effect) over the AV node. These drugs can have direct (e.g., verapamil blocks the slow-inward calcium current of the AV node) or indirect effects (e.g., digoxin increases vagal tone to the AV node). In most patients, the drug of choice is either adenosine or verapamil. The advantages of adenosine include its rapid onset of action (usually within 10-25 seconds a peripheral vein), sho half-life (less than 10 seconds) and high degree of efficacy. Its sho half-life minimizes the severity of side effects, such as facial flushing, chest tightness, dyspnea and transient sinus arrest and/or atrioventricular block. In general, adenosine has an excellent safety record, but pause-dependent torsade de pointes may infrequently occur and transient atrial fibrillation may occur due to shoening of the atrial action potential. Adenosine should be given with caution to patients with bronchospasm and is contraindicated in those with sinus node dysfunction or second- or third-degree hea block. Dipyridamole potentates adenosine's effects by blocking its cellular uptake and aminophylline blunts its effects by competitive receptor antagonism. Sequential dosing can be given at 60 second intervals due to adenosine's rapid metabolism. In AV node reentry the most common site of termination is the anterograde slow pathway. Termination may also occur indirectly, i.e., due to adenosine - induced atrial or ventricular premature beats",C

"Which of the following tumors is characterized histologically by pseudopalisading, necrosis, endoneural proliferation, hypercellularity, and atypical nuclei?",Schwannoma,Medulloblastoma,Oligodendroglioma,Glioblastoma multiforme,"The features listed in the question are characteristic of a glioblastoma multiforme. Astrocytomas, the most common primary brain tumors in adults, range from low-grade to very high-grade (glioblastoma multiforme). These grades of astrocytomas include grade I (the least aggressive and histologically difficult to differentiate from reactive astrocytosis), grade II (some pleomorphism microscopically), grade III (anaplastic astrocytoma, characterized histologically by increased pleomorphism and prominent mitoses), and grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme). Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly malignant tumor characterized histologically by endothelial proliferation and serpentine areas of necrosis surrounded by peripheral palisading of tumor cells. It frequently crosses the midline (""butterfly tumor""). In contrast, schwannomas generally appear as extremely cellular spindle cell neoplasms, sometimes with metaplastic elements of bone, cailage, and skeletal muscle. Medulloblastomas occur exclusively in the cerebellum and microscopically are highly cellular with uniform nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and, in about one-third of cases, rosette formation centered by neurofibrillary material. Oligodendrogliomas, which are marked by foci of calcification in 70% of cases, commonly show a pattern of uniform cellularity and are composed of round cells with small dark nuclei, clear cytoplasm, and a clearly defined cell membrane. Ependymomas are distinguished by ependymal rosettes, which are ductlike structures with a central lumen around which columnar tumor cells are arranged in a concentric fashion.

May be he has unprovoked venous thromboembolism and recurrent venous thromboembolism, so maintain INR at 2.0 to 3.0 and continue warfarin.IMPORTANT:Warfarin induced bleedingThe INR should be maintained in the therapeutic range to minimize the risk of bleeding.In asymptomatic patients whose INR is between 3.5 and 10, warfarin should be withheld until the INR returns to the therapeutic range.If the INR is over 10, oral vitamin K should be administered, at a dose of 2.5-5 mg.Higher doses of oral vitamin K (5-10 mg) produce more rapid reversal of the INR but may render patients temporarily resistant to warfarin when the drug is restarted.Patients with serious bleeding need more aggressive treatment. These patients should be given 5-10 mg of vitamin K by slow IV infusion. Additional vitamin K should be given until the INR is in the normal range.Treatment with vitamin K should be supplemented with fresh-frozen plasma as a source of the vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins.Four factor prothrombin complex concentrates, which contain all four vitamin K-dependent clotting proteins, are the treatment of choice for:Life-threatening bleeds.Rapid restoration of the INR into the normal range in patients requiring urgent surgery or intervention,Patients who cannot tolerate the volume load of fresh-frozen plasma.",C
"Negri bodies are characteristic of: September 2008, March 2013",Tetanus,Rabies,Polio,AIDS,"Ans. B: Rabies Since first described by Negri in 1903, the presence of the Negri bodies are practically pathognomic for rabies and are an impoant diagnostic finding. Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",B

These findings are typical for which of the following type of hypersensitivity immunologic responses:",Type IV,Type II,Type III,Type I,"Presence of epithelioid cell granuloma, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytes is characteristic of chronic granulomatous inflammation
Chronic granulomatous inflammation occurs when two conditions are satisfied i.e.

a. When an active T lymphocyte-mediated cellular immune response occurs.

Lymphokines produced by activated T lymphocytes inhibit migration of macrophages and cause them to aggregate in the area of injury and form granulomas.
This pathological process is characteristic of Type IV hypersensitivity (so one can say that- Type IV hypersensitivity is essential for chronic granulomatous inflammation)

b. When macrophages have successfully phagocytosed the injurious agent but it survives inside them.

Some important definitions- • Epithelioid cells - These are activated macrophages
They are large cells with abundant pale foamy cytoplasm
Epithelioid cell granuloma
An epitheloid cell granuloma is an aggregate of these activated macrophages.

What is found at surgery that changed the staging?",Involvement of the chest wall,Positive bronchial lymph nodes,Small cell histology,Tumor at the carina,"Although it is nearly impossible to memorize the staging rules for all the different kinds of tumors, there are several basic principles common to all. The TNM stage of a tumor is determined by the tumor size and extent (T for tumor), lymph node involvement (N for nodes), and metastasis (M for metastasis). N0 always means no lymph nodes are involved. An NI lesion has positive nodes, and only 2nd choice, positive bronchial lymph nodes, changes the patient's nodal status. Involvement of the chest wall is a feature of tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging. T2 lesions involve the chest wall. Histological features of the tumor, such as small cell morphology are not considered in tumor stage, but rather in tumor grade. Small cell tumors are considered high-grade carcinomas. Tumor extending to the carina reflects the tumor size and extent-thus, it is a component of the T in TNM-staging: T3 lesions involve the carina. Ref: Longo D.L. (2012). Chapter 81.

Pleomorphic adenoma is usually arisen from,Minor salivary gland,Superficial lobe,Parotid gland,Sub mandibular gland,"Pleomorphic adenomas present as painless, slow-growing, mobile discrete masses. They represent about 60% of tumors in the parotid, are less common in the submandibular glands, and are relatively rare in the minor salivary glands. 
Pleomorphic adenomas are benign tumors that consist of a mixture of ductal (epithelial) and myoepithelial cells, so they exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation.
Epithelial elements are dispersed throughout the matrix, which may contain variable mixtures of myxoid, hyaline, chondroid (cartilaginous), and even osseous tissue. In some pleomorphic adenomas, the epithelial elements
predominate; in others, they are present only in widely dispersed foci. This histologic diversity has given rise to the alternative, albeit less preferred name mixed tumor. 
The tumors consistently overexpress the transcription factor
PLAG1, often because of chromosomal rearrangements involving the PLAG1 gene, but how PLAG1 contributes to
tumor development is unknown.
Pleomorphic adenomas typically manifest as rounded, well-demarcated masses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatest dimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations (particularly the palate), the capsule is not fully developed, and expansile growth produces protrusions into the surrounding tissues. The cut surface is grey-white and typically contains myxoid and blue translucent chondroid (cartilage-like) areas. The most striking histologic feature is their characteristic heterogeneity. Epithelial elements resembling ductal or myoepithelial cells are arranged in ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or even sheets. These typically are dispersed within a mesenchyme-like background of loose myxoid tissue containing islands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone (Fig. 14–6).
Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ducts lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layer of deeply chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In other instances, there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelial cells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium also may be present. In most cases, no epithelial dysplasia or mitotic activity is evident. No difference in biologic behaviour has been observed between the tumors composed largely of epithelial elements and those composed largely of mesenchymal elements.",C

"Cis-atracurium is preferred over atracurium, because:",It has rapid onset of action,It causes less release of histamine,It has short duration of action,It has less depressant action on heart,Ans. (B) It causes less release of histamine(Ref: Miller's 7th/e p869)Both atracurium and cis-atracurium are non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers.Both of these are intermediate acting agents (both have same duration of action).Both of these agents are cardiostableAtracurium has faster onset of action as compared to cis-atracurium.Both are eliminated by Hoffman's elimination. Atracurium is also metabolized by liver to some extent and result in production of a metabolite laudanosine that can cause CNS toxicity including seizures. On the other hand cis-atracurium is almost completely eliminated by Hoffman's elimination and produce negligible laudanosine.Major advantage of cis-atracurium over atracurium is that the former do not release histamine.Note: Only cis-atracurium and doxacurium are the drugs in this category (whose name ends with curium) that do not release histamine.,B

Abnormal chromosomal number which is exact multiple of the 23 -,Euploidy,Aneuploidy,Mosaicism,Trisomy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Euploidy Chromosomal disorders (cvtogenetic disorders) o Chromosomal mutation may cause ? 1.Abnormal number of chromosomes 2.Alteration in the structure of chromosomes. 1. Abnormal number of chromosomes o There are 23 pairs of chromosomes (46, XX in females and 46, XY in males). o An exact multiple of the 23 (haploid number) is called euploidy. o When the number of chromosomes are not an exact multiple of 23, it is referred as aneuploidy. eg - Trisomy or monosomy. Pathogenesis of aneuploidy o In aneuploidy error either in meiosis or in mitosis. (a) Error in meiosis o It is the most common cause of aneuploidy. o The usual causes are nondisjunction or anaphase lag. o In nondisjunction, chromosomal pair fails to separate in first meiotic division during gametogenesis, so one gamete has an extra chromosome (n+1) and the other has one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization of such gametes with normal gamete results in two types of zygotes - trisomy (2n+1) or monosomy (2n-1). o In anaphase lag, one chromosome lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. The result is one gamete with normal chromosomes (n) and other gamete with one less chromosome (n-1). Feilization in two types of zygote -4 normal (2n) or monosomy (2n-1). (b) Error in Mitosis o Error in mitosis in early development give rise to two or more different types of populations in the same individuals, a condition referred as mosaicism. o Mosaicism affecting the sex chromosome is common. o In the division of an feilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cell receiving three sex chromosomes, where as the other recieves only one, yielding, a 45, X/47, XXX mosaic. That means the same individual will have both types of cells cells having 45, X and cells having 47, XXX. Then what is the difference between Monosomy / trisomy and mosachism ? Trisomy/monosomy are due to defect in meiosis and before feilization, so that after feilization all cells have same number of chromosome either monosomy or trisomy. In mosaicism, defect is in mitosis and after feilization so that same individual has cells of two different population eg. 45, X and 47, XXX. 2. Abnormal structure of chromosome o Chromosomal structural changes usually result from chromosome breakage followed by loss or rearrangement. o Beside these chromosomal structural abnormalities some autosomal recessive genetic disorders are associated with such a high level of chromosomal instability that they are known as chromosomal breakage syndrome --> Ataxia - telangiectasis, bloom syndrome, and fanconi anemia. There is significantly increased risk of cancer in these syndromes.",A

Reason for preferring cis-Atracurium over Atracurium is,Does not undergo Hoffman elimination,Sho and fast action,Lesser provocation of histamine release,Equal potency like Atracurium,"* Cis-Atracurium is a R enantiomer of Atracurium that does not provoke histamine release. Compared to Atracurium, Cis-Atracurium is: - * 4 times more potent * Slow in onset of action, but similar duration of action * Not hydrolysed by plasma cholinesterase and has limited hepatic metabolism --> less amount of toxic metabolites are formed. (Cis-Atra also undergoes Hoffman elimination) * Does not provoke histamine release, lesser side effects * Cis-Atracurium is preferred skeletal muscle relaxant in elderly patients and for patients with liver/kidney disease.

Most common type of malignancy of stomach is:September 2007,Adenocarcinoma,Squamous carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,Lymphoma,"Ans. A: AdenocarcinomaGastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%).Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria.Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate.Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"".Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma).Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A

An AST level that is higher than the ALT level is characteristic, however, of liver cell injury associated with chronic alcoholism. In this patient, the disease is decompensating, as evidenced by the elevated blood ammonia level. HAV is typically a mild disease without a preponderance of direct bilirubin. Choledocholithiasis results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but without the high ammonia level that is evidence of liver failure.

The dose of methyl prednisolone to be given in an acute spinal injury is,15 mg/kg/body weight,25 mg/kg/body weight,30 mg/kg/body weight,50 mg/kg/body weight,"(C) 30 mg/kg/body weight# STEROID THERAPY IN SPINAL CORD INJURY: Steroid have verified significant improvement in motor function and sensation in patients with complete or incomplete spinal cord injuries (SCIs) who were treated with high doses of methylprednisolone within 8 hours of injury. High doses of steroids or Tirilazad are thought to minimize the secondary effects of acute SCI.> 30-mg/kg bolus of methylprednisolone administered within 8 hours of injury, whereas the study evaluated methylprednisolone 5.4 mg/kg/h for 24 or 48 hours versus tirilazad 2.5 mg/kg q6h for 48 hours. (Tirilazad is a potent lipid preoxidation inhibitor.)> Between the 2 studies, it was determined that: (1) in patients treated earlier than 3 hours after injury, the administration of methyl- prednisolone for 24 hours was best; (2) in patients treated 3-8 hours after injury, the use of methylprednisolone for 48 hours was best; (3) Tirilazad was equivalent to methylprednisolone for 24 hours.> Both NASCIS studies evaluated the patients' neurologic status at baseline on enrollment into the study, at 6 weeks, and at 6 months and found absolutely no evidence suggests that giving the medication earlier (eg, in the first hour) provides more be nefit than giving it later (eg, between hours 7 and 8).> The authors concluded that there was only a benefit if methylprednisolone or tirilazad were given within 8 hours of injury.> Use of high-dose methylprednisolone in non-penetrating acute SCI had become the standard of care in North America.An increased incidence of infection and avascular necrosis has been documented.> Revised recommendations pertaining to steroid therapy in SCI:- The American College of Surgeons (ACS) has modified their advanced trauma life support (ACLS) guidelines to state that methylprednisolone is ""a recommended treatment"" rather than ""the recommended treatment."" Updated guidelines issued in 2013 by the CNS and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) recommend against the use of steroids early after an acute SCI. Guidelines recommend that methylprednisolone not be used for the treatment of acute SCI within the first 24-48 hours following injury. Previous standard was revised because of a lack of medical evidence supporting the benefits of steroids in clinical settings and evidence that high-dose steroids are associated with harmful adverse effects. Overall, the benefit from steroids is considered modest at best, but for patients with complete or incomplete quadriplegia, a small improvement in motor strength in one or more muscles can provide important functional gains. Administration of steroids remains an institutional and physician preference in spinal cord injury. Administration of high-dose steroids within 8 hours of injury for all patients with acute spinal cord injury is practiced by most physicians. Current recommendation is to treat all patients with spinal cord injury according to the local/regional protocol. If steroids are recommended, they should be initiated within 8 hours of injury with the following steroid protocol: Methylpred- nisolone 30 mg/kg bolus over 15 minutes and an infusion of methylprednisolone at 5.4 mg/kg/h for 23 hours beginning 45 minutes after the bolus.",C

Explanation:
Ans. is ‘a’ i.e., IL-2 [Ref: Robbins 7th/e p.
A. T helper - 1 {TH
1) secretes → IL-2 and interferon - γ
B. T helper - 2 (T[f
2) secretes → IL-4,IL-5, IL-6, EL-13
T-cells
o T cells are amongst the two important cells of adaptive immune system (others are B-cells).
o T cell precursors arise in bone marrow (also in yolk sac & liver before birth) and migrate to the thymus,
o Maturity ofT-cells takes place in the thymus (So, T cells arise in bone marrow and mature in thymus),
o T-cells constitutes 60%-70% of the circulating peripheral lymphocytes.
o Based on their surface markers. target cells and functions the following T cell category have been identified:
1. Helper/Inducer T cells
These cells have CD4 surface marker and are MHC class II restricted.
These are further subdivided into: -
A. Effector CD4 helper T cells
o These cells secrete cytokines and other products that perform all major functions,
o These cells are of following types.
i. TH, cells
These cells are activated by IFN-γ
These cells produce IL-2, IFNyand IL-12.
These cells facilitate delayed hypersensitivity, cell mediated immunity. Macrophage activation,
Killing of intracellular microbes e.g., tuberculosis & leprosy.
These cells also induce destruction of target cell by : -
i. Activating CD8 T cells to become cytotoxic cells; and
ii. Activating NK cells.
ii. TH, cells
These cells are activated by IL-4.
These cells secrete IL-4,1L-5, IL-6 and IL-13.
these cells facilitates the synthesis of antibodies particularly IgE and cause activation of mast
Cells and eosinophils → Therefore, provide defence against Helminthic parasites.
iii. TH17 cells
A third subset of CD4 T-cells (besides TH1 and TH2) has been discovered recently and is
Called the
TH17 cells.
If the antigen producing cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-23,
These work in collaboration with TGF-(3 to stimulate differentiation of T-cells to the TH 17
cells.
TH17 cells are powerful recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes, and thus play major roles in
severe inflammatoiy diseases.
They may also be important for defense against some bacterial and fungal infections in which
neutrophilic inflammation is a prominent feature.
TH 17 cells are activated by some microbial antigens and by self antigens in autoimmune
diseases. Activated TH17 cells secret IL-17, IL-22 and chemokines. Collectively, these
cytokines recruit neutrophils and monocytes.
TH17 cells produce IL-21, which amplifies the TH17 (self) response.
B. Memory CD4 helper T cells
o Provide memory, i.e., retain the antigenic affinity of the originally activated T cells and are used to
act aslater effector cells during a second immune response.
2. Cytolytk/cytotoik T cells
These cells have CD8 surface marker and are MHC class I restricted.
They kill and lyse target cells including tumor cells, virus infected cells and allograft; and participate in
Type II Hypersensitivity.
3. Suppressor T-cells
These cells have CDg surface marker and are MHC class I restricted.
These cells down regulate immune response.
o Helper T cell (CD4 T cell) is known as the master regulator of the immune system.
o The ratio of CD4 and CD8 T cell is normally 2 :1.",A

A patient presented with abdominal pain and frequent unsatisfactory bowel movement. For the last one year he has been using a purgative twice weekly to open his bowel.

Which is the most likely purgative that the patient has been using,Liquid paraffin,Lactulose,Ispaghula,Senna,"Anthraquinones Lactulose Senna is obtained from leaves and pods of ceain Cassia sp. The glycosides are not active as such. Unabsorbed in the small intestine, they are passed to the colon where bacteria liberate the active anthrol form, which either acts locally or is absorbed into circulation-- excreted in bile to act on small intestine. Thus, they take 6-8 hours to produce action. Taken by lactating mothers, the amount secreted in milk is sufficient to cause purgation in the suckling infant. The active principle of these drugs acts on the myenteric plexus to increase peristalsis and decrease segmentation. They also promote secretion and inhibit salt and water absorption in the colon. adverse effects:- Skin rashes, fixed drug eruption.

A 50-year-old chronic alcoholic presents to the emergency room with 12 hours of severe abdominal pain. The pain radiates to the back and is associated with an urge to vomit. Physical examination discloses exquisite abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies show elevated serum amylase. Which of the following morphologic changes would be expected in the peripancreatic tissue of this patient?,Coagulative necrosis,Caseous necrosis,Fat necrosis,Fibrinoid necrosis,"Fat necrosis. Saponification of fat derived from peripancreatic fat cells exposed to pancreatic enzymes is a typical feature of fat necrosis. Lipase, released from pancreatic acinar cells during an attack of acute pancreatitis, hydrolyzes fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Free fatty acids bind with calcium to form soaps, which is a process known as saponification. Entry of calcium ions into the injured tissue reduces the level of calcium in blood. Hypocalcemia is, therefore, a typical finding in patients who had a recent bout of acute pancreatitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis experience sudden-onset abdominal pain, distention, and vomiting. The other choices are not typically seen in peripancreatic tissue following acute pancreatitis, although liquefactive necrosis (choice E) may be observed.Diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis",C

Which of the following helps in differentiation of follicular carcinoma from follicular adenoma of thyroid gland?,Hurthle cell change,Lining of tall columnar and cuboidal cells,Vascular invasion,Increased mitoses,"Robbins clearly write…. ‘Microscopically, most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles. Follicular carcinomas may be grossly infiltrative or minimally invasive. The latter are sharply demarcated lesions that may be impossible to distinguish from follicular adenomas on gross examination. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface, to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. Extensive invasion of adjacent thyroid parenchyma makes the diagnosis of carcinoma obvious in some cases’.
Ideal answer for a question for diagnosis of follicular cancer is capsular invasion (better than even vascular invasion) but in the given options, vascular invasion is the answer of choice.

With anti-thyroid drugs risk of foetal hypothyroidism and goiter are there.# However, low doses of propylthiouracil are preferred as it has greater protein binding, allowing less transfer to foetus. For the same reason it is preferred in nursing mothers also.HYPERTHYROIDISM IN PREGNANCYHyperthyroidism in pregnancy should be aggressively evaluated and treated. It is most commonly caused by Graves disease, but autonomously functioning nodules, gestational trophoblastic disease, thyroiditis, and hyperemesis gravidarum should also be considered. Methimazole crosses the placenta to a greater degree than propylthiouracil and has been associated with fetal aplasia cutis. However, propylthiouracil can be associated with liver failure. Some experts recommend propylthiouracil in the first trimester and methimazole thereafter. Radioiodine should not be used during pregnancy, either for scanning or treatment, because of effects on the fetal thyroid. In emergent circumstances, additional treatment with beta blockers and a saturated solution of potassium iodide may be necessary. Hyperthyroidism is most difficult to control in the first trimester of pregnancy and easiest to control in the third trimester.",D

Which anesthetic modality is to be avoided in sickle cell disease?,General Anesthesia,Brachial Plexus Block,Intravenous Regional Anesthesia,Spinal Anesthesia,"Prevention of conditions that favor suckling is the basis of peri-operative management.

Supplemental oxygen is recommended during and after regional anesthesia/GA.
Circulatory stasis can be prevented with hydration and anticipation of intraoperative blood loss in order to avoid acute hypovolemia
Normothermia is desirable because hyperthermia increases the rate of gel formation, and hypothermia produces vasoconstriction that impairs organ blood flow.
The use of a tourniquet and hence Bier's block (intravenous regional anesthesia) is contraindicated because blood stasis can cause local acidosis, hypoxia with suckling of cells.
Drugs commonly used for anesthesia should not have significant effects on the suckling process.",C

All of the following statements about hormone replacement therapy (H) are true except ?,It increases the risk of coronary aery disease,It increases bone mineral density,It increases the risk of breast cancer,It increases the risk of endometrial cancer.,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., It increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of MI (coronary aery disease). The increased risk is attributed to progestin component. o H restore Ca++ balance, fuher bone loss is prevented and the excess fracture risk is nullified. o There is a higher incidence of breast cancer. o Risk for endometrial carcinoma is not increased as protective effect of progestin nullify the carcinogenic effect of estrogen. o There is increased risk for gall stone and migraine. o There is a small protective effective of H on colorectal cancer. Note :? o Usually in H combination of estrogen and progestin is given (combined H), except in hysterectimized women where estrogen alone is given. o With estrogen alone there is increased risk of endometrial cancer and decrease risk of coronary aery disease (as estrogen increases HDL and decreases LDL and triglyceride level). o So for H with estrogen alone the answer of this question will change. In that case it will be option 'a' i.e., increased risk of coronary aery disease.",D

First line of defence against tumour and virus?,NK cell,T cell,Histiocyte,Macrophage,"NK cells Ability to kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells NK cells act as an early line of defense against viral infections and some tumors. Two cell surface molecules, CD16 and CD56, are commonly used to identify NK cells. CD16 is an Fc receptor for IgG, and it confers on NK cells the ability to lyse IgG-coated target cells. This phenomenon is known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The functional activity of NK cells is regulated by a balance between signals from activating and inhibitory receptors NK cell inhibitory receptors recognize self-class I MHC molecules, which are expressed on all healthy cells. The inhibitory receptors prevent NK cells from killing normal cells. Virus infection or neoplastic transformation often enhances expression of ligands for activating receptors and at the same time reduces the expression of class I MHC molecules.",A

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic arthritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Lipoprotein - (a)

Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a).
An elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis.
How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis?
In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition).
So there is consistent deposition of fibrin.
Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plasminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in the reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen → Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system.
This enhances further fibrin deposition.
In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions.
So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C

"A 5-year-old boy is being evaluated for recurrent epistaxis and other abnormal bleeding episodes, including excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord at bih. Laboratory studies reveal the following: decreased hemoglobin (with microcytic hypochromic red cell indices), normal platelet count, markedly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT), and unmeasurable thrombin time (TT). Platelet aggregation studies reveal a normal platelet response to ristocetin, but with other substances (including collagen, ADP, and epinephrine), this patient's platelets exhibit a primary wave defect. Based on these findings, this patient most likely has",Afibrinogenemia,Bernard-Soulier syndrome,Glanzmann's thrombasthenia,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,"Platelet aggregation refers to platelets binding to other platelets. One mechanism for this involves fibrinogen, which can act as a molecular bridge between adjacent platelets by binding to GpIIb and GpIIIa receptors on the surface of platelets. Abnormalities of platelet aggregation (aggregation defects or primary wave defects) include Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and afibrinogenemia. Patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a deficiency of GpIIb-IIIa and defective platelet aggregation. Patients with low or no fibrinogen levels characteristically have prolonged PT, PTT, and TT values: in fact, they are so prolonged they are unmeasurable. In contrast to platelet aggregation, platelet secretion refers to the secretion of the contents of two types of granules within the platelet cytoplasm. a granules contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor, while dense bodies contain ADP, ionized calcium, histamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Decreased platelet secretion (activation defects) is seen with deficiencies of these granules; these diseases are called storage pool defects. They can involve either a granules (gray platelet syndrome) or dense bodies (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or TAR). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (small platelets), and immunodeficiency consisting of decreased levels of IgM and progressive loss of T cell function.These patients have recurrent infections with bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Which of the following immunologic defects is most likely to produce this disease?",Absence of adenosine deaminase,Abnormal CD40-CD40L interaction,Deletion of chromosome 22q11,HIV infection,"These are features of the hyper-IgM syndrome, which results from lack of isotype switching from IgM to other immunoglobulins. Patients are particularly susceptible to Pneumocystis and to bacterial infections. The abnormal IgM antibodies in excess can attach to circulating cells and lead to cytopenias. An absence of adenosine deaminase characterizes a form of severe combined immunodeficiency. The deletion of chromosome 22q11 is a feature of the DiGeorge anomaly, which affects T cell differentiation and maturation. HIV infection can be accompanied by opportunistic infections, particularly Pneumocystis, but abnormal immunoglobulin production generally is not seen.

True about MHC-class -,Not involved in innate immunity,Cytotoxic T-cell involved,Present in nucleated cells,Present in B-Cells,"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a set of cell surface proteins essential for the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in veebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2. In a cell, protein molecules of the host's own phenotype or of other biologic entities are continually synthesized and degraded. Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays a molecular fraction of a protein, called an epitope. The presented antigen can be either self or non-self, thus preventing an organism's immune system targeting its own cells. In its entirety, the MHC population is like a meter indicating the balance of proteins within the cell. The MHC gene family is divided into three subgroups: class I, class II, and class III. Class I MHC molecules have b2 subunits so can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors. Class II MHC molecules have b1 and b2 subunits and can be recognised by CD4 co-receptors. In this way MHC molecules chaperone which type of lymphocytes may bind to the given antigen with high affinity, since different lymphocytes express different TCR co-receptors. Diversity of antigen presentation, mediated by MHC classes I and II, is attained in at least three ways: (1) an organism's MHC repeoire is polygenic ( multiple, interacting genes); (2) MHC expression is codominant (from both sets of inherited alleles); MHC gene variants are highly polymorphic (diversely varying from organism to organism within a species). Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection has been observed in male mice making mate choices of females with different MHCs and thus demonstrating sexual selection. Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing which can combine peptides from different proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.[",A
"Hypersegmented neutrophils are a feature of: September 2011, March 2013",Hemosiderosis,Sideroblastic anemia,Megaloblastic anemia,Thalassemia,"Ans. C: Megaloblastic anemia The diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is based on leucopenia with hypersegmented granulocytes, a moderate to severe Megaloblastic anemia, elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in the serum and low serum vitamin B12. Hypersegmented neutrophil Normally, the number of segments in the nucleus of a neutrophil increases as it matures and ages, after being released into the blood from the bone marrow. Whereas normal neutrophils only contain three or four nuclear lobes (the ""segments""), hypersegmented neutrophils contain five or more lobes. Hypersegmented neutrophils have classically been thought to be pathognomonic of the megaloblastic anemias (anemias caused by failure of bone marrow blood-forming cells to make DNA, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies, or DNA-replication poisons). One of the earliest, notable changes in the peripheral blood in megaloblastic processes is the appearance of hypersegmented neutrophils. Because of the sho life-span of neutrophils, these abnormal hypersegmented neutrophils characteristically appear even before the onset of anemia in megaloblastic processes. Such neutrophils are less often seen in the other classes of anemia, which together are far more common than megaloblastic types of anemia. Note that pernicious anemia is a type of megaloblastic anemia, and as such, is expected to show hypersegmented neutrophils.",C

The greatest volume of gastric secretion occurs during:,Cephalic phase,Gastric phase,Intestinal phase,Deglutition,"B: The gastric phase is the period of greatest gastric secretion. This phase is responsible for the greatest volume of gastric secretions, and it is activated by the presence of food in the stomach.
A: The cephalic phase of stomach secretion is anticipatory and prepares the stomach to receive food. In the cephalic phase, sensations of taste, the smell of food, stimulation of tactile receptors during the process of chewing and swallowing, and pleasant thoughts of food stimulate centers within the medulla oblongata that influence gastric secretions.
C: The intestinal phase of gastric secretion primarily inhibits gastric secretions. It is controlled by the entrance of acidic chyme into the duodenum. The presence of chyme in the duodenum initiates both neural and hormonal mechanisms.

Anti GDla,AIDP,ASMAN,AMAN,Fisher syndrome,"Immunopathological studies suggest that the target of immune attack is different in the subtypes of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). In acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), the attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. In acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), the attack appears directed against a component of the Schwann cell. However, the nature of the antigenic targets is still not clear. We prospectively studied 138 Chinese GBS patients and found that IgG anti-GD1a antibodies were closely associated with AMAN but not AIDP. With a cutoff titer of greater than 1:100, 60% of AMAN versus 4% of AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies; with a cutoff titer of greater than 1:1,000, 24% of AMAN patients and none of the AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies. In contrast, low levels of IgG anti-GM1 antibodies (> 1:100) were detected in both the AMAN and the AIDP forms (57% vs 35%, NS). High titers of IgG anti-GM1 (>1:1,000) were more common in the AMAN form (24% vs 8%, NS). Serological evidence of recent Campylobacter infection was detected in 81% of AMAN and 50% of AIDP patients, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were common in both Campylobacter-infected and noninfected patients. Our results suggest that IgG anti-GD1a antibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of AMAN.",B

"A 25-year-old man involved in a motorcycle accident incurs a laceration to his thigh. The bleeding is stabilized en route to the hospital, but on arrival, he is noted to have orthostatic hypotension and his hematocrit is 21%. He receives 2 units of PRBCs. As the first unit is nearly finished transfusing, he becomes febrile and hypotensive. Urine output ceases. The serum above the clot in a red top phlebotomy tube is pink. Which of the following complications of transfusion has most likely occurred in this man?",Donor antibodies were directed against his granulocytes,Donor blood was contaminated with hepatitis C virus,Fluid overload led to congestive heart failure,Mislabeled specimens were processed in the laboratory,"The findings are those of a hemolytic (ABO) transfusion reaction, virtually all of which result from clerical errors. You learned that proper phlebotomy procedure requires labeling the tubes just after drawing the blood, not handing the tubes to someone else for labeling, and possible mix-up. This is not consistent with a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in which there are donor-derived HLA or granulocyte-specific antibodies in the recipient's blood product that is directed against antigens on the recipient WBCs. Though hepatitis C infection is still possible, but uncommon, from transfused blood, this infection has an incubation period of months.

Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2.5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2.5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",C

CEA is elevated in all of the following except:March 2007,Alcoholic cirrhosis,Ulcerative colitis,Carcinoma colon,Prostatic carcinoma,"Ans. D: Prostatic carcinomaAn elevated level of a tumor marker can indicate cancer; however, there can also be other causes of the elevation.Tumor markers can be produced directly by the tumor or by non-tumor cells as a response to the presence of a tumor. As used in oncology, they are as follows:- Screening for common cancers on a population basisExample: elevated prostate specific antigen suggests prostate cancer.- Monitoring of cancer survivors after treatmentExample: elevated AFP in a child previously treated for teratoma suggests relapse with endodermal sinus tumor.- Diagnosis of specific tumor types, paicularly in ceain brain tumors and other instances where biopsy is not feasible.Tumor markers can be classified in two groups: Cancer-specific markers and tissue-specific markers.- Cancer-specific markers:An example of a cancer-specific marker, CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a blood-borne protein, first noted to be produced by tumors of the gastrointestinal system. Fuher investigation showed that it was produced by the occasional lung and breast cancer case, meaning that an elevated level does not mean a bowel cancer. However, in a patient with a history of a treated bowel cancer, a rising CEA level can be an early sign of bowel cancer return.A sequence of steady low CEA readings can provide much needed reassurance to the post-operative patient. Also, a rising sequence of CEA readings should ale the physician to the need for diagnostic tests such as PET scans.- Tissue-specific markers:Tissue-specific markers are related to specific tissues which have developed cancer.Generally speaking, these substances are not specifically related to the tumor, and may be present at elevated levels when no cancer is present.Examples include PSA, beta-HCG - (Human chorionic gonadotropin), AFP - (Alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3 - (a lectin-reactive AFP) and Thyroglobulin.For example, if man has an elevated PSA, a search for prostate cancer will be undeaken.If an individual has an elevated level of beta-HCG, AFP or AFP-L3%, a search for a testicular or liver cancer, respectively, will be made.PSA (Prostate specific antigen) is produced by the normal prostate.It is a protein enzyme called a serine protease that usually acts as an anticoagulant to keep semen liquid. Only small amounts leak into the circulation in normal circumstances.Enlarged prostates leak more substantial amounts, and cancerous prostates also leak substantial amounts. o Beta-hCG: Elevated levels cannot prove the presence of a tumor, and low levels do not rule it out (an exception is in males who do not naturally produce beta-hCG).Neveheless, elevated beta-hCG levels fall after successful treatment (e.g. surgical intervention or chemotherapy) and a recurrence can often be detected by the finding of rising levels.",D

Overall incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma is falling. On the other hand, cancer of gastric cardia is on the rise. This is probably related to Barrett esophagus and may reflex the increasing incidence of chronic GERD and obesity.
The remarkable decrease in gastric incidence applies only to intestinal type. As a result, the incidences of intestinal and diffuse types of gastric cancer are now similar.",B
"A 32-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic renal failure manifests rapidly progressive weakness. On physical examination, she appears pale and has slightly yellow sclerae and an enlarged spleen. Blood tests reveal severe anemia and mild, mostly unconjugated, hyperbilirubinemia. Coombs test is positive at 37 C but negative at 0-4 C. This patient developed anemia because of?",Bone marrow aplasia,IgG directed against red blood cells,IgM directed against red blood cells,Renal failure,"First, what type of anemia is it? It must be a hemolytic form, since it is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (hence the yellow sclerae), resulting from increased destruction of red blood cells. Increased erythrocyte destruction is the cause (not the effect) of splenomegaly. Fuhermore, a positive Coombs test implies that hemolysis is mediated by antibodies attached to red blood cells. Thus, the correct choice must be either IgG or IgM. Since the Coombs test is positive at warm temperature (37 C), the antibody is a warm agglutinin. Warm agglutinins are viually always of IgG type and may be triggered by a variety of disorders, including lymphomas, drugs, and autoimmune diseases such as SLE. IgG-coated red cells are then sequestered by the spleen, where hemolysis occurs, thus explaining splenomegaly. By contrast, cold agglutinins are IgM and can be demonstrated by Coombs test at cold temperature (0-4 C). Cold agglutinins are usually triggered by Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection or lymphomas. Note: Bone marrow aplasia is due to failure or suppression of myeloid stem cells, with decreased production of red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes (pancytopenia). Most commonly, this condition is caused by chemical agents (especially drugs such as chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, alkylating agents, and antimetabolites) or total body irradiation. Renal failure causes normochromic, normocytic anemia because of decreased synthesis of erythropoietin. Erythropoietin administration is currently the standard treatment for this form of anemia. Although renal failure is a frequent consequence of SLE, there is no evidence that it plays a role in this patient's anemia. Ref: Reid M.E. (2010). Chapter 137. Erythrocyte Antigens and Antibodies.

A patient with recent-onset primary generalized epilepsy develops drugs reaction and skin rash due to Phenytoin sodium. The most appropriate course of action is:,Shift to clonazepam,Resta phenytoin sodium after 2 weeks,Shift to sodium Valproate,Shift to Ethosuximide,"Hypersensitivity reaction to a drug mandates its discontinuation. Phenytoin is being used for control of GTCS. Valproate can be substituted for Phenytoin because it is equally effective against GTCS. Ethosuximide is useful only against absence seizures whereas clonazepam is used to control acute attacks only. Therefore, best course is to change the drug from Phenytoin to valproate. ref: KD Tripathi 8th ed.",C

A serum IgE level and WBC count are normal. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism that contributes to the findings in his illness?",Accumulation of alveolar neutrophilic exudate,Bronchial hyperreactivity to chronic inflammation,Emigration of eosinophils into bronchi,Hyperresponsiveness to Aspergillus spores,"This history is typical of nonatopic, or intrinsic, asthma. There is no family history of asthma, no eosinophilia, and a normal serum IgE level. The fundamental abnormality in such cases is bronchial hyperresponsiveness (i.e., the threshold of bronchial spasm is intrinsically low). When airway inflammation occurs after viral infections, the bronchial smooth muscle spasms, and an asthmatic attack occurs. Such bronchial hyperreactivity also may be triggered by inhalation of air pollutants, such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxides. Even exercise and cold air may act as a trigger. Accumulation of neutrophils is typical of bacterial pneumonia, which could follow viral infection, but lead to lung consolidation. Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis refers to colonization of asthmatic airways by Aspergillus, which is followed by development of additional IgE antibodies. Secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 by type 2 helper T cells also occurs in cases of allergic asthma.",B

These are the esters of choline and may be natural alkaloids (ACh, muscarine, nicotine, pilocarpine and arecoline) or synthetic derivatives (methacoline, carbachol and bethanechol).

Acetylcholine is not used clinically, because it is metabolized very quickly by cholinesterases in the plasma and is not effective even by i.v. route.
Methacholine has maximum action on myocardium. It can be given inhalationally for the diagnosis of bronchial hyper-reactivity in patients who do not have clinically apparent asthma - methacholine challenge test.
Bethanechol is mainly used for its action on urinary bladder and has no nicotinic activity.

Unlike atherosclerosis, the smaller coronary artery branches are preferentially affected, but the result is the same: ischemic damage. The inflammation that may come from rejection is not a risk for amyloid deposition. A transplanted heart does not have a functional pericardial sac, and though there may be some fibrous adhesions following surgery, they are not constrictive. Transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy have immune dysregulation that increases the risk for both carcinomas and lymphoid malignancies, but these are unlikely to involve the heart.

Fuhermore, a biopsy confirms the benign nature of the lesion and demonstrates numerous Helicobacter pylori bacilli. Which of the following would be the most effective pharmacotherapy?",Aluminum or magnesium-containing antacid,H2-receptor blocking agent,Prostaglandin analog,Proton pump inhibitor plus antibiotic,"The gross specimen shows a typical peptic ulcer of the first poion of the duodenum. The great majority of these ulcers are associated with chronic H. pylori infection, which plays a pathogenetic role. Eradication of H. pylori is necessary not only for rapid healing of active ulcers, but also to prevent future recurrence. Therefore, drugs that eradicate this gram-negative bacillus are used for treatment of active peptic ulcer disease. Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole or lansoprazole) also have activity against H. pylori, but alone are not sufficient to achieve eradication. This treatment must be combined with at least one of the antibiotics (usually two) that are effective against H. pylori. Clarithromycin is usually used in combination with either metronidazole or amoxicillin. Aluminum or magnesium-containing antacids are probably the most common over-the-counter medications used by patients with peptic ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux for prompt relief of epigastric pain and discomfo. These drugs are no longer recommended as first-line agents for treatment of peptic disease nor do they have anti-H. pylori activity. H2-receptor blocking agents, including cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine are not effective in eradicating H. pylori infection. However, they provide rapid symptomatic relief and promote ulcer healing. Prostaglandin analogs (e.g. misoprostol) are used exclusively as prophylactic agents to prevent NSAIDs-induced ulcers, not as a standard treatment of peptic ulcers.

These antigens can be made the target of chemotherapies. Specific antibodies have been developed against these cell surface receptors. Because the antibodies were produced from one cell that was grown into a clone of identical cells it is called monoclonal antibody. These antibodies were originally developed as mice antibody but because human have immune reactions to mouse proteins, these antibodies are usually chimerized or humanized when used as therapeutic reagents. i.e., the antibodies have both human and mouse component. These antibodies kill the cells by following mechanism :? - Antibody dependent cellular toxicity - Complement dependent cytotoxicity - Diret induction of apoptosis However, the clinically relevant mechanism still remains unceain. Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Herceptin is a humanized antibody and is used in breast cancers which are HER2 positive. (Major poion of it is composed of human component and a small pa is composed of mouse protein). HER2 stands for --4 human epidermal growth factor receptor. HER2 gene produces HER2 protein also called HER2 receptor. The HER2 protein is found on the surface of some normal cells in the body. In normal cells HER2 protein help send growth signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell. These signals tell the cell to grow and divide. In HER2 (+ve) breast cancer the cancer cells have abnormally high number of HER2 genes per cell when this happens too much HER2 protein appears on the surface of these cancer cells. This is called HER2 protein over expression. Too much HER2 protein is thought to cause cancer cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Herceptin acts in two ways a) Herceptin attaches to HER2+ cancer cells and stimulates the bodys immune system to target the HER2+ cancer cells b) Herceptin attaches itself to the HER2 receptors on the surface and blocks them from receiving the signals. Herceptin also acts by antibody dependent cell c) mediated cytotoxicity.

"In hemophiliac patients, which of the following should not be given?",Factor VIII concentrate,Cryoprecipitate,EACA,Platelet factor,"Antifibrinolytic Drugs:
Bleeding in the gum, gastrointestinal tract, and during oral surgery requires the use of oral antifibrinolytic drugs such as ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) or tranexamic acid to control local hemostasis. The duration of the treatment depending on the clinical indication is 1 week or longer. Tranexamic acid is given at doses of 25 mg/kg three to four times a day. EACA treatment requires a loading dose of 200 mg/kg (maximum of 10 g) followed by 100 mg/Kg per dose (maximum 30 g/d) every 6h.
General considerations regarding the treatment of bleeds in hemophilia include the following: (1) Treatment should begin as soon as possible because symptoms often precede objective evidence of bleeding; because of the superior efficacy of early therapeutic intervention, classic symptoms of bleeding into the joint in a reliable patient, headaches, or automobile or other accidents require prompt replacement and further laboratory investigation, (2) Drugs that hamper platelet function, such as aspirin or aspirin containing drugs, should be avoided; to control pain, drugs such as ibuprofen or propoxyphene are preferred. FVIII and FIX are dosed in units. One unit is defined as the amount of FVIII (100 ng/mL) or FIX (5 μg/mL) in 1 mL of normal plasma. One unit of FVIII per kilogram of body weight increases the plasma level by 2%. One can calculate the dose needed to increase FVIII levels to 100% in a 70-kg severe hemophilia patient (<1%) using the simple formula below. Thus, 3500 units of FVIII will raise the circulating level to 100%.
FVIII dose (IU) = Target FVIII levels – FVIII baseline levels x Body weight (kg) x 0.5 unit/kg.
The doses for FIX replacement are different from those for FVIII, because FIX recover after infusion is usually only 50% of the predicted value. Therefore, the formula for FIX replacement is as follows:
FIX dose (IU) = Target FIX levels – FIX baseline levels x Body weight (Kg) x 1 unit/Kg.
The FVIII half-life of 8-12 h requires injections twice a day to maintain therapeutic levels, whereas the FIX half-life is longer, 24 h, so that once-a-day injection is sufficient. In specific situations such as after surgery, continuous infusion of factor may be desirable because of its safety in achieving sustained factor levels at a lower total cost. Cryoprecipitate is enriched with FVIII protein (each bag contains 80 IU of FVIII) and was commonly used for the treatment of hemophilia A decades ago; it is still in use in some developing countries, but because of the risk of bloodborne diseases, this product should be avoided in hemophilia patients when factor concentrates are available.

Mutation of which of the following gene is most impoant in paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria-,Decay accelerating factor (DAF),Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL),Glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI),CD8 binding protein,"in PNH ,these GPI(Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol) -linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutations that inactivate PIGA.PIGA is X linked and subject to lyonisation.PNH stems from acquired mutations in gene PIGA, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG), a membrane anchor that is a component of many proteins. Without the ""PIG-tail,"" these proteins cannot be expressed on the cell surface. The affected proteins include several that limit the activation of complement. As a result, PIGA-deficient precursors give rise to red cells that are inordinately sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. Leukocytes are also deficient in these protective pro- teins, but nucleated cells are generally less sensitive to com- plement than are red cells, and as a result the red cells take the brunt of the attack. The paroxysmal nocturnal hemolysis that gives the disorder its name occurs because the fixation of complement is enhanced by the slight decrease in blood pH that accompanies sleep (owing to CO2 retention). However, most patients present less dramatically with anemia due to chronic low-level hemolysis. Another complication that is often serious and sometimes fatal is venous throm- bosis. The etiopathogenesis of the prothrombotic state is somehow also related to the activity of the complement membrane attack complex, as inhibitors of this complex (described below) greatly lessen the incidence of thrombosis. Because PIGA is X-linked, normal cells have only a single active PIGA gene, mutation of which is sufficient to give rise to PIGA deficiency. Because all myeloid lineages are affected in PNH, the responsible mutations must occur in an early myeloid progenitor with self-renewal capacity. Remarkably, many normal individuals harbor small numbers of bone marrow cells bearing PIGA mutations identical to those that cause PNH. It is believed that clinically evident PNH occurs only in rare instances in which the PIGA mutant clone has a survival advantage. One setting in which this may be true is in primary bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), which most often appears to be caused by immune-mediated destruction or suppression of marrow stem cells. It is hypoth- esized that PIGA-deficient stem cells somehow escape the immune attack and eventually replace the normal marrow elements. Targeted therapy with an antibody that inhibits the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex is effective at diminishing both the hemolysis and the thrombotic complications, but also places patients at high risk for Neisseria infections, includ- ing meningococcal sepsis.

True about salivary gland tumour is:,MEC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,ACC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,MEC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,ACC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,"Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma is predicated by the location, histopathologic grade, and clinical stage of the tumor. Early-stage tumors of the parotid often can be treated by subtotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Advanced tumors may necessitate total removal of the parotid gland, with sacrifice of the facial nerve. Submandibular gland tumors are treated by assured surgical excision. For low-grade neoplasms, only a modest margin of surrounding normal tissue may need to be removed, but high-grade or tumors warrant wider resection, similar to that required for squamous cell carcinomas. If there is underlying bone destruction, then the involved bone must be excised. 
 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a relentless tumor that is prone to local recurrence and eventual distant metastasis. Surgical resection is usually the treatment of choice. Adjuvant radiation therapy may slightly improve patient survival in some cases, although recent SEER data suggest that radiation therapy does little to improve prognosis overall. Because metastasis to regional lymph nodes is uncommon (6% to 10% of cases), neck dissection usually is not indicated.

"Drug of choice for status epilepticus is: September 2011, March 2013",Valproate,Phenytoin,Lorazepam,Carbamazepine,"Ans. C: Lorazepam Intravenous Lorazepam is now the treatment of choice for controlling seizures in status epilepticus Status epilepticus/SE It is a life-threatening condition in which the brain is in a state of persistent seizure. Definitions vary, but traditionally it is defined as one continuous unremitting seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than 5 minutes. It is always considered a medical emergency. There is some evidence that 5 minutes is sufficient to damage neurons and that seizures are unlikely to self-terminate by that time. The moality rate of status epilepticus has the potential to be quite high (at least 20%), especially if treatment is not initiated quickly. Only 25 percent of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have epilepsy. Causes include: - Stroke - Hemorrhage - Insufficient dosage of a medication already prescribed to the patient. Such causes of this include: Forgetfulness on the pa of the patient in taking scheduled doses, or failure to take doses at the scheduled times Taking medicine at wrong times as a result of a time zone change while traveling Dislike of the medication or its side effects - Sudden withdrawal from a seizure medication. Such causes include: - Consumption of alcoholic beverages while on an anticonvulsant, or alcohol withdrawal. Dieting or fasting while on an anticonvulsant - Staing on a new medication that reduces the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant - Developing a resistance to an anticonvulsant already being used Gastroenteritis while on an anticonvulsant. This is because the digestive system may force out the anticonvulsant, thereby rendering the body with a lack of protection - Metabolic disturbances--such as affected kidney and liver Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories -- convulsive and nonconvulsive, the latter of which is underdiagnosed The benzodiazepine of choice is lorazepam for initial treatment due to its relatively long (2-8 hour) duration of action when injected, and its rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and to its low lipid solubility which causes it to remain in the vascular compament.

The keys to diagnosis are the location within soft tissue, calcification beginning at the periphery, and decrease in size over time. Gouty tophi can form in soft tissues, but there is typically a history of gouty arthritis first, and the lesions do not calcify. A hem- arthrosis forms with joint trauma and hemorrhage in and around the joint capsule, but does not involve calcification. An osteochondroma is a bony exostosis projecting from bone into soft tissue. An osteosarcoma that rarely arises in soft tissue must be distinguished from myositis ossificans; the latter is characterized by the mature shell of bone, lack of enlargement, and lack of bone or soft-tissue destruction.

Endometrium and cervical mucus may be modified.* The chief use of clomiphene is for infertility due to failure of ovulation: 50 mg once daily for 5 days starting from 5th day of cycle. Treatment is given monthly. Conception occurs in many women who previously were amenorrhoeic or had anovular cycles.* If 1-2 months treatment does not result in conception--the daily dose may be doubled for 2-3 cycles. No more than 6 treatment cycles should be tried.* The antiestrogenic effect of clomiphene on developing follicle, endometrium or cervical mucus can be counterproductive. Luteal phase dysfunction has also been blamed for therapeutic failures.* Addition of menotropins or chorionic gonadotropin on the last 2 days of the course improves the success rate.* Clomiphene is well absorbed orally, gets deposited in adipose tissue and has long t1/2 of ~6 days.

On electron microscopy in most of the cases characteic slpiiting of GBM with subepithelial deposits in few cases is seen in,RPGN,Membranous nephropathy,FSGS,Minimal change disease,"Refer Robbins page no 915By light microscopy the glomeruli either appear normal in the early stages of the disease or exhibit uniform, diffuse thick- ening of the glomerular capillary wall (Fig. 20-12A). By electron microscopy the thickening is seen to be caused by irregular electron dense also deposits containing immune com- plexes between the basement membrane and the overlying epithelial cells, with effacement of podocyte foot processes (Fig. 20-12B and D). Basement membrane material is laid down between these deposits, appearing as irregular spikes protrud- ing from the GBM. These spikes are best seen by silver stains, which color the basement membrane, but not the deposits, black. In time, these spikes thicken to produce domelike protru- sions and eventually close over the immune deposits, burying them within a markedly thickened, irregular membrane. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that the granu- lar deposits contain both immunoglobulins and complement (Fig. 20-12C).

Cytochrome b5 (cyb5) can also contribute reducing power to this system after being reduced by cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R).Mitochondrial P450 systems, that employ adrenodoxin reductase and adrenodoxin to transfer electrons from NADPH to P450.Bacterial P450 systems, that employ a ferredoxin reductase and a ferredoxin to transfer electrons to P450.CYB5R/cyb5/P450 systems in which both electrons required by the CYP come from cytochrome b5.FMN/Fd/P450 systems originally found in Rhodococcus sp. in which a FMN-domain- containing reductase is fused to the CYP.P450 only systems, which do not require external reducing power.

CGRP antagonistRef: Katzung's Basic and Clinical Pharmacology 13th/ed, p308Explanation# Calcitonin family of peptides includes:# Calcitonin# Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)# Adrenomedullin# Amylin# CGRP# Widely distributed: Largely in the C-cells of the thyroid gland, also found in CNS (central nervous system), PNS (peripheral nervous system), CVS (cardiovascular system), RS (respiratory system) and GIT (gastrointestinal tract).# CGRP-containing neuronal fibers are more abundant around arteries than around veins and in atria than in ventricles.# This peptide has vasodilatory property, in fact CGRP is the most potent vasodilator yet discovered.# When injected in systemic circulation, it causes hypotension and tachycardia.# When injected into CNS, it causes hypertension and suppression of feeding.# Release of CGRP from trigeminal nerves plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Selective serotonin agonist (triptans) normalizes CGRP levels.# CGRP antagonists though have not yet received FDA approval have shown promising results in trials for migraine. Antagonists developed are:- Olcegepant- Telcagepant# Note the name olcegepant: Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist.# These drugs are non-peptide antagonist.# Two primary hypotheses to explain the actions of antimigraine drugs are:# First, The triptans, ergot alkaloids, and antidepressants may activate 5-HT1D/1B receptors on presynaptic trigeminal nerve endings, thereby inhibiting the release of vasodilating peptides, (option b) and antiseizure agents may suppress excessive firing of these nerve endings (option d).# Second, the vasoconstrictor actions of direct 5-HT agonists (the triptans and ergot) may prevent vasodilation and stretching of the pain endings. It is possible that both mechanisms contribute in the case of some drugs.# Option a: Triptans (sumatriptan is 5 HT agonist).# Option b: CGRP itself is vasodilating peptide and olcegepant is CGRP antagonist. The triptans, ergot alkaloids, and antidepressants act by inhibiting the release of vasodilating peptides.# Option d: Antiseizure drugs like valproic acid and topiramate are useful in treatment of migraine, they reduce the excessive firing by trigeminal neurons.",C

The diagnosis of CF is most reliably made by the demonstration of increased concentrations of electrolytes in the sweat. The decreased chloride conductance characteristic of CF results in a failure of chloride reabsorption by the cells of the sweat gland ducts and, hence, to the accumulation of sodium chloride in the sweat. All of the pathologic consequences of CF can be attributed to the presence of abnormally thick mucus. Lack of pancreatic enzyme secretion in patients with CF causes malabsorption and foul-smelling fatty stools (steatorrhea). The other choices do not address the underlying cause of malabsorption in patients with CF.Diagnosis: Cystic fibrosis",D

Cell mediated reaction o It is mediated by T cells o T cell recognizes graft by two pathway. A) Direct Pathway o Ceain cells in the graft express HLA antigen, of these dendritic cells (antigen presenting cells) in the transplant is paicularly impoant. o That means, T cells of the recipient recognize antigen (HLA protein) on the antigen presenting cells of the transplant (donor tissue). o Two types of cells are involved in this pathway. (i) CD-4 T cells --> Recognize HLA-II on antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells) and differentiate into Till cells that secretes cytokines. These cytokines induce inflammatory reaction with local accumulation of mononuclear cells paicularly macrophages which destroye the graft tissue. (ii) CD-8 T cells Recognize HLA-I on APCs and differentiate into cytotoxic-T cells that kill the graft tissue by ---> (i) Perforin - granzyme - dependent killing or (ii) Fas-fas ligand dependent killing. B) Indirect pathway o In this pathway HLA molecule of the graft tissue is taken up by antigen presenting cells of the recepient and is presented to CD4 T cells of the recipient. CD-4 T cells become activated and destroy the graft. o In this pathway cytotoxic CD-8 T cells are not involved. o The direct pathway is the major pathway in acute cellular rejection, whereas the indirect pathway is more impoant in chronic rejection.",A

Focal diffuse gall bladder wall thickening with comet tail reverberation artefacts on USG is in -,Adenomyomatosis of gall bladder,Ca gall bladder,Adenomatous polyps,Xantho granuloma,"Cholecystoses 

Cholecystoses are a group of noninflammatory conditions of the gallbladder wall. cholecystoses can be divided into hyperplastic and thesaurismotic (accumulating forms). The hyperplastic forms are characterized by normal growth of the wall components, while thesaurismotic forms accumulate deposite of organic and inorganic material in the gall bladder wall.
The common forms of cholecystoses are Adenomyomatosis, cholesterosis and porcelain gall bladder.

1) Adenomyomatosis : - Ademomyomatosis is the most common form of cholecystoses. It is characterized by segmental or diffuse thickening of mucosa and muscular wall. In the thickened wall, more specifically, small cystic spaces are present, representing the dilated Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus. The most frequent site of the segment form is the gall bladder fundus. The sonographic signs are an irregular profile of the internal mucosa and wall thickening, in which may be seen hypoechoic cyst like zones corresponding to Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses. These cystic zones may contain debris or little stones, have an acoustic shadow or, more frequently, a comet tail artefact, which is considered a specific finding. USG findings in brief are : -

Hyperechoic thickening of bladder wall.
Hypoechoic cyst in the wall
Acoustic shadow
Convent tail artefact

2) Cholesterosis: - There are deposits of cholesterol in the epithelial cells and in the submucosal macrophages. This gives the appearance of multiple small yellow spots on a red hyperplastic muscosa, the strawberry gallbladder. Cholesterosis may be : -
i) Diffuse & micronodular (Nodule < 1 mm)
ii) Focal (nodules > 3 mm)

SIADH is caused by all EXCEPT:,Vincristine,Vinblastine,Actinomycin D,Cyclophosphamide,"Actinomycin D (Dactinomycin) :It is a very potent antineoplastic drug, highly efficacious in Wilms&; tumour and rhabdomyosarcoma. It has also produced good results in Mtx resistant choriocarcinoma and few other malignancies. Prominent adverse effects are vomiting, stomatitis, Vincristine ( oncovin): It is a rapidly acting drug, very useful for inducing remission in childhood acute leukaemia, but is not good for maintenance therapy. Other indications are lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin&;s disease, Wilms&; tumour, Ewing&;s sarcoma and carcinoma lung. Prominent adverse effects are peripheral neuropathy and alopecia. Bone marrow depression is minimal. diarrhoea, erythema and desquamation of skin, alopecia and bone marrow depression. Vinblastine: It is primarily employed with other drugs in Hodgkin&;s disease and testicular carcinoma. Bone marrow depression is more prominent while neurotoxicity and alopecia are less marked than with vincristine. Cyclophosphamide: It is inactive as such produces few acute effects and is not locally damaging. Transformation into active metabolites (aldophosphamide, phosphoramidemustard) occurs in the liver, and a wide range of anti tumour actions is exeed. It has prominent immunosuppressant propey. Thus, it is one of the most popular anticancer drugs. It is less damaging to platelets, but alopecia and cystitis (due to another metabolite acrolein) are prominent. Chloramphenicol retards the metabolism of cyclophosphamide. Hyponatremia is a common potential complication in cancer patients. It can be related to anticancer medical therapy. Vincristine, vinblastine, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide are the chemotherapeutic agents most frequently associated with hyponatremia. More recently, analogs such as carboplatin and ifosfamide have also been. incriminated. Hyponatremia is also associated with new immunomodulators (interferon, interleukin-2 and levamisole) and monoclonal antibodies. The mechanism by which all these drugs act on the sodium steady state is only paially known.

Defective phagolysosome formation is a feature of ___________.,Chronic granulomatus disease,Chediak-Higashi syndrome,Fanconi Anemia,Ataxia telangiectasia,"Chediak-Higashi  syndrom:

Chediak-Higashi  syndrome  is  characterized  by  defective fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes, resulting in defective phagocyte function and susceptibility to infections. 
The  main  leukocyte  abnormalities  are  neutropenia, defective degranulation, and delayed microbial killing. 
The  affected  leukocytes  contain  giant  granules,  which are  readily  seen  in  peripheral  blood  smears  and  are thought to result from aberrant phagolysosome fusion.
In  addition,  there  are  abnormalities  in  melanocytes (leading to albinism), cells of the nervous system (associated with nerve defects), and platelets (causing bleeding disorders) The gene associated with this disorder encodes a large cytosolic protein called LYST, which is believed to regulate lysosomal trafficking.

An abscess is surrounded by an acute inflammatory response composed of a fibrinous exudate, oedema and the cells of acute inflammation. Granulation tissue (macrophages, fibroblasts and new blood vessel proliferation) forms later around the suppurative process and leads to collagen deposition. If it is not drained or resorbed completely, a chronic abscess may result. If it is partly sterilised with antibiotics, an antibioma may form.

Which of the is not a channelopathy -,Cystic fibrosis,Liddles syndrome,Tay-sach's disease,Hypokaelemic periodic paralysis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Tay-Sach's disease Ion channels provide pores for the passive diffusion of ions across biological membranes.They are often highly selective for a particular ionic species, leading to a classification into sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl)and unspecific cation channels. Ion channels serve many functions apart from electrical signal transduction: chem ical signalling (Ca2+as a second messenger), transepithelial transport, regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentration and pH, and regulation of cell volume. Therefore, ion channel dysfunction can cause diseases in many tissues.The list of human diseases known to be associated with defects in ion channels has grown considerably during the past years.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aspergillosis,Polyaeritis nodosa,Renal carcinoma metastatic to the lung,Wegener's granulomatosis,"While in real life, other diseases (or combinations of diseases) may occasionally cause concurrent pulmonary, sinus, and renal involvement, if you see this pattern on a test question, you should immediately think of Wegener's granulomatosis. This is a rare focal necrotizing vasculitis of still unclear etiology, which also features prominent granulomas, some of which are centered on the vascular lesions. The vasculitis and granulomatous can involve the entire respiratory tract, and an easily obtained nasal biopsy may sometimes yield the diagnosis. The renal involvement is usually in the form of a necrotizing glomerulonephritis. The disease typically affects middle aged men, and its formerly poor prognosis has been improved by coicosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy. Note: Aspergillosis can cause prominent lung disease, but does not usually have renal involvement. Polyaeritis nodosa is a possibility, but usually spares the lungs.

Which of the following type of necrosis is seen in blood vessel due to immune complex mediated damage?,Coagulative necrosis,Liquefactive necrosis,Fibrinoid necrosis,Caseous necrosis,"Fibrinoid necrosis is a special form of necrosis usually seen in immune reactions involving blood vessels. This pattern of necrosis typically occurs when complexes of antigens and antibodies are deposited in the walls of aeries. Deposits of these ""immune complexes,"" together with fibrin that has leaked out of vessels, result in a bright pink and amorphous appearance in H&E stains, called ""fibrinoid"" (fibrin-like) by pathologists. Seen in Type III hypersensitivity, microscopic polyangiitis, vegetation of Libman Sack Endocarditis, malignant hypeension. Coagulative necrosis is a form of necrosis in which the architecture of dead tissues is preserved for a span of at least some days . The affected tissues exhibit a firm texture. Ischemia caused by obstruction in a vessel may lead to coagulative necrosis of the supplied tissue in all organs except the brain. A localized area of coagulative necrosis is called an infarct. Liquefactive necrosis, in contrast to coagulative necrosis, is characterized by digestion of the dead cells, resulting in transformation of the tissue into a liquid viscous mass. It is seen in focal bacterial or, occasionally, fungal infections, because microbes stimulate the accumulation of leukocytes and the liberation of enzymes from these cells. \The necrotic material is frequently creamy yellow because of the presence of dead leukocytes and is called pus. For unknown reasons, hypoxic death of cells within the central nervous system often manifests as liquefactive necrosis. Caseous necrosis is encountered most often in foci of tuberculous infection. The term ""caseous"" (cheeselike) is derived from the friable white appearance of the area of necrosis. On microscopic examination, the necrotic area appears as a structureless collection of fragmented or lysed cells and amorphous granular debris enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border; this appearance is characteristic of a focus of inflammation known as a granuloma",C

Therefore,it is a case of biphenotypic leukemia (mixed phenotypic leukemia). o Biphenotypic leukemia is a subtype of ""leukemia of ambiguous lineage"" (a new class of AML which has been added in 18th/e of Harrison. But in Harrison, detailed description of this class has not been given.. Acute leukemia with Ambiguous lineage 3 Human acute leukemias are broadly classified as myeloid or lymphoid according to the expression of surface and/or cytoplasmic antigens. o Uncommonly, the lineage of origin is not clear ; either two separate blast populations are encountered, one myeloid and other lymphoid, or a single blast population demonstrating evidence of both myeloid and lymphoid differentiation concurrently. o Acute leukemia with ambiguous lineage has following subtypes :-. A) Acute undifferentiated leukemia In this leukemia, the blast cells express none of the antigen that are useful in lineage attribution but rather express only markers that are linked to high stages of immaturity such as CD 34, CD 38 and HLA-DR and at times CD 7. B) Mixed phenotypic acute leukemia In this type of leukemia, immunological marker of more than one lineage are present. This is classifed intoi) Bilinear acute leukemia o In this, two separate blast populations are encountered. o For example blast cells of lymphoid and myeloid lineage are present simultaneously. n) Biphenotypic acute leukemia o Bipheotypic acute leukemia is also called "" hybrid acute leukemia"" or "" acute mixed lineage leukemia"" or ""simultaneous leukemia'. o In this leukemia, a single blast population demonstrates marker of more than one lineage (in contrast to bilinear leukemia where blasts of two different lineage are present). o Coexpression of myeloid with B lymphoid lineage is most common type (65%). Co-presence of myeloid with T-lymphoid lineage is second most common type. Co-expression of T and B cells phenotype or trilineage phenotype (T, B and myeloid cells) is rare. o According to the 2008 WHO classification, the requirements for lineage attribution are as follows :? a) Myeloid lineage :- Presence of myeloperoxidase or at least 2 markers of monocytic differentiation CD11c, CD 14, CD64, lysozyme, non-specific esterase b) T lineage :- Cytoplasmic or surface CD3 c) B lineage :- Strong CD19 expression with at least one of the following weakly expressed CD 10, CD 79a, cytoplasmic CD22; or weak CD 19 expression with at least 2 of the following strongly expressed CD 10, CD 79a, cytoplasmic CD22. Clinical presentation o Similar to other acute leukemias, acute leukemia with ambiguous lineage presents with symptoms related to depression of marrow function, i.e., cytopenia i.e. anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. Coming back to question o Expression of B lineage (CD19 with CD 10) and myeloid lineage ( myeloperoxidase) confirms the diagnosis of biphenotypic leukemia.",D

Xenobiotics are metabolized to ?,Increase water solubility,Increase lipid solubility,Make them nonpolar,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increase water solubility BIOTRANSFORMATION (METABOLISM) Most of the drugs are treated by the body as foreign substances (xenobiotics). Like other foreign substances (xenobiotics), body tries to eliminate drugs by various mechanisms for ridding itself of chemical intruders. Biotransformation means chemical alteration of the drug in the body. Why drug transformation is necessary ? Kidney plays a pivotal role in terminating the activity of drugs. For renal excretion the drug tends to be polar (lipid insoluble/water soluble) so that it can not diffuse back from tubular lumen and can be excreted. But pharmacologically active organic molecules (drugs) tend to be lipophlic (nonpolar) and remains unionized or only paially ionized at physiological pH. Biotransformation is needed to render nonpolar (lipid soluble) compounds polar (water soluble) so that they are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreted. Sites and processes of biotransformation Primary site of drug metabolism is liver, others are - kidney, intestine, lung and plasma. Biotransformation of drugs may lead to :- Active metabolite from an active drug Many drugs are paially conveed to one or more active metabolites. The effects observed are the sumtotal of that due to the parent drug and its active metabolite. Activation of inactive drugs Few drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites. Such a drug is called prodrug.",A

Which is not a 2nd generation antihistaminic ?,Loraudine,Acrivastatine,Cyclizine,None of the above,"Cyclizine Histamine is a naturally occuring amine. It is found in most body tissues but is predominantly secreted by mast cells. Histamine acts as a local hormone (autacoid) i.e. it acts within the immediate vicinity of its release. It main physiological effects are on: Blood vessels ? - Aerioles are dilated - Capillary permeability is increased Smooth muscles -- Cause contraction of the smooth muscles G.I.T. -- Increase gastric acid secretion Histamine acts through two receptors - H1 --> mediates edema and vascular effects of Histamine - H2 --> mediates effect on gastic secretion. Hi receptor antagonists : T- hey are classified in two types (i) First generation antihistamines (ii) Second generation antihistamines The term antihistamine is unsatisfactory for the first generation or older generation antihistamine because besides blocking histamine receptors, they also show considerable blocking activity against - muscarinins receptors - serotonin receptors - a adrenergic receptors They also enter the brain readily and cause sedation. Because of their non-specificity and their highly sedative action, they have a great tendency to cause serious adverse effect. Because of these disadvantages, second generation antihistamines were developed which are more selective for H1 receptor and largely free of antimuscarinic and antiadrenergic activity.

Coombs test (Ref: Robbins 9/e p643-644; Chandrasoma and Taylor 3/e p401)History of jaundice in a 23-year old female with pallor and spherocytes in peripheral blood points towards the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA):Onset is very often abrupt and can be dramatic.The hemoglobin level can drop, within days, to as low as 4g/dL; the massive red cell removal will produce jaundice, and often the spleen will be enlarged. When this triad is present, the suspicion of AIHA must be high.The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).AIHA is diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies with the direct antiglobulin (direct Coombs') test.IgG is present in warm antibody hemolytic anemia, and C3 (C3b and C3d) in cold antibody disease.Reticulocyte count is increased in both hereditary spherocytosis and AIHA.Osmotic Fragility Test is used to evaluate hemolytic anemia, especially hereditary spherocytosis, and immune hemolytic states.Test for PNH:PNH will present with hemoglobinuria.Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia:Low hemoglobinRaised LDHRaised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells)Raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin)Decreased levels of haptoglobinThe direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as antibodies do not cause the hemolysis in PNH.Warm antibody hemolytic anemiaCold antibody hemolytic anemia* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) at body temperature (37deg C)* These antibodies are called warm antibodies and are nearly IgGQ* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) better at temperature lower than 37degC* These antibodies are called reactive antibodies and are usually IgM* Rarely IgG antibodies e.g. The Donath Landsteiner antibody of Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria)QCausesCauses1.

About 5% to 8% of obese adults have a mutation in the MC4R gene, and even though there are abundant fat stores and plenty of leptin, the lack of MC4R to drive energy consumption leads to weight gain. Leptin is the product of the ob gene, and mutations reduce leptin levels that signal satiety, but such mutations are rare. Mutations in OB-R encoding the leptin receptor are seen in about 3% of cases of early-onset obesity with hyperphagia in children. POMC is in a catabolic pathway stimulated by leptin, but mutations are rare, and affected individuals typically have childhood-onset with hyperphagia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is stimulated by the thiazolidinedione drugs and leads to a reduction in free fatty acids, reduction in resistin, and decreased insulin resistance.",B

True statement regarding management of this patient is?",No treatment is necessary as it is due to business loss,SSRI is the most efficacious of the available drugs,Start SSRI treatment based on side effect profile,Combination therapy of 2 anti-depressant drugs,"Ans. (C) Start SSRI treatment based on side effect profile(Ref: CMDT 2010/964)Depression associated with reactive disorders usually does not call for drug therapy and can be managed by psychotherapy and the passage of time. In severe cases -- particularly when vegetative signs are significant and symptoms have persisted for more than a few weeks -- antidepressant drug therapy is often effective. Drug therapy is also suggested by a family history of major depression in first-degree relatives or a past history of prior episodes.Drug selection is influenced by the history of previous responses if that information is available. If a relative has responded to a particular drug, this suggests that the patient may respond similarly. If no background information is available, a drug such as sertraline, 25 mg orally daily and increasing gradually up to 200 mg orally, or desipramine, starting with 50 mg orally and gradually increasing to 150 mg daily, can be selected and a full trial instituted.

On physical examination, a diffuse petechial rash is seen. Blood examination reveals thrombocytopenia. The most likely diagnosis for this patient will be?",Fat embolism syndrome,Dengue,Caisson disease,Trosseau syndrome,"Symptomatic fat embolism syndrome is characterized by pulmonary insufficiency, neurologic symptoms, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a diffuse petechial rash that is fatal in 10% of cases. 
Clinical signs and symptoms appear 1 to 3 days after injury as the sudden onset of tachypnea, dyspnea, tachycardia, irritability, and restlessness, which can progress rapidly to delirium or coma. Thrombocytopenia is attributed to platelet adhesion to fat globules and subsequent aggregation or splenic sequestration; anemia can result from similar red cell aggregation and/or hemolysis. A diffuse petechial rash (seen in 20%–50% of cases) is related to rapid onset of thrombocytopenia and can be a useful diagnostic feature.
The pathogenesis of fat emboli syndrome involves both mechanical obstruction and biochemical injury. Fat microemboli occlude pulmonary and cerebral microvasculature, both directly and by triggering platelet aggregation. This deleterious effect is exacerbated by fatty acid release from lipid globules, which causes local toxic endothelial injury. Platelet activation and granulocyte recruitment (with free radical, protease, and eicosanoid release) complete the vascular assault.

Left-sided heart failure

The major morphological and clinical effects of LVF are due to increased back pressure in the pulmonary circulation and the consequences of diminished peripheral blood pressure and flow,
The extracardiac organs involved commonly are -

1. Lung (most common)
2. Kidney
3. Brain
Lung

The pressure in the pulmonary veins increases and transmitted retrogradely to capillaries and arteries,
This results in pulmonary congestion and pulmonary-oedema → Wet lung.
There is perivascular and interstitial translate, particularly in the interlobular septa → responsible for Kerley's B lines on X-rays.
Edematous fluid accumulates in alveoli.
Iron-containing proteins and hemoglobin leak out from the capillaries and are phagocytosed by macrophages and converted to hemosiderin.
Hemosiderin - containing macrophages in the alveoli (called siderophages, or heart failure cells) denote previous episodes of pulmonary edema.
The clinical manifestations of LVF are primarily due to these changes in lungs —> Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Kidney

Decreased cardiac output causes a reduction in renal perfusion.
If it is severe enough to impair the excretion of nitrogenous product (BUN, Creatinine), Prerenal ARF (Prerenal azotemia) may be precipitated.

Brain

Reduced perfusion to the brain may cause hypoxic/ischemic encephalopathy.",B
A patient was administered trimethaphan during surgery. This drug will cause which of the following responses?,Accommodation,Hypeension,Peristalsis,Tachycardia,"Trimethaphan is a ganglionic blocker that is sometimes administered during surgery to maintain controlled hypotension and to minimize blood loss. The trick to determining the effect of a ganglionic blocker is to first know the predominant tone of the end organ in question. The blocker will produce the opposite effect of the predominant tone. The vessels, aerioles and veins, are predominantly under sympathetic tone. Most everything else is under parasympathetic tone. The hea is under predominantly parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation of the hea causes bradycardia. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would result in tachycardia. The eye is predominantly under parasympathetic control. Parasympathetic stimulation causes the eye to accommodate (focus for near vision). Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce focusing for far vision. Aerioles are predominantly under sympathetic control. Sympathetic stimulation produces vasoconstriction and possibly hypeension. Removal of this tone with trimethaphan would produce vasodilatation and hypotension. The gut is predominantly under parasympathetic control, which increases gut motility. Removal of parasympathetic tone with trimethaphan would diminish gut motility. Ref: Pappano A.J. (2012). Chapter 8. Cholinoceptor-Blocking Drugs. In B.G. Katzung, S.B. Masters, A.J.

"Which of the following is known as the ""guardian of the genome"" -",p53,Mdm2,p14,ATM,"p53; Guardian of genome

p53 is a tumor suppressor gene.
p53 gene is located on chromosome 17.
p53 acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell.
p53 gene product, i.e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes.
The ma 'or functional activities of the 53 rotein are cell c cle arrest and initiation of a o v.tosis in res onse to DNA damage.
When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels.
p53 causes -

Cell cycle arrest


p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor.
p21 inhibit cyclin D-CDK-4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase.
This allows time for DNA repair.

DNA repair

p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage).
GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.
If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 → Relieve in cell cycle block.
If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis-inducing gene BAX.
So p53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA → p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer.
Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of the above protective mechanism.
p-53 is the most common target for genetic alteration in human tumors: A little over 50% of human tumors contain mutation in this gene.

Distension of distant alveoli is seen in -,Irregular emphysema,Paraseptal emphysema,Panacinar emphysema,Centriacinar emphysema,"Ref: Textbook of pathology (Harsh Mohan) 6th edition, page No.481 Morphology of Individual Types of Emphysema CENTRIACINAR (CENTRILOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA. Centriacinar or centrilobular emphysema is one of the common types. It is characterised by initial involvement of respiratory bronchioles i.e. the central or proximal pa of the acinus. This is the type of emphysema that usually coexists with chronic bronchitis and occurs predominantly in smokers and in coal miners' pneumoconiosis. 2. PANACINAR (PANLOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA. Panacinar or panlobular emphysema is the other commontype. In this type, all poions of the acinus are affected but not of the entire lung. Panacinar emphysema is most often associated with a1-antitrypsin deficiency in middle-aged smokers and is the one that produces the most characteristic anatomical changes in the lung in emphysema. PARASEPTAL (DISTAL ACINAR) EMPHYSEMA This type of emphysema involves distal pa of acinus while the proximal pa is normal. Paraseptal or distal acinar emphysema is localised along the pleura and along the perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to the areas of fibrosis and atelectasis and involves upper pa of lungs more severely than the lower. This form of emphysema is seldom associated with COPD but is the common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. Grossly, the subpleural poion of the lung shows air-filled cysts, 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter. 4. IRREGULAR (PARA-CICATRICIAL) EMPHYSEMA. This is the most common form of emphysema, seen surrounding scars from any cause. The involvement is irregular as regards the poion of acinus involved as well as within the lung as a whole. During life, irregular emphysema is often asymptomatic and may be only an incidental autopsy finding. MIXED (UNCLASSIFIED) EMPHYSEMA. Quite often, the same lung may show more than one type of emphysema. It is usually due to more severe involvement resulting in loss of clearcut distinction between one type of emphysema and the other. Thus, the lungs of an elderly smoker at autopsy may show continuation of centriacinar emphysema in the upper lobes, panacinar in the lower lobes, and paraseptal emphysema in the subpleural region.",B

"Sickle cell trait patient do not have manifestations as that of Sickle cell disease, because-",50% HbS is required for occurrence of sickling,HbA prevents sickling,50% sickles,HbA prevents polymerization of Hbs,"Sickle cell disease occurs in following forms


Heterozygous state, i.e., sickle cell trait.
Homozygous state, i.e., sickle cell anemia.


The most important factor for sickling is the amount of HbS in the cell.
In sickle cell trait (heterozygous state), only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, this is insufficient to produce sickling manifestations.
In homozygous state, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS, therefore they undergo sickling.",A

Molecular diagnostic assays would most likely show alterations in the length of the primary transcript for which of the following muscle-associated proteins?",Actin,Desmin,Dystrophin,Glycogen phosphorylase,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, X-linked condition characterized by progressive degeneration of muscles, particularly those of the pelvic and shoulder girdles. A milder form of the disease is known as Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Both DMD and BMD are caused by a deficiency of dystrophin, a member of the family of membrane cytoskeletal proteins, which includes a-actinin and spectrin. The protein is located on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane of muscle cells and is linked to it by integral membrane glycoproteins (dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex), which in turn, are bound to extracellular laminin. It has been proposed that the absence of dystrophin leads to a defective membrane that is damaged during contraction, an effect that predisposes to death of the myocyte. Serum levels of creatine kinase are increased. Glycogen phosphorylase gene mutations (choice D) are found in patients with McArdle disease.Diagnosis: Duchenne muscular dystrophy",C

[Desmopressin-only V2)Drugs used for treatment of acute variceal bleeding are:# Vasopressin (Terlipressin)# Somatostatin (acts via VI receptors)# Octreotide# b-blockers are used for prophylactic treatment of large varices; reduce risk by 40-50%.VARICEAL HEMORRHAGE: TREATMENTTreatment for variceal hemorrhage as a complication of portal hypertension is divided into two main categories:# primary prophylaxis and# prevention of re-bleeding once there has been an initial variceal hemorrhage.# Primary prophylaxis requires routine screening by endoscopy of all patients with cirrhosis. Once varices that are at increased risk for bleeding are identified, then primary prophylaxis can be achieved either through nonselective beta blockade or by variceal band ligation. Several studies have also evaluated variceal band ligation and variceal sclera- therapy as methods for providing primary prophylaxis.# Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has achieved a level of success and comfort with most gastroenterologists who see patients with these complications of portal hypertension. Thus, in patients with cirrhosis who are screened for portal hypertension and are found to have large varices, it is recommended that they receive either beta blockade or primary prophylaxis with EVL.# The approach to patients once they have had a variceal bleed is first to treat the acute bleed, which can be life- threatening, and then to prevent further bleeding. Prevention of further bleeding is usually accomplished with repeated variceal band ligation until varices are obliterated.# The medical management of acute variceal hemorrhage includes the use of vasoconstricting agents, usually somatostatin or Octreotide. Vasopressin was used in the past but is no longer commonly used.# Balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube) can be used in patients who cannot get endoscopic therapy immediately or who need stabilization prior to endoscopic therapy. Control of bleeding can be achieved in the vast majority of cases; however, bleeding recurs in the majority of patients if definitive endoscopic therapy has not been instituted. Octreotide, a direct splanchnic vasoconstrictor, is given at dosages of 50-100 g/h by continuous infusion. Endoscopic intervention is employed as first-line treatment to control bleeding acutely.# When esophageal varices extend into the proximal stomach, band ligation is less successful. In these situations, when bleeding continues from gastric varices, consideration for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be made.# Surgical esophageal transection is rarely used and generally is associated with a poor outcome.",C

The peripheral cerebral arteries and the core of each plaque stain positively with Congo red. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for his disease?",Aggregation of Ab peptide,Conformational change in the prion protein (PrP),Dopamine deficiency,Expansion of polyglutamine repeats,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be complicated by cerebral amyloid angiopathy and terminal hemorrhagic stroke. Formation and aggregation of the Ap peptide are now considered central to the pathogenesis of AD. Ap peptide is derived from the abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). When APP, a transmembrane protein, is cleaved by a-secretase within the Ap sequence, followed by g-secretases, a soluble nontoxic fragment is formed. Cleavage of the Ap sequence by b-secretase and then g-secretase gives rise to Ap peptides that aggregate and form the amyloid cores that elicit a microglial and astrocytic response to form neuritic plaques. Conformational change in prion protein leads to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, rapidly progressive dementia with spongiform encephalopathy but not neuritic plaques or amyloid deposition. Loss of dopaminergic neurons with a deficiency of dopamine is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Expansion of polyglutamine repeats owing to CAG trinucleotide repeat-expansion underlies Huntington disease. Although abnormally phosphorylated forms of tau protein are found in neurofibrillary tangles seen in AD, there is no mutation of the tau gene, and the tangles are not considered primary in the pathogenesis of AD. Mutation of the tau gene can be found in frontotemporal lobe dementias.",A

"A 14-year-old girl noticed gradual neck enlargement during the past 8 months. On physical examination, her thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged. Her serum TSH level is normal. A dietary history is most likely to reveal that she has begun eating more of which of the following foods?",Cabbage,Fava beans,Fish,Plantains,"She has developed a sporadic goiter. Vegetables of the Brassicaceae family, including cabbage, turnips, and Brussels sprouts, contain glucosinolate, which can decompose to release thiocyanate, a by-product that interferes with thyroid hormone synthesis. Thus such substances are known as goitrogens. Young persons with increased demand for thyroid hormones are at increased risk. Fava beans contain oxidizing agents that incite hemolysis in persons with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. In addition, beans contain long-chain sugars that are indigestible with human intestinal enzymes, leaving them to be fermented by colonic bacteria that release gas (flatus). Fish have omega-3 fatty acids that protect against atherogenesis. Plantains are starchy, as anyone mistaking them for sweet bananas soon discovers; rare food allergy develops to them.

Cell-mediated immunity is-,Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,"Cell-mediated (Type) hypersensitivity

It is initiated by activated T-lymphocytes.

It includes
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity - mediated by CD-4 T cells.
2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity - mediated by CDS- T cells.
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity

In delayed hypersensitivity reactions, CD-4 T cells and macrophages are primarily involved.
The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary' cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes,
Delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and certain parasites.

Pathophysiology

Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by the formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epithelioid) cells surrounded by colour of lymphocytes and giant cells.
It is also called granulomatous Inflammation.
The cellular events start when an antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells → naive CD-4 T cells recognize this peptide antigen in association with MHC – II and differentiate into T4-l cells.
Induction of T4-l cells is of central importance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-l cells.

2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity

In this type of hypersensitivity, cytotoxic T cells kill virus-infected or tumor cells.",D
"A 70 year old woman dies in a nursing home after a hea attack. The time of onset of her clinical symptomatology and the cause of death are unceain; fuhermore, the possibility of neglect is being considered. Therefore, an autopsy investigation is arranged. The forensic pathologist discovers acute thrombosis involving the posterior descending branch of the right coronary aery with resultant myocardial infarction (MI) in the posterior third of the interventricular septum. Histologically, there is coagulation necrosis with associated abundant neutrophilic infiltration. Histiocytes and lymphocytes are scanty. Which of the following is the approximate period between the onset of pain (ie, beginning of ischemic injury) and death?",1 hour,12 hours,2 days,5 days,"Following irreversible ischemic injury, the hea (and any other organ) displays an orderly sequence of events that progresses from necrosis of parenchymal cells to inflammatory reaction, granulation tissue, and scar healing. Although ischemic injury manifests with pain almost immediately following vascular occlusion, histologic evidence of necrosis lags behind the clinical symptoms. At 1 hour after ischemia, there is no morphologic change indicative of necrosis. The first signs of necrosis appear 12 hours after irreversible ischemia: myocytes appear intensely eosinophilic and wavy, but there is no inflammatory reaction yet. Acute inflammatory cells (neutrophils) infiltrate the infarcted area beginning 1 day and peaking at approximately 2-3 days after injury. This acute inflammatory response paially overlaps with the subsequent influx of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Reabsorption of necrotic myofibers by histiocytes, as well as proliferation of small blood vessels, marks early formation of granulation tissue at around 5 days.

Reed Sternberg cells are characteristically seen in: March 2013,Non specific infection,Burkitts lymphoma,Acute myeloid leukemia,Hodgkins lymphoma,"Ans. D i.e. Hodgkins lymphoma Reed-Sternberg cells They are usually derived from B lymphocytes, classically considered crippled germinal center B cells. Seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a moth-eaten appearance. They are named after Dorothy Reed Mendenhall and Carl Sternberg, who provided the first definitive microscopic descriptions of Hodgkin's disease. Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bibbed nucleus (thus resembling an ""owl's eye"" appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 andCD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis, carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very often in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A special type of Reed-Sternberg cells is the lacunar histiocyte, whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called lacunae) between them. These are characteristic of the nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma",D

All are true about Ifosfamide except,It is nitrogen mustard,Metabolised by CYP3 A4 to form active metabolite,Chloracetaldehyde is active form,Less neurotoxic than cyclophosphamide,"Less neurotoxic than cyclophosphamide Ifosfamide is a synthetic analogue of cyclophosphamide. It is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent. Ifosfamide is a cyclophosphamide analogue thus it has all the potential adverse effects of cyclophosphamide. Ifosfamide metabolite, rather than the parent drug is responsible for toxicity of Ifosfamide. Ifosfamide is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation by microsomal liver enzymes to produce biologically active compounds. Activation is mediated by cytochrome p450 - CYP3A4 and deactivated by CYP3A-4 AND CYP2B6. The metabolic activation of Ifosfamide is an autoinducible process and besides producing active cytotoxic metabolites it also results in generation of some toxic metabolic byproducts that are responsible for its side effects. The two well known toxic nzetabolities of Ifosfamide are acrolein and chloracetaldehyde. - ""Acrolein is responsible for Ifosfamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis where as chloroacetaldehyde is responsible for renal tubular damage and neutrotoxicity"". Acrolein - Hemorrhagic cystitis Chloroacetaldehyde - Nephrotoxicity (Renal tubular danage) - Neurotoxicity At equivalent doses, the rate of chloroacetaldehyde generation with ifosfamide is 40 times greater than with cyclophosphamide. -This explains why cyclophosphamide although structurally related has viually no nephrotoxicity and less neurotoxic. Goodman Gilman Says - At equivalent doses, the rate of chloroacetaldehyde generation with ifosfamide is 40 times greater than with cyclophosphamide therefore it produces more platelet suppression, neurotoxicity, urothelial damage. Neurotoxicity in ifosfamide Neurotoxity in ifosfamide is caused by the active metabolite of ifosfamide i.e., chloralacetaldehyde These metabolites enter brain and produce neurological symptoms which are encephalopathy and seizure. These symptoms almost always resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Patients who have mild to moderate symptoms can continue to receive the drug.",D

"A 35-year-old man has had an outbreak of pruritic lesions over the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees during the past month. He has a history of malabsorption that requires him to eat a special diet, but he has had no previous skin problems. On physical examination, the lesions are 0.4- to 0.7-cm vesicles. A 3-mm punch biopsy of one of the lesions over the elbow is performed and on microscopic examination shows the accumulation of neutrophils at the tips of dermal papillae and the formation of small blisters caused by separation at the dermo-epidermal junction. Immunofluorescence studies show granular deposits of IgA localized to tips of dermal papillae. Laboratory studies show serum antigliadin antibodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bullous pemphigoid,Contact dermatitis,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Discoid lupus erythematosus,"Dermatitis herpetiformis can accompany the celiac disease. The IgA or IgG antibodies formed against the gliadin protein in gluten that is ingested (commonly in wheat, rye, and barley grains) cross-react with reticulin. Reticulin is a component of the anchoring fibrils that attach the epidermal basement membrane to the superficial dermis. This explains the localization of the IgA to the tips of dermal papillae and the site of inflammation. A gluten-free diet may relieve the symptoms. Bullous pemphigoid can occur in older individuals, with an antibody directed at keratinocytes to produce flaccid bullae, but there is no association with celiac disease. Contact dermatitis is most likely to be seen on the hands and forearms. It is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction without immunoglobulin deposition and would not persist for 1 month. Discoid lupus erythematosus is seen in sun-exposed areas and has the appearance of an erythematous rash. Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity response to infections and drugs; it produces macules and papules with a red or vesicular center, but it is probably mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes and not by immunoglobulin deposition.

The maximal response for different action of a drug may be different ie the DRCs (Dose response curves) for different effects of a drug may be different. The extent of separation of DRCs of a drug for different effects is a measure of its selectivity, e.g. the DRCs for bronchodilatation and cardiac stimulation are quite similar in case of isoprenaline but far apa in case of salbutamol - the latter is more selective. The gap between the therapeutic effect DRC and the adverse effect DRC defines the safety margin or the therapeutic index.",A

Agonist has affinity for -,Active receptor,Inactive receptor,Both,None,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Active receptor Drug-receptor binding and agonism o A receptor can exist in two conformational states: (i) Active state (Ra) (ii) Inactive state (Ri) o Usually, inactive state predominates in the absence of drug and the basal signal output will be low. o The extent to which the equilibrium is shifted toward the active state is determined by the relative affinity of the drug for the two conformations. o Agonist has higher affinity for the active confirmation and drives the equilibrium to the active state and thereby activate the receptor. A full agonist is sufficiently selective for the active confirmation that at a saturating concentration it will drive the receptor essentially completely to active state -3 maximum activity can be produced by agonist. o Paial agonist has only moderately higher affinity for the active confirmation (Ra) than inactive confirmation (Ri). Its effect will be less, even at saturating concentrations, so paial agonist cannot produce a full biological response at any concentration --> paial agonist has submaximal intrinsic activity. o Antagonist has equal affinity for both active (Ra) and inactive (Ri) confirmation. So, antagonist will not alter the equilibrium between Ra & Ri, and will not produce an effect --> antagonist has no intrinsic activity. o Inverse agonist has greater affinity for inactive confirmation (Ri) and drives the equilibrium to the inactive state. So, inverse agonist has an effect opposite to that of an agonist --> inverse agonist has intrinsic activity with a minus sign that means opposite intrinsic activity. Examples of such inverse agonists at G-protein coupled receptors are Famotidine, losaan, metoprolol and risperidone. 1. Agonist has affinity for active configuration (Ra) 2. Paial agonist has affinity for bath active (Ra) as well as inactive (Ri) confirmation, but has more affinity for active configuration (Ra > Ri) 3. Antagonist has equal affinity for active and inactive confirmation (Ra = Ri) 4. Inverse agonist has affinity for inactive confirmation (Ri)",A

Pneumococcal resistance to penicillin G is mainly acquired by:,Conjugation,Transduction,Transformation,All of the above,"Transformation: A resistant bacterium may release the resistance carrying DNA into the medium and this may be imbibed by another sensitive organism-becoming unresponsive to the drug. This mechanism is probably not clinically significant except isolated instances of pneumococcal resistance to penicillin G due to altered penicillin binding protein, and some other cases. Resistance once acquired by any of the above mechanisms becomes prevalent due to the selection pressure of a widely used AMA, i.e. presence of the AMA provides oppounity for the resistant subpopulation to thrive in preference to the sensitive population.

Mechanism of action of sulfonylureas is ?,Insulin release,Alpha glucosidase inhibitor,PPAR y inhibitor,Insulin sensitizer,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Insulin release Sulfonylureas act by Sulfonylurease provoke a brisk release of insulin from pancreas. They act on the so called ""Sulfonylurea receptors"" (SUR1) on pancreatic b-cell membrane - cause depolarization by reducing conductance of ATP sensitive K+ channels. This enhances influx of Ca+2 - degranulation. They do not cause hypoglycemia in pancreatectomized animals and type 1 diabetes (Presence of at least 30% of functional b-cells in essential for their action). A minor action reducing glucagon secretion by increasing insulin and somatostatin release has been demonstrated. Extrahepatic action On chronic administration they sensitize the target cells (especially the liver) to the action of insulin. On chronic administration their action on pancrease (to release insuline) declines due to down regulation of sulfonylurea receptors. But glycemic control is maintained due to extrahepatic action.",A

Which of the following lesions best explains these findings?",Chronic subdural hematoma,Frontal lobe abscess,Glioblastoma with edema,Hydrocephalus ex vacuo,"The papilledema and the herniation are a consequence of brain swelling, typically the vasogenic form of edema from blood-brain barrier disruption adjacent to the neoplasm. A large aggressive neoplasm, such as glioblastoma, may produce a mass effect via enlargement from rapid growth, hemorrhage, and surrounding edema. The mass effect with herniation of the medial temporal lobe results in a third cranial nerve palsy as the nerve is compressed. A chronic subdural hemorrhage accumulates slowly enough that herniation may not occur. An abscess may cause a mass effect with some associated brain swelling, but this patient is afebrile. There is no pressure effect with hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which is a consequence of cerebral atrophy.

Cotrimoxazole can be used for the treatment of all of the following except:,Chancroid,Lower urinary tract infections,Migraine,Typhoid,"COTRIMOXAZOLE The fixed dose combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole is called cotrimoxazole. T rimethoprim is a diaminopyrimidine related to the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine which selectively inhibits bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFRase). Uses: Though cotrimoxazole is still widely used, its popularity in the treatment of systemic infections has declined. Common indications are: 1 . Urinary tract infections Most acute uncomplicated infections respond rapidly. Single dose therapy with 4 tablets of cotrimoxazole has been recommended for acute cystitis. Courses of 3-l 0 days have been advised for lower and upper urinary tract infections, according to associated features. It is specially valuable for chronic and recurrent cases and in prostatitis, because trimethoprim is concentrated in prostate. 2. Respiratory tract infections Both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis and facio-maxillary infection, otitis media caused by gram positive cocci and H influenzae respond well 3. Typhoid: Initially cotrimoxazole was an effect alten1ative to chloramphenicol. However, in many areas resistant S typlri have appeared, and now it is seldom used Sensitive strains of S typhi respond to one DS tab BD for 2 weeks. 4. Bacterial diarrhoeas and dysentery Cotrimoxazole may be used for severe and invasive infections by Campylobacter, E. coli, Shigella Y. enterocolitica . Though response rate is lower than previously, and fluoroquinolone are more commonly used, it is effective in ampicillin resistant cases. 5. Pneumocystis jiroveci causes severe pnemonia in neutropenic and AIDS patients. Cotrimoxazole has prophylactic as well as therapeutic value, but high doses are needed. One DS tab 4-6 times/ day for 2-3 weeks may be curative,but adverse effects necessitate discontinuation in upto 20%cases. One DS tab. daily has been used for prophylaxis and is better tolerated. 6. Chancroid Cotrimoxazole (800 + 160 mg) BD for 7 days is a 3rd choice inexpensive alternative to ceftriaxone, erythromycin or ciprofloxacin. 7. Cotrimoxazole is an effective alternative to penicillin for protecting agranulocytosis patients and treating respiratory and other infections in them.

Lung to lung metastasis is seen in ?,Adenocarcinoma of lung,Squamous cell carcinoma,Small cell carcinoma,Neuroendocrine tumor of lung,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Adenocarcinoma of lung o Bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a relatively unusual (5% of all lung cancer) subtype of adenocarcinoma that has a unique growth pattern that differs from adenocarcinoma. Rather than invading and destroying contiguous lung parenchyma tumor cells multiply and fill the alveolar spaces. Because of their grwoth within alveoli, BAC tumor cells from one site can aerogenously seed other pas of the same lobe or lung, or the contralateral lung. This growth pattern and tendency to seed can produce three radiographic presentation: a single nodule, multiple nodules (in single or multiple nodes), or a diffuse form with an appearance mimicking that of a lobar pneumonia. Because tumorcells fill the alveolar spaces and envelop small airways rather than destroying them, air bronchograms can be seen, unlike with other carcinomas. o it has the best prognosis of all the cell types.",A
"Therapeutic  Drug  Monitoring  (TDM)  involves measurement of plasma concentrations of drugs to find whether the drug levels are within the therapeutic range or not.

The thyroid extracts iodide from the plasma and, in an oxidative process, iodinated tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin molecules. Monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine are formed and then coupled to produce either thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine, T4) or triiodothyronine (T3). Proteolytic cleavage of thyroglobulin molecules leads to free T3 or T4, which is then released into the circulation; T3 is several times more potent than T4. Peripheral deiodination of T4 at the 5&; position leads to T3 formation (mainly in the liver); this step is inhibited by propylthiouracil. Decreasing the efficacy of TSH binding, decreasing the rate of thyroglobulin proteolysis, increasing the amount of rT3 formation, and inhibiting the uptake of iodide into the thyroid, would all tend to decrease the formation of thyroid hormones in the thyroid itself.

"During heterosexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing HIV contacts vaginal squamous mucosa. Cells capture virions and transport the virus via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Within the germinal centers of these lymph nodes, the virions infect CD4+ lymphocytes and proliferate, causing CD4+ cell lysis with release of more virions, which are taken up on the surface of cells having Fc receptors, allowing continued infection by HIV of more CD4+ cells passing through the nodes. Which of the following types of cells is most likely to capture HIV on its surface via Fc receptors?",B lymphocyte,CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte,Follicular dendritic cell,Natural Killer cell,"Dendritic cells are a form of antigen-presenting cell. Dendritic cells in epithelia are known as Langerhans cells, and those within germinal centers are called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. They have cell surface Fc receptors that capture antibody-coated HIV virions through the Fc portion of the antibody. These virions attached to the FDCs can infect passing CD4+ lymphocytes. Dendritic cells elaborate type I interferons that up-regulate antiviral proteins in neighboring cells. B cells are a component of humoral immunity, and antibody to HIV does not serve a protective function, but allows serologic detection of infection. CD8+ cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that lack the receptor necessary for infection by HIV. Because they survive selectively, the CD4+:CD8+ ratio is reversed so that it is typically less than 1 with advanced HIV infection. Innate lymphoid cells resemble NK cells, but shape further lymphoid reactions. Langhans giant cells are ""committees"" of activated macrophages that are part of a granulomatous response. Macrophages are a type of antigen- presenting cell that can become infected by HIV without destruction.

Paraganglioma seen in-,Carotid body tumor,Thorax,Para-veebral location,Para-aoic lymph nodes,"CAROTID BODY TUMOUR (chemodectoma, CAROTID BODY PARAGANGLIOMA). Carotid body tumour arises in the carotid bodies which are situated at the bifurcation of the common carotid aeries. Carotid bodies are normally pa of the chemoreceptor system and the cells of this system are sensitive to changes in the pH and aerial oxygen tension and are also the storage site for catechola- mines. Histologically similar tumours are found in other parasympathetic ganglia represented by the vagus and glomus jugulare (jugulotympanic bodies,). Carotid body paragangliomas, as they are currently called, are rare tumours and occur between 3rd and 6th decades of life with slight female preponderance. A few (5%) are bilateral and some show familial incidence. Grossly, they are small, firm, dark tan, encapsulated nodules. Microscopically, well-differentiated tumour cells form characteristic organoid or alveolar pattern, as is the case with all other neuroendocrine tumours. The tumour cells contain dark neurosecretory granules containing catecholamines. These tumours are mostly benign but recurrences are frequent.

Side effect of salmeterol is -,Tremor,Seizure,Hypertension,Hyperkalaemia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Tremor o Salmeterol is a beta - 2 agonist taken by inhalational route and a adverse effects are usually not a problem with beta-agonists when given by inhalation. The most common side effects are muscle tremor and palpitations, which are seen more commonly in elderly patients.o There is a small fall in plasma potassium due to increased uptake by skeletal muscle cells, but this effect does not usually cause any clinical problem.Adverse effects of inhalational b2 - agonistso Owing to their b-selectivity and topical delivery (inhalation), adverse effects are not usually a problem with b2 agonists.o At higher doses systemic absorption and side effects occur due to activation of b-adrenergic receptorsThe most common side effects are muscle tremor and palpitationHypokalemia - biochemical pump that shifts potassium into cells is activated by the b2-receptor agonists, i.e. there is increased intracellular uptake of potassium especially in skeletal muscles.Hyperglycemia - Due to b2 mediated gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.Toleranceo Tolerance is a potential problem with b2-agonists.o It is due to down regulation of b2-receptors caused by continous exposure of tissues to b-agonists.o This may cause tachyphylaxis (rapidly developing tolerance). (Note - other drugs showing tachyphylaxis are indirectly acting sympathomimetics, e.g. ephedrine, amphetamine, tyramine).o So, b2 agonists should not be used on any regular schedule - due to tolerance, bronchial hyperactivity not reduced on continous use.o It is advised that patients requiring regular medication should be treated with inhaled steroids and use of b2 agonist inhalers should be restricted to symptomatic relief of on acute attack.Throat irritationAnkle edema7..

Which of the following is not true regarding tetracycline?,It is not teratogenic,It can cause tooth discoloration,It can result in superinfection,It can lead to pseudomembranous colitis,"Tetracyclines are broad spectrum antibiotics Mechanism of action The tetracyclines arc primarily bacteriostatic; inhibit protein synthesis by binding to 305 ribosomes in susceptible organism. Subsequent to such binding, attachment of aminoacyl-t-RNA to the mRNA-ribosomc complex is interferred with As a result the peptide chain fails to grow. Tetracyclines have chelating propey. Calcium-tetracycline chelate gets deposited in developing teeth and bone. Given from midpregnancy to 5 months of extrauterine life, the deciduous teeth are affected: brown discolouration, ill-formed teeth, more susceptible to caries. Tetracyclines given between 3 months and 6 years of age affect the crown of permanent anterior dentition. Repeated courses are more damaging. Given during late pregnancy or childhood, tetracyclines can cause temporary suppression of bone growth. The ultimate effect on stature is mostly insignificant, but deformities and reduction in height are a possibility with prolonged use.

Because of their dual blood supply, aerial occlusion of either the hepatic aery or the poal vein rarely results in liver infarcts. However, thrombosis of branches of the hepatic aery may result in a pale (anemic) infarct, or possibly a hemorrhagic infarct due to blood flow from the poal vein. In contrast, occlusion of the poal vein, which may be caused by cirrhosis or malignancy, may result in a wedge-shaped red area called an infarct of Zahn. This is a misnomer, however, since it is not really an infarction but instead is the result of focal sinusoidal congestion. Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) is associated with polycythemia vera, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives. Clinically, Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, ascites, tender hepatomegaly, and hematemesis.

Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone man-ow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the mayor clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's inunune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",D

Ectopic ACTH is commonly secreted by:September 2007,Small cell carcinoma of the lungs,Pancreatic carcinoma,Gall bladder malignancy,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,"Ans. A: Small cell carcinoma of the lungsEndogenous Cushing's syndrome results from some derangement of the body's own system of secreting coisol. Normally, ACTH is released from the pituitary gland when necessary to stimulate the release of coisol from the adrenal glands.In pituitary Cushing's, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as Cushing's disease and is responsible for 65% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome.In adrenal Cushing's, excess coisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.Finally, tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH that affects the adrenal glands. This final etiology is called ectopic or paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome and is seen in diseases like small cell lung cancer.",A

"All of the following drugs cause hypeensive crisis in patients with phaeochromocytoma, EXCEPT:",Phenoxybenzamine,Propranolol,Saralasin,Captopril,"Phenoxybenzamine is used in the treatment of hypeensive crisis in pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine secreting tumor of cells derived from adrenal medulla. Prior to surgical of tumor, patients are treated with phenoxybenzamine, an alpha blocker to preclude the hypeensive crisis that can result from manipulation of the tissues. Beta blockers or other antihypeensives should not used without first blocking the alpha adrenoceptor mediated vasoconstriction. The goal of pre operative management is relaxation of constricted vasculature, expansion of reduced plasma volume and normalization of blood pressure. Beta blockers can be added to it if tachycardia persists, and CCBs and ACEIs can be added if BP is not controlled with phenoxybenzamine alone. Elevated levels of plasma and urinary catecholamines and the methylated metabolites, metanephrines, are the cornerstone for the diagnosis. T2-weighted MRI with gadolinium contrast is optimal for detecting pheochromocytomas and is somewhat better than CT for imaging extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Which of the following therapeutic index (T.I.) values represent the greatest safety profile for a drug?,100,"1,000",500,2,"Although factors such as idiosyncratic reactions or allergic reactions can contribute to the overall safety profile of a drug, the therapeutic index gives a reliable indication of the drugs safety margin if other considerations are assumed to be equal. The therapeutic index represents the ratio between the median lethal dose (LD50) and the median effective dose ( ED50) of a drug. This calculation of LD50/ DD50 generates an index that is the therapeutic window between the dose that produces the desired effect and the dose that results in toxic effects. Like all indices, the T.I. is dimensionless since the dose units, usually express in ""mg-kg "", cancel each other. The therapeutic index conveniently represents the safety merger of a drug. The greater the therapeutic ratio, or spread, between the ED50 and LD50, the greater the drug safety. Therefore a T.I. of one thousand represents a drug with a far greater safety profile than a drug with a T.I. of two. Ref: Von Zastrow M. (2012). Chapter 2. Drug Receptors & Pharmacodynamics. In B.G.

Goodpasture's syndrome is characterized by -,Necrotising hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonitis,Alveolitis,Patchy consolidation,Pulmonary edema,"Goodpasture syndrome

Goodpasture syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the rapid destruction of the kidney and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
It is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies targeted against basement membrane of lung and kidney.
These antibodies are directed against the noncollagenous domain of the α -3 chains of type IV collagen (collagen of basement membrane).
The antibodies initiate an inflammatory destruction of the basement membrane in kidney glomeruli and lung alveoli.
In Goodpasture syndrome, the immune reaction is type II hypersensitivity.

Morphological changes
I. Lung

The lungs are heavy, with areas of red-brown consolidation.
There is focal necrosis of alveolar walls associated with intraalveolar hemorrhages.
Alveoli contain hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
Linear deposits of immunoglobulins along the basement membranes of the septal walls.

II. Kidney

Diffuse proliferative rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
Focal necrotizing lesion and crescents in >50% of glomeruli.
Linear deposits of immunoglobulins and complement along the glomerular basement membrane.

In a-thalassemia with -,Excess a-chain,No a-chain,Excess b-chain,No b-chain,"a -thalassemia is charecterised by the reduced or absent synthesis of a- globin chain.a-Thalassemia Unlike b-thalassemia, a-thalassemia is caused mainly by deletions involving one or more of the a-globin genes. The severity of the disease is propoional to the number of a-globin genes that are missing (Table 11-3). For example, the loss of a single a-globin gene produces a silent- carrier state, whereas the deletion of all four a-globin genes is lethal in utero because the red cells have viually no oxygen-delivering capacity. With loss of three a-globin genes there is a relative excess of b-globin or (early in life) g-globin chains. Excess b-globin and g-globin chains form relatively stable b4 and g4 tetramers known as HbH and Hb Ba, respectively, which cause less membrane damage than the free a-globin chains that are found in b-thalassemia; as a result, ineffective erythropoiesis is less pronounced in a-thalassemia. Unfounately, both HbH and Hb Ba have an abnormally high affinity for oxygen, which renders them ineffective at delivering oxygen to the tissues Referance : Exam preparatory manual for UGs by Ramdas Nayak Page no:273 Ref Robbins 9/e pg415",B

Invovled in Hereditiary spherocytosis -,Troponin,Ankyrin,Pyrin,Actin,"the pathogenic mutations of HS affect ankyrin,band3,spectrin,or band 4.2. Hereditary spherocytosis is caused by abnormalities in the membrane skeleton, a network of proteins that underlies lipid bilayer of the red cell (Fig. 11-1). The major membrane skeleton protein is spectrin, a long, flexible het- erodimer that self-associates at one end and binds sho actin filaments at its other end. These contacts create a two- dimensional meshwork that is linked to the overlying mem- brane through ankyrin and band 4.2 to the intrinsic membrane protein called band 3, and through band 4.1 to glycophorin. The mutations in hereditary spherocytosis most frequently involve ankyrin, band 3, and spectrin, but mutations in other components of the skeleton have also been described.A shared feature of the pathogenic mutations is that they weaken the veical interactions between the membrane skeleton and the intrinsic membrane proteins. This defect somehow destabilizes the lipid bilayer of the red cells, which shed membrane vesicles into the cir- culation as they age. Little cytoplasm is lost in the process and as a result the surface area to volume ratio decreases progressively over time until the cells become spherical (Fig. 11-1). The spleen plays a major role in the destruction of sphe- rocytes. Red cells must undergo extreme degrees of defor- mation to pass through the splenic cords. The floppy discoid shape of normal red cells allows considerable latitude for shape changes. By contrast, spherocytes have limited deform- ability and are sequestered in the splenic cords, where they are destroyed by the plentiful resident macrophages. The critical role of the spleen is illustrated by the beneficial effect of splenectomy; although the red cell defect and spherocytes persist, the anemia is corrected. Ref: Robbins 9/,e pg:633",B

A. Combination should be avoidedRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th/ed, p2147Explanation# Option a: Anakinra (IL 1 antagonist) and infliximab (anti-TNF) should not be combined.# Both agents restrict inflammatory process markedly and lead to high rate of serious infections.# This finding is observed in trials that used this regimen.# New strategy in treatment of RA focuses on several goals:1. Early, aggressive therapy to prevent joint damage and disability.2. Frequent modification of therapy and use of combination therapy where appropriate.3. Individualization of therapy, to maximize response and minimize side effects;4. Achieving, remission of clinical disease activity.# Preferred first line drug as monotherapy in moderate to severe RA: Methotrexate# Effective combinations include:# Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine (oral triple therapy);# Methotrexate and leflunomide;# Methotrexate plus a biological (e.g. methotrexate and infliximab an anti-TNF agent; methotrexate + Etanercept is equivalent to oral triple therapy options b and d)# Early RA (<6 months of disease duration)# Started with methotrexate - switch or add DMARD therapy after 3 months of worsening or persistent moderate/high disease activity - If disease still persists after 3 months of intense DMARD therapy, add a biologic agent.# Oral triple therapy (hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine) is a reasonable first step for the treatment of early RA, including its use as a step-up strategy where treatment is initiated with methotrexate alone and then combined at 6 months with hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine if the disease is not adequately controlled.# Patients with established RA.# Treatment with a biologic agent or aggressive combination DMARD therapy was also recommended as initial therapy in certain patients with high disease activity and poor prognosis.",A

Wilson disease is due to accumulation of: September 2005,Copper,Iron,Zinc,Nickel,"Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.

The tensile strength of wound after laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a 30 years old woman depends upon:,Replacement of type 3 collagen,Macrophage aetivity/snvasion,Extensive crosslinking of tropocollagen,Granulation tissue,"The recovery of tensile strength results from the excess of collagen synthesis over collagen degradation during the first 2 months of healing, and, at later times, from structural modifications of collagen fibers (cross-linking, increased fiber size) after collagen synthesis ceases.
'Recovery of Tensile Strength: Fibrillar collagens (mostly type I collagen) form a major portion of the connective tissue in repair sites and are essential for the development of strength in healing wounds. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased collagen synthesis but also on decreased degradation. When sutures are removed from an incisional surgical wound, usually at the end of the first week, wound strength is approximately 10% that of unwounded skin.
Wound strength increases rapidly over the next 4 weeks, slows down at approximately the third month after the original incision, and reaches a plateau at about 70% to 80% of the tensile strength of unwounded skin. Lower tensile strength in the healed wound area may persist for life. The recovery of tensile strength results from the excess of collagen synthesis over collagen degradation during the first 2 months of healing, and, at later times, from structural modifications of collagen fibers (cross-linking, increased fiber size) after collagen synthesis ceases.'- Robbins 8/e p105-106",C
"All are true about Cotrimoxazole, except",Resistance is delayed due to drugs in combination,Trimethoprim : Sulphamethoxazole = 1:5,Similar pharmacokinetics for both components,Trimethoprim increases absorption of Sulphamethoxazole,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Trimethoprim increases absorption of Sulfamethoxazole Cotrimoxazole - It is a fixed dose combination of Trimethoprim and Sulphamethoxazole.Important properties -Sulphamethoxazole and Trimethoprim have been selected for combination because both have nearly the same t 1/2- 10 hr. (Pharmacokinetics of both the drugs resemble each other closely).Optimal synergy in case of most organism is exhibited at a concentration ratio of Sulphamethoxazole 20: Trimethoprim 1 (This ratio is obtained in plasma when two are given in a dose ratio of 5:1)This occurs because trimethoprim has a larger volume of distribution than Sulfamethoxazole and attains lower plasma concentration.Trimethoprim adequately crosses blood brain barrier and placenta, while sulfamethoxazole has poor entry.Trimethoprim is more rapidly absorbed than Sulfamethoxazole (It does not affect absorption of Sulphamethoxazole)Trimethoprim is 40 % plasma protein bound, Sulphamethoxazole is 60% plasma protein bound.Resistance to the combination has been slow to develop compared to the resistance to either drug alone.",D
Commonest site of intestinal T.B.,Stomach,Jejunum,Ileum,Colon,"Ans, is 'C' i.e., ileum o Most common site of intestinal T.B. is ileum.o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms,o Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis.o Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonar\! tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis,o Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate.o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumen,o It usually occurs in the ileocecal region,o Clinical featuresAttacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea.Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mas in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction.o Barium meal radiography will revealPersistent narrowing of the affected segment ie the terminal ileum and the caecum.The caecum is pulled up and may become subhepatic.As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caeca! angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecat angle is 90o. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 150o.o Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.A TT is given both cases.If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)o Thus, all the options are correct in this question but (d) option is partly correct as conservative nv'n is not the t/t of choice. The t/t of choice depends on the presence or absense of obstructive sympt. In case of obstruction, surgery is the t/t of choice,o Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis),o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved.o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt loss.o Barium meal shows - absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment,o TreatmentA course of A TT is adequateOperation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",C

Methanol toxicity causes blindness due to the formation of: March 2010,Formic acid,Formaldehyde,Lactic acid,Pyruvic acid,"Ans. A: Formic Acid The initial step in the metabolism of methanol involves the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). First, methanol is slowly oxidized by ADH to yield formaldehyde. Next, formaldehyde is oxidized by formaldehyde dehydrogenase to yield formic acid (or formate, depending on the pH). This oxidation occurs rapidly so that little formaldehyde accumulates in the serum. Finally, formic acid is metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, which are excreted by the kidneys and lungs. The accumulation of formic acid is responsible for the presence of metabolic acidosis. Formic acid also inhibits cellular respiration leading to lactic acidosis. The ocular injury caused by methanol may be due to retinal injury, which results from intra-retinal metabolism of methanol and the accumulation of formic acid. Alternatively, it may be caused be the inhibition of normal metabolism in optic nerve calls.",A

Mitochondrial inheritance,Father - son,Father - both,Mother - daughter,Mother - both,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Mother - both Mitochondrial diseaseso DNA in human may be found at two locationsNuclear DNA : In the nucleus.Organelle DNA : In the mitochondria.o Mitocondrial DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells,o Mitochondrial DNA, is always maternally inherited.y Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embry>o comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mothers egg.o So, in diseases showing mitochondrial inheritance all children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmitted from an affected father to his children.",D

Laboratory studies show Na+, 135 mmol/L; K+, 3.8 mmol/L; Cl-, 99 mmol/L; CO2, 25 mmol/L; glucose, 76 mg/ dL; creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL; and urea nitrogen, 30 mg/dL. Fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%. Plasma renin, aldosterone, and antidiuretic hormone levels all are increased. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is 200 pg/mL (normal <100 pg/mL). Which of the following pathologic findings is this man most likely to have?",Aldosteronoma,Bilateral adrenal atrophy,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Ischemic heart disease,"He has left-sided heart failure with pulmonary edema and congestion. His reduced cardiac output leads to diminished renal blood flow that stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism to retain salt and water to increase plasma volume. He has prerenal azotemia with a high BUN-to-creatinine ratio and low fractional excretion of sodium. The other options do not explain his pulmonary edema. An aldosterone- secreting adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome) would increase aldosterone, but decrease the plasma renin. In chronic adrenal failure (Addison disease), there should be hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia accompanying hyponatremia. Chronic glomerulonephritis with chronic renal failure would be associated with a BUN-to-creatinine ratio around 10:1. Pulmonary fibrosis would lead to cor pulmonale and a prominent right heart border with features of right-sided congestive heart failure. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a paraneoplastic syndrome that can occur with pulmonary small cell carcinomas, and secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) would increase ADH and cause more severe hyponatremia, but would not have a major effect on the renin-angiotensin mechanism, and sodium excretion would be higher.",D

Characteristic feature of Crohn's disease is?,Skip lesions,Toxic megacolon,Fibrosis is rare,Involvement is superficial,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Skip lesions * A classic feature of CD is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from adjacent uninvolved bowelWhen multiple bowel segments are involved, the intervening bowel is normal - skip lesions.Crohn disease (Terminal ileitis or regional enteritis)* Any portion of intestine can be involved, but most commonly small intestine (especially distal ileum) is involved (in 40% cases). Both small intestine and colon are involved in 30% of cases, and only colon isinvolved in 30%.* In the affected segment, mesentric fat wraps around the bowel surface - creeping fat.* The intestinal wall is rubbery and thick, as a consequence of edema, inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria - lumen is almost always narrowed - string sign on barium meal.* There are serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of bowel.* As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarse texture - Cobblestone appearance.* Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. Further extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation.* There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of bowel wall.* Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers.* Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscess.* Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscularis propria, and mucosa eventually leads to stricture formation.* There is an increased incidence of cancer of GIT in patients with long-standing CD, but the risk of cancer in CD is considerably less than in patients with chronic UC.* On barium enema there is Hose pipe (lead pipe) appearnace and cobble - stone appearnace.* Screening test is presence of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisae antibody (ASCA).

The mechanism of action of cephalosporin is:,Interferes with cell wall synthesis,Inhibition ol DNA gyrase,Inhibition of protein synthesis,Inhibition of DMA polymerase,"Ans: A (Interferes with cell wall synthesis) Ref: Goodman & Gilmans The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed, 2011. Pg 1479, 1493: Basic and Clinical Pharmacology by Katzung, 2012, 12th ed, Pg 792Explanation:Cephalosporin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.Its mechanism of action is similar to penicillin as both are beta lactams.Bacterial ceil wall plays a major role in the growth and development of bacteria.Peptidoglycan. a component of bacterial cell wall owing to its cross-linked structure offers strength to the cell wall.Peptidoglycan is composed of N-acetyl- glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid with cross-linking.A five amino acid peptide known as pentapeptide is linked to N-acetylmuramic acid and this peptide terminates as D-alanyl-D- alanine.Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) removes terminal alanine from D-alanyl -D-alanine and forms cross link with the adjacent peptide, thus enhancing cell wall rigidity.Beta lactam antibiotics are structurally similar to D-alanyl -D-alanine, and hence covalently bind to PBP, resulting in inhibition of transpeptidation reaction w hich is essential for the removal of D-alanine from D-alanyl-D- alanine.As peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited by cephalosporins as any other beta lactams, the bacterial cell dies. However cell death is maximum when the cells are actively growing and synthesizing cell wall.",A

Most serious adverse effect of ketoconazole is:,Adrenal insufficiency,Pellagra like skin lesion,Liver injury,Prostate cancer,"Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. Adverse effects Ketoconazole is much less toxic than AMB, but more side effects occur than with itraconazole or fluconazole, that have largely replaced it for systemic use. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting; can be reduced by giving the drug with meals. Others are-loss of appetite, headache, paresthesia, rashes and hair loss. Ketoconazole decreases androgen production from testes, and it displaces testosterone from protein binding sites. Gynaecomastia, loss of hair and libido, and oligozoospermia may be themanifestations. Menstrual irregularities occur in some women due to suppression of estradiol synthesis. A dose-dependent decrease in serum hydro coisone due to synthesis inhibition has also been noticed, but without any clinical manifestations in normal individuals. Mild and asymptomatic elevation of serum transaminases occurs in -5% patients, but serious hepatotoxicity is infrequent. It is contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women.

The most common source of pulmonary embolism is-,Amniotic fluid embolism,Renal artery embolism,Large veins of lower limb,Cardiothoracic surgery,"Pulmonary embolism

Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of pulmonary artery or one of its branches.
Pulmonary embolism is an extremely common and highly lethal condition that is a leading cause of death in all age groups.

Etiology

In more than 95% of instances, venous emboli originating from deep leg vein thrombi above the level of knee i.e. in popliteal, femoral or iliac veins.
Although the most common site of deep vein thrombosis is calf veins, calf veins thrombosis is itself associated with a low risk of embolism, but when the thrombosis progresses proximally to involve the larger veins above the leg then the risk becomes very high.
So,  Most common site of DVT → Calf veins

Most common source of pulmonary embolism → DVT of proximal veins of lower limb i.e., popliteal, femoral or iliac veins.
Pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism

If the size of embolus is large, it may be impacted at the bifurcation of main pulmonary artery → Saddle embolus, or may be passed out into the smaller, branching arterioles.
More commonly, there are multiple emboli, or a large embolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which are then impacted in a number of vessels, particularly affecting the lower lobes of lungs.
Rarely, Paradoxical embolism may occur by passage of an embolus from the right side of the heart into the left heart through ASD or VSD. In this way, pulmonary emboli may reach systemic circulation.",C

Immunity against cancer cells-,Basophills,Eosinophils,NK cells,Neutrophils,"NK cells are cytotoxic; small granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins such as perforin and proteases known as granzymes. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either apoptosis or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell lysis is impoant in immunology: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the virions, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. a-defensins, antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of neutrophils",C
Griseofulvin isnot useful in one of the following:,Tinea capitis,Tinea cruris,Tinea versicolor,Tinea pedis,"HETEROCYCLIC BENZOFURAN Griseofulvin It was one of the early antibiotics extracted from Penicillium griseofulvum. However, because of lack of antibacterial activity, little attention was paid to it: clinical utility in dermatophytosis was demonstrated only around 1960. Griseofulvin is active against most dermatophytes, including Epidermophyton, Trichophyton, Microsporum, etc., but not against Candida and other fungi causing deep mycosis. Bacteria are also insensitive. Dermatophytes actively concentrate it: this feature probably accounts for its selective toxicity. Resistance can be induced in vitro and this is associated with loss of concentrating ability. However, emergence of resistance during clinical use is rare. Griseofulvin interferes with mitosis-multinucleated and stunted fungal hyphae result from its action. It also causes abnormal metaphase configurations. However, unlike the typical mitotic inhibitors (colchicine, vinca alkaloids), it does not cause metaphase arrest; rather the daughter nuclei fail to move apa or move only a sho distance. It does not inhibit polymerization of tubulin (microtubular protein which pulls the chromosomes apa), but binds to polymerized microtubules and somehow disorients them.

With respect to her antiepileptic medication, wof should be considered",Leave her on current therapy,Switch to lamotrigine,Decrease valproate dose,None of the above,"Lamotrigine Mech of action:- Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic. It modifies maximal electric shock and decreases electrically evoked as well as photic after-discharge duration. Prolongation of Na+ channel inactivation and suppression of high frequency firing has been demonstrated. In addition, it may directly block voltage sensitive Na+ channels, thus stabilizing the presynaptic membrane and preventing release of excitatory neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate and aspaate. This may account for its broader-spectrum of antiseizure efficacy. uses:- Absence and myoclonic or akinetic epi-lepsy cases have also been successfully treated. Reduction in seizure frequency or complete control is obtained as frequently as with carbamazepine. Pharmacokinetics:- Lamotrigine is well absorbed orally and metabolized completely in liver. Its t 1/2 is 24 hr, but is reduced to ~16 hr in patients receiving phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. On the contrary valproate inhibits glucuronidation of lamotrigine and doubles its blood level, but valproate levels are lowered by lamotrigine. Reduce the dose of lamotrigine to half in patients taking valproate. However, metabolism of other anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives is not altered. Ref:- kd tripathi;pg num:-419",B

Which of the following is false about Digoxin,Dosage reduction is required in hepatic disease,Dosage direction is required in renal failure,It can cause bradycardia,It increases the force of contraction in congestive hea failure,"Refer kDT 7/e p516.. Medical useEdit Irregular heabeatEdit The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers are often preferred. There is tentative evidence that digoxin may increase the risk of death, though another meta-analysis in 2015 repoed no change in moality. Hea failureEdit Digoxin is no longer the first choice for hea failure; it has fallen out of or in people with hea failure because it may increase the risk of death. Currently, the recommendation for hea failure is a triple therapy of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker and mineralocoicoid antagonists. Digoxin is a third-line therapy. AboionEdit Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during aboions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise(measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration. Side effectsEdit Main aicle: List of side effects of digoxin Fuher information: Digoxin toxicity The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal as of 2005.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from defects in:,Ankyrin,Band 3,Spectrin,GPI,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a disease that results from acquired mutations in the phosphatidylinositol glycan complementation group A gene (PIGA), an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of ceain cell surface proteins. Proteins are anchored into the lipid bilayer in two ways. Most have a hydrophobic region that spans the cell membrane; these are called transmembrane proteins. The others are attached to the cell membrane through a covalent linkage to a specialized phospholipid called glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). In PNH, these GPI-linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutations that inactivate PIGA. Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 14.",D

The reticulocytes are larger RBCs that slightly increase the MCV. Anaplastic marrow is very hypocellular and unable to respond to anemia; it is associated with pancytopenia. The normal Coombs test results exclude autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Iron deficiency impairs the ability of the marrow to mount significant and sustained reticulocytosis. Iron deficiency anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic but could be partially masked here by reticulocytosis, which would not be as marked if iron were not available, but his diet is supplying needed iron.

Which is NOT pyrogenic Interleukin,IL-1,TNF-a,IL-4,IL-6,"(C) IL-4 # Pyrogenic cytokines: Known pyrogenic cytokines include IL-1, IL-6, TNF, ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), and interferon (INF)a. Others probably exist; although IL-18 - a membrane of the IL-1 family - does not appear to be pyrogenic cytokine. Each cytokine is encoded by a separate gene, and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF produce fever at low doses (10 to 100 ng/kg).> Fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1deg to 4degC, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is caused by infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level. IL-4 is involved in immediate hypersensitivity reactions.",C
Most common cause of aoic aneurysm is -,Atherosclerosis,Syphilis,Trauma,Congenital,"Aneurysms are congenital or acquired dilations of blood vessels or the hea . ""True"" aneurysms involve all three layers of the aery (intima, media, and adventitia) or the attenuated wall of the hea; these include atherosclerotic and congenital vascular aneurysms, as well as ventricular aneurysms resulting from transmural myocardial infarctions. By comparison, a false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm) results when a wall defect leads to the formation of an extravascular hematoma that communicates with the intravascular space (""pulsating hematoma""). Examples are ventricular ruptures contained by pericardial adhesions and leaks at the junction of a vascular graft with a natural aery. The two most impoant causes of aoic aneurysms are atherosclerosis and hypeension. Atherosclerosis is the more dominant factor in abdominal aoic aneurysms, while hypeension is associated with ascending aoic aneurysms. (Robbins basic pathology,9th edition.pg no.345)",A

Which of the following is the earliest event resulting from the effects of these factors?",Alteration in vasomotor tone regulation,Conversion of smooth muscle cells to foam cells,Dysfunction from endothelial injury,Inhibition of LDL oxidation,"Atherosclerosis is thought to result from an initial endothelial injury and the subsequent chronic inflammation and repair of the arterial intima. All risk factors, including smoking, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, cause biochemical or mechanical injury to the endothelium with resulting dysfunction that initiates smooth muscle migration with proliferation, as well as lymphocyte and monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Formation of foam cells occurs after the initial endothelial injury. Vasomotor tone does not play a major role in atherogenesis. Inhibition of LDL oxidation should diminish atheroma formation. Although lipoprotein receptor alterations can occur in some inherited conditions, these account for only a fraction of cases of atherosclerosis, and other lifestyle conditions do not affect their action.",C

Most important factor associated with progression of HIV positive to AIDS is?,Nutrition,Viral load,Age,CD4 count,"Ans is 'd' i.e. CD4 count * HIV can infect and kill many different types of cells in the body, but the primary targets are immune cells called CD4 T-cells. The CD4 T-cells are white blood cells that help coordinate the immune system's response to infection and disease. CD4 T-cells count is the most important factor determining HIV progression.* Patients progress to AIDS when their CD4 cell counts drop below 200 cells per microliter of blood. Healthy individuals have a CD4 cell count between 600 and 1,200 cells per microliter of blood. Individuals with a CD4 cell lower than 200 cells per microliter of blood have the greatest risk of developing opportunistic infections.* The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups. In those greater than six years of age it is:a. Stage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test.b. Stage 1: CD4 count > 500 cells/pi and no AIDS defining conditions.c. Stage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500 cells/pl and no AIDS defining conditions.d.

All are true regarding typhoid ulcer except -,Perforation is less common in children below 5yrs,Placed transversely along the ileum,Multiple ulcer found in terminal ileum,Perforation occurs in 3rd week,"Typhoid ulcers are placed longitudinally along the ileum.
On the other hand. Tubercular ulcers are placed transversely along the ileum (Mnemonic: (neck) tie lies longitudinally on the body).

Features of Typhoid ulcer -

Salmonella typhi primarily affects the ileum and colon, the terminal ileum is affected most often.
The Peyer's patches show ovoid ulcers with their long axes along the axis of the ileum (remember that in intestinal tuberculosis, the ulcers are transverse to the axis of the bowel).
The margins of the ulcer are slightly raised, and the base of the ulcers is base black due to the sloughed mucosa.
Though the enteric fever is an example of acute inflammation, neutrophils are invariably absent from cellular infiltrate and this is reflected in leucopenia with neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis in peripheral blood. The cellular infiltrates in typhoid consists of phagocytic histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Complications of Typhoid -

The most common complications of Typhoid are perforation and haemorrhage.
There is never significant fibrosis in case of typhoid, hence stenosis seldom occurs in healed typhoid lesions. (strictures are common features of intestinal Tuberculosis).",B

Steroid resistant nephritic syndrome ?,Nephrin,Alpha-actinin-4,Podocin,Transient Receptor Potential 6,Podocin The glomerular capillary wall is a filtering membrane and consists of the following structures i) Endothelial cells ii) Glomerular basement membrane iii) Visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) iv) Mesangial cells The visceral epithelial cell known as podocyte is impoant for the maintenance of glomerular barrier function. They are structurally complex cells that possess interdigitating foot processes (pedicels). The adjacent foot processes are separated by 20-30 rim wide filtration slits. The filtration slit or slit diaphragm maintains glomerular barrier function. They present a size selective distal diffusion barrier to the filtration of proteins and it is the cell type that is largely responsible for the synthesis of GBM components. Proteins located in the slit diaphragm control glomerular permeability. Impoant proteins have been identified in this regard - Nephrin - Podocin (impoant in structural organization of slit diaphragm) - CD2 associated protein and - Actin cytoskeleton The impoance of these proteins in maintaining glomerular permeability is demonstrated by the observation that mutations in the gene encoding them give rise to nephrotic syndrome.

Clopidogrel inhibit platelet aggregation by?,Inhibit gp 2b 3a,Inhibits phosphodiesterase,Inhibits ADP,Inhibits cyclooxygenase,"ANSWER: (C) Inhibits ADPREF: Goodman and Gillmans 11TH ed, Page 972TICLOPIDINE The agonists of purinergic receptors are extracellular nucleotides. Platelets contain two purinergic receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12; both are GPCRs for ADR The ADP-activated platelet P2Y1 receptor couples to the Gq-PLC-IP3-Ca2+ pathway and induces a shape change and aggregation. Activation of the P2Y12 receptor by ADP couples via Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase, resulting in lower levels of cyclic AMP and thereby less cyclic AMP-dependent inhibition of platelet activation. Apparently; both receptors must be stimulated for platelet activation, and inhibition of either receptor is sufficient to block platelet activation. Ticlopidine (TICLID) is a thieno pyridine that inhibits the P2Y12 receptor.CLOPIDOGREL The thieno pyridine dopidogrel (PLAVIX) is closely related to ticlopidine and appears to have a slightly more favorable toxicity profile with less frequent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, although TTP has been reportedABCIXIMAB Abciximab (REOPRO) is the Fab fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the IIa3h receptor.ASPIRIN: In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is thromboxane A2, a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor.

An hour later, he develops severe, painful myalgias and arthralgias. These symptoms abate within 24 hours. Which of the following occluding his arterioles is the most likely cause of his findings?",Fat globules,Fibrin clots,Nitrogen gas bubbles,Platelet thrombi,"These findings are characteristic of decompression sickness (the bends), a form of air embolism. At high pressures, such as occur during a deep scuba dive, nitrogen is dissolved in blood and tissues in large amounts. Ascending too quickly does not allow for slow release of the gas, and formation of small gas bubbles causes symptoms from occlusion of small arteries and arterioles. Fat globules in pulmonary arteries are a feature of fat embolism, which usually follows trauma. Fibrin thrombi may form with widespread activation of coagulation, as with DIC. Platelet thrombi may form with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Atherosclerosis typically occurs in elastic arteries, not arterioles.",C

Which of the following conditions involving the pancreas is most likely to be present?",Adenocarcinoma,Chronic pancreatitis,Cystic fibrosis,Islet cell adenoma,"The weight loss and pain suggest a malignant neoplasm. Jaundice (a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) occurs because of biliary tract obstruction by a mass in the head of the pancreas. Such a carcinoma may manifest with ""painless jaundice"" as well, but it is more likely to invade the nerves around the pancreas, causing pain. Islet cell adenoma is not as common as pancreatic carcinoma. An adenoma located near the ampulla could have an effect similar to that of carcinoma; however, weight loss with adenoma is unlikely. Chronic pancreatitis usually does not obstruct the biliary tract. In cystic fibrosis, there is progressive pancreatic acinar atrophy without a mass effect.

B/L Exudative pleural effusion seen in -,SLE,Lymphoma,CCF,Nephrotic syndrome,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition), page no.511 In pleural effusion (the presence of fluid in the pleural space) the fluid can be either a transudate or an exudate. When the pleural fluid is a transudate, the condition is termed hydrothorax. Hydrothorax from CHF probably is the most common cause of fluid accumulation in the pleural cavity. An exudate, characterized by protein content greater than 2.9gm/dL and, often, inflammatory cells, suggests pleuritis. The four principal causes of pleural exudate formation are (1) microbial invasion through either direct extension of a pulmonary infection or blood-borne seeding (suppurative pleuritis or empyema); (2) cancer (lung carcinoma, metastatic neoplasms to the lung or pleural surface, mesothelioma); (3) pulmonary infarction; and (4) viral pleuritis. Other, less common causes of exudative pleural effusions are systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid ahritis, and uremia, as well as previous thoracic surgery.

Methotrexate resistance is due to :,Depletion of folate,Overproduction of DHFRase,Overproduction of thymidylate kinase,Decreased DHFRase,"Mechanisms of pharmacokinetic and cellular resistance to methotrexate. Metabolism of methotrexate in the liver to paly inactive 7-hydroxymethotrexate reduces plasma concentrations of methotrexate and creates competition for cellular uptake RFC, which also internalizes reduced folates and folic acid, although with low affinity for the latter. Folate receptors mediate low affinity endocytosis of methotrexate. Quantitative or qualitative alterations in RFCs or folate-receptor expression confer transpo-related resistance to methotrexate, as do high levels of exogenous folates competing for cell entry. Intracellularly, methotrexate is metabolized to polyglutamated forms by FPGS, and these are broken down by FPGH. The monoglutamated forms and, to some extent, polyglutamated forms are expelled transpoers ABCC1-ABCC5 and ABCG2. ABCB1 does not transpo anionic drugs such as methotrexate. Polyglutamated forms of methotrexate can inhibit several key enzymes in folate metabolism, such as DHFR and TS, preventing de novo purine biosynthesis by APFase and AICAFase. Enzyme inhibition, folate depletion, and direct or indirect effects on cytokine release signaling pathways (such as those mediated by NFkB and IKK) all create routes which methotrexate could suppress RA.

IV diazepam has which of the following effect which is not seen by other routes ?,Analgesia,Sedation,Hypotension,Coronary dilatation,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Coronary dilatation Mechanism of action of benzodiazepines (BZDs) Benzodiazepines act preferentially on midbrain ascending reticular formation (which maintains wakefulness) and on limbic system (thought and mental function). Muscle relaxation is produced by action on medulla. Ataxia is due to action on cerebellum. BZDs acts on GABAA receptors. GABA,,, receptor has 5 subunits a / p, p, a / y. GABA binding site is on p. subunit, while BZDs binding site is on a / y subunit. BZDs receptor increase the conductance of Cl- channel. BZDs do not themselves increase Cl- conductance, i.e. they have only GABA facilitatory but no GABA mimetic action. (Barbiturates have both GABA facilitatory and GABA mimetic actions). Effect on CNS In contrast to barbiturates, BZDs are not general depressant, but exe relatively selective anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects. The antianxiety action of BZDs is not dependent on their sedative propey --> with chronic administration relief of anxiety is maintained, but drowsiness wanes off due to development of tolerance. Stage 2 sleep is increased, while REM, Stage 3 & 4 sleep are decreased. Nitrazepam is the only benzodiazepine, which increases REM sleep. Clonazepan and diazepam have more marked muscle relaxant propey. Clonazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and flurazepam have more prominent anticonvulsant activity than other BZDs. Diazepam (but not other BZDs) has analgesic action. Diazepam produces sho lasting coronary dilatation on i.v. injection. Diazepam decreases nocturnal gastric secretion and prevents stress ulcers.",D

Effective red cell diameter,Different in males and females,Diameter of 500 microns,Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter,Mixed iron and folic deficiency anemia produce microcytic,"Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

Tumor suppressor gene p53 prevents carcinoma by?,DNA repair,Cell cycle arrest,Apoptosis induction,All of the above,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above * p53 gene is located on chromosome 17 & acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell. p53 gene product, i.e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes.* When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels.* p53 causes :-a) Cell cycle arrest: p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor. p21 inhibit cyclin DCDK- 4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase. This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX. So p-53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA - p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against formation of cancer. Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of above protective mechanism.",D

Methotrexate is used in all except -,Sickle cell anemia,Psoriasis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Ankylosing spondylitis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sickle cell anemia Methotrexate in Rheumatoid arthritisMethotrexate is now considered the first line DMARD agent for most patients with Rheumatoid arthritis.Methotrexate is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of Rheumatoid arthritis as well as slowing or halting radiographic damage.It has relatively rapid onset of action at therapeutic doses good efficacy, favourable toxicity profile, ease of administration and relatively low cost.The antiinflammatory effect of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis appears to be related at least in part to interruption of adenosine and possible effect on TNF pathways.Which DMARD should be the drug of first choice remains controversial and trials have failed to demonstrate a consistent advantage of one over the other. Despite this, methotrexate has emerged as the DMARD of choice especially in individuals with risk factors for the development of bone erosions or persistent synovitis of> 3 months duration because of its relatively rapidity of action, its capacity to effect sustained improvement with ongoing therapy and the higher level of patient retention on therapy.Methotrexate in PsoriasisMethotrexate is a folate antagonist. It causes reduction in cells reproductive abilities.Methotrexate affects cells which divides quickly.In psoriasis cells divide more than usual.Methotrexate binds to these cells and inhibits enzymes involved in rapid growth of skin cells.It is commonly used to stop the progression of psoriatic arthritis and less commonly used in the t/t of severe psoriasis with no arthritis component.Methotrexate is an effective antipsoriasis agent It is especially useful in.Acute generalized pustular psoriasis.Psoriatic erythrodermaPsoriatic arthritis andExtensive chronic plaque psoriasisMethotrexate in Ankylosing spondylitisMethotrexate although widely used has not been shown benefit in ankylosing spondylitis. There is not enough evidence to be certain of the benefit and harms of methotrexate for ankylosing spondylitis and more research is needed.In ankylosing spondylitis the use of methotrexate is not recommended for the axial manifestations.The drug may have some efficacy in the peripheral involvement.For this disease there is lack of clinical trials and most of the trials did not show efficacy on the axial symptoms of the disease.",A

An endometrial biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following?",Adenocarcinoma,Choriocarcinoma,Leiomyosarcoma,Malignant mullerian mixed tumor,"Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding is a red flag for endometrial carcinoma. Such carcinomas often arise in the setting of endometrial hyperplasia. Increased estrogenic stimulation is thought to drive this process, and risk factors include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and infertility. Choriocarcinomas are gestational in origin. A submucosal leiomyosarcoma could produce vaginal bleeding, but the uterus would be enlarged because leiomyosarcomas tend to be large masses. Malignant mullerian mixed tumors are much less common than endometrial carcinomas, but they could produce similar findings. Malignant mullerian mixed tumors are typically uterine neoplasms that have glandular and stromal elements; the malignant stromal component can be heterologous and may resemble mesenchymal cells that are not ordinarily found in the myometrium, such as cartilage.

All of the following statements are true about warfarin except:-,It inhibits activation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors,It can cross placenta,Its half-life is approximately 36 hours,Its dose should be increased in liver disease,"WARFARIN It acts by inhibiting the activation of vitamin K dependent clotting factors. These factors include clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Half life of warfarin is 36-48 hours. Bleeding is the most common adverse effect of all anticoagulants. If a patient develops bleeding due to overdose of warfarin, fresh frozen plasma (to supply clotting factors) is the treatment of choice but specific antidote is vitamin K1 (but the action will be delayed). It crosses the placenta and can cause fetal warfarin syndrome; also known as Contradi syndrome (growth retardation, stippled epiphyses, hypoplasia of nose and hand bones etc.) if used during pregnancy (therefore contraindicated). Prothrombin time is used to adjust the dose of warfarin (because it mainly affects the extrinsic pathway).

Which of the following morphologic features is most likely to be seen in his adrenal glands?",Cortical atrophy,Cortical hyperplasia,Cortical nodule,Medullary atrophy,"Adrenogenital syndrome can lead to precocious puberty, which is most commonly associated with a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase. The lack of this enzyme reduces cortisol production, driving corticotropin production, which leads to adrenal hyperplasia and the production of sex steroid hormones. Bilateral adrenal cortical atrophy is typically seen in cases of Addison disease or after long-term exogenous glucocorticoid therapy. A nodule in the adrenal cortex that has zona glomerulosa cells produces primary hyperaldosteronism; if it has zona fasciculata cells, it produces Cushing syndrome. Most adrenal nodules are nonfunctional and incidental findings. A nodule in the adrenal medulla, if functional, produces catecholamines, and older patients with such nodules have hypertension. Medullary atrophy is rare but might result from infections or toxins. Medullary hyperplasia is uncommon but could also produce catecholamines.",B

Raised AFP is typically seen with?,Hepatitis,Seminoma,HCC,All of the above,"Ans. C. HCC. (Ref. Robbin's Pathology8th/pg. 666, 695; Harrison-17th/pg. 483, 587, 614)AFP# AFP is a glycoprotein normally synthesized by the fetal yolk sac and several other fetal tissues. Approximately 50% of HCC patients have elevated serum?-fetoprotein.# However, this tumor ""marker"" lacks specificity, because modest elevations are also encountered in other conditions, such as- cirrhosis,- massive liver necrosis,- chronic hepatitis,- normal pregnancy,- fetal distress or death,- fetal neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida, and- gonadal germ cell tumors.# Very high levels (>1000 ng/mL), however, are rarely encountered except in HCC.PProstate-specific antigen (PSA)# It is a glycoprotein which is a serine protease.# Its function may be to facilitate liquefaction of semen, but it is a marker for prostatic disease.# It is measured by an immunoassay and the normal range can differ a little from laboratory to laboratory.# The normal upper limit is about 4 nmol/ml.# Its level in men with metastatic prostate cancer is usually increased to >30 nmol/ml and falls to low levels after successful androgen ablation.# Men with locally confined prostate cancer usually have serum PSA levels <15 nmol/ml. Although PSA is a reliable marker for the progress of advanced disease it is neither specific nor sensitive in the differential diagnosis of early prostate cancer and BPH, as both diseases are compatible with PSA in the range of 4-12 nmol/ml.# PSA measurement has superseded measurement of serum acid phosphatase.# PSA is good at following the course of advanced disease.# It is lacking in sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of early localised prostate cancer.# Nevertheless, the finding of a PSA >10 nmol/ml is suggestive of cancer and >35 ng/ml is diagnostic of advanced prostate cancer.# A decrease of PSA to the normal range following hormonal ablation is a good prognostic sign.Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA):# CEA, which is elaborated by carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, stomach, and breast, and ?-fetoprotein, which is produced by hepatocellular carcinomas, yolk sac remnants in the gonads, and occasionally teratocarcinomas and embryonal cell carcinomas.# CEA and?-fetoprotein assays lack both specificity and sensitivity required for the early detection of cancers. They are still particularly useful in the detection of recurrences after excision. With successful resection of the tumor, these markers disappear from the serum.QTumor markers for testicular tumor# hCG: HCG produced by neoplastic syncytiotrophoblastic cells, is always elevated in patients with choriocarcinoma. Other germ cell tumors, including seminoma, may also elaborate hCG. Approximately 10% to 25% of seminomas elaborate hCG.# AFP: RAISED in yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor. AFP is a reliable indicator of the presence of a nonseminomatous component to the germ cell neoplasm, because yolk sac elements are not found in pure seminomas. Because mixed patterns are common, most nonseminomatous tumors have elevations of both hCG and AFP.# In addition to the primary diagnosis and staging of testicular germ cell tumors, serial determinations of hCG and AFP is useful for monitoring patients for persistent or recurrent tumor after therapy.TumorMarkersMelanomaHMB45, S-100, TyrosinaseCa PancreasCA 19-9, PIVKANeuroblastomaLDH, Ferritin, Neuron specific enolaseGistc-KITMCTCalcitoninSCLCNeuron specific enolaseOvarian cancer and some lymphomasCA-125Adenocarcinoma of colon, breast, pancreasCEACA-125NeuroblastomaLDHLymphoma Ewing's sarcoma Dysgerminoma Seminoma Gonadal germ cell tumor HCCAFPGonadal germ cell tumorHCG",C

Cytochrome c, together with some cofactors, activates caspase-9, while other proteins block the activities of caspase antagonists that function as physiologic inhibitors of apoptosis. The net result is the activation of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation. If cells are exposed to growth factors and other survival signals, they synthesize antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the two main ones of which are Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL. These proteins antagonize Bax and Bak, and thus limit the escape of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. Cells deprived of growth factors not only activate the pro-apoptotic proteins but also show reduced levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thus further tilting the balance toward death.APOPTOSISIntrinsic pathwayInvolved in tissue remodeling in embryogenesis. Occurs when a regulating factor is withdrawn from a proliferating cell population (e.g., * 1L-2 after a completed immunological reaction>>apoptosis of proliferating effector cells). Also occurs after exposure to injurious stimuli (e.g., radiation, toxins, hypoxia). Changes in proportions of anti- and pro- apoptotic factors lead to*mitochondrial permeability and cytochrome c release. BAX and BAK are pro- apoptotic proteins; Bcl-2 is anti-apoptotic. Bcl-2 prevents cytochrome c release by binding to and inhibiting Apaf-1. Apaf-1 normally induces the activation of caspases. If Bcl-2 is overexpressed (e.g., follicular lymphoma), then Apaf-1 is overly inhibited, leading to*caspase activation and tumorigenesis.Extrinsic pathway2 pathways: - Ligand receptor interactions (FasL binding to Fas [CD95J) and immune cell (cytotoxic T-cell release of perforin and granzyme B) Fas-FasL interaction is necessary in thymic medullary negative selection.

B: Post-prandial abdominal pain, weight loss, chronic mesenteric vessel occlusion The 3 aeries supplying the gut are the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric. Unless significant stenoses or actual occlusion of 2 of the 3 vessels is present, efficient collateral circulation between the celiac and superior mesenteric aeries (i.e., the pancreaticoduodenal arcades) and the superior and inferior mesenteric aeries (i.e., the meandering mesenteric aery) ensures that blood flow to the gut generally is adequate. The internal iliac aeries also may be an impoant source of collateral hindgut and midgut perfusion in the presence of inferior mesenteric aerial occlusion. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease (chronic process).

"In myocardial, the Reperfusion injury maximum effect is caused due to -",Neutrophil,Monocytes,Free radicals,Eosinophils,"Reperfusion injury refers to myocardial vascular or electrophysiological dysfunction that is induced by the restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissue.
o Manifestation includes:

Reperfusion arrhythmias.
Endothelial cell damage leading to microvascular dysfunction,
Myocardial stunning.
Myocyte death and infarction.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY-
When blood flow to cardiac myocytes is disrupted by occlusion of a coronary artery, a series of events is set in motion that results in cellular injury and death. These processes are largely related to energy production and utilization and include the following :

Reduced energy production with a fall in intracellular ATP levels,
A transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy utilization,
An accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism,
Reduced intracellular pH.

Factors that contribute to reperfusion injury include the following :

Damage to cellular and organelle membranes, including mitochondria,
Myocyte hypercontracture.
Free radical formation.
Aggregation of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators,
Platelet activation.
Complement activation.
Activation of the pro-apoptotic signalling cascade.
Endothelium damage and vasoconstriction.

Oxygen and other free radicals -

Free radicals are produced within a minute of reperfusion and continue to be generated for hours after the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue.
Superoxide anion (O2)
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
Hypochlorous acid (HClO)
Nitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite.
Hydroxyl radical (OH)
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the development of these free radicals including xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils, electron leakage from ischemic mitochondrion, catecholamine oxidation, as well as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes.
The relative importance of each of these pathways is not clear, but they are probably interrelated and may potentiate one another.
Free radicals damage myocytes directly by altering membrane proteins and phospholipids. Because these membrane constituents play crucial roles as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, free radical injury can lead to fatal metabolic and structure derangements. As an example, oxygen radicals inure the sarcolemma and may impair the contractile function of the myocyte on this basis. The role for free radicals as a source of significant myocardial damage is further supported by studies showing that free radical scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase, administered during thrombolytic therapy help preserve myocardial function. Finally, reactive oxygen species stimulate leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and leukocyte-endothelial adherence.",C

Which of the following antimicrobial is not given in pregnancy: September 2011,Penicillin G,Quinolone,Cephalosporin,Erythromycin,"Ans. B: Quinolone Betalactam antibiotics (penicillins and most of the cephalosporins) are safe during pregnancy Erythromycin base is safe but erythromycin estolate should be avoided Quinolones and fluoroquinolones They are chemotherapeutic bactericidal drugs, eradicating bacteria by interfering with DNA replication. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial DNA gyrase or the topoisomerase II enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily porins and, therefore, are often used to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many Gram-negative bacteria, DNA gyrase is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many Gram-positive bacteria. Theophylline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and coicosteroids enhance the toxicity of fluoroquinolones. Products containing multivalent cations, such as aluminum- or magnesium-containing antacids and products containing calcium, iron, or zinc, invariably result in marked reduction of oral absorption of fluoroquinolones. Many fluoroquinolones, especially ciprofloxacin, inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2.This inhibition causes an increased level of, for example, antidepressants such as amitriptyline and imipramine, clozapine (an atypical antipsychotic), caffeine, olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic). Fluoroquinolones are well tolerated, with most side effects being mild to moderate. Some of the serious adverse effects that occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity.Fluoroquinolones are sometimes associated with an QTc interval prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, tendon rupture, torsade de pointes and hypoglycemia. Moxifloxacin carries a higher risk of QTc prolongation Gatifloxacin has been most frequently linked to disturbed blood sugar levels, although all quinolones carry these risks. Some quinolones were withdrawn from the market because of these adverse events (for example, sparfloxacin was associated with phototoxicity and QTc prolongation, thrombocytopenia and nephritis were seen with tosufloxacin, and hepatotoxicity with trovafloxacin).Fluoroquinolones are considered high-risk antibiotics for the development of Clostridium difficile and MRSA infections. The CNS is an impoant target for fluoroquinolone-mediated neurotoxicity. Moxifloxacin came out worst among the quinolones for causing CNS toxicity. Quinolones are contraindicated if a patient has epilepsy, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, CNS inflammation or those who have suffered a stroke.There are safety concerns of fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy and, as a result, are contraindicated except for when no other safe alternative antibiotic exists.

These are consequence of anaemia or leucocytosis. Some patients may also present with signs of abnormal hemostatis such as bleeding gum. Peripherial smear shows pancytopenia? o The no. of Leukemic cells in peripheral blood in AML is highly variable sometimes being more than 10000 cell/ ml but being under 10,000 in 50% of patients. o Occasionally the peripheral smear may not contain any blasts (aleukemic leukemia). So even in pts with pancytopenia bone marrow examination is essential to exclude acute leukenia. Bone marrow examination reveals 26% blast/cells :? o Harrison says ? ""The diagnosis of AML is established by presence of more than 20% myeloblast in bone marrow."" The blast cells were mature and contain Auer rods: o Auer rods are red staining rod like structures (representing abnormal azurophilic granules) present in myeloblast in AML. The presence of Auer rods is considered as definite evidence of myeloid differentiation. They are most numerous in M3 form ofAML. Neutrophil with Pseudo Pelger Huet anomaly :? o Pseudo Pelger Huet cells are neutrophils with only 2 nuclear lobes and are frequently seen in myelodysplastic syndrome.

The execution phase of apoptosis which mediates the final phase of apoptosis is associated with which of the following caspase?,Caspase 9,Caspase 8,Caspase 3,Caspase 1,"The two initiating pathways converge to a cascade of caspase activation, which mediates the final phase of apoptosis. The mitochondrial pathway leads to activation of the initiator caspase-9, and the death receptor pathway to the initiator caspases-8 and 10. After an initiator caspase is cleaved to generate its active form, the enzymatic death program is set in motion by rapid and sequential activation of the executioner caspases. Executioner caspases, such as caspase-3 and 6, act on many cellular components. Cleave an inhibitor of a cytoplasmic DNase and thus make the DNase enzymatically active; this enzyme induces cleavage of DNA. Caspases also degrade structural components of the nuclear matrix and thus promote fragmentation of nuclei.",C

A 65 year old man with mild hea failure is treated with a loop diuretic. A few days later the man complains of muscle weakness. Laboratory results are shown below. Aerial PCO2: 48 mm Hg Aerial pH: 7.49 Plasma HCO3-: 35 mEq/L Which of the following is most likely decreased in this man?,Plasma angiotensin,Plasma potassium,Potassium excretion,Renin secretion,"The data shown in the table indicate that the man has developed metabolic alkalosis (increased PCO2, pH, and HCO3-), which occurs commonly with overuse of diuretics (thiazides and loop diuretics). The overuse of a loop diuretic increases the excretion of sodium and potassium by the kidneys. the increase in potassium excretion leads to a decrease in plasma potassium levels. The sodium depletion stimulates renin secretion, which in turn raises angiotensin II levels in the plasma (which also stimulates aldosterone secretion). Ref: Michel T., Hoffman B.B. (2011).

Lung carcinomas most frequently metastasize to -,Brain,Liver,Adrenal,Bone,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no.502 Bronchogenic carcinoma can invade the adjoining structures directly, or may spread by lymphatic and haematogenous routes: 1. Direct spread. The tumour extends directly by invading through the wall of the bronchus and destroys and replaces the peribronchial lung tissue. As it grows fuher, it spreads to the opposite bronchus and lung, into the pleural cavity, the pericardium and the myocardium and along the great vessels of the hea causing their constriction. Extension of the cancer located at the apex of the lung into the thoracic cage may involve brachial plexus and the sympathetic chain causing pain and sensory disturbances, so called Pancoast's syndrome. 2. Lymphatic spread. Initially, hilar lymph nodes are affected. Later, lymphatic metastases occur to the other groups leading to spread to mediastinal, cervical, supraclavicular and para-aoic lymph nodes. Invasion of the thoracic duct may produce chylous ascites. 3. Haematogenous spread. Distant metastases blood stream are widespread and early. The sites affected, in descending order of involvement, are: the liver, adrenals, bones, pancreas, brain, opposite lung, kidneys and thyroid",A

SLE is which type of hypersensitivity reaction: March 2005,Type I hypersensitivity,Type II hypersensitivity,Type III hypersensitivity,Type IV hypersensitivity,"Ans. C: Type III hypersensitivity Type III hypersensitivity response (Immune-complex mediated response) Examples are: Some form of glomerulonephritis Serum sickness Ahus reaction SLE Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing and anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-EN A) form the mainstay of serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically the most widely used method is indirect immunofluorescence. The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the patient's serum. ANA screening yields positive results in many connective tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases.",C
All of the following is true except aEUR',NADPH oxidase acts superoxide ions,Chediak-Higashi syndrome is due to defective phagolysosome,In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected,Myeloperodixase action is mainly due to OCIaEUR',"In Brutons aganunaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected [Ref : Harrison 171h/e p. 381; Bobbin's 7""Ve p. 60, 61, 62, 210, 591 During phagocytosis there is rapid respiratory burst which is brought about by rapid burst in the activity of NADPH oxidase. Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (02-) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (1-1,02) free radical. The 11,0, generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself However, the azurophilic , granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as Cl? conves H202 to hypochlorite (HOCI). Hypochloth'e (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H20,- MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterial. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are ? - Melanosotnes of melanocytes - Dense bodies of platelets - Granules of schwann cells In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour (-)f skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy. More on chediak higashi syndrome Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked disease that occurs mainly in males. It is caused due to defect in the gene Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Bruton's tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in B cell maturation as well as mast cell activation. Defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase leads to failure of maturation of B cells. B cells cannot mature beyond pro B cell stage. In the absence of mature B cell, patient lacks lymphoid tissue and fails to develop plasma cells, (the cells that produce antibodies). Thus there is absence of immunoglobulins of all classes in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia. Germinal centres, where B cells proliferate and differentiate are poorly developed, in all lymphoid tissues including the .spleen, tonsils, adenoids, peripheral lymph nodes. Peyer patches in the intestine are small or absent. Clinical features Patients with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia do not manifest any symptoms till 6 months of life (due to the presence-of maternal antibodies). These patients are susceptible to infections with capsulated bacterias because antibody response is vital to kill encapsulated bacterias. Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, 11 ifluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsoni us). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",C

DNA repairs defect associated with aEUR',Xeroderma pigmentosum,Icthyosis,Mosaicism,??,"Xeroderma pigmentosum Genomic instability - enabler of malignancy The maintenance of integrity of information in D.N.A. molecule is of utmost impoance. Cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to monitor the integrity of the genetic material. A number of complex multisubunit enzyme systems are involved in repair of damaged DNA or to prevent any error during DNA synthesis. Despite the elaborate proofreading system employed during DNA synthesis, errors including base pairing or inseion of one to a few extra nucleotides can occur. In addition, DNA is constantly being subjected to environmental insults that cause the alteration or removal of nucleotide bases. - Base are also altered or lost spontaneously from mammalian DNA at a rate many thousands per cell per day. - If the damage is not repaired a permanent mutation (genomic instability) may be introduced that can result in any of a number of deleterious effects including loss of control over the proliferation of a mutated cell leading to cancer. Luckily cells are remarkably efficient at repairing damage done to their DNA. When there is a defect in DNA the cell cycle stops for a while, allowing the damaged DNA time for repair. If the DNA cannot be repaired it undergoes apoptosis. Most of the repair systems involve :? - Recognition of the damage on the DNA - Removal or excision of the damage - Replacement or, filling the gap left by excision using sister strand as template for DNA synthesis - Typically genomic instability occurs when both copies of the DNA repair gene are lost, however recent work has suggested that even a subset of these genes may promote cancer in haploinsufficient manner. Persons with defect in DNA repair continue to replicate damaged DNA rather than stopping to allow repair or undergoing apoptosis. -There are several inherited disorders in which genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair are defective. - Individuals born with such inherited defects in DNA repair proteins are at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. - The defect in DNA repair protein leads to genomic instability which enables malignancy. - DNA repairing genes themselves are not oncogenic but their abnormalities allow mutations in other genes during the process of normal cell division. Three types of DNA repair defects contributes to different types of cancers Mismatch repair Nucleotide excision repairQ Recombination repair",A

In contrast to infective endocarditis, the sterile valvular lesions of NBTE are nondestructive.
The vegetations in NBTE are typically small (1 to 5 mm in diameter)  and valvular damage is not a prerequisite. Indeed, the condition usually occurs on previously normal valves. Rather, hypercoagulable states are the usual precursor to NBTE; such conditions include chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyperestrogenic states, and those associated with underlying malignancy, particularly mucinous adenocarcinomas. This last association probably relates to the procoagulant effect of circulating mucin and/or tissue factor elaborated by these tumors. Endocardial trauma, such as from an indwelling catheter, also is a well-recognized predisposing condition.

Snail track ulcer and cobblestone appearance are seen together in:,Secondary syphilis,Heck's disease,Tertiary syphilis,Pyostomatitis vegetans,"In secondary syphilis, only snail track ulcers are seen.
Hyperplastic lesions in Heck's disease are small (0.3–1.0 cm), discrete, and well-demarcated, but they frequently cluster so closely together that the entire mucosal area takes on a cobblestone or fissured appearance.
Patients with pyostomatitis vegetans exhibit characteristic yellowish, slightly elevated, linear, serpentine pustules set on an erythematous oral mucosa. The lesions primarily affect the buccal and labial mucosa, soft palate, and ventral tongue. These lesions have been called “snail track” ulcerations, although in most instances, the lesions are probably not truly ulcerated. 
The most frequently affected area was the buccal mucosa which presented a ‘cobblestone’ appearance, while the vestibular lesions appeared as folds and ulcers.

"A 44-year-old businessman presents to a physician because of a markedly inflammed and painful right great toe. He states that he just returned from a convention, and had noticed increasing pain in his right foot during his flight back home. Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",Allopurinol,Aspirin,Colchicine,Probenecid,"The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance. Therapy with these agents should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided.",C

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by:September 2010,Microcytosis,Macrocytosis,Splenomegaly,Autosplenectomy,"Ans. D: AutosplenectomySickle cell anemia causes autosplenism by causing hypoxia and infarcts in the spleen. Since in the spleen blood flow is sluggish, the oxygen tension is low.When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen ""disappears"" completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').",D

"During a routine physical examination, a 42-year-old female is found to have an elevated blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg. Workup reveals a small left kidney and a normal-sized right kidney. Laboratory examination reveals elevated serum renin levels. Fuher workup reveals that renal vein renin levels are increased on the left but decreased on the right. This patient's hypeension is most likely the result of",Atherosclerotic narrowing of the left renal aery,Atherosclerotic narrowing of the right renal aery,Fibromuscular hyperplasia of the left renal aery,Fibromuscular hyperplasia of the right renal aery,"A rare cause of hypeension is renal aery stenosis, which may occur secondary to either an atheromatous plaque at the orifice of the renal aery or fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal aery. The former is more common in elderly men, while the latter is more common in young women. The decrease in blood flow to the kidney with the renal aery obstruction (Goldblatt's kidney) causes hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and increased renin production. This produces increased secretion of angiotensin and aldosterone, which leads to retention of sodium and water and produces hypeension. Increased levels of aldosterone also produce a hyperkalemic alkalosis. The kidney with stenosis of the renal aery becomes small and shrunken due to the effects of chronic ischemia, but the stenosis protects this kidney from the effects of the increased blood pressure. The other kidney, however, is not protected and may develop microscopic changes of benign nephrosclerosis (hyaline aeriolosclerosis).

Cell injury occurs due to,Decreased cellular ATP generation,Cytosolic Ca++,Membrane damage,Intracellular K+,"Cell injury occurs due to decreased generation of cellular ATP ATP is necessary for Na+--K+ ATPase pump and Ca pump action and many other cellular functions for the existence of the cell THE MORPHOLOGY OF CELL AND TISSUE INJURY It is useful to describe the structural alterations that occur in damaged cells before we discuss the biochemical mecha- nisms that bring about these changes. All stresses and noxious influences exe their effects first at the molecular or biochemical level. Cellular function may be lost long before cell death occurs, and the morphologic changes of cell injury (or death) lag far behind both (Fig. 1-7). For example, myocardial cells become noncontractile after 1 to 2 minutes of isch- emia, although they do not die until 20 to 30 minutes of ischemia have elapsed. These myocytes may not appear dead by electron microscopy for 2 to 3 hours, or by light microscopy for 6 to 12 hours. The cellular derangements of reversible injury can be corrected, and if the injurious stimulus abates, the cell can return to normalcy. Persistent or excessive injury, however, causes cells to pass the nebulous ""point of no return"" into irreversible injury and cell death. The events that determine when reversible injury becomes irreversible and progresses to cell death remain poorly understood. The clinical rele- vance of this question is obvious; if the biochemical and molecular changes that predict cell death can be identified with precision, it may be possible to devise strategies for preventing the transition from reversible to irreversible cell injury. Although there are no definitive morphologic or biochemical correlates of irreversibility, two phenomena con- sistently characterize irreversibility: the inability to correct mito- chondrial dysfunction (lack of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation) even after resolution of the original injury, and profound disturbances in membrane function. As mentioned earlier, injury to lysosomal membranes results in the enzymatic dissolution of the injured cell, which is the culmination of injury progressing to necrosis. As mentioned earlier, different injurious stimuli may induce death by necrosis or apoptosis (Fig. 1-6 and Table Refer robbins 9/e p6",A

Antibacterial spectrum: PnG is a narrow spectrum antibiotic; activity is limited primarily to gram-positive bacteria, few gram negative ones and anaerobes.
Cocci: Streptococci (except viridans, group D or enterococci) are highly sensitive, so are many pneumococci. Staph. aureus, though originally very sensitive, has acquired resistance to such an extent that it must be counted out of PnG spectrum. Gram negative cocci-Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis are susceptible to PnG, though increasing number of gonococci have developed partial and other high degree resistance.
Bacilli: Gram-positive bacilli – majority of B. anthracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and practically all Clostridia (tetani and others), listeria are highly sensitive, so are spirochetes (Treponema pallidum, Leptospira, and others), but Bacteroides fragilis is largely resistant.
Actinomyces israelii is only moderately sensitive.
Majority of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rickettsiae, chlamydiae, protozoa, fungi and viruses are totally insensitive to PnG.
Gonorrhea: PnG has become unreliable for the treatment of gonorrhoea.
Syphilis: T. pallidum has not shown any resistance and PnG is the drug of choice. Early and latent syphilis is treated either with daily i.m. injection of 1.2 MU of procaine penicillin for 10 days or with 1-3 weekly doses of 2.4 MU benzathine penicillin. For late syphilis, benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU weekly for 4 weeks is recommended. Cardiovascular and neurosyphilis requires sod. PnG 5 MU i.m 6 hourly for 10-14 days followed by the above regimen.

Mechanism of secretion of macro molecules by cell in the manner of fusion with vesicle is,Phagocytosis,Pinocytosis,Exocytosis,Endocytosis,"(A) Phagocytosis # Phagocytosis:> Phagocytosis is the cellular process of phagocytes and protists of engulfing solid particles by the cell membrane to form an internal phagosome. Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis involving the vesicular internalization of solid particles, such as bacteria, and is therefore distinct from other forms of endocytosis such as the vesicular internalization of various liquids.# Pinocytosis> In cellular biology, pinocytosis (""cell-drinking"", ""bulk-phase pinocytosis"", ""nonspecific, non-adsorptive pinocytosis"", ""fluid endocytosis"") is a form of endocytosis in which small particles are brought into the cell suspended within small vesicles which subsequently fuse with lysosomes to hydrolyze, or to break down, the particles.# Exocytosis> Exocytosis is the durable process by which a cell directs the contents of secretory vesicles out of the cell membrane.# Endocytosis> Endocytosis is the process by which cells absorb molecules (such as proteins) from outside the cell by engulfing it with their cell membrane. It is used by all cells of the body because most substances important to them are large polar molecules that cannot pass through the hydrophobic plasma membrane or cell membrane. The process opposite to endocytosis is exocytosis.",A

Which of the following statement is false regarding phenobarbitone: September 2011,Act primarily at the GABA: BZD receptor-Chloride ion channel complex,Crosses placenta,May precipitate porphyria,No significant interaction with warfarin,"Ans. D: N significant interaction with warfarin Barbiturates stimulates hepatic microsomal catabolism of warfarin Phenobarbital/ Phenobarbitone It is a barbiturate It is the most widely used anticonvulsant worldwide, and the oldest still commonly used. The World Health Organization recommends its use as first-line for paial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (those formerly known as grand mal) in developing countries. It is still commonly used to treat neonatal seizures. Phenobarbital is indicated in the treatment of all types of seizures except absence seizures. Sedation and hypnosis are the principal side effects (occasionally, they are also the intended effects) of phenobarbital. Central nervous system effects like dizziness, nystagmus and ataxia are also common. In elderly patients, it may cause excitement and confusion while in children, it may result in paradoxical hyperactivity. Another very rare side effect is amelogenesis imperfecta Contraindication: Acute intermittent porphyria, oversensitivity for barbiturates, prior dependence on barbiturates, severe respiratory insufficiency and hyperkinesia in children The principal mechanism of action of barbiturates is believed to be their affinity for the GABAA receptor (Acts on GABA : BDZ receptor Cl- channel complex). GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). Barbiturates bind to the GABAA receptor at the alpha subunit, which are binding sites distinct from GABA itself. Like benzodiazepines, barbiturates potentiate the effect of GABA at this receptor. In addition to this GABA-ergic effect, barbiturates also block the AMPA receptor, a subtype of glutamate receptor. Phenobarbital has an oral bioavailability of approximately 90%. Peak plasma concentrations are reached 8 to 12 hours after oral administration. It is one of the longest-acting barbiturates available - it remains in the body for a very long time (half-life of 2 to 7 days) and has very low protein binding (20 to 45%). Phenobarbital is metabolized by the liver, mainly through hydroxylation and glucuronidation, and induces many isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system. Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) is specifically induced by Phenobarbital It is excreted primarily by the kidneys Phenobarbital markedly reduces effect of warfarin",D
Insulin sensitivity increases with following treatment except:,Metformin,Acarbose,Exercise,Fasting,"Ans: D (Fasting) Ref: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed, 2011 Pg 1246. 1258. 1264.1270Explanation:Insulin sensitivity refers to the amount of glucose that can be cleared from the blood with a given dose of insulin Insulin sensitivity may be altered b\ age. body weight, exercise, diseases and drugs. Active persons are found to be more sensitive to insulin compared to those with sedentary life style. Insulin sensitivity has been found to be inversely related to age with insulin resistance more common in the elderly due to reduced physical activity.In hyperglycemic state, metformin decreases blood glucose by lowering hepatic glucose production and enhancing peripheral glucose uptake. This is attributed to increase in insulin sensitivity and reduction in insulin resistance.Acarbose an u-glucosidase inhibitor by reducing postprandial plasma glucose increases the release of glucoregulatory hormone. GLIM. As a result acarbose increases insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose.Easting leads to hypoglycemia which is associated with reduction of insulin secretion and the release of counter regulatory hormones namely epinephrine, glucagon, glucocorticoids etc. Hence the answer to above question is fasting which does not increase insulin sensitivity.",D

Which of the following anti-tubercular drug is associated with red-green color blindness?,Cycloserine,Isoniazid,Pyrazinamide,Ethambutol,"Ethambutol is a synthetic, water-soluble, heat-stable compound, the dextro-isomer dispensed as the dihydrochloride salt. Ethambutol inhibits mycobacterial arabinosyl transferases, which are encoded by the embCAB operon. Arabinosyl transferases are involved in the polymerization reaction of arabinoglycan, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Resistance to ethambutol is due to mutations resulting in overexpression of emb gene products or within the embB structural gene. Hypersensitivity to ethambutol is rare. The most common serious adverse event is retrobulbar neuritis, resulting in loss of visual acuity and red-green color blindness. This dose-related adverse effect is more likely to occur at dosages of 25 mg/kg/d continued for several months. At 15 mg/kg/d or less, visual disturbances are very rare. Periodic visual acuity testing is desirable if the 25 mg/kg/d dosage is used. Ethambutol is relatively contraindicated in children too young to permit assessment of visual acuity and red-green color discrimination.

Epitheloid granuloma consists mainly of which type of cells:,B cells,T cells,Monocytes,Macrophages,"Ans. D: Macrophages Macrophages/ histiocytes are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells. The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as ""epithelioid"". Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with eosin. Granulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and non-infectious. Infections that are characterized by granulomas tuberculosis leprosy histoplasmosis cryptococcosis coccidioidomycosis blastomycosis cat scratch disease. Examples of non-infectious granulomatous diseases are Sarcoidosis (Sarcoid granulomas often contain star-shaped structures termed asteroid bodies or lamellar structures termed Schaumann bodies) Crohn's disease berylliosis Wegener's granulomatosis Churg-Strauss syndrome Pulmonary rheumatoid nodules Aspiration of food and other paiculate material into the lung.",D

"A 39-year-old female presents with chronic abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and periodic facial flushing. Physical examination reveals wheezing and a slightly enlarged liver. Workup reveals several masses within the liver and a large mass in the small intestine. Which one of the listed substances is most likely to be elevated in the urine of this individual as a result of her disease?",5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA),Aminolevulinic acid (ALA),N-formiminoglutamate (FIGlu),Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA),"The patient shows signs of the carcinoid syndrome, which include flushing, diarrhea, and bronchoconstriction. The syndrome results from elaboration of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) by a primary carcinoid tumor in the lungs or ovary, or from hepatic metastases from a primary carcinoid tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. However, primary appendiceal carcinoid tumors, the most common gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, very rarely metastasize and are viually always asymptomatic. Carcinoid tumors arise from cells of the neuroendocrine system, which, as pa of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, are capable of secreting many products. Grossly, carcinoid tumors, which tend to be multiple when they occur in the stomach or intestines, are characteristically solid and firm and have a yellow-tan appearance on sectioning. Histologically they are composed of nests of relatively bland-appearing monotonous cells. Diagnosis is based on finding increased urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion from metabolism of excess serotonin. In contrast, increased urinary levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) are seen with lead toxicity, increased N-formiminoglutamate (FIGlu) with folate deficiency, and increased normetanephrine or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) with tumors of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma in adults and neuroblastoma in children) Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) occur from mutation of-,c-KIT oncogene,c-KTT oncogene,c-KTT oncogene,c-RET oncogene,"GIST is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the abdomen PATHOGENESIS Approximately 75% to 80% of all GISTs have oncogenic, gain-of-function mutations of the gene encoding the tyrosine kinase c-KIT, which is the receptor for stem cell factor. Another 8% of GISTs have mutations that activate a related tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA); thus activating mutations in tyrosine kinases are found in viually all GISTs. However, either mutation is sufficient for tumorigenesis, and c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations are almost never found in a single tumor.

P53 is an example of a pro-apoptotic gene k/a Guardian of Genome. If DNA is damaged / mutated p53, repairs it. But if defect is beyond repair - Activation of pro-apoptotic machinery - Apoptosis Result: - Reduced cell mutation rate The p53 protein is the central monitor of stress in the cell and can be activated by anoxia, inappropriate signalling by mutated oncoproteins, or DNA damage. p53 controls the expression and activity of proteins involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. DNA damage is sensed by complexes containing kinases of the ATM/ATR family; these kinases phosphorylate p53, liberating it from inhibitors such as MDM2. Active p53 then upregulates the expression of proteins such as the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, thereby causing cell-cycle arrest at the G1-S checkpoint. This pause allows cells to repair DNA damage. If DNA damage cannot be repaired, p53 induces additional events that lead to cellular senescence or apoptosis.",D

Ectopic ACTH is commonly secreted by: September 2007,Small cell carcinoma of the lungs,Pancreatic carcinoma,Gall bladder malignancy,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,"Ans. A: Small cell carcinoma of the lungs Endogenous Cushing's syndrome results from some derangement of the body's own system of secreting coisol. Normally, ACTH is released from the pituitary gland when necessary to stimulate the release of coisol from the adrenal glands. In pituitary Cushing's, a benign pituitary adenoma secretes ACTH. This is also known as Cushing's disease and is responsible for 65% of endogenous Cushing's syndrome. In adrenal Cushing's, excess coisol is produced by adrenal gland tumors, hyperplastic adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia. Finally, tumors outside the normal pituitary-adrenal system can produce ACTH that affects the adrenal glands. This final etiology is called ectopic or paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome and is seen in diseases like small cell lung cancer.",A

Macrophages are found in -,Phase of scar formation,Phase of repair,Late phase of inflammation,Early phase of inflammation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Late phase of inflammation Cells in acute inflammation Neutrophils predominate in the early phase of inflammation (the phase occuring within 24 hrs) whereas macrophages enter the area in late phase of inflammation ie. after 24-48 hrs. Neutrophils remain predominant cells for upto 72 hrs, after which the macrophages take over as predominant cell. Lymphocytes and plasma cells are also seen along with macrophages in the acute inflammatory response. Mast cells may also involve in acute inflammation. There are exceptions to this pattern of cellular reaction :- Pseudomonas infection - Neutrophils predominate over 2 to 4 days. Viral infection --> Lymphocytes are the first cells to arrive. In some hypersensitivity reactions --4 Eosinophils predominate. Why neutrophils are replaced by macrophages ? Neutrophils can not regenerate their lysosomal enzymes, so these cells are not capable of sustained activity. On the other hand macrophages can regenerate their lysosomal enzymes and are capable of sustained activity. So, macrophages become the predominant cells after 48-72 hrs to sustaine inflammation.

Mechanism of action of thiazides is by -,Inhibiting Na+/Cl- symporter in DCT,Inhibiting Na+/Cl- symporter in PCT,Inhibiting Na+K+2C1- in ascending limb of loop of henle,Inhibiting Na+K+2CI- in descending limb of loop of henle,"Ans. is ""a' i.e.. Inhibiting Na+/Cl- symporter in DCT o Thiazide diuretics act by inhibiting Na+/ Cl- reabsorption pump in the distal convoluted tubule, thereby increasing urinary excretion of Na+ and Cl-. This result in reduced ECF and plasma volume, which results in decreased CO.o Na+ absorption at different tubular sites.PT - 65-70%Asc. LH - 20-25%DT - 8-9%CD- 1-2%o Tubular absorption can be divided into four sites.Site I- Proximal tubuleo Four mechanisms of Na4 transport have been defined in this segment -1. Direct entry of Na4 along electrochemical gradient.2. Na+-K+ symport along with active reabsorption of glucose, aminoacids, organic anions and PO4 -33. Exchange with H+ by Na+ /H+ exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete H+ with the help of carbonic anhvdrase. H+ ion exchanges with Na+ present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antiporter) and forms H2CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2CO3 is broken into H2O + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H2O diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H2CO3 is the source of H+. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transported to cortical E.C.F. by basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- symporter resulting in net reabsorption of NaHCO3.Carbonic anvdrase inhibitors (acetazoiamide) act predominantly in PCTand inhibit NaHCQ3 reabsorption.4. The disroportionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, particularly in the later PT. This takes Na+ and H2O along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic.o Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water:Site 11 Ascending limb of loop of Henleo The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct portion.1. Medullary portion lined by cuboidal cells.2. Cortical portion lined by flattened cells.o Both portions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid,o In the medullary portion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transports ions in ratio of Na+-K+-2Cl-. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na+ K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane,o This Na+ -K+--2Cl= symport is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide)o In addition, a Na+-Cl- symporter moves Cl- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along.Site III - cortical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DTo This segment is also impermeable to H2O and continues to absorb salt through Na+-Cl- symporter.o Thiazide diuretics act at this site.Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting ducto In late DT and CD, Na+ is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained partly by passive Cl- diffusion and partly by secretion of K+ and H+.o Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Na+ channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone.o K+- sparing diuretics act at this site.o Collecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic induced changes in K+ balance occur - as K+ secretion occurs in exchange of Na+, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine - Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absortion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine),o The principal cells are the major sites of Na+, K+, and water transport, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of H+ secretion.o The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed wrater channels (aquaporin-2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein - coupled cAMP - mediated process.o ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",A

Entacapone may be useful in patients being treated with levodopa-carbidopa combination because it :,Activates COMT,Decreases formation of 3–OMD,Inhibits monoamine oxidase type B,Inhibits dopamine uptake,"Levodopa is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase (that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier).
Carbidopa is an inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase in the periphery. It therefore increases the amount of l-dopa that reaches the brain (due to inhibition of peripheral metabolism to dopamine).
Due to inhibition of l-dopa metabolism (by dopa decarboxylase), an alternative pathway of metabolism by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is activated.
COMT metabolizes l-dopa to 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD) that can complete with l-dopa for entry in the brain.

First sign/symptom of renal graft rejection is?-,Fever,Rash,Increase Creatinine on exam,Tenderness,"On the basis of the time course and morphology of rejection reactions, they have been classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic Chronic RejectionPatients present with chronic rejection late after transplantation (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum creatinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.

The inheritance pattern of Familial hypercholesterolemia is,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,"Mutations involving single genes follow one of three patterns of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Familial hypercholesterolemia Huntington disease Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hereditary spherocytosis Neurofibromatosis, type 1 Adult polycystic kidney disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. It is caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene that encodes the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the form in which 70% of total plasma cholesterol is transpoed. A brief review of the synthesis and transpo of cholesterol follows. Normal Cholesterol Metabolism. Cholesterol may be derived from the diet or from endogenous synthesis. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are incorporated into chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa, which drain by way of the gut lymphatics into the blood. These chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by an endothelial lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of muscle and fat. The chylomicron remnants, rich in cholesterol, are then delivered to the liver. Some of the cholesterol enters the metabolic pool (to be described), and some is excreted as free cholesterol or bile acids into the biliary tract. The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and LDL begins in the liver (Fig. 6-2). The first step in the synthesis of LDL is the secretion of triglyceride-rich very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver into the blood. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL paicle undergoes lipolysis and is conveed to intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL). In comparison with VLDL, the content of triglyceride is reduced and that of cholesteryl esters enriched in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), but IDL retains on its surface two of the three VLDL- associated apolipoproteins B-100 and E. Fuher metabo- lism of IDL occurs along two pathways: Most of the IDL paicles are directly taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor described later; others are conveed to cholesterol- rich LDL by a fuher loss of triglycerides and apolipopro- tein E. In the liver cells, IDL is recycled to generate VLDL. Two thirds of the resultant LDL paicles are metabo- lized by the LDL receptor pathway, and the rest is metabo- lized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipo- proteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transpo of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely impoant role in LDL metabolism. The first step in the receptor-mediated transpo of LDL involves binding to the cell surface receptor, followed by endocy- totic internalization inside so-called ""clathrin-coated pits"" (Fig. 6-3). Within the cell, the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomes, and the LDL molecule is enzymatically degraded, resulting ultimately in the release of free cholesterol into the cytoplasm. The cholesterol not only is used by the cell for membrane synthesis but also takes pa in intracel- lular cholesterol homeostasis by a sophisticated system of feed- back control: * It suppresses cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. * It stimulates the formation of cholesterol esters for storage of excess cholesterol. * It downregulates the synthesis of cell surface LDL recep- tors, thus protecting cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. The transpo of LDL by the scavenger receptors, alluded to earlier, seems to take place in cells of the mononuclear- phagocyte system and possibly in other cells as well. Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for chemically modified (e.g., acetylated or oxidized) LDLs. The amount catabolized by this ""scavenger receptor"" pathway is directly related to the plasma cholesterol level. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no. 219)",B

"In a study of patients with non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma, a nuclear gene is found to be actively transcribed to mRNA and is transported into the cell cytoplasm. A protein is translated from this mRNA, with up-regulation of BCL2. In a control group without lymphoma, translation of the mRNA does not occur. How is the silencing of this active gene's mRNA most likely to occur?",Absence of tRNA,Binding to miRNA,Methylation of DNA,Mutation of mRNA,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded by about 5% of the human genome. miRNAs do not encode for proteins, but bind and inactivate or cleave mRNA, preventing translation of proteins by mRNA. This effectively silences gene expression without affecting the gene directly. There is abundant transfer RNA (tRNA) present in the cytoplasm that is not a rate-limiting step to translation. DNA methylation, particularly at CG dinucleotides, is a way of suppressing gene expression directly, as is seen with genomic imprinting. Mutations that occur in genes in DNA may result in reduced mRNA production or abnormal protein production, but mRNA itself is not mutated. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for proteins that are mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways",B

Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,Iron deficiency anemia,"Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",A

Sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis -,Decreased,Increased,No change,May increase or decrease,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Increased CYSTIC FIBROSISo Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands,o Cystic fibrosis follows on autosomal recessive transmission,o There is a defect in ion transport of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion inExocrine glands (pancreas)Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract Pathophysiologyo In normal duct epithelia, chloride is transported by plasma membrane channels (chloride channels)o The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31.2.o Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes - In cystic fibrosis activity of chloride channel is decreased.o Along with chloride channel, CFTR can regulate other channel also, for example epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system).Normal CFTR gene productDef ective (mutated) CFTR gene product in cystic fibrosis||1. Induce Cl conductance through itself (chloride channel)1. Reduced or lost Cl- conductance1. Inhibits Na+ conductance through ENaC2. Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane Clinical features of CFo Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i.e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl"" into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen),o Therefore clinical features are tissue specific:1. Respiratory tracto Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i.e. there is active secretion of Cl-,o CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen.o Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity)o Both these decreased Cl- secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area),o This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance - obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis.2. Intestineo Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion and enhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen,o This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents - obstruction of small and large intestine.3. Pancreaso The absence of CFTR Cl- channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Cl- -HCHO3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct.o The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis.4. Hepatobiliary systemo Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions - biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis.5. Sweat glandso In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i.e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na+ from lumen,o Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of NaCl - Hypertonic sweat with increased Na+ and Cl- in sweat.",B
Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is inhibited by-,Propranolol,Diltiazem,Sotalol,Sodium iodide,"Ans. is 'a"" i.e..

Iodide uptakeo First step in the synthesis of T3 & T4 is iodide uptake.o Thyroid cells (follicular cells) have active transport system for iodine uptake - Na+ :I- symporter.o This trapping is stimulated by TSH.o The iodide concentrating mechanism (Na+ : I- symporter) is also found in skin, salivary glands, gastric mucosa, intestine, mammary glands and placenta, but uptake in these organs is not stimulated by TSH.2. Oxidation and iodinationo Iodide trapped by follicular cells is transported to colloid.o In colloid it is oxidised by membrane bound thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ion (I+) or hypoiodous acid (HOI) or enzyme - linked hypoiodate (E-OI).o These oxidized forms of iodine combines with tyrosine residues of thvroglobulin to form monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyorosine (DIT) (in this reaction no enzyme is required),o These MIT and DIT are attached to thvroglobulin.3. Couplingo Pairs of iodinated tyrosine residues couple together to form T3 and T4.o Coupling is an oxidation reaction and is catalysed by same membrane bound thyroid peroxidase,o Normally more T4 is formed than T3.o Oxidation and coupling are stimulated by TSH.4. Storage and releaseo Thyroglobulin containing MIT, DIT, T3 & T4 is transported into the follicular cells by endocytosis.o Inside the cells thyroglobulin is broken down by lysosomal proteases.o Released T4 & T3 are secreted into the circulation, released MIT and DIT are deiodinated and the iodide released is reutilized.o The uptake (endocytosis) and proteolysis of thyroglobuline are stimulated by TSH.5. Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3o Peripheral tissues, especially liver and kidney, convert T4 to T3.o Target tissues take up Tj from circulation for their metabolic need, except brain and pituitary which take up T4 and convert it to T3 within their own cells.o Propylthiouracil, propranolol, amiodarone and glucocorticoids inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.",A

Which of the following drugs is both antiresoptiveand bone formative?,Strontium ranelate,Calcitonin,Ibadronate,Teriperatide,"Strontium Ranelate Osteoporosis is an abnormal decrease in amount orbone, but whatever left, is of normal quality. It results from bone loss due to age related changes in bone remodelling. In adult bones, remodelling is the principal metabolic skeletal process. - During remodelling the bone is ,first resorbed by osteoclasts and is then replaced by an equal amount of bone tissue due to action of osteoblasts. - This process of bone resorption and formation goes on throughout the adult life, and it serves two purposes. - To repair the microdamage within the skeleton. - To supply calcium. from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. In young adult the resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus the mass of skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass in achieved in adulthood. However after the age of 35-40 the resorption and formation processes becomes imbalanced and resorption exceeds formation. - Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and or decrease in osteoblastic activity. Mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate in the tit of osteoporosis. Strontium Ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in bone fonnation. - Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyappatite replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its .fracture benefit. It is approved in several European countries for the t/ t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by - Decreasing the rate of bone resorption (antiresorptive therapy.) - Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy). Since bone remodelling is a coupled process, antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone .formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD. ""Thus, Strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation."" More on tit of osteoporosis Pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis is generally aimed at restoring bone strength and preventing .fractures. The long standing centrepiece of this approach has been antiresorptive drugs such as: ? - Biphosphonate - Estrogen - Selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene - Calcitonin Until recently, antiresorptive drugs were the only drugs approved in the United States ,for treating osteoporosis. This situation changed in 2002 when FDA approved Teriparatide (the biologically active PTH fragment). Teriparatide acts by increasing the bone mass - Because teriparatide stimulates bone formation whereas biphosphonates reduce bone resorption, it was predicted that therapy combining the two would enhance the effect on bone marrow density more than treatment with either one alone. - However addition of teriparatide to alendronate provided no additional bebefit for bone mass density. Before the advent of strontium Ranelate there was'nt any drug which combined the two processes i.e., increasing bone formation and at the same time, decreasing bone resorption. Strontium Ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of hone growth but also acts on bone formation promoting the growth of new bone. More on antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis: Biphosphonates Alendronate,Pamidronctte Most effective drugs currently approved for prevention and t/t of osteoporosis. They suppress bone resorption at doses that do not inhibit mineralization. Thiazide diuretics They are not strictly antiresorptive but they reduce urinary Cat` excretion and constrain bone loss in patients with hypercalciurea. Estrogen There is an unambiguous relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Post menopausal status or estrogen deficiency at any stage significantly increases patient's risk.for osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) These are estrogenic compounds with tissue selective activities. Raloxifene (SERM) acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and liver and is inactive on the uterus. Calcitonin Calcitonin inhibits oteoclastic bone resorption.",A

Which of the following conditions would mostly likely be associated with chronic gastritis (Type A) resulting from autoimmune destruction of parietal cells?,Decreased growth of luminal bacteria,Decreased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma,Decreased plasma concentration of gastrin,Increased production of macrocytic red blood cells,"Autoimmune destruction of parietal cells would lead to decreased secretion of gastric acid and intrinsic factor. The diminished availability of intrinsic factor would result in poor absorption of dietary vitamin B12. Over time, the vitamin B12 deficiency could lead to pernicious anemia, which is characterized by increased production of macrocytes (megaloblasts) by the bone marrow. Because of the decrease in gastric acid secretion, luminal bacteria would most likely exhibit increased (not decreased) growth. One of the functions of HCl secreted by the parietal cells is to sterilize the gastric lumen. Patients with Type A gastritis have an increased likelihood of developing gastric carcinoma (not decreased,). A decrease in acid secretion leads to increased secretion of gastrin (not decreased) by antral G cells. This is because low gastric pH (less than 3) inhibits gastrin secretion paracrine release of somatostatin from cells in the gastric mucosa that can sense the acidity. With decreased parietal cells, the pH of the gastric lumen would rise and remove this inhibitory component. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 14.

Second generation cephalosporins : ? More active against gram negative organism, Also has some activity against gram positive organisms. Some members also have activity against anaerobes e.g., cefotetan, Cefnzetazole and cefoxitin. Among the second generation cephalosporins, cefuroxime attains higher C.S.F. concentration. Third generation cephalosporins : - Have highly augumented activity against gram negative enterobacteriacea. Less active against gram (+ve) cocci and anaerobes. Highly resistant to [3 lactamases from negative bacteria. Some third generation cephalosporins have antipseudomonal activity : - e.g., Ceftazidime and cefoperazone. Ceftazidime + aminoglycoside is the treatment of choice for pseudomonas infections. Fouh generation cephalosporins : ? These drug possess activity against gram negative organisms (including pseudomonas) resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Their efficacy against gram positive cocci is similar to 3rd generation compounds but an impoant point to remember is that they are not active against anaerobes. General features of Cephalosporins :- (Some impoant points to remember) Cephalosporin like other lactam antibiotics exe their action by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Cephalosporins are excreted primarily by the kidney therefore they require dose reduction in renal failure. Probenecid slows the tubular secretion of most of the cephalosporins. Cefpiranzide, ceftriaxone and cefperazone are exceptions because they are excreted predominantly in the bile. Cefotaxime is deacetylated in vivo. The metabolite has less antimicrobial activity than the parent compound and is excreted by the kidneys. None qf the other cephalosporins appears to undergo appreciable metabolism. Several cephalosporins penetrate into C.S.F. in sufficient concentrations to be useful for the treatment of meningitis. These include: ? Cefotaxime Ceftriaxone Cefepime Cephalosporins also cross the placenta and they are found in high concentrations in synol and pericardial fluids. Penetration into the aqueous humour of the eye is relatively good after systemic administration of the third generation agents but penetration into the vitreous humour is poor. No cephalosporins is active against enterococcus fecalis, MRSA and listeria monocytogens. Concentrations in bile usually are high with those achieved after administration of cefoperazone and cefpiranzide being the highest. Adverse reactions Most common side effect of cephalosporin is hypersensitivity reaction. Immediate reactions such as anaphylaxis, bronchosposam and uicaria are observed. Cephalosporins have been implicated as potentially nephrotoxic agents (cephaloridine is considered the most nephrotoxic cephalosporin. It is no longer available in the united states).

Used instead of aspirin to avoid Reye syndrome in children with viral infection.ToxicityOverdose produces hepatic necrosis; acetaminophen metabolite (NAPQI) depletes glutathione and forms toxic tissue adducts in liver. N-acetylcysteine is antidote--regenerates glutathione.ACETAMINOPHEN OVERDOSAGEAcetaminophen is metabolized predominantly by a phase II reaction to innocuous sulfate and glucuronide metabolites.Acetaminophen can cause severe centrilobular hepatic necrosis when ingested in large amounts.Fatal fulminant disease is usually associated with ingestion of micro25 g. Blood levels of acetaminophen correlate with the severity of hepatic injury (levels > 300 microg/ mL 4 h are predictive of the severe damage; levels < 150 microg/ mLsuggest that hepatic injury is highly unlikely). Renal failure and myocardial injury may be present.Rx:# Treatment includes gastric lavage, supportive measures, and oral administration of activated charcoal or cholestyramine to prevent absorption of residual drug (effective if given >30 min after ingestion).# In patients with high acetaminophen blood levels (>200 mg/mL measured at 4 h or >100 mg/mL at 8 h after ingestion), the administration of sulfhydryl compounds (e.g., cysteamine, cysteine, or N-acetylcysteine) reduces the severity of hepatic necrosis. It appear to act by providing a reservoir of sulfhydryl groups to bind the toxic metabolites or by stimulating synthesis and repletion of hepatic glutathione.# Therapy should be begun within 8 h of ingestion but may be effective even if given as late as 24-36 h after overdose. Later administration of sulfhydryl compounds is of uncertain value.# Routine use of N-acetylcysteine has substantially reduced the occurrence of fatal acetaminophen hepatotoxicity.# When given orally, N- acetylcysteine is diluted to yield a 5% solution. A loading dose of 140 mg/ kg is given, followed by 70 mg/kg every 4 h for 15-20 doses.# Rx can be stopped when plasma acetaminophen levels indicate that the risk of liver damage is low.# If signs of hepatic failure (e.g., progressive jaundice, coagulopathy confusion) occur despite N-acetylcysteine therapy for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity, liver transplantation is only option.Uses of N-acetylcysteine# Mucolytic (cleaves disulfide bonds within mucus glycoproteins, e.g. in CF).# Antidote of acetaminophen/Paracetamol poisoning (replenishes glutathione).# To prevent Contrast induced nephropathy.",A

True regarding bupropion is: September 2009,Dopamine reuptake stimulator,It is an antianxiety drug,No precipitation of seizures,Nicotinic receptor antagonist,"Ans. D: Nicotinic receptor antagonist Bupropion/amfebutamone is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. It acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), as well as alpha3 beta4-nicotinic receptor antagonist. Bupropion belongs to the chemical class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants cathinone and diethylpropion, and to phenethylamines in general. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own but it is paicularly popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Since it does not inhibit serotonin reuptake at all (or very insignificantly), bupropion does not cause weight gain or sexual dysfunction like the SSRI group of antidepressants.

Only males are manifesting disease.
Females are acting as carriers → sisters sons had suffered from the disease.


Both these are features of X-linked recessive disorders.

X-linked disorders

Except for a few conditions, all X-linked disorders are X-linked recessive.
A male has only one X-chromosome, the male with an affected gene on X-chromosome will always manifest the disease.
On the other hand, the female has 2 X-chromosomes, the heterozygous female will be a carrier because of the expression of a normal allele on the other X-chromosome.
Note → Female with Turner syndrome (only one 'X' chromosome) can manifest X-linked recessive disorders.
50% boys of the carrier mother will be affected.
All daughters of an affected father will become a carrier, i.e. affected father will transmit the defective X chromosome to all the daughters.
Father will not transmit the disease to son as boys do not inherit X-chromosome from father.

This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of",Parathyroid hormone,Calcitonin,Parathyroid hormone-related peptide,Calcitonin-related peptide,"Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact, but the membrane is altered in such a way that the cell and its fragments become avid targets for phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly cleared before cellular contents have leaked out, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host. Apoptosis differs in this respect from necrosis, which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity, enzymatic digestion of cells, leakage of cellular contents, and frequently a host reaction( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 18 )",C

Because a1A subtype predominates in the bladder base and prostate, while a1B receptors are dominant in blood vessels, tamsulosin does not cause significant changes in BP or HR at doses, which relieve urinary symptoms. No increase in adverse CVS events, including postural hypotension has been noted. Dizziness and retrograde ejaculation are the only significant side effects.

"A 15-year-old girl incurs a cut to the sole of her foot after stepping on a piece of broken glass. On examination, a superficial 0.5-cm laceration ceases to bleed within 5 minutes after application of local pressure. Which of the following substances is released by endothelium and is most likely to counteract platelet aggregation near this site of injury?",Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa,Platelet-activating factor,Prostacyclin,Tissue-type plasminogen activator,"Endothelial injury releases glycoprotein tissue factor (factor III) that drives the coagulation process and activates platelets. Adjacent intact endothelium generates prostacyclin (PGI2 ) via arachidonic acid metabolism to inhibit clot propagation beyond where it is needed. PGI2 and nitric oxide are powerful vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. This limits thrombus formation just to the area of injury. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, which induces shape change; phospholipid, which binds fibrinogen and calcium; and platelet-activating factor are procoagulants that drive thrombosis and platelet activation. Tissue-type plasminogen activator promotes fibrinolytic activity after a thrombus has formed. Thrombomodulin binds to thrombin to form an anticoagulant that activates protein C, which then cleaves activated factor V and factor VIII. Thromboxane is generated via arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets to promote platelet activation and vasoconstriction.",C
Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern in the pedigree given below-,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,"It is an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance.
The features which suggest the X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance are-
A single abnormal X chromosome is sufficient to express the disease.
All of the female offspring’s of a diseased male XY will receive the abnormal X chromosome and express the disease, whereas none of the male offspring to the diseased father will have the disease (as sons don't receive X chromosome from their father).
A diseased mother can transmit the abnormal X chromosome to both daughter and sons equally.

Important facts 

If a female is transmitting the disease to all offspring’s (both males and females) and a male is not transmitting the disease to any child, it is mitochondrial inheritance.
If a male is transmitting the disease only to daughters (all daughters) and not to the sons whereas female transmit the disease to half daughters and half of the sons, it is X-linked dominant.
If only males are affected in a pedigree, it is likely to be an X-linked recessive disease (females act as carriers; only transmit the disease and themselves remain unaffected).
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to half of the offspring’s, it is an autosomal dominant disorder.
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to one-fourth of the offspring’s, it is likely to be an autosomal recessive disorder.",D

Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",Allopurinol,Aspirin,Colchicine,Probenecid,"The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

Hephaestin is similar to ceruloplasmin, the copper-carrying protein.Sr. Ferritin# Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma.# Its levels correlate well with body iron stores.# During earliest iron deficiency period, iron stores--reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stainable iron on bone marrow aspirations--decrease.# As long as iron stores are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within normal limits. At this stage, red cell morphology and indices are normal.# Gradually, the TIBC increases, as do red cell protoporphyrin levels.# The serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores.# By definition, marrow iron stores are absent when the serum ferritin level is <15 pg/L.DIAGNOSIS OF MICROCYTIC ANEMIATestsIron deficiencyInflammationThalassemiaSideroblasticSmearMicro/hypoNormal micro/ hypoMicro/hypo with targetingVariableSI<30<50Normal to highNormal to highTIBC>360<300NormalNormalPercent saturation<1010-2030-8030-80Ferritin (pg/L)<1530-20050-30050-300Hemoglobin patternNormalNormalAbnormalNormalDIAGNOSIS OF HYPOPROLIFERATIVE ANEMIASTestsIron DeficiencyInflammationRenal DiseaseHypometabolicAnemiaMild to severeMildMild to severeMildMCV (ft)60-9080-909090MorphologyNormo-microcyticNormocyticNormocyticNormocyticSI<30<50NormalNormalTIBC>360<300NormalNormalSaturation (%)<1010-20NormalNormalSerum ferritin (mg/L)<1530-200115-150NormalIron stores02-4+1-4+Normal",A

Which of the following would be the best morphological feature to distinguish ulcerative colitis from Crohn's disease -,Diffuse distributions of pseudopolyps,Mucosal edema,Crypt abscesses,Lymphoid aggregates in the mucosa,"Pseudopolyps (inflammatory polyps) can be seen in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis
In ulcerative colitis, the distribution of these pseudopolyps can be diffuse but in Crohn's disease, the distribution cannot be diffuse because a classic feature of crohn's disease is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from the adjacent uninvolved bowel. When multiple bowel segments are involved the intervening bowel is essentially normal (skip lesions).

Mucosal edema
- The hallmark of both ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease is mucosal inflammation and chronic mucosal damage. So mucosal edema is a feature of both of these diseases.
- The important point is that while in Ulcerative colitis these processes are limited to mucosa or submucosal, in crohn's disease these processes extend beyond the mucosa and submucosa and involves the entire wall.

Crypt abscesses -

- Crypt abscesses are produced due to infiltration of the neutrophil into crypt lumen.
- These crypt abscesses are not specific for ulcerative colitis and may be observed in crohn's disease or any active inflammatory colitis.

Lymphoid aggregates in mucosa

The characteristic mucosal feature of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease on histology includes —
i. Distortion of crypt architecture
ii.Destruction and loss of crypt
iii.A marked increase in lymphocytes and plasma cells in lamina propria.

The most impoant mechanism by which tetracycline antibiotics exe antimicrobial action,They interfere with DNA mediated RNA synthesis in bacteria,They bind to 50S ribosomes and interfere with translocation of the growing peptide chain in the bacteria,They bind to 30S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis,They chelate Ca2+ ions and alter permeability of bacterial cell membrane,"TETRACYCLINES Mechanism of action:- The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic; inhibit protein synthesis by binding to 30S ribosomes in susceptible organism. Subsequent to such binding, attachment of aminoacyl-t-RNA to the acceptor (A) site of mRNA-ribosome complex is interferred as a result, the peptide chain fails to grow. The sensitive organisms have an energy dependent active transpo process which concentrates tetracyclines intracellularly. In gram-negative bacteria tetracyclines diffuse through porin channels as well. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-733",C
Best for diagnosing pheochromocytoma is:September 2008,Urinary catecholamines and their metabolites,Serum catecholamines and their metabolites,CT scan,Surgery,"Ans. A: Urinary catecholamines and their metabolitesThe diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is established by the demonstration of elevated 24-hour urinary excretion of free catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) or catecholamine metabolites (vanillylmandelic acid and total metanephrines).The measurement of plasma catecholamines can also be of value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.However, the measurement of plasma catecholamines has limited sensitivity and specificity. Plasma metanephrines have been repoed to be more sensitive than plasma catecholamines. Pharmacologic testing with agents such as glucagon or clonidine is rarely required to make the diagnosis",A

These lesions are excised, but 2 years later, similar lesions appear. Which of the following conditions most likely predisposed him to the development of these recurrent lesions?",Candida albicans infection,Circumcision,Human papillomavirus infection,Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection,"Condyloma acuminatum is a benign, recurrent squamous epithelial proliferation resulting from infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, one of many sexually transmitted diseases that can occur in sexually active individuals. Koilocytosis is particularly characteristic of HPV infection. Candidiasis can be associated with inflammation, such as balanoposthitis, but not condylomata. Recurrent gonococcal infection indicates that the patient is sexually active and at risk for additional infections, but is not the cause for the condylomata. The gonococcal infection causes suppurative lesions in which there may be liquefactive necrosis and a neutrophilic exudate or mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Circumcision generally reduces risks for infections. Phimosis is a nonretractile prepuce, and paraphimosis refers to forcible retraction of the prepuce that produces pain and urinary obstruction.",C

The hypercellu- larity is produced both by proliferation of cells in the mesangium and so-called endocapillary proliferation involving capillary endothelium and infiltrating leukocytes. The glomeruli have an accentuated ""lobular"" appearance due to the proliferating mesangial cells and increased mesangial matrix (Fig. 20-16). The GBM is thickened, and often shows a ""double- contour"" or ""tram-track"" appearance, especially evident in silver or PAS stains. This is caused by ""duplication"" of the basement membrane (also commonly referred to as splitting), usually as the result of new basement membrane synthesis in response to subendothelial deposits of immune complexes. Between the duplicated basement membranes there is inclu- sion or interposition of cellular elements, which can be of mesangial, endothelial, or leukocytic origin. Such interposition also gives rise to the appearance of ""split"" basement mem- branes (Fig. 20-17A). Crescents are present in many cases",A

The specific marker for alcoholic hepatitis?,GGT,Alanine transaminase,Alkaline phosphatase,LDH,"Ans. (a) GGTSerum levels of GGT differ from those of ALP during pregnancy, in which GGT remains normal even during cholestasis in pregnancy. GGT is often increased in alcoholics even without liver disease; in some obese people; and in the presence of high concentrations of therapeutic drugs, such as acetaminophen and phenytoin and carbamazepine (increased up to five times the reference limits), even in the absence of any apparent liver injury. Studies suggest that alcohol induces mitochondrial damage, resulting in the release of mitochondrial AST, which, besides being the predominant form of AST in hepatocytes, has a significantly longer half-life than do extramitochondrial AST and ALT. This frequently results in the disproportionate elevation of AST over ALT, yielding an AST/ALT quotient, also called the DeRitis ratio, of 3-4:1 in alcohol-induced liver disease",A

"Dopamine, in renal doses, in shock leads to: March 2009",Reduction in peripheral re,Constriction of renal vasculature,Dilatation of renal vasculature,Increase in cardiac output,"Ans. C: Dilatation of renal vasculature Dopamine at ""renal dose""/ low dosage binds D-lreceptors and effects in dilating blood vessels, increasing blood flow to renal, mesenteric, and coronary aeries; and increasing overall renal perfusion. Dopamine therefore has a diuretic effect, potentially increasing urine output. Intermediate dosages have a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect through increased beta-1 activation. It is used in patients with shock or hea failure to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. High dose is the ""pressor"" dose. This dose causes vasoconstriction, increases systemic vascular resistance, and increases blood pressure through alpha-1 receptor activation; but can cause the vessels in the kidneys to constrict to the point where they will become non-functional",C

Carbamazepine in elderly causes:,Hypernatremia,Hyponatremia,Hyperkalemia,Hypokalemia,"Carbamazepine Chemically related to imipramine, it was introduced in the 1960s for trigeminal neuralgia; is now a first line antiepileptic drug. Carbamazepine modifies maximal electroshock seizures as well as raises threshold to PTZ and electroshock convulsions. It also inhibits kindling. Though its action on Na+ channels (prolongation of inactivated state) is similar to phenytoin, the profile of action on neuronal systems in brain is different. Carbamazepine exes a lithium-like therapeutic effect in mania and bipolar mood disorder. It also has antidiuretic action, probably by enhancing ADH action on renal tubules. Adverse effects Carbamazepine produces dose-related neurotoxicity-sedation, dizziness, veigo, diplopia and ataxia. Vomiting, diarrhoea, worsening of seizures are also seen with higher doses. Acute intoxication causes coma, convulsions and cardiovascular collapse. Hypersensitivity reactions are rashes, photosensitivity, hepatitis, lupus like syndrome, rarely agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia. Some degree of leucopenia due to hypersensitivity is more common.

Digoxin increases cardiac contractility by directly engaging in wof,Inhibiting myocardial Na + /Ca 2+ -ATPase,Activating L-type Ca 2+ channels,Inhibiting cardiac phosphodiesterase,Inhibiting myocardial Na + /K + -ATPase,Mechanism of action:- Digoxin increases force of cardiac contraction by a direct action independent of innervation. It selectively binds to extracellular face of the membrane associated Na+K+ ATPase of myocardial fibres and inhibitis this enzyme. Inhibition of this cation pump results in progressive accumulation of Na+ intracellularly. This indirectly results in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation. During depolarization Ca2+ ions enter the cell driven by the steep Ca2+ gradient through voltage sensitive L type Ca2+ channels. This triggers release of larger amount of Ca2+ stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through Ryanodine calcium channel 2 (RYR2) - cytosolic Ca2+ increases transiently (calcium transients) - triggers contraction by activating troponin C on myofibrils.

Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is associated with?,Panacinar-emphysema,Centriacinar-emphysema,Paraseptal-emphysema,Irregular-emphysema,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Panacinar-emphysema Emphysema Emphysema is a condition of the lung characterized by abnormal permanant enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis. ""Destruction of walls"" is necessory to define emphysema. Enlargement of airspaces without destruction of their walls is termed overinflation, for example, the distention of airspaces that occurs in the remaining lung after unilateral pneumonectomy. Types of emphysema Emphysema is classified according to its anatomic distribution within the lobule. There are four major types of emphysema ? 1. Centriacinar (centrilobular) emphysema Centriacinar emphysema is the most common type of emphysema seen clinically. It is chracterized by involvement of respiratory bronchioles, i.e. central (proximal) pa of the acinus. So, both emphysematous and normal airspaces exist within the same acinus and lobule. The lesions are more common and more severe in the upper lobe, paicularly in the apical segments. This is the type of emphysema that occurs predominantly in heavy smokers and usually coexists with chronic bronchitis. 2. Panacinar (Panlobular) emphysema The acini are uniformly enlarged from the level of the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli. This type of emphysema tends to occur more commonly in the lower zones and in the anterior margins of the lung, and it is usually most severe at the base. This type of emphysema is associated with al-antitrypsin deficiency. 3. Distal acinar (Paraseptal) emphysema This type of emphysema involves distal pa of the acinus, while proximal pa is normal. It is localized adjacent to the pleura, along perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to areas of fibrosis, scarring, or atelectasis and is usually more severe in the upper half of lungs. This type of emphysema is a common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. 4. Irregular emphysema (Para-cicatricial emphysema) The acinus is involved irregularly and is almost invariably associated with scarring. It is the most common type of emphysema histologically. Most common type of emphysema is irregular emphysema, but it is not clinically significant as most patients are asymptomatic and it is only an autopsy finding.

"A study is conducted involving persons with LDL cholesterol levels above 160 mg/dL. They are found to have increased oxidized LDL deposited in their arteries. As a consequence, the arterial lumen, particularly at branch points, is decreased in size. Which of the following is the most likely pathologic change that develops initially in these areas of arterial narrowing?",Endothelial cell disruption,Intimal thickening,Lymphocytic infiltrates,Platelet aggregation,"The initial response of an arterial wall to injury is intimal thickening with neointimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and production of an increased intimal extracellular matrix. Note that ""injury"" can be caused by inflammation, immune reactions, and toxins as well as the local physical trauma from hypertension and abnormal flow. The trauma does not produce immediate injury with endothelial cellular disruption, but a response of endothelial dysfunction that signals smooth muscle cell migration. This process takes years to show changes of vascular narrowing. As atheromatous plaques progress, there is participation by lymphocytes producing cytokines, as well as monocytes that are transformed into macrophages that accumulate lipid to evolve into foam cells. Eventually, plaque disruption may incite platelet aggregation.",B

Which of the following findings implies an increased risk of subsequently developing invasive carcinoma?",Apocrine metaplasia,Blue-domed cysts of Bloodgood,Duct ectasia,Sclerosing adenosis,"Sclerosing adenosis is a type of proliferative fibrocystic disease that is often seen with other variants of fibrocystic disease. It is a proliferation of small ducts and myoepithelial cells near the terminal duct lobular unit. It also is characterized by fibrosis that distos the glands and lobules into a whorled pattern. The demonstration of this on biopsy, as with other proliferative fibrocystic changes, implies an increased risk for subsequent invasive breast cancer. Apocrine metaplasia is the term used to describe a transformation of ductal epithelial cells to eosinophilic cells resembling apocrine sweat gland epithelium. This is a benign, common, non-proliferative change that is not associated with increased cancer risk. A blue-domed cyst of Bloodgood is a fluid-filled cyst, sometimes up to 5 cm in size, that appears blue grossly before it is incised. When incised, the fluid is serous and dark- colored. These cysts are pa of benign non-proliferative fibrocystic disease and do not carry increased cancer risk.

"Glucocoicoids causes all, except :",Muscle wasting,Osteoporosis,Diabetes mellitus,Reduced appetite,"Glucocoicoid excess leads to bone dissolution by decreasing bone formation and increasing bone resorption. This leads to osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass that leads eventually to collapse of veebral bodies and other fractures.Glucocoicoids in excess accelerate the basic electroencephalographic rhythms and produce mental aberrations ranging from increased appetite, insomnia, and euphoria to frank toxic psychoses. Many of the amino acids liberated from catabolized proteins are conveed into glucose in the liver and the resultant hyperglycemia and decreased peripheral utilization of glucose may be sufficient to precipitate insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, especially in patients genetically predisposed to diabetes. Patients with excess Glucocoicoids are protein-depleted as a result of excess protein catabolism. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are therefore thin and the muscles are poorly developed.

Mediastinal lymph node calcification is seen in which one of the following-,Metastatic neoplasm,Lymphoma,Sarcoidosis,Bronchiectasis,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (""lymphangitic"" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are ""nonmatted"" (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",C

Optimal treatment of the patient should include management with,Propranolol,Clonidine,Metoprolol,Lidocaine,"Essential Tremor is the commonest movement disorder. It can present in childhood but dramatically increases in prevalence over the age of 70 years. ET is characterized by a high-frequency tremor (6-10 Hz) that predominantly affects the upper extremities. The tremor most often manifest as a postural or action (kinetic) tremor and, in severe cases, can interfere with functions such as eating and drinking. It is typically bilateral and symmetric but may begin on one side and remain asymmetric. TREATMENTMany cases are mild and require no treatment other than reassurance. Beta blockers and primidone are the standard drug therapies for ET and help in about 50% of cases. Propranolol (20-120 mg daily, given in divided doses) is usually effective at relatively low doses, but higher doses may be effective in some patients.

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's genetic disease?",Chromosomal nondisjunction,Chromosome inversion,Expansion of trinucleotide repeat,Frame-shift mutation,"Fragile X syndrome, the most common cause of inherited mental retardation, is caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in a noncoding region immediately adjacent to the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. In a poorly understood manner, the expanded CGG repeat silences the FMR1 gene by methylation of its promoter. The abnormal repeat is associated with an inducible ""fragile site"" on the X chromosome, which appears in cytogenetic studies as a nonstaining gap or chromosomal break. The male newborn afflicted with the fragile X syndrome appears normal, but during childhood, characteristic features appear, including an increased head circumference, facial coarsening, joint hyperextensibility, enlarged testes, and abnormalities of the cardiac valves. Mental retardation is profound, with IQ scores varying from 20 to 60. A significant proportion of autistic male children carry a fragile X chromosome.

Why is it so? lets see : - The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur.3.

Oral manifestation of scarlet fever:,Strawberry tongue.,Raspberry tongue.,Stomatitis scarlatina.,All of the above.,"The chief oral manifestations of scarlet fever have been referred to as stomatitis scarlatina. 
Small punctate red macules may appear on the hard and soft palate and uvula. These are called Forchheimer spots; however, these are not diagnostic since they may be present in other infectious conditions like rubella, roseola, infectious mononucleosis, and septicemia.
The palate and the throat are often fiery red. The tonsils and faucial pillars are usually swollen and sometimes covered with a grayish exudate. More important are the changes occurring in the tongue. Early in the course of the disease, the tongue exhibits a white coating and the fungiform papillae are edematous and hyperemic, projecting above the surface as small red knobs. This phenomenon has been described clinically as ‘strawberry tongue’.

Here the nucleotide triplet CTC (or GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in mRNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia.Sickle Cell DiseaseSickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descend.Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of B-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ.In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ.Pathogenesis:HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated.Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form.With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ.Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestationsChronic hemolysisQMicrovascular occlusionsQTissue damageQMorphology:Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, retieulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants).The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ.Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in x-raysQ.Increased breakdown of hemoglobin can cause pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemiaQ.Splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage (autosplenectomy)Q",A

Biopsy of the responsible lesion shows a whorling pattern of the cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Arachnoid cyst,Glioblastoma multiforme,Meningioma,Metastatic breast cancer,"The most likely diagnosis is an intracranial meningioma. Meningiomas are slow-growing, benign tumors comprising 15% of intracranial tumors; they are most common in the elderly. They originate from either dura mater or arachnoid and are sharply demarcated from brain tissue. Meningiomas often incite an osteoblastic reaction in the overlying cranial bones. Microscopically, the meningioma cells have a tendency to encircle one another, forming whorls and psammoma bodies. Clinically, they present as mass lesions; seizures may occur. The superior parasagittal surface of the frontal lobes is a orite site of origin. This can often produce leg weakness, since the leg motor fibers that pass down through the internal capsule originate in parasagittal coical regions. Treatment of meningiomas is usually surgical. Arachnoid cysts are formed by splitting of the arachnoid membrane; most arachnoid cysts arise near the Syln fissure. They may present with mass effect, but would be unlikely to produce seizures, prominent focal signs, or reactive hyperostosis. Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive malignant astrocytoma that would likely have killed the patient long before 5 years had elapsed. Metastatic breast cancer would generally look different microscopically (the whorling cell pattern is characteristic of meningioma). It would be unlikely for metastatic cancer to cause a reaction in the overlying bone, or to be present long enough to cause symptoms for 5 years. Ref: Johnson J., Lalwani A.K. (2012). Chapter 62.

"A 75-year-old woman presents with a pruritic vulvar lesion. Physical examination reveals an irregular white, rough area involving her vulva. If this area of leukoplakia is due to lichen sclerosis, then biopsies from this area will most likely reveal",Atrophy of epidermis with dermal fibrosis,Epidermal atypia with dysplasia,Epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis,Individual malignant cells invading the epidermis,"Several pathologic conditions are associated with the formation of white plaques on the vulva, which are clinically referred to as leukoplakia. Lichen sclerosis is seen histologically as atrophy of the epidermis with underlying dermal fibrosis. This abnormality is seen in postmenopausal women, who develop pruritic white plaques of the vulva. It is not thought to be premalignant. Loss of pigment in the epidermis (vitiligo) can also produce leukoplakia. Inflammatory skin diseases, such as chronic dermal inflammation, squamous hyperplasia (characterized by epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (characterized by epithelial atypia or dysplasia), can also present with leukoplakia. A term related to leukoplakia is vulvar dystrophy, but this refers specifically to either lichen sclerosis or squamous hyperplasia. Because the latter is sometimes associated with epithelial dysplasia, it is also referred to as hyperplastic dystrophy. It is most commonly seen in postmenopausal women. The male counterpa of lichen sclerosis, called balanitis xerotica obliterans, is found on the penis. Paget's disease is a malignant tumor that can be found in the breast or the vulva. The latter is seen clinically as pruritic, red, crusted, sharply demarcated maplike areas. Histologically, these malignant lesions reveal single anaplastic tumor cells surrounded by clear spaces (""halos"") infiltrating the epidermis. These malignant cells stain positively with PAS and mucicarmine stains. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Equilibrium pressure in the absence of flowpressure is called,Mean circulatory filling pressure,Critical closing pressure,Perfusion pressure,Pulse pressure,"Mean Circulatory Filling PressureWhen hea pumping is stopped by shocking the hea with electricity to cause ventricular fibrillation or is stopped in any other way, flow of blood everywhere in the circulation ceases a few seconds later.Without blood flow, the pressures everywhere in the circulation become equal. This equilibrated pressure level is called the mean circulatory filling pressure.Effect of blood volume on mean circulatory filling pressureThe greater the volume of blood in the circulation, the greater is the mean circulatory filling pressure, because extra blood volume stretches the walls of the vasculature.Blood volume of about 4000 milliliters, the mean circulatory filling pressure is close to zero because this is the""unstressed volume"" of the circulation, but at a volume of 5000 mL the filling pressure is the normal value of 7 mm Hg. Similarly, at still higher volumes, the mean circulatory filling pressure increases almost linearly.Critical Closing PressureWhen pressure falls below a critical level in blood vessels, called the critical closing pressure, blood flow ceases as the blood vessels and completely collapsed.(Refer: Ganong&;s Review of Medical physiology 24th edition,pg no: 582)",A

Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is associated with the following except:,Focal Segmental glomerulosclerosis,Minimal Change Disease,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis,"Ans. D. Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis. (Ref. Robbin's Pathology8th/pg. Table 14-2)Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN) is manifested histologically by alterations in the GBM and mesangium and by proliferation of glomerular cells. It accounts for 5% to 10% of cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children and adults. Some individuals present only with hematuria or proteinuria in the non-nephrotic range; others have a combined nephrotic-nephritic picture. Two major types of MPGN (I and II) are recognized on the basis of distinct ultrastructural, immunofluorescence microscopic, and pathogenic findings. Of the two types, type I is far more common (~ 80% of cases).The Nephrotic Syndrome# The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, which results in hypoalbuminemia and edema. Podocyte injury is an underlying mechanism of proteinuria, and may be the result of nonimmune causes (as in MCD and FSGS) or immune mechanisms (Membranoproliferative variety).# Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome in children; it is manifested by proteinuria and effacement of glomerular foot processes without antibody deposits; the pathogenesis is unknown; the disease responds well to steroid therapy.# Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) may be primary (podocyte injury by unknown mechanisms) or secondary (e.g. as a consequence of prior glomerulonephritis, hypertension or infection such as HIV); glomeruli show focal obliteration of capillary lumens, hyaline deposits and loss of foot processes; the disease is often resistant to therapy and may progress to end stage renal disease.# Membranous nephropathy (MN) is caused by an autoimmune response against an unknown renal antigen; it is characterized by granular subepithelial deposits of antibodies with GBM thickening and loss of foot processes but little or no inflammation; the disease is often resistant to steroid therapy.Causes of Nephrotic Syndrome: CauseChildren-Prevalence (%)Adults-Prevalence (%)A.Primary Glomerular Disease 1Membranous GN5302Minimal-change diseaseQ65103Focal segmental glomerulosclerosisQ10354Membranoproliferative GNQ10105IgA nephropathy and others1015B.Systemic Diseases with Renal Manifestations1Diabetes mellitusNote:Approximate prevalence of primary disease is 95% of the cases in children, 60% in adults.Approximate prevalence of systemic disease is 5% of the cases in children, 40% in adults.2Amyloidosis3Systemic lupus erythematosus4Ingestion of drugs (gold, penicillamine, ""street heroin"")5Infections (malaria, syphilis, hepatitis B, HIV)6Malignancy (carcinoma, melanoma)7Miscellaneous (bee-sting allergy, hereditary nephritis)",D

"In acute inflammation due to the contraction of endothelial cell cytoskeleton, which of the following results?",Delayed transient increase in permeability,Early transient increase in permeability,Delayed permanent increase in permeability,Early permanent increase in permeability,"Endothelial cell contraction leading to intercellular gaps in postcapillary venules is the most common cause of increased vascular permeability. Endothelial cell contractionoccurs rapidly after binding of histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, and many other mediators to specific receptors, and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). A slower and more prolonged retraction of endothelial cells, resulting from changes in the cytoskeleton, may be induced by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1). This reaction may take 4 to 6 hours to develop after the initial trigger and persist for 24 hours or more. ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 34 )",B
"A patient of anemia due to chronic inflammation, the positive finding is",Serum iron is increased,S. ferritin is decreased,TIBC is decreased,Presence of normal iron in blasts,"Direct quote from Robbins : ‘Hyperacute rejection occurs when preformed antidonor antibodies are present in the circulation of the recipient’. Such antibodies may be present:

In a recipient who has previously rejected a kidney transplant
Multiparous women who develop anti-HLA antibodies against paternal antigens shed from the fetus may have preformed antibodies to grafts taken from their husbands or children
Prior blood transfusions
In recipients not previously sensitized to transplantation antigens, exposure to the class I and class II HLA antigens of the donor graft may evoke antibodies. The initial target of these antibodies in rejection seems to be the graft vasculature.

Thus, antibody-dependent acute humoral rejection is usually manifested by a vasculitis, sometimes referred to as rejection vasculitis",A

False statement regarding phenytoin is: March 2007,Is highly protein bound,Half life decreases with decreasing dose,Microsomal enzyme inducer,Follows zero order kinetics at lower doses,"Ans. D: Follows zero order kinetics at lower doses Phenytoin acts to dampen the unwanted, runaway brain activity seen in seizure by reducing electrical conductance among brain cells by stabilizing the inactive state of voltage gated sodium channels. Absorption of phenytoin by oral route is slowit is widely distributed in the body and 80-90% bound to plasma proteins. Phenytoin is metabolized in liver by hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation. The kinetics of metabolism is capacity limited; changes from first order to zero order over the therapeutic range-small increments in dose produce dispropoionately high plasma concentrations. The plasma half life (12-24 hours) progressively increases (upto 60 hours) when plasma concentration rises above 10 microgram/ ml as metabolizing enzyme gets saturated. Aside from seizures, it is an option in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia as well as ceain cardiac arrhythmias. At therapeutic doses, phenytoin produces horizontal gaze nystagmus At toxic doses, patients experience sedation, cerebellar ataxia, and ophthalmoparesis, as well as paradoxical seizures. Idiosyncratic side effects of phenytoin, as with other anticonvulsants, include rash and severe allergic reactions. Phenytoin causes a reduction in folic acid levels, predisposing patients to megaloblastic anemia. Folic acid is presented as polyglutamate in foods, it is then conveed into monoglutamates by intestinal conjugase. Phenytoin acts by inhibiting this enzyme therefore causing folate deficiency. Phenytoin is a known teratogen. The syndrome consists of craniofacial anomalies (broad nasal bridge, cleft lip and palate, microcephaly) and a mild form of mental retardation (average IQ=71).This syndrome resembles the well-described Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and has also been called the ""fetal hydantoin syndrome."" Phenytoin may accumulate in the cerebral coex over long periods of time, as well as causing atrophy of the cerebellum when administered at chronically high levels. Despite this, the drug has a long history of safe use and it is a common ""first line of defense"" in seizure cases. Phenytoin has been known to cause Drug-induced Lupus. Phenytoin has been associated with drug induced gingival enlargement (hyperplasia) in the oral cavity probably due to folate defiency. Patients whose epilepsy is treated with drugs face about twice the risk of suicidal thoughts compared to placebo-takers Phenobarbitone competitively inhibits phenytoin metabolism, while by enzyme induction both enhance each other's degradation. Phenytoin induces microsomal enzymes and increases degradation of steroids (failure of oral contraceptives), digitoxin, doxycycline, theophylline.",D

Which of the following diuretics decrease the renal lithium clearance?,acetazolamide,hydrochlorthiazide,furosemide,spironolectone,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., hydrochlorothiazide Lithium has got low therapeutic index so measuring its plasma level is of utmost importance to assure safe use of drugApproximately 95% of a single dose of Li+ is eliminated in urine.Li+ is handled by the kidney in same way as Na+ i.e. most of the filtered Li+ is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. So loading with Na+ will increase the Li+ excretion and Na+ depletion will promote a clinically important degree of retention of Li+It is now obvious that diuretics will cause retention of Li+ because they cause Na+ depletion.All the diuretics given in option (except Acetazolamide) decrease the renal lithium clearance.So we will have to choose the one, which causes the greatest retention of lithium.Goodman Gilman (10/e, p 509) and Katzung (8/e, p 493) write that the thiazide cause greatest retention among diuretics.Other drugs which can cause Li retentionTetracyclineIndomethacinACE inhibitors",B
Platelet aggregation in vivo is mediated by ?,Swelling,Ig mediators,Interaction among the leukocyte,All,"Ans. is 'b' i.e, Ig mediators Platelets and hemostasis o Platelets play a central role in normal hemostasis. o After endothelial injury platelets come in contact with subendothelial ECM especially collegen. o On contact with ECM, platelets undergo three general reactions. Adhesion o Platelets adhesion to extracellular matrix is mediated largely interaction with Von-willebrand factor (VWF), which acts as a bridge between platelet surface receptor GPlb and exposed collegen. o Although platelets can also adhere to other components of ECM (fibronectin), GPIb - vWf association is the only interaction suffciently strong to overcome the high shear force of flowing blood. Secretion o Platelets contain two specific types of granules : - A)Alpha granule --> Contains fibrinogen, fibronectin, factors V & VIII, PDGF, TGF-(3 and platelet factor 4. B) Dens bodies or 5granules --> Contain ADP, Ca+2, histamine, serotonine, and epinephrine. Soon after adhesion, secretion of the contents of both granules occurs and secretion of thromboxane A2 also takes place. 3. Platelet aggregation It follows adhesion and secretion. The most impoant endogenous stimulus for platelet aggregation are ADP & TxA 2. o ADP & TxA, set up an autocatalytic reaction leading to buildup an enlarging platelet aggregate Primary hemostatic plug. o This primary plug is reversible. o Coagulation system is activated and thrombin is generated. o Thrombin binds to platelet surface receptors and along ADP & TXA2 cause furher aggregation of platelets and thrombin also conves fibrinogen to fibrin. o This followed by platelet contraction, creating an irreversible fused mass of platelet entangled in fibrin --> definitive secondary hemostatic plug. Factors that promote platelet aggregation (Pro-aggregatory factor) o ADP o Epinephrine o VWF o Thrombospondin o Immune complex o TXA2 o Serotonine o Fibrinogen o Collegen o Thrombin Now see each option of the question separately. o There is platelet contraction (not swelling). o Immune complex (Ig mediator) promote platelet aggregation. o Interaction among the leukocye contributes the inflammation that accompanies thrombosis, but has no role for platelet aggregation. o Interaction among platelet cause fuher aggregation of platelet. o Macromolecules (GPIIb/IIIa) promote platelet aggregation. Also know Platelet antiaggregatoiy factors PGI2 Endothelin NO 3 Bradykinin",B

True about shock -a) In early stage cardiac output and BP are maintainedb) There is decreased sympathetic activityc) Renin secretion may be increased d) Aldosterone secretion is decreased,a,bc,ac,b,"Stages of shock 

Shock tends to evolve through three general phages : -

A. Non progressive (Initial or compensated reversible) shock
In the early stage of shock, there is activation of compensatory mechanisms that attempt to maintain adequate perfusion of the heart and brain, and to maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure.
These compensatory mechanisms include : -
	1. Due to decrease perfusion pressure, baroreceptors are stimulated that leads to increased sympathetic discharge & catecholamines release with reduced vagal activity. All these cause : -
	a) Peripheral vasoconstriction Cool clammy extrimities (In hyperdynamic stage of septic shock and in neurogenic shock the extrimities are warm due to vasodilatation).
	b) Tachycardia
	2. Decreased renal perfusion and sympathetic stimulation cause increased renin release from the kidney and activation of renin angiotensin system. So that : -
Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and release of aldosterone.
Aldosterone causes fluid and salt conservation by kidney.
In this stage patient can be managed by correcting the underlying cause, e.g., fluid therapy in hypovolemic. Shock and control of infection in septic shock.

B. Progressive (Decompensated reversible) shock
Due to continued tissue hypoxia, aerobic respiration replaced by anaerobic glycolysis that leads to formation of lactic acid → Lactic acidosis & pH.
Acidosis (↓ pH) causes blunting of venoconstrictor effect of catecholamine → Venodilatation → Pooling of blood in peripheral veins. As there is arteriolar constriction ( ↑ peripheral resistance) and venodilatation (↓ venous return) → Cardiac output is decreased.
Peripheral pooling of blood and decreased cardiac output cause anoxic injury to endothelial cells that may cause DIC.
Decreased perfusion to vital organs like brain causes mental confusion & drowsiness and decreased perfusion to kidney causes decline in urinary output.
In this stage patient can be managed but more aggresive management is required i.e., along with correction of underlying cause; intropic agent, vasopressor, oxygen and resuscitation may be required.

C. Irreversible shock
Unless there is intervention in previous stages, the process enters in an irreversable stage in which there is multiple organ damage.
In this stage survival is not possible even after intervention.",C

Plasma cells produce specific antibodies by the process of?,Class selection,Clonal selection,Isotope selection,Isotope switching,"Clonal selection

B-cells are able to make a specific antibody against a specific antigen. It is due to the presence of specific receptor on B-cells - B-cell receptor (BCR), that is usually an immunoglobulin Ig M or Ig D. An antigen interacts with B-cell that shows best fit by virtue of its BCR. The antigen binds to this receptor, and the B-cell is stimulated to divide and form a clone (clonal selection). This clone of cells will become plasma cells that will secrete antibody of a particular specificity and same class.
Plasma cells make an antibody of a single specificity, of a single immunoglobulin class and allotype, and of a single light chain type only. An exception is seen in the primary antibody response, when a plasma cell producing IgM initially, may later be switched to IgG production (called isotype switching or class switching).",B

	Stratum granulosum (granular cells layer)
Stratum spinosum (Prickle cell layer)
	Stratum basale (Basal cell layer)
Dermis —
	Papillary dermis
	Reticular dermis


Pemphigus is characterized by acantholysis. Acantholysis is separation of epidermal cells from one another. This separation occurs due to antibodies (IgG) against the intercellular substances.
Acantholysis occurs in different layers of epidermis in different types of pemphigus.
Pemphigus vulgaris and ----> Acantholysis occur in between basal cells and cells of prickle cell layer (Stratum pemphigus vegetans spinosum). Some books also state that acantholysis occurs in suprabasal layer. Suprabasal layer is most probably, stratum spinosum as it is seen above basal layer
Pemphigus foliaceous and-- Acantholysis occurs in stratum granulosum.

During angiogenesis recruitment of pericytes and periendothelial cells is due to,VEGF & PDGF,"Angiopoietins, TGF & PDGF","TGF, VEFG & PDGF","VEGF, IL-6","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Angiopoietins, TGF & PDGF Angiogenesis Blood vessels formation in adults is known as angiogenesis or neovascularization. It can occur by two ways:? 1. Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels The major steps in this process are :? Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel. Preoteolytic degradation of basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cellto-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. Maturation of endothelial cells. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis VEGF is the most impoant growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. The most impoant receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (periendothelial cells). Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 & 2), PDGF and TGF-/3 paicipate in stabilization process. Remember VEGF transcription is regulated by the transcription factor HIF, which is induced by hypoxia.",B

All are to access platelet functions EXCEPT:,Prothrombin time,Bleeding time,Clot retraction time,Prothrombin deactivation,"Prothrombin time REF: Wintrobe's hematology lied page 1242 Tests for platelet function: Bleeding time: Hemostasis in a small superficial wound, such as that produced when measuring the bleeding time, depends on the rate at which a stable platelet plug is formed and, thus, provides a measure of the efficiency of the vascular and platelet phases. However, it does not discriminate between vascular defects, thrombocytopenia, and platelet dysfunction. Platelet enumeration Platelet volume measurements Platelet aggregation Clot Retraction: Clot retraction usually is deficient when the platelet count is below 50,000411 and in a rare disorder of platelet function (Glanzmann thrombasthenia). It is normal in most other disorders of platelet function. This test is primarily of historical interest; Glanzmann thrombasthenia is typically diagnosed using platelet aggregation methods or flow cytometer. Tests of Coagulation Phase: Paial thromboplastin time: The PTT is a simple test of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. When a mixture of plasma and a phospholipid platelet substitute is re-calcified, fibrin forms at a normal rate only if the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway (prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII) and in the common pathway (factors X and V, prothrombin, and fibrinogen) are present in normal amounts. The PTT is somewhat more sensitive to deficiencies of factors VIII and IX than to deficiencies of factors XI and XII or factors involved in the common pathway Prothrombin time The production of fibrin by means of the extrinsic and common pathways requires tissue factor and factor VII, in addition to factors X and V, Prothrombin, and fibrinogen Thromboplastin generation test: The thromboplastin generation test is impoant for historical reasons.

Glomus Cells are found in -,Carotid body Tumour,Thyroid carcinoma,Liver carcinoma,None,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Carotid body tumoro Non-chromaffin (neuroendocrine) cells of paraganglioma are also called glomus cells.o Glomus tumor is the most common benign tumor of middle ear. It arises from the glomus bodies, therefore named Glomus tumor. It is well recognised that glomus tumors arise from paraganglions, which are normally occurring structures usually found in close association with sympathetic ganglions along the aorta and its main branches. The chiefcells (paraganglionic cells (PGI90)) of the paraganglions are of neural crest origin and are components of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DIVES). These paraganglionic cells are derived from embryonic neuroepithelium (neural crest). Glomus tumors are also referred to as chemodectomas or nonchromaffin (PGI04) paragangliomas. There are two types of glomus tumorsGlomus jugulareThese glomus tumors arise from the dome of the internal jugular vein in the hypotympanum (DPG10) and jugular foramen. In jugular foramen they can invade IX to XII cranial nerves.Glomus tympanicumThey arise from the promontory of the middle ear along the course of the tympanic branch of the IXth cranial nerve,o The glomus tumor is a rare and benign vascular neoplasm that arises from the neuroarterial structure called a glomus body. The normal glomus body is located in the dermis throughout the body, but is more concentrated in the digits. They are believed to function in thermal regulation,o The most common site of glomus tumors is subungual and 75% of the lesions occur in the hand,o The lesions present most frequently during the fourth and fifth decade of life although they can be found in any age and at any site.o The subungual tumors affect women three times more commonly then men.o The lesions are usually solitav but mulifocal tumors are also seen.o Clinically, glomus tumors are characterized by a triad ofsensitivity to cold,Localized tenderness andserve intermittent pain.The pain can be excruciating and is described as a burning or bursting.o Grossly, the tumors are usually less than one cm. in size, and appear as small red-blue nodules. The lesion appears as a localized dark red or blue lesion beneath the finger nail, but the subungual lesions can be difficult to detect on clinical examination.o Two usefull tests for diagnosing glomus tumors, particularly solitary painful glomus tumors (especially those under a nail) are the following :disappearance of pain after application of a tourniquet proximal ly on the arm.eliciting pain by applying pressure to a precise area with the tip of a pencil.# Treatment of glomus tumors consists of surgical excision.",A

Which of the following conditions is the most frequent cause of spontaneous aboion in the first trimester of pregnancy?,Abruptio placentae,Chorioamnionitis,Chromosomal abnormalities,Placenta pre,"At least 10% to 15% of normally feilized and implanted ova are lost in the first trimester of pregnancy because of spontaneous aboion. Studies using immunoassay of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) for early diagnosis of pregnancy suggest that the percentage of feilized ova lost in the first trimester might be even higher. The great majority of these cases are attributable to chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomal studies are not routinely performed in such cases, but they are recommended when a malformed fetus has been identified or when habitual or recurrent aboions occur. Abruptio placentae, a complication of the third trimester, occurs when the placenta detaches prematurely from its implantation site. Retroplacental hemorrhage develops within the space between placenta and uterine wall, leading to interruption or severe reduction in the blood supply to the fetus. Chorioamnionitis, a complication of the second and third trimesters, results from ascending infections through the vaginal canal. Infection of chorioamniotic membranes may lead to premature rupture of membranes and aboion or premature labor. Placenta pre is a placenta implanted in the lower segment of the uterus. When dilatation of this segment begins in late pregnancy, a placenta pre may cause severe bleeding and lead to premature labor. Ref: Kipps T.J. (2010). Chapter 94.

Displacement of a protein bound drug-,T Drug plasma level,T Side effects,Free level,Effect,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., T Drug plasma level One drug can bind to many sites on the albumin molecules. o Conversely, more than one drug can bind to the same site. o This can give rise to displacement interactions among drugs bound to the same sites. o Drug bound with higher affinity will displace that bound with lower affinity. The concentration of free form (plasma level) will increase. o However this is often transient because the displaced drug will diffuse into the tissues as well as get metabolized or excreted. o The new steady state free drug concentration is only marginally higher unless the displacement extends to tissue binding or there is concurrent inhibition of metabolism and excretion. The overall impact of many displacement interactions is minimal, clinical significance being attained only in case of highly bound drugs with limited volume of distribution and where interaction is more complex.",A

Penicillins and their related group of antibiotics were called fl lactam antibiotics because they contained a four carbon ring called fi lactam ring. Within a .few years of introduction of penicillin, bacterias staed acquiring resistance against penicillins by producing penicillinase To overcome this problem penicillinase resistant penicillins came into picture. Sholy afterwards, the broad spectrum penicillin and first gene- ration cephalosporins were introduced. They remained, first line antibiotics. for several years. Over a period of tune bacterias developed resistance even against these organisms by producing filactamase. fi lactamase are enzymes that break open the fi lactam ring and deactivate the antibiotic. The ,B lactamases hydrolyze penicillins and narrow spectrum cephalo- sporin, such as cephalothin or cefazolin, and are resistant to them. To counteract the problems against fl lactamases new classes of /I lactams were developed. These are cephalosporins containing oxy- minio side chain e.g. ceftizoxime, cefotaxine, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone (broad spectrums cephalosporins). - Consequently, when these oxymino side chain containing com- pounds were introduced they were effective against a broad group of otherwise resistant bacterias. - f3luctamases cannot hydrolyze higher generation cephalosporins with an oxymino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime). But not long ago after these cephalosporins came into use strains of klebsiella pneumonia were discovered which were resistant even to oxyimino containing cephalosporins e.g. (cefotaxime, cefazidime, ceftriaxone) The mechanism of this resistance was production of extended spectrum /3 lactanzase enzyme (ESBL). These bacterias are called ESBL bacterias -Bacterias are classified as extended spectrum fl lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria, when a simple point mutation occurs in genes normally responsible .for beta lactamase mediated resistance. The mutation usually responsible is (TEM). - As a result of the mutation, organisms, are able to produce novel beta lactamases that can hydrolyze all the fi lactam containing antibiotics which includes even the ox-pninio group containing cephalosporins (ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), Aztreonam and all the older fi lactam drugs. Because of their greatly extended substrate range these enzymes were called extended spectrum 13 lactamase ESBLS are capable of efficiently hydrolyzing :- -Folic illins - Narrow spectrum cephalosporins - Many extended spectrum cephalosporins - Oxyimino group containing cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) - Monobactams (aztreonams) - Beta lactatnase inhibitors (clavulinic acid sulbactam) An impoant point None of the ESBLS described till to date are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or carbepenems (imipenenz, meropenems) ESBL producing organisms are associated with gram negative bacterias and most of these organisms are in the family.

The enterobacteriacea species most commonly associated with ESBL are klebsiella (Klebsiella pneumonia predominantly) and E. coli. Treatment of ESBL'S Of all the available fllactams ""carbepenenzs"" are the most effective and reliable as they are highly resistant to the hydrolytic activity of the fl lactamase. - None of the ESBLS described till todate are able to hydrolyze cephamycin or Carbepenem (imipenem, meropenem) Meropenem is the most active with MIC generally lower than those of imipenem. Beta lactamase inhibitors (Clavulanic acid, sulbactam, Tazobactam) Although ESBL activity is inhibited by clavulinic acid the only infections that may be treated safely with b lactam / f3lactamase inhibitor combinations are those involving the urinary tract. - In this instance i3lactamase inhibitor concentration is high et,ough to counteract the hydrolytic activity of ESBI:.s clavulinic acid appears more efficient than sulbactam (It takes about eight times more sulbactam to obtain a protection similar to that given by clavulinic acid).

"In acute inflammation due to the contraction of endothelial cell cytoskeleton, which of the following results -",Delayed transient increase in permeability,Early transient increase in permeability,Delayed permanent increase in permeability,Early permanent increase in permeability,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Early transient increase in permeability Increased vascular permeability o The hallmark of acute inflammation is increased vascular permeability The following mechanisms have ben proposed for increased permeability. i) Formation of endothelial gaps in venules (immediate transient response) This is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage and is caused due to the mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, leukotrienes, neuropeptide sustance Classically this type of leakage affects venules, leaving capillaries and aerioles unaffected. The precise reason for this restriction to venules is unceain, it may be because there is greater density of receptors for mediators in venular endothelium. Binding of mediators such as histamine to their receptors on endothelial cells activate intracellular signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin. These proteins contract leading to contraction of endothelial cells and separation of intercellularjunction. Thus the gaps in the vascular endothelium are largely intercellular or close to the intercellular junctions. This type of leakage occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually reversible and sho lived (15-30 minutes), it is thus known as immediate transient response. Cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon y also increase vascular permeability by inducing a structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton such that the endothelial cells retract from one another. In contrast to the histamine effect, the cytokine induced response is somewhat delayed (4-6 hrs) and long lived (24 hrs or more). Direct endothelial injury resulting in endothelial cell necrosis and detachment (immediate sustained response) This effect is usually encountered in necrotizing injuries and is due to direct damage to the endothelium by injurious stimulus e.g severe burns or lytic infections. The reaction is known as immediate sustained response because the leakage stas immediately after the injury and is sustained at high levels for several hours until the damaged vessels are thrombosed or repaired. o All levels of microcirculation are affected including venules, capillaries and aerioles. iii) Delayed prolonged leakage This is curious but relatively common type of increased permeability that begins after a delay of 2-12 hours, lasts for several hours or even days and involves venules as well as capillaries. This type of leakage is caused by mild to moderate thermal injury, X-ray radiation or ultraviolet radiation and ceain bacterial toxins. It is caused either by direct effect of injurious agent or by cytokine mediated endothelial retraction. iv) Leucocyte mediated endothelial injury Leucocytes adhere to endothelium relatively early in inflammation. These leucocytes may be activated releasing toxic oxygen species and proteolytic enzymes which then cause endothelial injury or detachment. This type of leakage affects venules (mostly); pulmonary & glomerular capillaries. v) Increased transcytosis across the endothelial cytoplasm Transcytosis occurs across channels consisting of clusters of interconnected uncoated vesicles and vacuoles called the vesiculovacuolar organelle, many of which are located close to intercellular junctions. It usually occurs in venules. vi) Leakage from new blood vessels During repair formation of new vessels occur (angiogenesis) New vessel sprouts, remain leaky until the endothelial cells mature.",B

Metastasis Metastasis is the spread and growth of malignant cells to produce secondry neoplasm at a site distant from and discontinous with the primary neoplasm. It is the most reliable feature of malignancy. o With few exceptions, all cancer metastatize. The major exceptions are glioma of CNS and basal cell carcinoma of skin, But both of these are locally invasive. Local invasion The malignant tumors progressively infiltrate and destroy the surrounding tissue and tumor cells move beyond the normal confins a process that is called local invasion. Due to local invasion, malignant tumors are poorly demarcated from the surrounding normal tissue and a well ? defined cleavage plane is lacking that makes their surgical resection difficult, and even if tumor appears well circumscribed, it is necessory to remove a considerable margin of apperently normal tissues adjacent to the neoplasm. ) After metastasis, it is the most reliable feature of malignancy.",B

The bacterial drug resistance in tuberculosis results from:,Transduction,Transformation,Plasmid mediated,Mutation,"Drug resistance: It refers to unresponsiveness of a microorganism to an AMA, and is akin to the phenomenon of tolerance seen in higher organisms. Resistance may be developed by mutation or gene transfer. Mutation: It is a stable and heritable genetic change that occurs spontaneously and randomly among microorganisms. It is not induced by the AMA. Any sensitive population of a microbe contains a few mutant cells which require higher concentration of the AMA for inhibition. These are selectively preserved and get a chance to proliferate when the sensitive cells are eliminated by the AMA. Thus, in time it would appear that a sensitive strain has been replaced by a resistant one, e.g. when a single antitubercular drug is used. Mutation and resistance may be: (i ) Single step.- A single gene mutation may confer high degree of resistance; emerges rapidly, e.g. enterococci to streptomycin, E. coli and Staphylococci to rifampin. (ii ) Multistep.* A number of gene modifications are involved, sensitivity decreases gradually in a stepwise manner. Resistance to erythromycin, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol is developed by many organisms in this manner. Sometimes mutational acquisition of resistance is accompanied by decrease in virulence, e.g. ceain rifampin resistant staphylococci and low grade penicillin-resistant gonococci have decreased virulence",D

SERM drug used in treatment of osteoporosis aEUR',Raloxifene,Estrogen,Strontium,Alendroate,"Raloxifene Traditionally hormone replacement therapy with estrogen was being used to prevent/treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal worsen. H has been shown to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in women. But long term use of estrogen leads to range of adverse effect including cardiovascular disease, stroke, pulmonary emboli and invasive breast cancer. These serious adverse effect made to look for other options. Selective estrogen receptor modulators These are class of compounds that act on estrogen receptors. Their characteristic feature is that they do not have pure agonist or antagonistic action on estrogen receptors. - Their selective action distinguishes these substances .from pure receptor agonist or antagonist. - SERMS are ""selective"" that means SERMS block estrogen in some tissues and activate estrogen action in others. - All the SERMS bind to the estrogen receptor but each agent produces a unique receptor drug conformation. - As a result specific coactivator or co-oppressor proteins are bound to the receptor resulting in differential effects. Two SERMS are currently being used Raloxifens For the t/t and prevention of osteoporosis Tamoxifen --> For the t/t and prevention of Breast Ca The .first SERM to reach the market was Tamoxifen which blocks the stimulative effect of estrogen on breast tissue and is used in breast cancer. Raloxifene is the second SERM to be approved by the FDA. Raloxifens has been approved for the tit and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifens acts like estrogen on bone and helps to build and maintain bone density. - Raloxifen has been shown in clinical trials to increase bone density in the spine and hip and to reduce the risk of spinal fractures in women with osteoporosis. While it acts like estrogen on bone, it blocks the action of estrogen on breast and uterus. - This profile makes it very useful for the t/t of osteoporosis because Raloxifene provides the bone benefits of estrogen without increasing the risk for estrogen related breast and uterine cancers. Raloxifene in Breast cancer Due to its antiestrogenic effect on breast, Raloxifene has been shown to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women who are taking it for osteoporosis. Raloxifene reduces the risk of breast cancer by 50-70% in both low risk and high risk postmenopausal women. The national cancer institute U.S.A. funded the STUDY OF TAMOXIFEN AND RALOXIFEN (STAR) a clinical trial comparing raloxtfens with tamoxifen in preventing breast cancer, in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of developing the disease. The study found that tamoxifen and Raloxifen are equally effective in reducing invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease. The study also .found out that women who took raloxifen had fewer uterine cancer and.fewer blood clots than women who took tamoxifen. However, Raloxifen did not decrease the risk of noninvasive breast Ca. On September 14 2007, the US. food and drug administration announced approval of raloxifens for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive cancer.",A
A 70 year old man presenting with abdominal pain has a mass in abdomen. Angiography reveals aneurysm of aoa. What is the MOST likely cause of aoic aneurysm?,Trauma,Atherosclerosis,Syphilis,Congenital,"Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of aoic aneurysm. Infrarenal abdominal aoa is most frequently affected by the atherosclerotic process and is the most common site of aneurysm formation. Abdominal aoa is more prone to develop aneurysm because it is less elastic, resulting from less elastin and more collagen, and it has higher pulsatile stress compared with ascending aoa. Media of infrarenal aoa in humans has no vaso vasorum, so inner media receive nutrition by diffusion from aoic lumen. Intimal thickening by atherosclerosis disturbs nutrition and hence wall nutrition. Thoracic aoic aneurysms greater than 60mm in diameter and abdominal aoic aneurysm greater than 50mm are prone to rupture. Ref: Diagnosis and Treatment of Aoic Diseases edited by Christoph A.

A patient presents with a severe form of atopic asthma. Which of the following changes would MOST likely to be found in this patient's blood?,Basophilic leukocytosis,Eosinophilic leukocytosis,Lymphocytosis,Monocytosis,"An increased number of eosinophils (AKA eosinophilia) occurs in association with several conditions, the most frequent of which are immune-mediated diseases (e.g., asthma, hay fever, and pemphigus vulgaris) and parasitic infestations. This is due to an absolute increase in the number of circulating eosinophils, brought about by IL-5, which stimulates differentiation of eosinophilic precursor cells in the bone marrow.Also know:Basophilic leukocytosis is a rare event that is sometimes observed in association with chronic myelogenous leukemia. It is not seen in patients with asthma. Lymphocytosis may result from a vast array of conditions, but it is not typical of asthma or other allergic diseases. Lymphocytosis may develop in response to a number of infections (e.g., brucellosis, whooping cough, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, and tuberculosis) or manifest as pa of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Monocytosis refers to an increase in number of monocytes, which are circulating macrophages. Chronic infections (e.g., tuberculosis, rickettsiosis, and malaria) and chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., collagen vascular diseases and inflammatory bowel disease) are the most common underlying causes.

"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ""poor vision"" and ""flashing lights"" in her left eye. She is unusually tall, with long limbs and slender fingers. Physical examination is remarkable for pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis, a midsystolic click, and a pansystolic murmur. Ophthalmologic examination reveals a retinal detachment and dislocation of the lens. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?",Deafness,Gout,Proximal aoic aneurysm,Large intestine rupture,"This patient most likely has Marfan syndrome, which is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and consists of a mutation of the fibrillin gene that increases her risk of an aoic aneurysm at the base of the aoa. The classic features of Marfan syndrome are long, thin extremities, with skeletal changes such as pectus excavatum and kyphoscoliosis, ocular changes such as dislocation of the lens, myopia, and retinal detachment, and cardiovascular changes such as mitral valve prolapse (midsystolic click) and mitral regurgitation (pansystolic murmur). The life-threatening complications include aoic aneurysm, aoic dissection, and aoic rupture. Deafness is associated with Alpo syndrome, which is typically an X-linked inherited mutation of type IV collagen, that is characterized by hematuria, conical deformation of the lens, and sensorineural deafness. Gout can be associated with Type I glycogen storage disease (von Gierke disease), which an inherited autosomal recessive disorder that leads to hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperlipidemia. These individuals have sho stature, fat cheeks, a protuberant abdomen, thin extremities, and ""doll-like faces."" Complications, other than gout, include pancreatitis, hepatic adenomas, renal disease, pulmonary hypeension, and osteoporosis. Large intestine rupture and uterine rupture are complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, which is a caused by a mutation in type III procollagen.

Brain related symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, trouble speaking, personality changes, anxiety, and seeing or hearing things that others do not. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition due to a mutation in the Wilson disease protein (ATP7B) gene. For a person to be affected they must inherit an affected copy of the gene from each parent. Diagnosis may be difficult and often involves a combination of blood tests, urine tests, and a liver biopsy. Genetic testing may be used to screen family members of those affected",B
Essential for tumour metastasis is ?,Angiogenesis,Tumorogenesis,Apoptosis,Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity,"Angiogenesis Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a pa of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells. According to Harrison ""Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis"". Angiogenesis in tumours :? Tumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour. Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 12 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels. Angiogenesis of tumour impas two benefits A) Growth of tumour By supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells. Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells. B) Distant metastasis Without access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites. Tumour associated angiogenic factors :? Tumours secrete ceain factors which induce neovascularization Two most impoant are ? i) Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF) ii) Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF) Steps in the spread of cancer ? Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis The first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cells Normal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i.e. E cadherin. Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin. Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis. Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interaction Loosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin. Degradation of ECM Tumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i.e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase. Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in ceain cancers. These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself; is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and.finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved. Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen :? Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role. i) Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells. ii) Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have propeies of tumour cell chemotcuis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer. After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels. Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus. Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cells Tumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.",A

Concentric hyperophy of left ventricle is seen in,Mitral stenosis,Hypeension,Aoic regurgitation,None,"In pressure overload states (e.g., hypeension or valvular stenosis), new sarcomeres tend to be added parallel to the long axis of the myocytes, adjacent to existing sarcomeres. The growing muscle fiber diameter thus results in concentric hyperophy--the ventricular wall thickness increases without an increase in the size of the chamber. The chronic pressure overload of systemic hypeension causes left ventricular concentric hyperophy, often associated with left atrial dilation due to impaired diastolic filling of the ventricle. Persistently elevated pressure overload can cause ventricular failure with dilation. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no.386,388)",B

It causes endothelial cell activation, promotes thrombosis, and increases leukocyte adhesiveness in developing atheroma. Because atherogenesis is partly an inflammatory process, CRP is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. PR3 is one type of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated with some vasculitides such as microscopic polyangiitis. Cryoglobulins may be found with some forms of immune complex-mediated vasculitis. The ESR (""sed rate"") is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation and therefore the internist's least favorite test; the ESR is best known to be markedly elevated with giant cell arteritis.

In 5% of male infants born at term and 30% of those born prematurely, the testes are not located in the scrotum or are easily retracted. In the large majority of these infants, the testis will descend into the scrotum during the first year of life. The descent of the testis may be arrested at any point from the abdominal cavity to the upper scrotum. According to their location, the cryptorchid testes can be classified as abdominal, inguinal, or upper scrotal. Anorchia (choice A) refers to congenital absence of testes.

Best predictor for coronary aery disease aEUR',HDL,LDL,VLDL,Chylomicron,"LDL ???? Elevated LDL cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol are independent predictors of coronary hea disease. - Although there is consensus regarding the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol the value of elevating HDL cholesterol remains controversial. Low HDL and coronary risk High serum HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk of CHD. The incidence of CHD events in a normal population appears to be inversely related to serum HDL cholesterol with low levels being associated with increased coronary risk. - Based upon data .from the Framingham Hea study, the risk for myocardial infarction increases by about 25%.for every 5mg/d1 (.13 nuno1/1) decrement in serum HDL cholesterol. Elevated LDL and coronary risk Elevation in LDL cholesterol is a well known risk factor for the development of coronary aery disease. Association of elevated LDL with coronary aery disease has been established in various trials and studies. There is linear reduction in cardiovascular disease with progressive lowering of the LDL cholesterol. Traditionally LDL levels are considered to be the nzost impoant factor in the prediction of coronary aery disease. The impoance of LDL as a risk factor lies in the fact that effective therapes are avalaible to lower it, while it is not so in the case of HDL. So when treating dyslipidemia for reducing cardiovascular events, the .first target is LDL and not HDL. Doubt and Controversy What is creating doubts in our mind is a table from Braunwald 8th/e p1008 according to which 'Low HDL' appears to be better marker, for prediction of future cardiovascular disease than 'High LDL'. According to this bar diagram in Braunnwald 8""Ye p1008 - the adjusted hazard ratio .for .future cardiovascular events for LDL is 1.62 while that of HDL is 2.32. But the text given in the book does clarify which one is better marker. (we have give this table from Braunwald in our previous discussion on this topic in Nov 2009 Medicine). We have tried to confirm this low HDL' fact from various other books. But none of the texts clearly. ored any one between these 2 to be the better marker. Both LDL and HDL are mentioned to be impoant. We have also consulted several cardiologist on this. All of them say that the answer should be LDL Well, Braunwald is text book of immense reputation. and any information or text given in the book does not need confirmation from any other source. But what has added to the confusion is that the latest edition of Braunwald i.e., 9""/e has eliminated that diagram from the book and in the text have not clarified which one is better marker. Instead, the text states that Apolipo (a) and B 100 are better marker, .for predicting future cardiovascular events than LDL and HDL. We are not absolutely sure of the answer, but we would for the time being go with LDL. Also Know The following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary risk. - Elevated total cholesterol - Elevated LDL cholesterol Low HDL cholesterol - Increased total to HDL cholesterol ratio - Increased non HDL cholesterol - Hyperiglyceridemia - Increased Lp(a) - Increased apolipoprotein B - Sinai! dense LDL paicles",B

ARDS has also been called adult respiratory failure, shock lung, traumatic wet lung, pump lung, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The initial and basic lesion in ARDS is diffuse damage to the alveolar wall. Protein-rich edema fluid then leaks into the alveolar spaces and combines with fibrin and dead cells to produce hyaline membranes that line the alveoli and are the characteristic histologic feature of ARDS. In the acute edematous stage, the lungs are congested (pulmonary congestion) and show pulmonary edema with interstitial inflammation. Collapsed, airless pulmonary parenchyma is called atelectasis and can also be seen in ARDS. These other changes, although present in ARDS, are not pathognomonic.

"A 40-year-old woman has experienced chest pain on exertion for the past 2 months. A month ago, she had pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from her sputum. On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes?",Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes,Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies,Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes,Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin,"The clinical features of obesity with angina and glucose intolerance in this patient strongly suggest type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is confirmed by the oral glucose tolerance test (>200 mg/dL at 2 hours), useful in this case because her fasting blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL did not quite reach the diagnostic criterion of 126 mg/dL. The fundamental abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance. Several adipocyte-derived molecules, such as adiponectin and resistin, have been implicated in the causation of insulin resistance, establishing the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) has emerged as a key molecule in the regulation of insulin resistance through its actions on adipocyte hormones. TZDs bind to and activate PPARg in adipocytes, and increase the levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and reduce the levels of free fatty acids and resistin, both of which increase insulin resistance. Insulin autoantibodies are seen with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Beta-cell loss and density of insulin receptors are not major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. TZDs do not affect the metabolism of insulin. Glucagon excess worsens diabetes, but TZDs do not affect its secretion. Beta cells do not regenerate, but many antidiabetogenic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus are designed to work with the beta cells that are left.",A

"An overweight 48-year-old male presents with complaints of increased thirst and frequent urination. Laboratory examination reveals a blood glucose level of 180 mg/dL. The patient's past medical history is unremarkable, except for an anaphylactic reaction that occurred one year ago when he was given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for a sinus infection. Based on this information, which of the following agents should be prescribed?",Chlorpropamide,Glipizide,Glucagon,Metformin,"The patient's initial presentation strongly suggests Type 2 diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which usually begins in middle or late life. Symptoms often develop gradually, and the diagnosis is frequently made when an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient is found on routine laboratory examination to have an elevated blood glucose level. Therapy with an oral hypoglycemic agent would be appropriate in this case. Since the patient had a documented anaphylactic reaction to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, he should not take any ""sulfa"" drugs, including the sulfonylurea type oral hypoglycemic agents such as chlorpropamide and glipizide. Metformin is a biguanide oral hypoglycemic agent, chemically distinct from the sulfonylureas. This medication is indicated as monotherapy or in conjunction with other oral hypoglycemic agents in the treatment of NIDDM. Glucagon is the drug of choice for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia; this agent would worsen the patient's hyperglycemia.",D
Osteogenesis imperfect defect in,Collagen type I,Elastin,Collagen type IV,basement membrane,"harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition. *osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant or recessive disorder of synthesizing type1 collagen that constitutes 90 to 95 % bone matrix Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as ""brittle bone disease,"" is actually a group of genetic disorders caused by defec- tive synthesis of type I collagen. Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",A

Which of the following cells do not act as antigen presenting cells. ?-,T-cells,B-cells,Macrophages,Osteoclasts,"Answer is option 1 T cell responses differ from B cell responses in at least two crucial ways. First, T cells are activated by foreign antigen to proliferate and differentiate into effector cells only when the antigen is displayed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. The T cells respond in this manner because the form of antigen they recognize is different from that recognized by B cells. Whereas B cells recognize intact antigen, T cells recognize fragments of protein antigens that have been paly degraded inside the antigen-presenting cell. The peptide fragments are then carried to the surface of the presenting cell on special molecules called MHC proteins, which present the fragments to T cells. T cells don't act as antigen presenting cells.",A

Since the outer cortical plate of the mandible is thick in the molar region, the lingual plate is the one most frequently perforated. According to the studies of Tschiassny, initial infection of the submandibular space, particularly in cases of the second and third molars, is due to the fact that the apices of these teeth are situated below the mylohyoid ridge in 65% of cases. He also noted that because the apices of the roots of the first molar are above this ridge in about 60% of the cases, infection of the sublingual space is most common in cases of infection of this tooth.

Inherited coagulation disorder is all except -,Protein C deficiency,Protein S deficiency,Leiden mutation,Lupus anticoagulant,"Primary (inherited) hypercoagulability most often is caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes: Approximately 2% to 15% of whites carry a specific factor V mutation (called the Leiden mutation, after the Dutch city where it was first described). The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1% to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrombin transcription and is associated with a nearly threefold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life. Congenitally elevated levels of homocysteine contribute to aerial and venous thromboses (and indeed to the development of atherosclerosis) ( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9 th edition, page 87 )",D

Which among the following is a long acting beta-2 agonist?,Albuterol,Salmeterol,Pirbuterol,Orciprenaline,"The long-acting inhaled 2 agonists (LABA) salmeterol have proved to be a significant advance in asthma and COPD therapy. This drugs have a bronchodilator action of >12 hours and also protect against bronchoconstriction for a similar period. Albuterol is a sho acting selective 2 receptor agonist with pharmacological propeies and therapeutic indications similar to those of terbutaline. It is administered either by inhalation or orally for the symptomatic relief of bronchospasm. Pirbuterol is a sho acting and relatively selective 2 agonist. Its structure is identical to albuterol except for the substitution of a pyridine ring for the benzene ring. Pirbuterol acetate is available for inhalation therapy; dosing is typically every 4-6 hours. Pirbuterol is the only preparation available in a breath-activated meter-dose inhaler, a device meant to optimize medication delivery by releasing a spray of medication only on the patient's initiation of inspiration. Orciprenaline is a sho acting 2 adrenergic agonist.It is considered to be 2-selective, although it probably is less selective than albuterol or terbutaline and hence is more prone to cause cardiac stimulation.

Poorly differentiated carcinoma express-,Cytokeratin,Vimentin,ILA,desmin,"Cytokeratins are proteins of keratin-containing intermediate filaments found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue. The term ""cytokeratin"" began to be used in the late 1970s (for example, see ""Intermediate-sized filaments of human endothelial cells"" by Franke, Schmid, Osborn and Weber) when the protein subunits of keratin intermediate filaments inside cells were first being identified and characterizedThe subsets of cytokeratins which an epithelial cell expresses depends mainly on the type of epithelium, the moment in the course of terminal differentiation and the stage of development. Thus this specific cytokeratin fingerprint allows the classification of all epithelia upon their cytokeratin expression profile. Fuhermore, this applies also to the malignant counterpas of the epithelia (carcinomas), as the cytokeratin profile tends to remain constant when an epithelium undergoes malignant transformation. The main clinical implication is that the study of the cytokeratin profile by immunohistochemistry techniques is a tool of immense value widely used for tumor diagnosis and characterization in surgical pathology.",A

It was soon synthesized chemically and the commercial product now is all synthetic. Adverse effects 1 . Bone marrow depression Of all drugs, chloramphenicol is the most impoant cause of aplastic anaemia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia. Two forms are recognized: (a) Non-dose related idiosyncratic reaction: This is rare (1 in 40,000), unpredictable, but serious, often fatal, probably has a genetic basis and is more common after repeated courses. Aplastic anaemia is the most common manifestation. Apparently, a longer latent period of onset of marrow aplasia is associated with higher moality. Many victims, even if they survive, develop leukaemias later. (b) Dose and duration of therapy related myelosuppression: a direct toxic effect, predictable and probably due to inhibition of mitochondrial enzyme synthesis. This is often reversible without long-term sequelae. Liver and kidney disease predisposes to such toxicity. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions Rashes, fever, atrophic glossitis, angioedema are infrequent 3. Irritative effects Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pain on injection. 4. Superinfections These are similar to tetracyclines, but less common. 5. Gray baby syndrome It occurred when high doses (-100 mg/kg) were given prophylactically to neonates, especially premature. The baby stopped feeding, vomited, became hypotonic and hypothermic, abdomen distended, respiration became irregular; an ashen gray cyanosis developed in many, followed by cardiovascular collapse and death. Blood lactic acid was raised. It occurs because of inability of the newborn to adequately metabolize and excrete chloramphenicol. At higher concentration, chloramphenicol blocks electron transpo in the liver, myocardium and skeletal muscle, resulting in the above symptoms. It should be avoided in neonates, and even if given, dose should be - 25 mg/kg/day. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY,K.D.TRIPATHI,SIXTH EDIYION PAGE NO:715,717",B

A microbiology laboratory repos growth of Staphylococcus aureus from pus drained from a breast abscess. What is the most likely condition predisposing the patient to the development of a breast abscess?,Breast feeding,Endocarditis,Inflammatory breast carcinoma,Menopause,"Acute mastitis, frequently complicated by breast abscess formation, typically develops in the postpaum period, when the nipples are first subjected to the physical stresses of breast feeding. Bacteria enter the breast cracks in the nipple, and flourish in the microenvironment of the lactating breast. Acute mastitis causes redness, pain, and swelling in the affected breast; Staph. aureus is the most common pathogen. Although endocarditis could send septic emboli to the breast, Staph. aureus endocarditis is more commonly associated with bacteremia and fevers, proliferative glomerulonephritis, valvular dysfunction, and emboli to the brain, kidneys, hea, and gut. Inflammatory breast carcinoma does not invoke an inflammatory response, and it is not associated with an infection. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is characterized by tumor spread into the dermal lymphatics, producing diffuse induration and skin tenderness with the typical peau d'orange appearance. Mastitis arising in the perimenopausal period is usually a chronic mastitis, caused by obstruction of ducts due to inspissated secretions. Chronic mastitis is sterile. The breast tissue shows lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding dilated ducts filled by cellular debris. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 17.

Predisposing factors for lung cancer

A smoking → Most important factor associated with lung carcinoma. Two lung cancer cell types, squamous cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma are strongly associated with cigarette smoking and are extremely rare in the absence of cigarette smoking.
High dose ionizing radiation eg. by uranium
Asbestos exposure
Radon exposure
Contact with certain chemicals and substances: such as uranium, chromium and nickel; can cause lung cancer, but this is rare.
Molecular genetics → All the previously mentioned factors cause a genetic alteration in lung cells, which accumulate and eventually lead to the neoplastic phenotype.

- Small cell cancer → Alteration in c-MYC & RB genes.
- Non-small cell cancer → Alteration in RAS & p16 genes.
- Both small and non-small cancer → p53 gene
- Squamous cell carcinomas show the highest frequency of p53 mutations.

Inheritance of ABO blood group is:,X-linked inheritance,Recessive inheritance,Mitochondria] inheritance,Codominance,"Ans. d. Codominance (Ref Robbins 9/e p140; Ganong 23/e p527)Inheritance of ABO blood group is Codominance.""Although Mendelian traits are usually described as dominant or recessive, in some cases both of the alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype--a condition called codominance. Histocompatibility and blood group antigens are good examples of codominant inheritance. ""--Robbins 9/e p140Codominance is a relationship between two versions of a gene, individuals receive one version of a gene, called an allele, from each parent. If the alleles are different, the dominant allele usually will be expressed, while the effect of the other allele, called recessive, is masked. In Codominance, however, neither allele is recessive nor are the phenotypes of both alleles are expressed, e.g., ABO blood group, where in AB blood group both A and B are dominant.""Codominance: When both alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype. E.g., Blood group AB.ABO Blood Group SystemA and B antigens of the ABO blood group system are glycoproteins present on the RBC membrane.H substance is the immediate precursor on which A and B antigens are added.H substance is formed by the addition of fucose to the glycolipid or glycoprotein backbone.The subsequent N-acetyl glucosamine creates the A antigen, while the addition of galactose produces the B antigen.Bombay phenotypeIndividuals with the rare Bombay phenotype (hh) do not express the H antigen (also called the H substance), the antigen, which is present in blood group OQ.As a result of the absence of the H antigen they cannot make either the A antigen or the B antigenQ.These individuals have antibodies not only against A and B antigens but also against the H antigenQ.",D
