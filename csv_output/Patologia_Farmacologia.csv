On examination, she has diffuse but mild muscle tenderness. Laboratory studies show her serum creatine kinase is 2049 U/L and creatinine is 2 mg/dL. Urine dipstick analysis is positive for blood, without RBCs on urine microscopy. Which of the following drugs is most likely to produce her findings?",Cholestyramine,Clofibrate,Ezetimibe,Lovastatin,"She has a statin-induced myopathy, with a creatine kinase level more than 10 times normal from rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin released from muscle can be detected by the urine dipstick). Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that reduce endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Cholestyramine binds bile acids in the intestine and disrupts enterohepatic bile acid circulation to increase the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. Clofibrate enhances uptake and oxidation of free fatty acids in muscle. Ezetimibe interferes with intestinal lipid absorption. Nicotinic acid inhibits the mobilization of peripheral free fatty acids to reduce hepatic triglyceride synthesis and secretion of VLDL.",D

"A newborn baby presented with profuse bleeding from the umbilical stump after birth. Rest of the examination and PT, APTT are within normal limits. Most probable diagnosis is -",Factor X deficiency,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,Von willebrand disease,Bernard soulier disease,"Normal PT and APTT exclude option a and c because PT is raised in factor X deficiency and APTT is raised in Von Willebrand disease.
So we are left with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and Bernard Soulier syndrome.
Both these disorder are platelet function disorders and can result in neonatal bleeding.
Disorders of platelet function produce defects in the formation of a hemostatic plug and thus results in bleeding.
Both are congenital disorders.
There is little to differentiate between these two disorders.
Between these two, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia can present as bleeding since birth.

Glanzmann's thrombasthenia

Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
The disease is characterized by a deficiency of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa which acts as a receptor for fibrinogen.
The disease manifests at birth with increased bleeding from the umbilical cord stump.

a.Â There is a lifelong mucocutaneous bleeding tendency in the form of epistaxis, ecchymoses and bleeding fromÂ the gums.
b.Â Episodes of G.I. bleeding genitourinary bleeding or post surgery/trauma may occur. However, bleeding episodesÂ decrease with increasing age.
Bernard Soulier syndrome

It is a rare autosomal disorder characterized by mild thrombocytopenia, giant platelets and defective adhesion.
The striking abnormality is giant platelet in peripheral smear.
The membrane abnormality is GPIb-IX-V complex in platelets and megakaryocytes.
Bleeding usually begins at an early age.
There is moderate bleeding in the form of purpuric rash, bruising epistaxis, gingival bleeding and men.

The main lab findings are increased in bleeding time without any coagulation abnormality.",B

Gingival biopsy is used for diagnosis of ?,Scurvy,Sarcoidosis,Amyloidosis,SLE,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Amyloidosis Biopsy of gingiva (gingival biopsy) is used in the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Diagnosis of amvloidosis The most definitive investigation for amyloidosis is biopsy. The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by detecting the characteristic amyloid protein in a biopsy specimen of involved tissue. For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice. However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity). Other sites are salivary glands, gingiva, skin, tongue, bone marrow, stomach.",C

Which of the following condition has increased risk ofmalignancy-,Metaplasia,Dysplasia,Hyperplasia,Inflammation,"Metaplasia is the reversible replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type. The change from one type of cell to another may be pa of a normal maturation process, or caused by some so of abnormal stimulus. In simplistic terms, it is as if the original cells are not robust enough to withstand their environment, so they transform into another cell type better suited to their environment. If the stimulus causing metaplasia is removed or ceases, tissues return to their normal pattern of differentiation. Metaplasia is not synonymous with dysplasia, and is not considered to be an actual cancer. It is also contrasted with heteroplasia, which is the spontaneous abnormal growth of cytologic and histologic elements. Today, metaplastic changes are usually considered to be an early phase of carcinogenesis, specifically for those with a history of cancers or who are known to be susceptible to carcinogenic changes. Metaplastic change is often viewed as a premalignant condition that requires immediate intervention, either surgical or medical, because metaplasia is associated with cancer.",A
Type of necrosis occurring in brain-,Coagulative,Liquefactive,Fibrinoid,Caseous,"CoagulativeÂ necrosis

This is the most common type of necrosis.
This type of necrosis is most frequently caused by sudden cessation of blood flow (ischemia) in organsÂ such as the heart (MI), Kidney (ATN), adrenal gland, and spleen.
Note: Brain is the only exception, i.e., It is the only solid organ in which ischemia leads to liquefaction necrosis, not coagulative necrosis.
It is also seen with other types of injury e.g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis ofÂ skin after burns (Thermal injury).
Why there are predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion?
Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier) â 4 pH results in denaturationÂ ofÂ proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes â So, there is no enzymaticÂ digestion

LiquefactiveÂ necrosis

It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergoes softening and liquefaction because of theÂ action of hydrolytic enzymes.
It occurs after

1. Infection Le., suppurative inflammation (most common).
2. Ischemic necrosis in the brain.
Note: Brain lacks any substantial supportive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in the brain is liquefactive, unlike otherÂ organs where it is coagulative.

Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis â Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and theseÂ cells to release lysosomal enzymes.
Caseous necrosis
It is a variant of coagulative necrosis.
It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to certain organisms e.g.,Â Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis).
Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulativeÂ necrosis?
In contrast to coagulative necrosis where tissue architecture is maintained, in caseous necrosis, the tissueÂ architecture is completely obliterated. So, it has been called caseous because of its cheesy whiteÂ appearance of the area of necrosis.",B

Mutation leading to sickle cell anemia-,Crossover mutation,Frameshift,Deletion,Point mutation,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Point mutationIn sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation.Mutations o A mutation is a permanant change in the DNA.o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease. o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are impoant in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations.o Mutations may be classified into three categories ?I. Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations.o These may of different types depending whether it involves complete gene or single base ?(a) Point mutationA single nucleotide base is subustituted by a different base.When a pyrimidine base is subustituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine ---> Transition.When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa --> Transversion.This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation. o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in 13-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is13-thalassemia in which CAG codon in f3-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.(b) Deletion and inseionsDeletion or inseion of one or two base lead to alterations in the reading frame of the DNA strand frame shift mutation.If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three framshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.(c) Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain.o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.2.Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome.3.Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",D
A 58-year-old woman presents with an irregular nodularity that has developed in her right breast over the past 3 months. Mammography demonstrates irregular densities in both breasts. A needle biopsy of one breast lesion is shown. An excisional biopsy of the contralateral breast shows similar histology. Which of the following is the most likely pathologic diagnosis?,Colloid carcinoma,Lobular carcinoma in situ,Malignant phyllodes tumor,Medullary carcinoma,"Lobular carcinoma in situ arises in the terminal duct lobular unit. Malignant cells appear as solid clusters that pack and distend the terminal ducts but not to the extent of ductal carcinoma in situ. The lesion does not usually incite the dense fibrosis and chronic inflammation so characteristic of intraductal carcinoma in situ and is, therefore, less likely to cause a detectable mass. It is not uncommon for lobular carcinoma in situ to be an ""incidental"" finding in a biopsy that was prompted by benign changes. As with intraductal carcinoma in situ, 20% to 30% of women with lobular carcinoma in situ receiving no further treatment after biopsy will develop invasive cancer within 20 years of diagnosis. However, about half of these invasive cancers will arise in the contralateral breast and may be either lobular or ductal cancers. Thus, lobular carcinoma in situ, more than ductal carcinoma in situ, serves as a marker for an enhanced risk of subsequent invasive cancer in both breasts. The histologic appearance is not consistent with any of the other choices.Diagnosis: Lobular carcinoma in situ",B

The inflammatory response to the spirochetes causes an obliterative endaeritis of the vaso vasorum, leading to a loss of blood supply to the elastic tunica media. Ischemia of the tunica media, combined with fuher syphilitic invasion into the tunica media itself, results in medial destruction and weakening, ultimately causing dilation and aneurysm-formation. Fibrosis of the vascular wall can give involved vessels a 'tree-bark'-like appearance and probably protects against aoic dissections which are not a consequence of syphilitic aneurysms. Syphilitic Aneurysms almost always involve the ascending aoa or aoic root and can lead to aoic regurgitation due to separation of the aoic valve leaflets.

The parents of a 2-year-old boy with hyposadias (urethra opens on the ventral aspect of the penis) visit a genetic counselor to discuss the chances that a similar birth defect will occur in their future offspring. This birth defect shows which of the following patterns of inheritance?,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,Multifactorial,X-linked dominant,"The inheritance of a number of birth defects is multifactorial. Most normal human traits are inherited neither as dominant nor as recessive mendelian attributes, but rather in a more complex manner. For example, multifactorial inheritance determines intelligence, height, skin color, body habitus, and even emotional disposition. Similarly, most of the common chronic disorders of adults represent multifactorial genetic diseases and are well known to ""run in families."" Such maladies include diabetes, atherosclerosis, and many forms of cancer and arthritis, and hypertension. The inheritance of a number of birth defects is also multifactorial (e.g., cleft lip and palate, pyloric stenosis, hypospadias, and congenital heart disease). The concept of multifactorial inheritance is based on the notion that multiple genes interact with various environmental factors to produce disease in an individual patient. Such inheritance leads to familial aggregation that does not obey simple mendelian rules (see choices A, B, D, and E). As a consequence, the inheritance of polygenic diseases is studied by the methods of population genetics, rather than by the analysis of individual family pedigrees.Diagnosis: Hypospadias, multifactorial inheritance",C

Multiple sinuses from infection of great toe is mainly caused by: September 2007,Tuberculosis,Actinomycetes,Trichosporum,Histoplasmosis,"Ans. B: Actinomycetes Mycetoma is a chronic localized granulomatous inflammatory lesion common in the tropics and sub-tropics. Multiple siAuses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includes Actinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) and Botryomycosis (bacterial infection). - Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick). Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs. The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread. - Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera . This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy. Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy. In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise. The differential diagnosis includes chronic osteomyelitis, tuberculosis and chronic abscesses.",B

Teratomas are AKA ""Dermoid Cyst"" Gross appearance is heterogeneous with solid, sometimes Cailaginous, and cystic areas. Teratomas are composed of a heterogeneous, helter-skelter collection of differentiated cells or organoid structures, such as neural tissue, muscle bundles, islands of cailage, clusters of squamous epithelium, structures reminiscent of thyroid gland, bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium, and bits of intestinal wall or brain substance, all embedded in a fibrous or myxoid stroma. Elements may be mature (resembling various adult tissues) or immature (sharing histologic features with fetal or embryonal tissue). Rarely, malignant non-germ cell tumors arise in teratomas, a phenomenon that is referred to as ""teratoma with malignant transformation"". Transformation may take the form of a squamous cell carcinoma, mucin-secreting adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, or other cancers. The impoance of recognizing a non-germ cell malignancy arising in a teratoma is that these secondary tumors are chemoresistant; thus, the only hope for cure resides in the resectability of the tumor.

"A 4-year-old female is being evaluated for the sudden onset of multiple petechiae and bruises. She is found to have a peripheral leukocyte count of 55,000, 86% of which are small, homogeneous cells that have nuclei with immature chromatin. Indistinct nucleoli are also present. Initial tests on these immature cells are as follows: TdT, positive; PAS, positive; acid phosphatase, positive; and myeloperoxidase, negative. Based on these findings, the immature cells most likely originated from",Lymphoblasts,Monoblasts,Megakaryoblasts,Myeloblasts,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is primarily a disease of children and young adults that is characterized by the presence of numerous lymphoblasts within the bone marrow. These malignant cells may spill over into the blood and other organs. In contrast to myeloblasts, lymphoblasts do not contain myeloperoxidase, but they do stain positively with the PAS stain or acid phosphatase stain and for the enzyme TdT. The French-American-British (FAB) classification of ALL divides ALL into three types based on the morphology of the proliferating lymphoblasts. L1-ALL, seen in about 85% of the cases of ALL, consists of small homogeneous blasts. L2-ALL, seen in only 15% of cases of ALL, but more common in adults, consists of lymphoblasts that are larger and more heterogeneous (pleomorphic) than L1 blasts. These cells may also contain nuclear clefts. The final type of FAB ALL is the L3 type, which is seen in less than 1% of the cases of ALL. This form is essentially the leukemic form of Burkitt's lymphoma. Like the malignant cells of Burkitt's lymphoma, these L3-ALL cells are large blasts with cytoplasmic vacuoles that stain positively with the oil red O lipid stain. In contrast to the FAB classification of ALL, the immunologic classification of ALL is based on the developmental sequence of maturation of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. First it is necessary to determine whether the blasts have B cell or T cell markers. Most cases of ALL are of B cell origin; that is, the lymphoblasts express both CD19 and DR. A few cases of ALL are of T cell origin; the lymphoblasts lack CD19 and DR and instead express T cell antigens CD2, 5, and 7. Many cases of T-ALL involve a mediastinal mass and are clinically similar to cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma. To subclassify B-ALL, first determine if surface immunoglobulin (sIg) is present. Mature B-ALL cells (L3-ALL or Burkitt's lymphoma) have surface immunoglobulin, which is not found in the other types of B-ALL. These mature cells typically lack TdT, which is a marker for more immature cells. Next determine if there is cytoplasmic u present. Cytoplasmic u chains are specific for pre-B ALL cells, which have a characteristic translocation t(1;19). The B cell ALL cells that lack both surface Ig and cytoplasmic u are called early pre-B-ALL and are separated into the CALLA (CD10)-positive and CALLA-negative types Acute Lymbhoblastic leukemia Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",A

RPGN may be subdivided into three types based on the immunofluorescence (IF) staining pattern. Type I RPGN reveals linear staining of IgG and C3. The majority of these patients are found to have Goodpasture's disease (anti-GBM disease). Type II RPGN reveals immune complex deposition (granular staining). These patients may have other glomerular or systemic diseases, including post-streptococcal GN, membranoproliferative GN, IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease), and SLE. Type III RPGN reveals minimal immune changes and is referred to as pauci-immune crescentic GN. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), which are found in some patients with vasculitis, are found in many of these patients with pauci-immune GN. ANCAs are either perinuclear (P-ANCAs, against myeloperoxidase) or cytoplasmic (C-ANCAs, against proteinase 3). P-ANCAs are found in patients with microscopic polyaeritis and idiopathic crescentic GN, while C-ANCAs are found in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, a disorder that is characterized by acute necrotizing granulomas of the respiratory tract, focal necrotizing vasculitis, and diffuse necrotizing GN Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",B

What is the most common cause of this patient's disease in adults?",Abdominal trauma,Chronic alcoholism,Gallstones,Hyperlipidemia,"Chronic pancreatitis is characterized histologically by chronic inflammation and irregular fibrosis of the pancreas. The major cause of chronic pancreatitis in adults is chronic alcoholism, while in children the major cause is cystic fibrosis. Recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis also result in the changes of chronic pancreatitis. Hypercalcemia and hyperlipidemia also predispose to chronic pancreatitis (since they are causes of acute pancreatitis), while in as many as 10% of patients, recurrent pancreatitis is associated with pancreas divisum. This condition refers to the finding of the accessory duct being the major excretory duct of the pancreas. Chronic ductal obstruction may be a cause of chronic pancreatitis and may be associated with gallstones, but it is more appropriate to relate gallstones with acute ductal obstruction and resultant acute pancreatitis. Complications of chronic pancreatitis include pancreatic calcifications, pancreatic cysts and pseudocysts, stones within the pancreatic ducts, diabetes, and fat malabsorption, which results in steatorrhea and decreased vitamin K levels.

This defect causes abnormal regulation of -catenin, which leads to abnormal cell proliferation and the initial steps in tumor formation. Mutational activation of the K-ras gene leads to constitutive activation of an impoant proliferative signaling pathway, is common at these stages, and fuher increases the proliferative potential of the adenomatous tumor cells.

Currently, it is the most prevalent occupational disease in the world.* Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms but crystalline forms are much more fibrogenic. The crystalline form are quartz, and crystobalite.* Silicosis is characterized in its early stages by nodules in the upper zones of the lung. As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars. Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura. Sometimes thin sheets of calcification occur in the lymph nodes and are seen radiographically as egg shell calcification i.e. (calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification. It the disease continues to progress, expansion and coalescence of lesions produce progressive massive fibrosis.* Histologically the lesions of silicosis consist of concentric layers of hyalinized collagen surrounded by a dense capsule of more condensed collagen.

Karyotyping is useful in diagnosis of-,Autosomal recessive disorders,X-linked recessive disorders,Chromosomal abnormalities,Biochemical abnormalities,"A karyotype is a photographic representation of a stained metaphase spread in which the chromosomes are arranged in order of decreasing length.A variety of techniques for staining chromosomes have been developed. With the widely used Giemsa stain (G banding) technique, each chromosome set can be seen to possess a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark bands of variable widths . The use of banding techniques allows identification of each chromosome, and can detect and localize structural abnormalities. Karyotype analy- sis of chromosomes by G banding remains the classic approach for identifying changes at the chromosomal level; however, as might be expected, the resolution with this technique is fairly low. In order to identify subchromo- somal alterations, both focused analysis of chromosomal regions by FISH and global genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have become popular. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) FISH utilizes DNA probes that recognize sequences spe- cific to chromosomal regions of greater than 100 kilobases in size, which defines the limit of resolution with this tech- nique for identifying chromosomal changes. Such probes are labeled with fluorescent dyes and applied to metaphase spreads or interphase nuclei. The probe hybridizes to its complementary sequence on the chromosome and thus labels the specific chromosomal region that can then be visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The ability of FISH to circumvent the need for dividing cells is invaluable when a rapid diagnosis is warranted (e.g., in a critically ill infant suspected of having an underlying genetic disorder). Such analysis can be performed on prenatal samples (e.g., cells obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy, or umbilical cord blood), peripheral blood lymphocytes, and even archival tissue sections. FISH has been used for detection of numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy) (Fig. 6-37, A); for the demonstration of subtle microdeletions (Fig. 6-37, B) or complex transloca- tions not detectable by routine karyotyping; for analysis of gene amplification (e.g., NMYC amplification in neuroblastomas); and for mapping newly isolated genes of interest to their chromosomal loci. Array-Based Genomic Hybridization It is obvious from the preceding discussion that FISH requires previous knowledge of the one or few specific chromosomal regions suspected of being altered in the test sample. However, chromosomal abnormalities may also be detected without previous knowledge of what these aber- rations may be, using a global strategy known as array- based CGH. Here the test DNA and a reference (normal) DNA are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes (most commonly, Cy5 and Cy3, which fluoresce red and green, respectively). The differentially labeled samples are then hybridized to an array of segments of genomic DNA ""spotted"" on a solid matrix, usually a glass slide (Fig. 6-38, A). These segments of DNA are representations of the human genome at regularly spaced intervals, and cover all 22 autosomes and the sex chromosome (Fig. 6-38, A). Amplifications and deletions in the test sample produce an increase or decrease in signal relative to the normal DNA that can be detected down to a 10-kilobase (kb) resolution (Fig. 6-38, B). Newer generations of microarrays using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (see fuher on) provide even higher resolution (with more than 1 million SNPs from the human genome on a single microarray!) and are currently being used to uncover copy number abnor- malities in a variety of diseases, from cancer to autism.

"A 13-year-old, previously healthy boy has had pain in the right leg for the past month. There is no history of trauma or recent illness. On physical examination, there is warmth and tenderness to palpation of the right lower thigh anteriorly, and the circumference of the right thigh is slightly larger than that of the left. His temperature is 39degC. A radiograph of the right leg shows a 6-cm expansile mass in the diaphyseal region of the right lower femur that extends into the soft tissue and is covered by layers of reactive bone. A biopsy of the mass is done, and microscopic examination shows sheets of closely packed primitive cells with small, uniform nuclei and only scant cytoplasm. Karyotypic analysis of the tumor cells shows a t(11;22) translocation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chondrosarcoma,Ewing sarcoma,Giant cell tumor,Metastatic carcinoma,"The histologic appearance is characteristic of an Ewing sarcoma. The radiologic appearance of the mass in this child is typical for a malignant tumor, with bone destruction and soft-tissue extension. The two most common malignant bone tumors in children are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcomas typically arise in the metaphyseal region, whereas Ewing sarcoma arises in the diaphyseal region of long tubular bones, as seen in this case. This tumor usually occurs in patients 10 to 15 years old. The t (11;22) translocation is present in about 85% of Ewing sarcomas and the related primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), which belong to the small round cell tumors of childhood that can be difficult to distinguish microscopically. The translocation gives rise to the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene, now considered the definitive test for the diagnosis of these tumors. Ewing sarcomas often produce tender masses with fever and leukocytosis, mimicking acute osteomyelitis. Chondrosarcoma can occur across a wide age range, in contrast to most primary malignancies arising in bone, which occur most often in the first two decades; most are sufficiently differentiated so that a cartilaginous matrix is apparent on microscopic examination. A giant cell tumor is a benign but locally aggressive lesion that arises in the epiphysis of the long bones of young adults and has a ""soap bubble"" radiographic appearance. Metastatic carcinoma is the most common tumor of adults involving bone because there are far more carcinomas than primary bone malignancies; childhood bone metastases are rare. Osteosarcoma typically arises in the metaphyseal region, and the malignant spindle cells produce an osteoid matrix. A plasmacytoma produces a focal lytic lesion within the bone, and microscopically there are recognizable plasma cells.",B

These findings are typical for which of the following type of hypersensitivity immunologic responses:",Type IV,Type II,Type III,Type I,"Presence of epithelioid cell granuloma, Langhans giant cells and lymphocytes is characteristic of chronicÂ granulomatous inflammation
Chronic granulomatous inflammation occurs when two conditions are satisfied i.e.

a. When an active T lymphocyte-mediated cellular immune response occurs.

Lymphokines produced by activated T lymphocytes inhibit migration of macrophages and cause them toÂ aggregate in the area of injury and form granulomas.
This pathological process is characteristic of Type IV hypersensitivity (so one can say that- Type IVÂ hypersensitivity is essential for chronic granulomatous inflammation)

b. When macrophages have successfully phagocytosed the injurious agent but it survives inside them.

Some important definitions- â¢ Epithelioid cells - These are activated macrophages
They are large cells with abundant pale foamy cytoplasm

"In acute inflammation, Late-appearing sunburn is an example of",Delayed transient increase in permeability,Early transient increase in permeability,Delayed prolonged increase in permeability,Early permanent increase in permeability,"In Acute inflammation:Contraction of endothelial cells resulting in increased inter-endothelial spaces is the most common mechanism of vascular leakage. It is elicited by histamine,bradykinin, leukotrienes, and other chemical mediators. It is called the immediate transient response because it occurs rapidly after exposure to the mediator and is usually sho-lived (15 to 30 minutes). In some forms of mild injury (e.g., after burns, irradiation or ultraviolet radiation and exposure to ceain bacterial toxins), vascular leakage begins after a delay of 2 to 12 hours and lasts for several hours or even days; this delayed prolongedleakage may be caused by contraction of endothelial cells or mild endothelial damage. Late-appearing sunburn is a good example of this type of leakage.Reference: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease; 9th edition; Chapter 3; Acute Inflammation",C

"Nodular glomerulosclerosis is associated with: September 2009 and 2011, September 2012",Henoch-Schonlein purpura,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Hypeension,Diabetes Mellitus,"Ans. D: Diabetes Mellitus Nodular glomerulosclerosis refers to a histologic pattern of nodular mesangial sclerosis with accentuated, lobular-appearing glomeruli on renal biopsy. Although nodular glomerulosclerosis is classically described in association with diabetes (the so-called ""KimmelstielWilson lesion""), the lesion is not pathognomonic for diabetic nephropathy. In fact, a number of renal conditions have been seen in association with this distinctive, histologic pattern. The differential diagnosis of non-diabetic, nodular glomerulosclerosis includes, but is not limited to: Immunotactoid glomerulosnephritis Fibrillary glomerulosnephritis Fibronectin glomerulosnephritis Cryoglobulinemic glomerulosnephritis Amyloidosis Light Chain Deposition Disease (LCDD) Heavy Chain Deposition Disease (HCDD) Idiopathic Nodular Glomerulosclerosis In order to determine the specific disease responsible for nodular glomerulosclerosis, a deliberate inspection of the renal biopsy (paicularly, Congo red staining) is required.

"A 24-year-old woman notes a lump in her right breast for the past month. She is concerned because her sister was diagnosed with poorly differentiated ""triple-negative"" breast cancer at age 31. Ultrasonography of the breast shows a solid mass. Fine needle aspiration is attempted but no diagnostic cells are obtained. Mammography is performed and there is a single 1-cm density with small clustered calcifications in the right breast but no lesions of the opposite breast. Which of the following is the best course of action for this patient?",Biopsy to obtain tissue from the lesion,Continued monthly breast self-examination,Genetic testing for BRCA1 mutations,Hormonal therapy with tamoxifen,"Her age would suggest the lesion is probably benign, and even fibroadenomas and fibrocystic changes can have calcifications. The fibrous component of fibroadenoma or fibrocystic changes can make it difficult to aspirate cells from them. However, the family history and the mammographic appearance of small clustered calcifications are concerning for carcinoma. A delay in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer decreases survival. Although BRCA1 mutations are associated with HER2 and ER- and PR-negative breast cancers, the lesion must still be diagnosed. Based upon the histologic findings and molecular markers, a treatment plan can then be instituted that may include additional studies and pharmacologic therapies.",A

Weight range of adrenal glands in most of cases of cushing's disease is -,4-11gm,11-13 gm,14-24 gm,25-40 gm,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., 25-40 gm o The weight of adrenal gland depends on the cause of cushing syndrome : ? Due to ACTH production by pituatory microadenoma (cushing disease) or by ectopic ACTH production. o ACTH stimulates the zona reticularis and zona fasciculata which results in either diffuse hyperplasia (25-40 gm) or nodular hyperplasia (30-50 gm) of adrenal. Primary pituitary adenoma Weight is less than 30 gm. Primary pituitary carcinoma -4 Weight is 200-300 gm. Exogenous glucocoicoid administration o Exogenously administered glucocoicoids inhibit the release of ACTH from pituitary by negative feed back mechanism. o So, there is no stimulatory signal on zona fasciculata and zona reticularis --> Both these layers undergo atrophy. o As zona glomerulosa function is independent of ACTH, its thickness remains normal. o Due to atrophy the weight of the gland is less than normal, i.e., < 4 gm.",D

Acellular amyloid deposits derived from calcitonin polypeptides are present in adjacent stroma.Calcitonin is readily demonstrable within the cytoplasm of the tumor cells and in stromal amyloid by immunohistochemical methods.One of the peculiar features of familial medullary cancers is the presence of multicentric C-cell hyperplasia in the surrounding thyroid parenchyma, a feature that is usually absent in sporadic lesions.Foci of C-cell hyperplasia are believed to represent the precursor lesions from which medullary carcinomas arise*Clinical CourseSporadic cases presents with mass in the neck and dysphagia or hoarseness.Paraneoplastic syndrome can occur, caused by the secretion of a peptide hormone (e.g., diarrhea due to the secretion of VIP, or Cushing syndrome due to ACTH).Notably, hypocalcemia is NOT a prominent feature, despite the presence of raised calcitonin levels.Secretion of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by the neoplastic cells is a useful biomarker.",A

a1 Antitrysin deficiency is associated with all except-,Fatty liver,Emphysema,Pancreatitis,Renal disease,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (harsh mohan)6th edition, page no.479 Protease-antiprotease . Alpha-1-antitrypsin (a1-AT), also called a1-protease inhibitor (a-1-Pi), is a glycoprotein that forms the normal constituent of the a1globulin fraction of the plasma proteins on serum electrophoresis. The single gene locus that codes for a-1-AT is located on the long arm of chromosome 15. It is normally synthesised in the liver and is distributed in the circulating blood, tissue fluids and macrophages. The normal function of a1-AT is to inhibit proteases and hence its name a1protease inhibitor. The proteases (mainly elastases) are derived from neutrophils. Neutrophil elastase has the capability of digesting lung parenchyma but is inhibited from doing so by anti-elastase effect of a1-AT. There are several known alleles of a1-AT which have an autosomal codominant inheritance pattern and are classified as normal (PiMM), deficient (PiZZ), null type (Pi null null) having no detectable level, and dysfunctional (PiSS) type having about half the normal level. The most common abnormal phenotype in classic a1-AT deficiency is homozygous state PiZZ resulting from a single amino acid substitution Glu-Lys which causes spontaneous polymerisation of a1-AT and inhibits its release from the liver. The remaining material of a1-AT in the liver causes hepatic cirrhosis . Clinically significant deficiency is also associated with homozygous Pi null null and heterozygous Pi nullZ. The heterozygote pattern of PiMZ has intermediate levels which is not sufficient to produce clinical deficiency, but heterozygote individuals who smoke heavily have higher risk of developing emphysema. The a1-AT deficiency develops in adults and causes pulmonary emphysema in smokers as well as in nonsmokers, though the smokers become symptomatic about 15 years earlier than non-smokers. The other organ showing effects of a1-AT deficiency is the liver which may develop obstructive jaundice early in infancy, and cirrhosis and hepatoma late in adulthood.It also causes chronic pancreatitis .",D

Mesotheliomas are of 2 types--benign (solitary) and malignant (diffuse). The biologic behaviour of pleural mesotheliomas is usually predicted by their gross appearance--those forming solitary, discrete masses are generally benign, whereas those which grow diffusely are usually malignant. Benign (Solitary) Mesothelioma Benign or solitary mesothelioma is also called as pleural fibroma. Asbestos exposure plays no role in etiology of benign mesothelioma. Malignant (Diffuse) Mesothelioma Malignant or diffuse mesothelioma is rare. It is a highly malignant tumour associated with high moality. The tumour is significant in view of its recognised association with occupational exposure to asbestos Pleural fibroma is differentiated from mesothelioma by the presence Cytokreatin",C

DNA repairs defect associated with aEUR',Xeroderma pigmentosum,Icthyosis,Mosaicism,??,"Xeroderma pigmentosum Genomic instability - enabler of malignancy The maintenance of integrity of information in D.N.A. molecule is of utmost impoance. Cells have developed elaborate mechanisms to monitor the integrity of the genetic material. A number of complex multisubunit enzyme systems are involved in repair of damaged DNA or to prevent any error during DNA synthesis. Despite the elaborate proofreading system employed during DNA synthesis, errors including base pairing or inseion of one to a few extra nucleotides can occur. In addition, DNA is constantly being subjected to environmental insults that cause the alteration or removal of nucleotide bases. - Base are also altered or lost spontaneously from mammalian DNA at a rate many thousands per cell per day. - If the damage is not repaired a permanent mutation (genomic instability) may be introduced that can result in any of a number of deleterious effects including loss of control over the proliferation of a mutated cell leading to cancer. Luckily cells are remarkably efficient at repairing damage done to their DNA. When there is a defect in DNA the cell cycle stops for a while, allowing the damaged DNA time for repair. If the DNA cannot be repaired it undergoes apoptosis. Most of the repair systems involve :? - Recognition of the damage on the DNA - Removal or excision of the damage - Replacement or, filling the gap left by excision using sister strand as template for DNA synthesis - Typically genomic instability occurs when both copies of the DNA repair gene are lost, however recent work has suggested that even a subset of these genes may promote cancer in haploinsufficient manner. Persons with defect in DNA repair continue to replicate damaged DNA rather than stopping to allow repair or undergoing apoptosis. -There are several inherited disorders in which genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair are defective. - Individuals born with such inherited defects in DNA repair proteins are at a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. - The defect in DNA repair protein leads to genomic instability which enables malignancy. - DNA repairing genes themselves are not oncogenic but their abnormalities allow mutations in other genes during the process of normal cell division. Three types of DNA repair defects contributes to different types of cancers Mismatch repair Nucleotide excision repairQ Recombination repair",A

Macrophages are conveed to epitheloid cells by which cytokine ?,IL-2,IFN-y,TNF-a,TGF-(3,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., IFN-y A granuloma is a focus of chronic inflammation consisting of a microscopic aggregation of macrophages that are transformed into epithelium like cells (epithelioid cells) surrounded by a Collor of mononuclear leukocytes, principally lymphocytes and occasionally plasma cells. Frequently, these epitheloid cells fuse to form giant cells in the periphery or some times in the center of granuloma. Pathogenesis of granuloma Immune granuloma (most common type of granuloma) is a type IV hypersensitivity that involved CD-4 helper T cell. On-exposure to paiculate antigen macrophages process and present this antigen to Helper T cells and also secretes IL-2. T-cells are activated on contact with this antigen and by IL-2. Activated T-cells (helper) produce IFN-y, the major cytokine of granulomatous inflammation. IFN-y has the following effects It is the most impoant activator of macrophages. It induce granuloma formation by conversion of activated macrophages into epitheliod cells and formation of giant cell. Augment the differentiation of T-cells. Finally there is formation of granuloma induced by IFN-y. Remember Foreign body (Nonimmune) granuloma consist almost entirely of epitheloid cells and multinucleated giant cells but no lymphocytes.

This process is mediated by both neurogenic and chemical mediator systems and usually resolves within seconds to minutes. Followed by, Vasodilation first involves the aerioles and then leads to the opening of new capillary beds in the area. There is increased permeability of the microvasculature, with the outpouring of protein-rich fluid into the extravascular tissues.

Actinic keratosis is a form of dysplasia in sun-exposed skin. Histologically, such lesions are composed of atypical squamous cells, which vary in size and shape. They show no signs of regular maturation as the cells move from the basal layer of the epidermis to the surface. Dysplasia is a preneoplastic lesion, in the sense that it is a necessary stage in the multistep evolution to cancer.

N K cells activity is enhanced by -,IL-1,TNF,IL-2,TGP-P,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., IL-2 o IL-2 acts as a growth factor for N K cells.Null cells.(Large granular lymphocytes)o Null cells are called so because they lack features of surface markers of both B and T lymphocytes,o The account for 5 to 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes.o They are also called ""large granular lymphocytes (LGL)"" as they contain large azurophilic cytoplasmic granules,o They expressSurface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (CD-16)NCAM-I (CD56)o They proliferate in response to IL-2o Many LGL express some lineage marker particularly CD-8, CD-2,o LGLs arise in both bone marrow and thymic microenvironment.o Members of this group are :Antibody dependent cytotoxic cells (ADCC)o ADCC possess surface receptors for the Fc part of Ig.o Capable of lysing or killing target cells sensitized with IgG.Natural killer cells (NK Cells)o Possess spontaneous cytotoxicity towards various target cells : -Virus infected cellsMalignant cellsTransplanted foreign cellso Cytotoxicity is not antibody dependent or MHC restrictedo Activity is nonimmune as it does not require sensitization by prior antigenic contact,o They have CD-56 and CD-16 on their surfaceo IL-2 acts as a growth factoro Natural killer cell activity is augmented by interferon.o They release perforin which causes transmembrane pores through which TNF-p enters the cell and induce apoptosis.o NK cells qre activated to LAK cells, in the presence of IL-2o Usually CD-3 negative but subset of NK cells are CD-3 positive called NK/T cells.o NK cells secrete TNF-oc, GMCSF, IFN-y, perforin, IL-4.o NK cells do not kill normal cells. Why is it so? lets see : - The NK cells express activating and inhibiting receptors. The functional activity of the NK cells is regulated by a balance between signal from these receptors. MHC class I molecules has inhibiting signal on NK cells and normal cell are not killed because inhibiting signals from normal MHC class I molecules overside activating signals. The ability of NK cells to kill target cells is inversly related to target cell expression of MHC class I molecule. If virus infection or neoplastic transformation reduces the expression of MHC I, inhibitory signals are interrupted and lysis of target cells occur.3.

The bone marrow is markedly hyper- cellular and contains numerous megaloblastic erythroid pro- genitors. Megaloblasts are larger than normal erythroid progenitors (normoblasts) and have delicate, finely reticu- lated nuclear chromatin (indicative of nuclear immaturity) (Fig. 11-11). As megaloblasts differentiate and acquire hemo- globin, the nucleus retains its finely distributed chromatin and fails to undergo the chromatin clumping typical of normo- blasts. The granulocytic precursors also demonstrate nuclear- cytoplasmic asynchrony, yielding giant metamyelocytes. Megakaryocytes may also be abnormally large and have bizarre multilobed nuclei. In the peripheral blood the earliest change is the appear- ance of hypersegmented neutrophils, which appear before the onset of anemia. Normal neutrophils have three or four nuclear lobes, but in megaloblastic anemias they often have five or more. The red cells typically include large, egg- shaped macro-ovalocytes; the mean cell volume often is greater than 110 fL (normal, 82 to 92 fL). Although macro- cytes appear hyperchromic, in reality the mean cell hemoglo- bin concentration is normal. Large, misshapen platelets also may be seen. Morphologic changes in other systems, espe- cially the gastrointestinal tract, also occur, giving rise to some of the clinical manifestations. Refer robbins 9/e pg 422",B

This produces the principal physical finding of mitral valve prolapse on cardiac auscultation i.e. o The midsystolic click a hipth pitched sound of sho duration. The midsystolic click may be loud or soft and varies in its timing according to left ventricular loading and contractility It is caused by the sudden tensing of the mitral valve apparatus as the leaflets billow into the left atrium during systole. Multiple systolic clicks may be generated by different poions of the mitral leaflets prolapsing at different times during systole. The midsystolic click is frequently followed by a late systolic murmur usually medium to high pitched and loudest at the apex. The murmur is produced by systolic leak of small amount of blood through the defective mitral valve during systole (mitral regurgitation murmur).,A

C: Granuloma formationSequence of vascular changes:Transient vasoconstriction of aerioles may be due to:- Direct mechanical stimulation of capillaries- Local axon reflex (vasoconstrictor fibres).Persistent vasodilation- first aerioles, followed by opening of capillary beds, caused by chemical mediators.Increased blood flow mainly due to aeriolar dilatation and opening of capillary beds.Slowing of the circulation (Stasis) due to- Increased viscosity of blood due to fluid loss- Swollen capillary endothelium due to toxin.Flow of protein-rich fluid into extra-vascular space called inflammatory exudates.Inflammatory Exudate: due to:- Increased intra-vascular hydrostatic pressure.- Increased permeability due to endothelial contraction with increased intercellular gaps, of the venules.- Direct endothelial injury and detachment, involving venules, capillaries and aerioles.- Increased tissue osmotic pressure.Margination and immigration of leucocytes:Normally red and white cells flow intermingled in the center of the vessel forming axial stream, separated from vessel wall by a clear cell-free plasmatic zone.Due to slowing of the circulation, leucocytes fall out of the axial stream and come to plasmatic zone known as margination of leucocytes.Leucocytes gradually adhere to the vessel wall known as pavementing of the leucocytes.Leucocytes squeeze between the endothelial cells by the process of diapedesis and migrate through the vessel wall into the interstitial tissue, a process known as emigration of leucocytes (first neutrophils followed by monocytes and lymphocytes).Emigrated leucocytes move towards the site of injury under the influence of chemotactic agents and the process is called chemotaxis.Granuloma formation is a distinctive pattern of chronic inflammation.",C
Most common cause of aoic aneurysm is -,Atherosclerosis,Syphilis,Trauma,Congenital,"Aneurysms are congenital or acquired dilations of blood vessels or the hea . ""True"" aneurysms involve all three layers of the aery (intima, media, and adventitia) or the attenuated wall of the hea; these include atherosclerotic and congenital vascular aneurysms, as well as ventricular aneurysms resulting from transmural myocardial infarctions. By comparison, a false aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm) results when a wall defect leads to the formation of an extravascular hematoma that communicates with the intravascular space (""pulsating hematoma""). Examples are ventricular ruptures contained by pericardial adhesions and leaks at the junction of a vascular graft with a natural aery. The two most impoant causes of aoic aneurysms are atherosclerosis and hypeension. Atherosclerosis is the more dominant factor in abdominal aoic aneurysms, while hypeension is associated with ascending aoic aneurysms. (Robbins basic pathology,9th edition.pg no.345)",A

Which of the following is an antiapoptotic gene?,BAX,BAD,BCL-X,BIM,"Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases (so named because they are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins after aspaic residues). The activation of caspases depends on a finely tuned balance between production of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Two distinct pathways converge on caspase activation: the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway pro-apoptotic members of the family called Bax and Bak, which dimerize, inse into the mito- chondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol. These sensors also inhibit the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (see fuher on), enhancing the leakage of mitochondrial proteins. Cytochrome c, together with some cofactors, activates caspase-9. Other proteins that leak out of mitochondria block the activities of caspase antagonists that function as physiologic inhibitors of apop- tosis. The net result is the activation of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation. Conversely, if cells are exposed to growth factors and other survival signals, they synthesize anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the two main ones of which are Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL. These proteins antagonize Bax and Bak, and thus limit the escape of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. Cells deprived of growth factors not only activate the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak but also show reduced levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thus fuher tilting the balance toward death. ref Robbins 9/e p19",C
Decrease in plasma osmotic pressure is cause of edema in?,CHF,DVT,Nephrotic syndrome,None,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Nephrotic syndrome * Following conditions can cause edema :-1) Increased hydrostatic presure of capillaries : It causes increase in outward driving forece. It may be due to imparied venous return e.g. in CHF or DVT.2) Decreased plasma osmotic pressure of capillaries: It causes decreases in inward driving force. It results from Hypoproteinemia. When total plasma protein is below 5 gm/dl (normal 6-8gm/dl) or albumin is below 2[?]5 gm/dl (normal 3[?]5-5 gm/dl) edema takes place. Conditions causing hypoproteinemia are nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, protein losing enteropathy, and PEM.3) Defective removal of interstitial fluid by lymphatics : It is due to lymphatic obstruction, which may be inflammatory, neoplastic, post surgical and post-irradiational.4) Increased vascular permeability: It occurs in acute and chronic inflammation, and during angiogenesis (new vessels are leaky).5) Sodium (salt) and water retention : It causes expansion of plasma volume (hydrostatic pressure) and dilution of plasma proteins (| osmotic pressure).

The following is an antiapoptotic gene,Bax,Bad,Bcl-X,Bim,"Ans. is 'c' i.e. Bcl-X Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated intracellular programme in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cells own nuclear D.N.A and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins.The cells plasma membrane remain intact but its structure is altered in such a way that apoptotic cell becomes an avid target for phagocytosis.The dead cell is rapidly cleared before its contents have leaked out, and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the hostApoptosis occurs normally in many situations, and serves to eliminate unwanted or potentially harmful cells and cells that have outlived their usefulness.It is also a pathological event in conditions when cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affect the cell's D.N.A. In these situations the irreparably damaged cell is eliminated.How does apoptosis start ?Normally growth factors and other survival signals stimulate the production of antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.There are more than 20 proteins in this family, all of which function to regulate apoptosis.The two main antiapoptotic ones are Bcl-2 and BcL-X.These antiapoptotic proteins normally reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm and prevents apoptosis.When cells are deprived of survival signals or subjected to stress, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X are lost from the mitochondrial membranes and are replaced by proapoptotic members o/the family such as Bak, Bax and Bim.This leads to increased permeability of mitochondrial membrane and the release of certain proteins which activate caspases which carries on the process of apoptosis.Proapoptic factorsAnti-apoptic factorsApaf-1 (Apoptosis activating factor -1)Cytochrome CBakBaxBimAIFP53 geneCaspasesTNFRIFas FADD (Fas associated death domain)BH3 only proteins (Bim, Bid, Bad)Smac/DIABLOBcl-2/BCl-X *FLIP *Mcl-1IAPs",C

"Sickle cell trait patient do not have manifestations as that of Sickle cell disease, because:",50% HbS is required for occurrence of sickling,HbA prevents sickling,50% sickles,HbA prevent polymerization of Hbs,"In Sickle cell trait, the patient is heterozygous and only one parent contributes the abnormal S gene. in each cell of these patients approximately 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS. The rate of sickling is influenced by the intracellular concentration of hemoglobin S and by the presence of other hemoglobins within the cell. In Sickle cell trait the low level of HbS is insufficient to produce sickling unless there is profound hypoxia. Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an abnormal hemoglobin leads to chronic hemolytic anemia with numerous clinical consequences. It is caused by a single DNA base change leading to an amino acid substitution of valine for glutamine in the sixth position on the beta-globin chain. In Sickle cell disease patients are homozygous and 80% of their hemoglobin is HbS. Hemoglobin S is unstable and polymerizes in the setting of various stressors, including hypoxemia and acidosis, leading to the formation of sickled red blood cells.

Grade 1 represents the most well differentiated tumors, in which the neoplastic glands are uniform and round in appearance and are packed into well-circumscribed nodules (Fig. 21-38A). In contrast, grade 5 tumors show no glandular differentiation, with tumor cells infiltrating the stroma in the form of cords, sheets, and nests (Fig. 21-38C).

Neutrophils form an exudate and release various proteases, which can produce liquefactive necrosis, starting at the mucosa and extending through the wall of the tube. This mechanism results in perforation. Fibroblasts are more likely participants in chronic inflammatory responses and in healing responses, generally appearing more than 1 week after the initial event. Langhans giant cells are a feature of granulomatous inflammation. Mononuclear infiltrates are more typical of chronic inflammation of the fallopian tube, in which rupture is less likely.

Loss of hetrozygosity associated with:,Acute myeloid leukemia,ALL,Retinoblastorna,Promyelocitic leukemia,"Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a prime example of a tumour which is associated with loss of heterozygosity. This term is mostly used in the context of oncogenesis. The mutations required to produce retinoblastomes involves the RB gene located on chromosome 13 q14. RB gene is a tumour suppressor gene. Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB gene are inactivated or altered. In familial case of retinoblastoma, children are born with one normal and one defective copy of the RB gene. Such a child is said to be heterozygous at the RB locus (one allele of the gene is normal while the other one is a mutant) This implies that heterozygosity for the RB gene does not affect cell behaviour i.e., (cancer does not develop as long as one gene is normal) Cancer develops when both the alleles are mutant i.e., when the cell becomes homozygous for the mutant allele or you can put it in another way, when the cell loses heterozygosity for the normal PB gene (a condition known as loss of heterozygosity) Make it clear that in oncology, loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allete in a somatic cell of the off spring becomes inactivated by mutation. This results in no normal tumour suppressor gene being produced and almost ceainly results in turnourogenesis. It is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumour suppressor gene in the lost region. Loss of heterozygosity is the basis of two hit hypothesis of cancers (Knudson's hypothesis) In hereditary cases of Retinoblastoma one genetic change (first hit) is inherited from the affected parent therefore it is present in all the somatic cells of the body. But one genetic change is not sufficient to produce cancer. The second mutation (second bit) is required to produce cancer. It occurs in the retinal cells (which are carrying the first mutation). The mutation occuring in Retinal cells is acquired. In sporadic cases both mutations (hits) occur somatically within a single retinal cell whose progeny then form the tumour. This RB gene act as an example of several other genes that act similarly. Genes on chromosomes II Wilms tumour, Hepatoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma VHL Familial and sporadic clear cell Ca.",C

The term taurodontism was introduced by Sir Arthur Keith to describe a dental -anomaly where the body of the tooth is enlarged at the expense of the roots (bull âlike teeth). The taurodontic teeth are identified by elongated pulp .chambers and apical displacement of bifurcation or trifurcation of the roots. Due to this, the chamber has a greater apicoocclusal height than in cynodont teeth and lacks the constriction at the level of the CEJ giving it a rectangular shape.",C

Hematopoetic stem cell differ from progenitor stem cell in that they can -,Form terminally differentiated cells,Long term reconstitution of bone marrow,Produce growth factors,Have receptors for anchoring proteins,"Reference:Robbins basic pathology 9th edition pg no 74:Perhaps the most extensively studied tissue stem cells are hematopoietic stem cells found in the bone marrow. Although rare, they can be puri ed to viual purity based on cell surface markers. Hematopoietic stem cells can be isolated from bone marrow as well as from the peripheral blood after mobilization by administration of ceain cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). As is well known, they can give rise to all blood cell lineages and continuously replenish the formed ele- ments of the blood as these are consumed in the periphery. In clinical practice, marrow stem cells are used for treat- ment of diseases such as leukemia and lymphomas (Chapter 11). In addition to hematopoietic stem cells, the bone marrow also contains a somewhat distinctive population of tissue stem cells, often called mesenchymal stem cells. These cells can give rise to a variety of mesenchymal cells, such as chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and myoblasts. Hence, there is great interest in their therapeutic potential Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are the most undifferenti- ated stem cells. They are present in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and have extensive cell renewal capac- ity. Hence they can be maintained in culture for over a year without differentiating. Under appropriate culture conditions, ES cells can be induced to form specialized cells of all three germ cell layers, including neurons, cardiac muscle, liver cells, and pancreatic islet cells.",B
Osmotic fragility of RBCs are increased in:,Hereditary Spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Thalessemia,PNH,"Ans: A (Hereditary Spherocytosis) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th editionExplanation:""In two thirds of the patients with Hereditary Spherocytosis, the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions. which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion ""Ref: Robbins.Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS)This inherited disorder is caused by intrinsic defects in the red cell membrane skeleton.Red blood cells are spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction.Majority of cases are autosomal dominant (75%).PathogenesisThe remarkable elasticity and durability of the normal red cell are attributable to the physicochemical properties of its specialized membrane skeleton which lies closely apposed to the internal surface of the plasma membrane.Its chief protein component, spectrin, consists of two polypeptide chains, a and b. which form intertwined (helical) flexible heterodimers.The ""head"" regions of spectrin dimers selfassociate to form tetramers, while the ""tails"" associate with actin oligomers.Each actin oligomer can bind multiple spectrin tetramers. thus creating a two-dimensional speetrin-aetin skeleton that is connected to the ceil membrane by two distinct interactions.The first, involving the proteins ankyrin and band 4.2. binds spectrin to the transmembrane ion transporter, band 3.The second, involving protein 4.1. binds the ""tail"" of spectrin to another transmembrane protein, glycophorin A,HS is caused by diverse mutations that lead to an insufficiency of membrane skeletal components.The life span of the affected red cells is decreased on average to 10 to 20 days (Normal -120 days)The pathogenic mutations most commonly affect ankyrin. band 3. spectrin, or band 4.2.Young HS red cells are normal in shape, but the deficiency of membrane skeleton reduces the stability of the lipid hiiayer, leading to the loss of membrane fragments as red cells age in the circulation.The loss of membrane relative to cytoplasm ""forces"" the cells to assume the smallest possible diameter for a given volume, namely, a sphere.The invariably beneficial effects of splenectomy prove that the spleen has a cardinal role in the premature demise of spherocytes.Normal red cells must undergo extreme deformation to leave the cords of Billroth and enter the sinusoids.Because of their spheroidal shape and reduced deformability, the hapless spherocytes are trapped in the splenic cords, where they provide a happy meal for phagocytes.After splenectomy the spherocytes persist, but the anemia is correctedMorphologyThe most specific morphologic finding is spherocytosis, apparent on smears as abnormally small, dark-staining (hyperchromic) red cells lacking the central zone of pallor.Spherocytosis is distinctive but not pathognomonic, since other forms of membrane loss, such as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias, also cause the formation of spherocytes.Other features are common to all hemolytic anemias. These include:ReticulocytosisMarrow erythroid hyperplasiaHemosiderosisMild jaundice.Cholelithiasis (pigment stones - 40% to 50% cases)Moderate splenic enlargementsSplenomegaly results from congestion of the cords of Billroth and increased numbers of phagocytes needed to clear the spherocytes.Clinical FeaturesThe diagnosis is based on family history, hematologic findings, and laboratory evidence.In two thirds of the patients the red cells are abnormally sensitive to osmotic lysis when incubated in hypotonic salt solutions, which causes the influx of water into spherocytes with little margin for expansion.HS red cells also have an increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration, due to dehydration caused by the loss of K+ and H2O.The characteristic clinical features are anemia, splenomegaly, and jaundice.The generally stable clinical course is sometimes punctuated by aplastic crises, usually triggered by an acute parvovirus infection.Parvovirus infects and kills red cell progenitors, causing red cell production to cease until an effective immune response commences, generally in 1 to 2 weeks.Because of the reduced life span of HS red cells, cessation of erythropoiesis for even short time periods leads to sudden worsening of the anemia.Transfusions may be necessary to support the patient until the immune response clears the infection.Hemolytic crises are produced by intercurrent events leading to increased splenic destruction of red cells (e.g., infectious mononucleosis); these are clinically less significant than aplastic crises.Gallstones, found in many patients, can also produce symptoms.Splenectomy treats the anemia and its complications, but brings with it the risk of sepsis.

The pathogenesis of this tumor involves which of the following substances?",Direct-acting alkylating agents,Aflatoxin B1,Azo dyes,Vinyl chloride,"Many chemicals are associated with an increased incidence of malignancy. These substances are called chemical carcinogens. Aflatoxin B1, a natural product of the fungus Aspergillus flavus, is metabolized to an epoxide. The fungus can grow on improperly stored peanuts and grains and is associated with the high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in some areas of Africa and the Far East. Hepatitis B virus is also highly associated with liver cancer in these regions. direct-acting chemical carcinogens, such as the direct-acting alkylating agents that are used in chemotherapy, most organic carcinogens first require conversion to a more reactive compound. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic amines, and azo dyes must be metabolized by cytochrome P450-dependent mixedfunction oxidases to active metabolites.Azo dyes, such as butter yellow and scarlet red, are metabolized to active compounds that have induced hepatocellular cancer in rats, but no human cases have been repoed Vinyl chloride is metabolized to an epoxide and is associated with angiosarcoma of the liver, not hepatocellular carcinoma Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

A blister is a good example of serous inflammation. It is associated primarily with exudation of fluid into the sub-corneal or subepidermal space. Because the injury is mild, the fluid is relatively protein-poor. A protein-rich exudate results in fibrin accumulation. Granulomatous inflammation is characterized by collections of transformed macrophages called epithelioid cells.

Inherited susceptibility can never be completely excluded when an individual has two tumors; this can occur in patients with inherited mutations in the p53 gene. In this case, however, there is a clear hormonal basis for the second tumor. Faulty tumor suppressor genes are not involved in the hormonal promotion of a neoplasm.

Best investigation for diagnosing amyloidosis-,Rectal biopsy,Colonoscopy,CT scan,Upper GI endoscopy,"The diagnosis of amyloidosis may be suspected from the clinical signs and symptoms and from some of the findings mentioned; however, more specific tests must often be done for definitive diagnosis. Biopsy and subsequent Congo red staining is the most impoant tool in the diagnosis of amyloidosis. In general, biopsy is taken from the organ suspected to be involved. For example, renal biopsy is useful in the presence of urinary abnormalities. Rectal and gingival biopsy specimens contain amyloid in as many as 75% of cases with generalized amyloidosis. Examination of abdominal fat aspirates stained with Congo red is a simple, low-risk method. In suspected cases of AL amyloidosis, serum and urinary protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis should be performed. Bone marrow examination in such cases usually shows plasmacytosis, even if skeletal lesions of multiple myeloma are not present. Proteomic analysis of affected tissue is now being widely used for detection of small amounts of amyloid (from fat aspirates) and for definitive identification of the type of amyloid.

Medullary sponge kidney is a benign condition usually found on radiologic imaging of adults. Urethral atresia would produce marked bladder dilation, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis.",B
"Infection become localized in the form of abscess, bacteria responsible for this is:",Streptococci,Staphylococci,Actinomyces,All of the above,"Pyogenic organisms, predominantly Staphylococcus aureus, cause tissue necrosis and suppuration. Pus is composed of dead and dying white blood cells, predominantly neutrophils, that have succumbed to bacterial toxins. An abscess is surrounded by an acute inflammatory response composed of a fibrinous exudate, oedema and the cells of acute inflammation. Granulation tissue (macrophages, fibroblasts and new blood vessel proliferation) forms later around the suppurative process and leads to collagen deposition. If it is not drained or resorbed completely, a chronic abscess may result. If it is partly sterilised with antibiotics, an antibioma may form.

"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician complaining of right scrotal swelling. He states that the swelling has been present for 1 week. He initially noticed the swelling sholy after moving furniture for his new living room. He denies any nausea, vomiting, change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or urinary tract symptoms. He has no other significant medical or surgical history. On examination, he has an enlarged right hemi-scrotum with a mass that appears to be originating at the level of the external inguinal ring. With the patient completely relaxed, the physician is able to reduce the mass by pushing it back through the external inguinal ring. With the mass reduced, the physician instructs the patient to perform a Valsalva maneuver, upon which a protrusion is felt at the external inguinal ring. Once the mass is reduced, the testicle appears normal in size and consistency. Which of the following pathological processes might cause the patient's underlying condition to occur in an infant?",Defect in the floor of the inguinal canal,Defect in the internal inguinal ring,Defect in the linea semilunaris,Patent processus vaginalis,"The pathologic process that causes hernias is different in neonates and infants than in an adult. Embryologically, in the seventh week, the testes begin descending from their location at the 10th thoracic level into the scrotum. After the eighth week, a peritoneal evagination called the processus vaginalis forms just anterior to the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum is a condensation of peritoneum that attaches superiorly to the gonad and inferiorly to the fascia that is developing between the external and internal oblique muscles in the region of the labioscrotal swellings. The processus vaginalis pushes out as a ""sock-like"" extension into the transversalis fascia, the internal oblique muscle, and the external oblique muscle, thus forming the inguinal canal. After the processus vaginalis has evaginated into the scrotum, the gubernaculum shoen and simply pull the gonads through the canal. Within the first year after bih, the superior poion of the processus vaginalis is usually obliterated, leaving only a distal remnant sac, the tunica vaginalis, which lies anterior to the testis. During infancy, this sac wraps around most of the testis. Its lumen is normally collapsed, but under pathologic conditions it may fill with serous secretions, forming a testicular hydrocele. If the processus vaginalis remains patent, a connection between the abdominal cavity and scrotal sac will occur. Loops of intestine may herniate into this processus, resulting in an indirect inguinal hernia. Note: In adults, hernias are caused by a protrusion of a structure, usually intestine, through a tissue that normally contains it. Direct inguinal hernias occur through the floor of the inguinal canal separate from the spermatic cord. Direct inguinal hernias occur because of a breakdown of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia. An indirect inguinal hernia occurs through the internal inguinal ring in a protrusion of peritoneum along the spermatic cord in the internal spermatic fascia. Therefore, a large indirect inguinal hernia will descend into the scrotum along the spermatic cord. Spigelian hernias are rare and occur due to a weakness in the linea semilunaris, which is located at the lateral margin of the rectus sheath.

Grossly, multiple small petechial hemorrhages are found on the surface of the kidneys. The clinical course is often downhill, with only 50% of patients surviving 5 years; marked proteinuria, hematuria, cardiovascular problems, and finally renal failure contribute to death. The disease is often associated with accelerated preexisting benign essential hypeension, chronic renal disease (glomerulonephritis), or scleroderma In contrast, benign nephrosclerosis (renal disease occurring in benign hypeension) is characterized by hyaline aeriolosclerosis with thickened, hyalinized aeriolar walls and narrowed lumina. Fibroelastic hyperplasia occurs in the larger muscular aeries. Small kidneys with a finely granular surface often result because of ischemic atrophy of nephrons. Broad Ushaped coical scars overlying dilated calyces in the renal poles are seen with chronic pyelonephritis (reflux causes scars involving poles only, while obstruction produces scars all over the kidney), depressed coical areas overlying necrotic papillae of varying stages are seen with analgesic nephropathy and diabetes mellitus, multiple small white areas on the surface are seen with acute pyelonephritis, and wedge-shaped (i.e., V-shaped) pale coical scars are seen with renal infarcts.

Furthermore, hamartomas can coexist with adenomas, and one must not assume that a polyp is a hamartoma without proof. Colonoscopic excision is performed for large or symptomatic (bleeding, intussusception) lesions. Some juvenile polyps autoamputate. Colectomy is required in patients with familial juvenile polyposis.# Peutz-Jeghers syndrome- is an uncommon autosomal dominant disease (1/200,000 population) in which multiple hamartomatous polyps appear in the stomach, small bowel, and colon.- There is melanotic pigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, especially about lips and gums.- Until recently the Peutz-Jeghers hamartomas were thought to be without malignant potential, but adenomatous changes and the development of malignancy have been described.- The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer has been reported to be 39%.- Polyps are generally removed only if symptomatic, but patients should undergo continued surveillance. Carcinoma also develops at an increased rate in other tissues, eg, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, small intestine, and breast.",B

Phagocytic cells in brain -,Oligodendrocytes,Macrophages,Microglia,Astrocytes,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., MicrogliaMicroglia are the major phagocytic cells in the brain.Phagocvtosis Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating injurious agents.o Phagocytosis involves the following three steps.1. Recognition and attachmentPhagocytosis of microbes and dead cells is initiated by recognition of paicles by receptors expressed on leukocyte surface.These receptors are Mannose receptors and scavenger receptors.These receptors bind a variety of microbes.2. EnglulfmentBinding of a paicle to phagocytic leukocyte receptors initiates the process of active phagocytosis of the paicles.During engulment, extension of the cytoplasm, i.e., pseudopods flow around the paicle to be engulfed. Eventually, this results in complete enclosure of the paicle within a phagosome created by the plasma membrane.Membrane of this phagocytic vacuole (Phagosome) fuses with the membrane of lysosome to form phagolysosome resulting in discharge of lysosomal granule's content into phagosome.During this process neutrophils and macrophages become progressively degranulated.Phagocytosis is dependent on polymerization of actin (similar to chemotoxis that is also dependent on polymerisation of actin).3. Killing and degradationKillingMicrobial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-depending mechanism, i.e., due to generation of reactive oxygen species.The generation of reactive oxygen species is due to rapid activation on an oxidase - NADPH oxidase. Reactive oxygen species cause membrane damage, cytoskeletal damage and DNA damage.Bacterial killing can also occur by oxygen-independent mechanisms, through action of substances in leukocyte granules -3 Bacterial permeability increasign protein (BPI), lysozyme, lactoferrin, major basic protein and defensin.DegradationAfter killing, acid hydrolases, which are normally stored in lysosomes, degrade the microbes within phagolysosome.",C
Characteristic of protective epithelium is ?,Regeneration of membrane,Microvilli,Thinness,Pinocytic vesicle,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Regeneration of membraneThe regeneration of epithelium is one of the protective mechnaism of epithelial cells. There are three mechanism for healing.Resolution It is an ideal outcome of healing and occurs in acute infalmmatory responses to minor injuries.Regeneration Replacement of lost parenchymal cells by division of adjacent surviving parenchymal cells (Regeneration) can also restore injured tissue to normal. Whether regeneration occurs depends uponi) Regenerative capacity of the involved cell (i.e., their ability to divide)ii) The no. of surviving ble cellsiii) Presence of connective tissue framework that will provide the base for restoration of normal tissue structure. C.Repair by scar formation A scar is a mass of collagen that is the end result of repair by organization and fibrosis.

Essential for tumor metastasis is?,Angiogenesis,Tumorogenesis,Apoptosis,Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Angiogenesis * Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a part of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells.According to Harrison ""Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis"".Angiogenesis in tumoursTumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour.Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 1- 2 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels.Angiogenesis of tumour imparts two benefitsGrowth of tumourBy supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells.Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells.Distant metastasisWithout access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites.Tumour associated angiogenic factors * Tumours secrete certain factors which induce neovascularizationTwo most important are -Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF)Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF)Steps in the spread of cancer -Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesisThe first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cellsNormal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i.e. E cadherin.Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin.Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis.Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interactionLoosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin.Degradation of ECMTumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i.e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase.Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in certain cancers.These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved.Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen:-Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role.Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells.Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have properties of tumour cell chemotaxis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer.After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels.Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus.Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cellsTumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.",A

"A 50-year-old lady presented with a 3-month history of pain in the lower third of the right thigh. There was no local swelling; tenderness was present on deep pressure. Plain X-rays showed an ill-defined intra medullary lesion with blotchy calcification at the lower end of the right femoral diaphysis, possibly enchondroma or chondrosarcoma. Sections showed a cartilaginous tumor. Which of the following histological features (if seen) would be most helpful to differentiate the two tumours?",Focal necrosis and lobulation,Tumor permeation between bone trabeculae at periphery,Extensive myxoid change,High cellularity,"Chondroma (enchondroma) Vs Chondrosarcoma 

The term chondroma is used for benign neoplasm composed of cartilage. It is of two types : -


Enchondroma: - Cartilage tumors occurring within the bone.
Periosteal chondroma: - Cartilage tumors occurring on the surface of the bone.


Chondrosarcoma is the malignant tumor of cartilage.
Growth potential of chondroma is limited and mostly remain stable, but they have the potential to undergo malignant (sarcomatous) change to become chondrosarcoma. In fact, enchondromas are considered to be a low-grade chondrosarcoma.
A painful chondroid neoplasm in a large bone in an adult patient can be either enchondroma or chondrosarcoma.
The differentiation between a low-grade chondrosarcoma and an enchondroma can be difficult.
To make a distinction between these two neoplasms, one has to make use of -

Which malignancy develops in long standing goiter is,Follicular,Papillary,Medullary,None,"Enlargement of the thyroid, or goiter is caused by impaired synthesis of thyroid hormone, which is most often the result of dietary iodine deficiency. Impairment of thyroid hormone synthesis leads to a compensatory rise in the serum TSH level, which, in turn, causes hyperophy and hyperplasia of thyroid follicular cells and, ultimately, gross enlargement of the thyroid gland. The compensatory increase in functional mass of the gland overcomes the hormone deficiency, ensuring a euthyroid metabolic state in most individuals. If the underlying disorder is sufficiently severe (e.g., a congenital biosynthetic defect or endemic iodine deficiency, discussed later), the compensatory responses may be inadequate, resulting in goitrous hypothy- roidism.

In children, the following are the main sources of lead poisoning:Chewing of lead-containing furniture items, toys or pencils.Eating of lead paint flakes from walls.In adults, the sources are as follows:Occupational exposure to lead during spray painting, recycling of automobile batteries (lead oxide fumes), mining, and extraction of lead.Accidental exposure by contaminated water supply, house freshly coated with lead paint and sniffing of lead-containing petrol (hence unleaded petrol introduced as fuel).Lead is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. The absorbed lead is distributed in two types of tissuesa) Bones, teeth, nails and hair representing a relatively harmless pool of lead. About 90% of absorbed lead accumulates in the developing metaphysis of bones in children and appears as areas of increased bone densities ('lead lines') on X-ray. Lead lines are also seen in the gingiva. b) Brain, liver, kidneys and bone marrow accumulate the remaining 10% lead which is directly toxic to these organs.It is excreted kidneys. Lead toxicity occurs in the following organs predominantly:1. Nervous system: The changes are as under:In children, lead encephalopathy; edema of the brain, flattening of gyri and compression of ventricles.In adults, demyelinating peripheral motor neuropathy which typically affects radial and peroneal nerves resulting in wristdrop and footdrop respectively.2. Hematopoietic system: The changes in the blood are quite characteristic:Microcytic hypochromic anemia due to inhibition of two enzymes: delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrogenase required for haem synthesis, and through inhibition of ferroketolase required for incorporation of ferrous iron into the porphyrinring.Prominent basophilic stippling of erythrocytes. 3. Kidneys: Lead is toxic to proximal tubular cells of the kidney and produces lead nephropathy characterized by the accumulation of intranuclear inclusion bodies consisting of the lead-protein complex in the proximal tubular cells.4. Gastrointestinal tract: Lead toxicity in the bowel manifests as acute abdomen presenting as lead colic. Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children include: Developmental delay Learning difficulties Irritability Loss of appetite Weight loss Sluggishness and fatigue Abdominal pain Vomiting Constipation Hearing loss Seizures Eating things, such as paint chips, that aren't food (pica) Signs and symptoms in adults might include: High blood pressure Joint and muscle pain Difficulties with memory or concentration Headache Abdominal pain Mood disorders Reduced sperm count and abnormal sperm Miscarriage, stillbih or premature bih in pregnant women HARSH MOHAN Textbook of pathology 6th edition pg no 240-241",A

Following facts will help you to differentiate Wegener's granulomatosis from other Two -

Wegener's granulomatosis Vs classical PAN

Wegener's granulomatosis involves small vessels (arteriole, venule, capillary), while PAN involves medium size vessels.
Wegener's granulomatosis is associated with c-ANCA, while classical PAN is not associated with ANCA.
In Wegener's granulomatosis there is lung involvement, but not in classical PAN.

Since medulloblastomas are close to the fourth ventricle, they may disseminate downstream into the spinal cord. The detection of neuronal and progenitor cell markers (e.g., synaptophysin or nestin) may be diagnostically informative in distinguishing these tumors from metastatic epithelial tumors, lymphomas, or other neuroectodermal malignancies. Medulloblastomas are characterized by cells with hyperchromatic, round-to-oval nuclei and scant cytoplasm, which often crowd together with no structural pattern.

DNA in human may be found at two locations

Nuclear DNA in nucleus
Organelle DNA in the mitochondria

Mitochondrial DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells.Â Mitochondrial DNA is always maternally inherited. Why is it so, letâs see:-
Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cellsâ nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the Mitochondria in the motherâs egg.Â  All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmitted from anÂ affected father to his children.",A

MIC-2 is a marker of -,Ewing 's sarcoma,Osteosarcoma,Dermatofibrous protruberans,Alveolar cell sarcoma,"Ewing's sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma (/'ju:ING/) is a malignant small, round, blue cell tumor. It is a rare disease in which cancer cells are found in the bone or in soft tissue. The most common areas in which it occurs are the pelvis, the femur, the humerus, the ribs and clavicle (collar bone). Since a common genetic locus is responsible for a large percentage of Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, these are sometimes grouped together in a category known as the Ewing family of tumors. The diseases are, however, considered to be different: peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours are generally not associated with bones, while Ewing sarcomas are most commonly related to bone. Ewing's sarcoma occurs most frequently in teenagers and young adults, with a male/female ratio of 1.6 Although usually classified as a bone tumour, Ewing's sarcoma can have characteristics of both mesodermal and ectodermal origin, making it difficult to classify.

MRI shows a 10x8x7 cm solid mass deep to the quadriceps, but it does not involve the femur. Karyotypic analysis of tumor cells reveals t (12;16) (q13; p11) with amplification of the MDM2 gene. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chondrosarcoma,Liposarcoma,Metastatic adenocarcinoma,Nodular fasciitis,"A large, deep soft-tissue mass suggests cancer, most likely a sarcoma. Liposarcomas are located in deep soft tissues, can be indolent, and can reach a large size. They are the most common sarcomas of adulthood. Chondrosarcomas can be seen over a wide age range, but they arise within the bone. Carcinomas are far more common in adults than sarcomas and can metastasize, but such a large lesion in soft tissue is unlikely to be a metastasis. Nodular fasciitis is a reactive fibroblastic lesion of young adults, usually on the upper extremities and trunk, and can develop several weeks after local trauma.

In Prader- Willi syndrome, deletion of band q12 on long arm of paternal chromosome 15 occurs. Genes in this region of maternal chromosome 15 are imprinted so there is complete loss of their functions. Patients have mental retardation, sho stature, hypotonia, hyperphagia, small hands and feet, and hypogonadism.In Angelman syndrome, there is a deletion of the same region from the maternal chromosome.

All are affected in Graft-Versus host reaction except:,Skin,Lung,G.I.T,Liver,"Graft versus host disease

Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursorsÂ are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigenâs in theÂ host.
Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation butÂ may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion ofÂ uneradicated blood.
Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or priorÂ treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation.
When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogeneic donors, the immunocompetent, T cellsÂ present in the donor marrow recognize the recipientâs HLA antigen as a foreign antigen and react against them.Â Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues.
In clinical practice, GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matchedÂ donor and recipient
Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
Although any organ may be affectedÂ the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immuneÂ system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines.
Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severeÂ cases.
Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloodyÂ diarrhoea.
ImmunodeficiencyÂ is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiencyÂ may be a result of priorÂ treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipientâs immune system andÂ attack on hostâs immune cells by grafted lymphocytes.
Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many differentÂ types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is particularly important.",B

This patient is at risk for which of the following conditions?",Cardiac ischemia,Columnar metaplasia of the distal oesophagus,Mallory-Weiss lesion in the esophagus,Squamous cell carcinoma,"This woman likely suffers from reflux esophagitis, a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not adequately prevent acidic gastric contents from refluxing back into the distal esophagus. Most commonly, there is a defect in the LES mechanism itself, in addition to secondary causes such as pregnancy (due to increased abdominal pressure) and some medications (anticholinergics, beta-2 agonists, theophylline, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers). Symptoms can mimic cardiac chest pain and must be carefully evaluated. Complications of reflux esophagitis include esophageal strictures, ulcerations, laryngitis, pulmonary aspiration, and Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus). Barrett's esophagus is considered a premalignant state, with roughly a 30-fold increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus transforms into columnar epithelium similar to gastric epithelium as a result of recurrent reflux of acidic gastric contents. Anginal pain, signaling cardiac ischemia, is generally not burning in nature, and is not relieved by antacids. Mallory-Weiss lesions are actual tears of the epithelia of the proximal stomach or distal esophagus as a result of retching (seen in anorexics and alcoholics). The incidence of pure squamous cell carcinoma is not increased by acid reflux disease. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 14.

Caspases are associated with,Apoptosis,Cell injury,Necrosis,Inflammation,"Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease; 8th edition, Chapter I, Pg: 3Explanation:Caspases play a vital role in all the four options. But, most approximate answer would be apoptosis.Caspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases are a family of cysteine proteases that play essential roles in apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis, and inflammationBiochemical Features of ApoptosisActivation of Caspases.A specific feature of apoptosis is the activation of several members of a family of cysteine proteases named caspases.The term caspase is based on two properties of this family of enzymes: the ""c"" refers to a cysteine protease (i.e., an enzyme with cysteine in its active site), and ""aspase'' refers to the unique ability of these enzymes to cleave after aspartic acid residues.The caspase family, now1 including more than 10 members, can be divided functionally into two groups--initiator and executioner-- depending on the order in which they are activated during apoptosis. Initiator caspases include caspase-8 and caspase-9.Several other caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-6, serve as executioners.Like many proteases, caspases exist as inactive pro-enzymes, or zymogens, and must undergo an enzymatic cleavage to become active.The presence of cleaved, active caspases is a marker for cells undergoing apoptosis.",A

Cell injury occurs due to -,L ATP,T Cytosolic Ca',Membrane damage,All,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., ATP; 'b' i.e., is Cytosolic Ca'; 'c' i.e., Membrane damage; Cell injury o Cell injury results when cells are stressed so severly that they are no longer able to adapt i.e., when the limits of adaptive response to a stimulus are exceeded, cell injury occurs. o Cell injury is reversible up to a ceain point, but if the stimulus persists or is severe enough from the beginning, the cell reaches a ""point of no return"" and suffers irreversible injury and ultimate cell death. o Adaptation, reversible injury and irrversible injury & cell death are stages of progressive impairment of the cell's normal function and structure. Mechanism of injury o Regardless of the nature of injurious agents, there are a number of common biochemical themes or mechanisms responsible for cell injury:? A. Diminished generation ofATP o Diminished generation of ATP constitutes the critical mechanism of cellular injury and occurs in both reversible and irreversible phases. o Depletion of ATP to < 5% to 10% of normal levels has widespread effects on many critical cellular system : ? Activity of Na+ K+ ATPase is reduced. It is ATP dependent pump that cause effux of Na+ and influx of K+. Decreased activity of this pump leads to intracellular accumulation of sodium. The net gain in solute is accompnied by isoosmotic water gain, causing cell swelling. Normally Na+ inhibits efflux of Ca' and promotes influx of Ca+2. When activity of Na+K+ ATPase is reduced, there is increased intracellular Na+--> T influx and efflux of Ca' --> T intracellular calclium. 3Decreased ATP synthesis results in an increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis --> T Lactic acid accumulation .1, pH --> decreased activity of many cellular enzymes and clumping of nuclear chromatin. 4.Depletion of ATP results in structural disruption of protein synthetic apparatus Detachment of ribosomes from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) reduction in protein synthesis. B. Increased intracellular calcium o Sustained rise in intracellular calcium activates a number of enzymes ATPase fuher ATP depletion Phospholipases Membrane damage Proteases --> Damage to membrane and cystoskeleton proteins. Endonulcease --> Damage to DNA. C. Membrane damage o It occurs due to Mitochondrial dysfunction --> Defective mitochondrias function results in decrease phospholipid synthesis which is an impoant constituent of cell membrane and mitochondrial membrane. Increased intracellular Ca' activates phospholipase --> Damage to cell membrane, mitochondrial membrane and membrane of other organelles. Increase in intracellular Ca' results in activation of proteases --> damage to cystoskeletal filaments that serve as anchors connecting the plasma membrane to the cell interior. Free radicals cause damae to cell membrane. D. Release of lysosomal enzymes o The membrane damage combined with low pH cause leakage of lysosomal enzymes (RNases, DNases, phosphatases, proteases, glucosidases, Cathepsins) that leads to enzymatic digestion of cell component, resulting in loss of ribonucleoprotein (RNP), deoxyribonucleoprotein & glycogen, and the cells die by necrosis.",D

Principle mediator of vasodilation in acute inflammation is,Serotonin,IL-1,Histamine,TNF,"Vasodilation is induced by chemical mediators such as histamine and is the cause of erythema and stasis of blood flow in acute inflammation.Histamine causes dilation of aerioles and increases the permeability of venules. Histamine is considered to be the principal mediator of the immediate transient phase of increased vascular permeability, producing interendothelial gaps in venules. Its vasoactive effects are mediated mainly binding to receptors, called H1 receptors, on microvascular endothelial cells. The antihistamine drugs that are commonly used to treat some inflammatory reactions, such as allergies, are H1 receptor antagonists that bind to and block the receptor.Ref: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease; 9th edition; Chapter 3; Acute inflammation; Page no: 75",C

Which of the following is a metastasis suppressor gene in relation to prostate cancer,KAI - 1,NM 23,KISS,p53,"Prostate cancers account for 43% of all cancers diagnosed in American men. It is estimated that in 1996, 317,000 new cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed and 41,000 men died of the disease. The challenge of treating prostate cancer lies in accurately distinguishing those histologically-localized cancers which will complete metastatic progression from those that will remain indolent. At this time, we lack appropriate histological markers to make such distinctions, therefore, it is often difficult to accurately predict the clinical course of an individual patient's disease. There is growing evidence that a critical event in the progression of a tumor cell from a non-metastatic to metastatic phenotype is the loss of function of metastasis-suppressor genes. These genes specifically suppress the ability of a cell to metastasize. Work from several groups has demonstrated that human chromosomes 8, 10, 11 and 17 encode prostate cancer metastasis suppressor activities. As a result of these effos the first prostate cancer metastasis-suppressor gene, KAI1, was identified and mapped to the p11-2 region of chromosome 11. In subsequent studies, an additional gene encoded by the same region, CD44 was also determined to have metastasis-suppressor activity. Recent studies have shown a correlation between decreased expression of KAI1 and CD44 and an increased malignant potential of prostate cancers. It is anticipated that the identification of other metastasis suppressor genes may allow for the development of diagnostic markers useful in the clinical substaging of individual tumors. This manuscript is intended to present our perspective on the impoance of these genes in the understanding of prostate cancer progression. More impoantly, we present new findings from our laboratory's effo to identify the metastasis-suppressor genes encoded by human chromosome 17. Specifically we repo the strategy currently being used to evaluate a series of candidate genes and the approach being utilized to pinpoint the metastasis-suppressor region on human chromosome 17.",A

Carcinoid hea disease affects which pa ?,Valvular endocardium,Pericardium,Myocardium,Epicardium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Valvular endocardiumCarcinoid Hea DiseaseCarcinoid hea disease is the cardiac manifestation of the systemic syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors. It generally involves the endocardium and valve of the right side of hea.Cardiovascular lesions consist of firm plaque like endocardial fibrous thickenings on the inside surfaces of the cardiac chambers and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Occasionally they involve the major blood vessels of the right side, the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary aery. These plaque like thickenings are composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparase collagen fibres embedded in an acid mucopolysaccharide-rich matrix materials. Elastic fibers are not present in the plaque.The most common cardiac manifestation is tricuspid regurgitation. Stenosis of right sided valve may also develop.Why does right sided hea involvement more common ?Carcinoid tumors produce a variety of bioactive products that produce these (above described) hea lesions. Among these, serotonin is most impoant. Serotonin is inactivated during its passage through lung. As you all know, left side of hea recieve blood from pulmonary circulation, left sided hear lesions are uncommon (Because serotonin has already been metabolized in lung).Similarly, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors do not induce carcinoid hea disease (neither right nor left) as bioactive mediators released into the poal circulation are metabolized in the liver. Therefore carcinoid hea disease is produced by tumors that have extensive hepatic metastasis (liver releases the mediators directly into IVC) or carcinoid tumors of organs that are outside poal circulation (e.g., ovary).",A

B: Monoclonal light chains A Bence Jones protein is a monoclonal globulin protein found in the blood or urine, with a molecular weight of 22-24 kDa. The proteins are immunoglobulin light chains (paraproteins) and are produced by neoplastic plasma cells. They can be kappa (most of the time) or lambda. The light chains can be immunoglobulin fragments or single homogeneous immunoglobulins. They are found in urine due to the kidneys' decreased filtration capabilities due to renal failure, often induced by hypercalcemia from the calcium released as the bones are destroyed. The light chains can be detected by heating or electrophoresis of concentrated urine. Light chains precipitate when heated to 50 - 60 degrees C and redisolve at 90 -100 degrees C. There are various rarer conditions that can produce Bence Jones proteins, such as Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.",B

These small pinpoint petechial hemorrhages appear on the coical surface from rupture of aerioles or glomerular capillaries. On Histology ? Two distinct vascular lesions are seen Fibrinoid necrosis It affects the aerioles and is characterized by infiltration of aeriolar walls with eosinophilic material including fibrin, thickening of vessel walls and occasionally, an inflammatory infiltrate (necrotizing aeriolitis). Hyperplastic aeriolitis This affects the interlobular aeries and aerioles. There is concentric hyperplastic proliferation of the smooth muscles together with fine concentric layering of collagen to form a hyperplastic aeriolitis (Onion skin lesion).",B

Organelle where H2O2 is produced and destroyed is-,Peroxisome,Lysosome,Golgi body,Ribosome,"Cells have developed many mechanisms to remove free radicals and thereby minimize injury. Free radicals are inherently unstable and decay spontaneously. There are also nonenzymatic and enzymatic systems that contribute to inactivation of free radicals . * The rate of decay of superoxide is significantly increased by the action of superoxide dismutases (SODs) found in many cell types. Glutathione (GSH) peroxidases are a family of enzymes whose major function is to protect cells from oxidative damage. The most abundant member of this family, glutathione peroxidase 1, is found in the cytoplasm of all cells. It catalyzes the breakdown of H2O2 by the reaction 2 GSH (glutathione) + H2O2 - GS-SG + 2 H2O. The intracellular ratio of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH) is a reflection of this enzyme's activity and thus of the cell's ability to catabolize free radicals. * Catalase, present in peroxisomes, catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (2H2O2 - O2 + 2H2O). It is one of the most active enzymes known, capable of degrading millions of molecules of H2O2 per second. * Endogenous or exogenous antioxidants (e.g., vitamins E, A, and C and b-carotene) may either block the formation of free radicals or scavenge them once they have formed.

A person present with recurrent swelling on face and lips due to emotional stress. Likely cause is,C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency,Allergy,Anaphylaxis,None of the above,"A deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor gives rise to an autosomal dominant disorder hereditary angioedema. The C1 esterase inhibitor is a protease inhibitor whose target enzymes are C1r and C1s of the complement cascade, factor XII of the coagulation pathway, and the kallikrein system. So, any individual having the deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor would have excessive complement activation.
This causes the release of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) and other inflammatory mediators. These patients therefore have episodes of edema affecting skin and mucosal surfaces such as the larynx and the gastrointestinal tract. This may result in life-threatening asphyxia or nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after minor trauma or emotional stress.",A

Both hyperplasia and hyperophy is found inaEUR',Pregnancy uterus,Cardiac muscle in cardiomegaly,Skeletal muscle in athelete,Breast development in lactation,"Pregnant uterus ?? There are some confusion because of the changes in 881/e Robbin's Bobbin's 7th/e clearly states that (p7) The massive physiologic growth of uterus during pregnancy is a good example of hormone induced increase in the size of an organ that results from both hyperophy and hyperplasia But Robbin 8thie says (P 6-7) The massive physiological growth of the uterus during pregnancy is a good example of hormone induced increase in the size of an organ that results mainly .from hyperophy of muscle .fibres. The cellular enlargement is stimulated by estrogenic hormones acting on smooth muscles estrogen receptors. About Breast enlargement during pregnancy and pubey Bobbin's 8th le p. 8 says Hormonal hyperplasia is well illustrated by the proliferation of glandular epithelium t.f.female breast at pubey and during pregnancy usually accompanied by enlargement (hyperophy of glandular epithelial cells). Hyperophy Hyperophy refers to an increase in the size of cells resulting in an increase in size of the organ. Hyperplasia It is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue usually resulting in increased volume of the organ or tissue. Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, thus permiting mitotic division, in contrast, hyperophy involves cell enlargement without cell division. Although hyperplasia and hyperophy are two distinct processes, sometimes they may occur together. - For example hormone induced growth in the uterus during pregnancy involves both increased number of smooth muscles and epithelial cells and the enlargement of these cells (i.e. both hyperophy and hyperplasia). - The cellular hyperophy is stimulated by estrogenic hormones acting on smooth muscle estrogen receptors, eventually resulting in increased synthesis of smooth muscle proteins and an increase in cell size. Muscular hyperophy One of the most common and visible forms of organ hyperophy occurs in skeletal muscles in response to strength training. The muscle cells in both the hea and the skeletal muscles are capable of tremendous hyperophy perhaps because they cannot adequately adopt to increased demands by mitotic division and production of more cells to share the work. The most common stimulus for muscle hyperophy is increased workload. For example the bulging muscles of bodybuilders engaged in ""pumping iron"" result from an increase in size of the individual muscle fibres in response to increased demand. The workload is thus shared by a greater mass of cellular components and each muscle fibre is spared excess work and so escapes injury. The enlarged muscle cell achieves a new equilibrium, permitting it to function at a higher level of activity. In the hea, the stimulus for hyperophy is usually a chronic hemodynamic overload resulting from either hypeension or faulty values. Synthesis of more proteins and filaments occur, achieving a balance b/w the demand and the cell's functional capacity. The greater number of myofilaments per cell permits an increased workload with a level of metabolic activity per unit volume of cell not different from that borne by the normal cell. Breast enlargement during lactation occurs due to hyperophy of the cells caused by the action of prolactin and estrogen on breast. Breast hyperplasia occurs during pubey and pregnancy.",A

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Celiac sprue,Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas,Menetrier disease,Tropical sprue,"Celiac sprue, which is also referred to as gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is characterized by (1) generalized malabsorption, (2) small intestinal mucosal lesions, and (3) prompt clinical and histopathologic response to the withdrawal of gluten-containing food. Critical factors in the development of celiac sprue include genetic predisposition and gliadin exposure.

A single nucleotide change in a codon on chromosome 11 that causes valine to replace glutamic acid at the sixth position of the b chain of hemoglobin.peripheral blood film of the patient is given,a thalassemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Sickle cell anemia,"Hemoglobin S (Hb S) is formed by the replacement of glutamic acid by valine in the sixth position in the b chain of hemoglobin. On deoxygenation, Hb S polymerizes and the red cells sickle. In patients heterozygous for Hb S (sickle cell trait, Hb AS), there is approximately 45% Hb S and 55% Hb A. Because of the content of Hb A, erythrocytes only sickle at low oxygen tension and symptoms are much milder than in sickle cell disease. Hb F does not react with hemoglobin S, so that patients who have Hb S and large amounts of Hb F, as occurs in newborns with sickle cell disease, are asymptomatic. Clinically, sickle cell disease is characterized by the triad of chronic hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion, and vulnerability to infection. The severe chronic hemolytic anemia leads to chronic hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), which leads to pigmented gallstones. Vascular occlusion results in leg ulcers, renal papillary necrosis, and multiple infarcts, which may cause severe bone pain. Repeated splenic infarcts cause progressive fibrosis and splenic atrophy (autoinfarction). Rather than hypersplenism, most adults have a small, functionless, fibrotic spleen. The lack of splenic function along with defects in the alternate complement pathway predispose to infections such as Salmonella osteomyelitis and pneumococcal infections. The vasoocclusive disease also leads to painful crises, hand-foot syndrome in children (consisting of the typical triad of fever, pallor, and symmetric swelling of hands and feet), and infarctive crises. In patients not having yet undergone splenic autoinfarction (usually children), massive splenic sequestration (sequestration crisis) may lead to rapid splenic enlargement, hypovolemia, and shock. Patients with sickle cell disease have a normocytic anemia with a corrected reticulocyte count of greater than 3%. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is zero because the sickled red cells cannot aggregate and settle in the test tube. Hydroxyurea has recently been approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease because it increases the synthesis of hemoglobin F, thus reducing the severity of the disease Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",D

The impoant and ubiquitous role of MHC class I molecules is highlighted in patients with defective expression of all class I proteins. This rare immunodeficiency disorder can be caused by mutations in b2-microglobulin, a subunit of MHC class I proteins, or in the TAP proteins, which are vital to antigen presentation by MHC class I molecules. In early life, the TAP-deficient individual suffers frequent bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract and in the second decade begins to experience chronic infection of the lungs. The most characteristic mark of the deficiency is the occurrence of necrotizing skin lesions on the extremities and the midface.

Morphological hallmark- dense accumulation of distended, foamy macrophages in the small intestinal lamina propria. The macrophages contain periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, diastase-resistant granules that represent lysosomes stuffed with paially digested bacteria. Intact rod-shaped bacilli can also be identified by electron microscopy. Distension of villi due to dense macrophage infiltrates, impas a shaggy gross appearance to the mucosal surface. In Whipple disease, bacteria-laden macrophages can accumulate within mesenteric lymph nodes, synol membranes of affected joints, cardiac valves, the brain, and other sites.

Hemochromatosis is a defect in metabolism of -,Iron,Copper,Magnesium,Calcium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Iron o Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as the liver and pancreas.Hemochromatosiso Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas.o The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm year.o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver.o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first mainfests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life.o Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissueso The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.Liver (95%)o Usually the first organ to be affected,o Hepatomegaly seen in most of the cases,o Micronodular cirrhosis is characteristico Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 30% patientsSkin (90%)o Excessive skin pigmentation (Bronzing of the skin)o Skin pigmentation results partially due to hemosiderin deposition and mainly due to melanin depositiono Usually diffuse or generalized, but more pronounced on the face, neck and extensor aspects of lower forearmsPancreas (65%)o Leads to diabetes mellitusJoints (25-50%)o Arthropathyo PolyarthritisCardiaco Congestive heart failureo Anyhthmiao Cardiomyopathy (Restrictive)Hypogonadismo These changes are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary' function by iron deposition however, primary' testicular dysfunction may be seen in some cases",A

However, it may be activated 'in vivo' also. i) 'In vitro' activation :- Intrinsic pathway may be activated 'in vitro' upon interaction of factor XII ( Hageman factor or contact factor) with negatively charged surface such as glass, kaolin, dextran sulphate, ellagic acid, celite, or bismuth subgallate and interaction with hydrophobic surfaces. ii) 'In vivo ' activation :- 'in vivo' activation occurs as a result of contact activation of factor XII from subendothelial collagen and other components (platelets) following endothelial injury to blood vessels. As intrinsic pathway is largely an 'in vitro' pathway, it is impoant for coagulation testing. 2) Extrinsic pathway The extrinsic pathway is largely an 'in vivo' pathway and accounts for majority of 'in vivo' coagulation. It may also be activated 'in vitro' also. i) 'In vivo ' activation :- `in vivo' activation occurs by the expression of tissue factor at the sites of tissue injury. In vitro' activation :- 'in vitro' activation occurs by exposure of blood to thromboplastin reagents (tissue factor) derived from tissues.",A

What is hyperplasia -,Decrease in cell size,Increase in cell size,Increase in cell number,Decrease in cell number,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increase in cell number Hvperplasia o Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells without increase in size in an organ or tissue (by contrast hyperophy refers to an increase in the size of cells). o Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, thus permitting mitotic division i.e., hyperplasia involves cell division (by contrast hyperophy involves cell enlargement without cell division). o Hyperplasia can be physiological or pathological. A. Physiological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased physiological demand e.g (a) Hormonal --> Hyperplasia of endometrium in pregnant uterus, proliferation of the glandular epithelium of female breast at pubey and during pregnancy. (b) Compensatory --> Increase in tissue mass after damage or paial resection, e.g. regeneration of liver after paial hepatectomy. B. Pathological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased stimulus under ceain pathologic conditions. o Most forms of pathological hyperplasia are caused by excessive hormonal stimulation or growth factor acting on target cells, e.g., Endometrial hyperplasia due to disturbed estrogen and progesterone balance (with relative excess of estrogen) in menstural cycle. Note : Stimulus for physiologic and pathologic hyperplasia may be the same (e.g., estrogen for endometrial hyperplasia), but in physiologic hyperplasia, the stimulus is due to normal physiologic changes of body e.g., pregnancy, while in pathologic hyperplasia the stimulus is due to ceain pathologic conditions e.g., estrogen secreting ovarian tumor. o Although pathological hyperplasia is abnormal, the process remains controlled --> Hyperplasia regresses if the hormonal stimulation is eliminated. o It is the response to the normal regulatory control mechanisms that distinguishes benign pathological hyperplasia from Cancer, in which the growth control mechanism becomes defective. o However, pathological hyperplasia constitues a feile soil in which cancerous proliferation may eventually arise --> e.g., patients with endometrial hyperplasia are at increase risk of endometrial carcinoma Mechanism of hyperplasia o Hyperplasia is caused by increased production of growth factor or hormones that lead to production of transcription factor that turn on many cellular genes and induce cellular proliferation. o After some type of cell loss, hyperplasia is caused not only by proliferation of cells but also by the development of new cells from stem cells --> e.g., After hepatectomy the hyperplasia is due to proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes, but in chronic hepatitis, intrahepatic stem cells play a major role in hyperplasia as the proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is compromised.",C

Tumor containing cells of all three germ layers is called -,Leiomyoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Adenocarcinoma,Teratoma,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Teratoma o All Tumors, benign or malignant, have two basic components -* Proliferative neoplastic cells --> constiture parenchymes. Suppoive stroma ---> made up of connective tissue and blood vessels. o The name of tumor is usually based on the cell, e.g. smooth muscle cell tumor --> leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, skeletal muscle cell tumor rhabdomyosarcoma. o Benign tumors In general, benign tumors are designed by attaching the suffix - oma, e.g tumor of fibroblasts --> fibroma, tumor of cailagenous cells ---> chondroma. o Malignant tumors Malignant tumors arising in mesenchymal cell origin are usually called sarcoma, e.g. fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. Malignant tumors of epithelial cell origin are called carcinoma. Carcinoma may be fuher classified one with glandular growth pattern, i.e. adenocarcinoma and the other one producing recognizable squamous cells of epithelium, i.e. squamous cell carcinoma. o Germ layers and tumor Great majority of the neoplasm are composed of cells representative of a single germ layer. Teratomas, in contrast, are made up of a variety ofparenchymal cell types representative of more than one germ layer, usually all three. They arise from totipotent cells and so are principally encountered in the gonads. These totipotent cells differentiate along various germ lines, that can be identified as skin, fat, muscle, tooth structure, hair or any other tissue of the body. Example is dermoid cyst of ovary is a benign teratoma (note --> mature teratoma is benign, while immature teratoma is malignant).

Fast growing, poorly-differentiated cancer cells characteristically show high aerobic glycolysis.
A Serine/threonine kinase Akt stimulate glycolysis in malignant cells.
Activation of Akt oncogene is sufficient to stimulate the switch to aerobic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells and Akt activity renders cancer cells dependent on aerobic glycolysis for continued growth and survival.

Following information have been added in 8th /e of Robbins 

Even in the presence of ample oxygen, cancer cells shift their glucose metabolism away from the oxygen hungry, but efficient, mitochondria to glycolysis.
This phenomenon called the Warburg effect and also known as aerobic glycolysis.
This metabolic alteration is so common to tumors that some would call it the eighth hallmark of cancer:
Clinically, the ""glucose-hunger"" of tumors is used to visualize tumors via positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, in which patients are injected with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose, a non-metabolizing derivative of glucose that is preferentially taken up into tumor cells (as well as normal actively dividing tissues such as bone marrow).",A

Bleeding manifestation of Hemophilia is,Hemoptysis,Hemarthrosis,Hematomas,Hematuria,"(B) Hemarthrosis[?]Hemophilia is an X linked disorder of coagulation caused by the deficiency in a circulating plasma protein.oHemophilia A is caused by the deficiency of factor VIII, and hemophilia B is caused by the deficiency of factor IX.oIt is PTT which is affected (increased) and not PT (unaffected).oFactor VIII is involved in the intrinsic pathway which is measured by PTT and not in extrinsic pathway which is measured as PT.oBleeding is the common manifestation of hemophilia and the common bleeding manifestations are Hemarthoses, Hematomas, Mucocutaneous bleeding, Intracranial bleeding, Hematuria and Pseudotumor.i|SITES OF BLEEDINGSeriousLife-threatening* Joints (Hemarthrosis)* Central Nervous System (CNS)* Muscle/soft tissue* Gastrointestinal (GI)* Mouth/gums/nose* Neck/throat* Hematuria* Severe trauma [?]Clinical Manifestations: HemarthrosisoPathophysiology:-Bleeding probably starts from synovial vessels into the synovial space.-Re-absorption of this blood is often incomplete leading to chronic proliferative synovitis, where the synovium is more thickened & vascular, creating a 'target joint' with recurrence of bleeding.-There is destruction of surrounding structures as well-bone necrosis & cyst formations, osteophytes.-Terminal stage: Chronic Hemophiliac arthropathy: Fibrous or bony ankylosing of the joint.oDefects of secondary hemostasis (coagulation factor defects) often present with bleeds into soft tissues (e.g., muscle) or joints. Bleeding into joints (hemarthrosis) following minor trauma is particularly characteristic of hemophilia.oIt is unknown why severe defects in secondary hemostasis present with this peculiar pattern of bleeding; as with severe platelet defects, intracranial hemorrhage, sometimes fatal, may also occur.Other Options[?]Hemoptysis:-Diseases causing repeated haemoptysis include carcinoma, bronchiectasis, carcinoid tumours and some infections.-Severe mitral stenosis is now a rare cause. Patients with repeated haemoptysis should be investigated, at the very least by chest radiography and bronchoscopy.-Haemoptysis following trauma may be from a lung contusion or injury to a major airway. Treatment depends on the underlying cause.[?]Hematomas:-If large, painful or causing neural deficit, a haematoma may require release by incision or aspiration.-In the gluteal or thigh region, there may be an associated disruption of fat in the form of a fat fracture, which results in an unsightly groove but intact skin.-An untreated haematoma may also calcify and therefore require surgical exploration if symptomatic.[?]Hematuria:-Blood in the urine (haematuria) may be the only indication of cancer and other pathology in the urinary tract.-Microscopic haematuria may be detected by dipstick testing in a routine health check. A substantial haemorrhage imparts a red or brownish tinge to the urine (macroscopic haematuria) and the patient may pass clots.",B
A 30-year-old woman suffers massive trauma in an automobile accident and expires 4 days later of respiratory insufficiency.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this pathologic finding?,Fat embolism,Global ischemia,Occlusion of middle cerebral artery,Sepsis,"Small emboli, notably those composed of fat or air, occlude capillaries. Fat emboli originating from bone fractures are carried downstream through the cerebral vessels until the caliber of the emboli exceeds that of the blood vessels, at which point they lodge and block blood flow. The distal capillary endothelium becomes hypoxic and permeable, and petechiae develop, most commonly in the white matter.

Which of the following conditions is this patient most likely to develop?",Cerebral arterial mycotic aneurysm,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration,Pericardial effusion with tamponade,"She developed bacterial septicemia followed by infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Thus she has a high risk for developing complications of infective endocarditis. Such valvular vegetations are destructive of the valve. The impaired functioning of the mitral valve (most likely regurgitation) would give rise to left atrial dilation and left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema. Septic emboli from the mitral valve vegetation could reach the systemic circulation and give rise to abscesses. The infection of an arterial wall can weaken the wall, resulting in aneurysm formation and the potential for rupture. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be due to chronic alcoholism, or it may be idiopathic. It may be familial, or it may follow myocarditis, but it is not a direct complication of infective endocarditis. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve results from a defect in connective tissue, whether well-defined or unknown; the mitral valve leaflets are enlarged, hooded, and redundant. Lesions on the right side of the valve can produce septic emboli that involve the lungs, but vegetations on the left side embolize to the systemic circulation, producing lesions in the spleen, kidneys, or brain. Pulmonary abscesses can occur from right-sided infective endocarditis because septic emboli pour into the pulmonary arterial circulation.",A

A 49-year-old female presents with signs of anemia and states that every morning her urine is dark. Workup reveals that her red blood cells lyse in vitro with acid (positive Ham's test). What is the best diagnosis for this patient?,Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria,Cold-agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal stem cell disorder that is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red blood cells (RBCs) are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD 55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD55), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). Complement is normally activated by acidotic states, such as occur with exercise or sleep. In patients with PNH, the acidotic condition that develops during sleep (which is usually at night) causes hemolysis of red blood cells and results in red urine in the morning. The erythrocytes of these patients lyse in vitro with acid (Ham's test) or sucrose (sucrose lysis test). Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses, paicularly of the hepatic, poal, or cerebral veins. Since PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder, patients are at an increased risk of developing aplastic anemia or acute leukemia. The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are impoant causes of acute anemia in a wide variety of clinical states and can be separated into two main types: those secondary to ""warm"" antibodies and those reactive at cold temperatures. Warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias react at 37degC in vitro, are composed of IgG, and do not fix complement. They are found in patients with malignant tumors, especially leukemia-lymphoma; with use of such drugs as a-methyldopa; and in the autoimmune diseases, especially lupus erythematosus. Cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia reacts at 4 to 6degC, fixes complement, is of the IgM type, and is classically associated with Mycoplasma pneumonitis (pleuropneumonia-like organisms). These antibodies are termed cold agglutinins and may reach extremely high titers and cause intravascular red cell agglutination. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

Goodpasture's syndrome is characterized by -,Necrotising hemorrhagic interstitial pneumonitis,Alveolitis,Patchy consolidation,Pulmonary edema,"Goodpasture syndrome

Goodpasture syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the rapid destruction of the kidney and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage.
It is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies targeted against basement membrane of lung and kidney.
These antibodies are directed against the noncollagenous domain of the Î± -3 chains of type IV collagen (collagen of basement membrane).
The antibodies initiate an inflammatory destruction of the basement membrane in kidney glomeruli and lung alveoli.
In Goodpasture syndrome, the immune reaction is type II hypersensitivity.

Feature of Autosomal dominant disorder:,Present early in life,Complete penetrance common,New germ cell mutations in old fathers,Male to male transmission not possible,"Autosomal dominant disorder usually have late onset of disease due to presence of one non mutated gene which can function normally. In contrast with autosomal recessive where onset is early due to presence of mutation in both gene present. Complete penetrance is feature of autosomal recessive disorder, as individual who inherits the both mutated gene, individual will have symptom. As in autosomal dominant disorder, some individual shows mild, some might have moderate or some severe. Some individual might not express the phenotype even though they inherit the allele. Therefore incomplete penetrance is feature of AD disorder. Male to male transmission is possible in autosomal inheritance condition. In autosomal dominant condition like achondroplasia: Normally, FGF-mediated activation of FGFR3 inhibits endochondral growth. Constitutive activation of FGFR3 exaggerates this effect, suppressing growth. Approximately 90% of cases stem from new mutations, almost all of which occur in the paternal allele.",C
Ham test is done for -,PNH,Megaloblastic anemia,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,"Diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

Until recently the diagnosis of P.N.H was based on special tests that were based on the principle that P.N.H red cells are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. These tests are :

HAM Test

Ham's acidified serum test is one of the screening tests for P.N.H. Patient's red cells gets lysed in an acidic pH in the presence of complement.

Sucrose Test

Red cells lyse on the addition of sucrose and complement in the medium.
Addition of sucrose decreases the ionic strength.
But now the diagnosis of P.N.H depends upon analyzing the expression G.P.IâAP on the hematopoietic stem cells using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The simplest method is to analyze the expression of CD59 on erythrocytes.

Congenital syphilis can produce abnormalities of bone, such as saber shin from periosteitis and perichondritis, but does not affect the skin. Vitamin D deficiency in childhood producing rickets is accompanied by bowing deformities of long bones, but not skin abnormalities. The pattern of findings here suggests a structural gene defect leading to development of abnormalities, and not congenital anomalies without a specific cause. Battered children typically have multiple contusions and fractures, but the skin and bone structure are normal.",B
"A 50-year old man has a 30 year history of smoking. For approximately 6 months per year for the preceding 5 years, he has had copious sputum production. This sputum production is most likely closely related to increased numbers of which of the following cell types in his bronchioles and small (less than 3 mm) bronchi?",Goblet cells,Smooth muscle cells,Squamous cells,Type I pneumocytes,"The patient has chronic bronchitis, which has been clinically defined to be chronic cough with copious sputum production that has been present for at least 3 months in 2 consecutive years. Smoking and inhalation of other irritating substances (including smog) are usually associated. While the sputum production of early chronic bronchitis is the result of hyperophy of submucosal glands in larger bronchi, in late and more severe cases, goblet cell metaplasia of bronchioles and small bronchi also contributes significantly to the mucus production. Other microscopic changes that occur include increased infiltration of small airways by alveolar macrophages and fibrosis of bronchiolar walls (that may even obliterate lumina). Smooth muscle hyperophy can be seen in larger bronchi, and is related to the increased effo needed to clear bronchi of copious amounts of mucus, but does not cause increased mucus production.Squamous cell metaplasia is seen as a reaction to irritation (often by smoking) in the larger bronchi. It is related to increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in smokers, but not increased mucus production.Type I pneumocytes are the normal, flat, lining cells of alveoli.

On physical examination, there are 0.3- to 0.9-cm comedones, erythematous papules, nodules, and pustules most numerous on the lower face and posterior upper trunk. Other family members have been affected by this condition at a similar age. The lesions worsen during a 5-day cruise to the Adriatic. Which of the following organisms is most likely to play a key role in the pathogenesis of these lesions?",Group A b-hemolytic streptococcus,Herpes simplex virus type 1,Mycobacterium leprae,Propionibacterium acnes,"Teenagers and young adults are affected by acne vulgaris more often than other age groups, and males are affected more often than females. Propionibacterium acnes organisms break down sebaceous gland oils to produce irritative fatty acids, and this may promote the process. The food on the cruise probably did not play a role, but stress causes the lesions to worsen. Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci are implicated in the inflammatory skin condition known as impetigo, which can include pustules and a characteristic pale yellow-brown crust. Herpes simplex virus produces vesicular skin eruptions, most often in a perioral or genital distribution. Mycobacterium leprae causes leprosy, which is a chronic condition that can produce focal depigmentation and areas of skin anesthesia.",D

It represents incomplete involution of the vitellointestinal duct and always arises from the antimesenteric border of the intestine. Heterotopic gastric or pancreatic tissue may be present in about one-half of cases. Peptic ulceration, which occurs as a result of acid secretion by heterotopic gastric mucosa, is usually located in the adjacent ileum.

Not true about graft versus host reaction ?,Not true about graft versus host reaction ?,Bile duct damage,Intrahepatic cholestasis,None,"Ans. is None (all are true) Pathological manifestations of graft versus host disease (GVHD) o There are three principal target tissues affected in GVHD:- Skin, liver and gut. o GVHD disease may be acute or chronic A. Acute GVHD :-Acute GVHD occurs within 100 days (usually 10-50 days) of bone marrow transplantation. The manifestations of acute GVHD are:? 1. Skin o The most common tissue affected in acute GVHD is the skin, with over 80% of patients with GVHD manifesting skin eruption. o The typical skin presentation consists of a maculopapular rash that can resemble a sunburn. o Histological findings are:- (i) Perivascular mononuclear infiltrates (ii) Vacuolar degradation of dermo-epidermal junction (iii) Dyskeratotic cells or eosinophilic bodies in the epidermis (iv) Epidermolysis & bullae (v) Denudation of epidermis (separation of epidermis from dermis) 2. Gut J The primary clinical manifestation of gut GVHD is diarrhea and abdominal pain. o There is lymphocytic infiltrates at the crypts with accompnied necrosis and dropout of crypt cells. 3. Liver o Lymphocytic infiltrates in the interlobular and marginal bile ducts are characteristic histopathologic findings. o This results in hepatitis with necrosis of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells o There is inflammation of the parenchyma and poal tracts. o These findings lead to clinically identifiable cholestatic picture. B. Chronic GVHD :- It occurs after 100 days of bone marrow transplantation. Manifestations are :1.Skin o Extensive cutaneous injury, with destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis. Gut o Damage to GIT may result in necrosis, ulceration, fibrosis and strictures. Liver o The findings of liver damage are :? (i) Poal tract inflammation (ii) Selective bile duct destruction (iii) Endothelitis of poal vein and hepatic vein radicles, in which a subendothelial lymphocytic infiltrate lifts the endothelium from its basement membrane. (iv) Intrahepatic cholestasis Role of liver biopsy in GVHD o Evaluation of liver biopsies in the setting of acute GVHD is usually not required, because skin or GI tract biopsies are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis and the risks associated with liver biopsy in the early post-operative period are unacceptably high. However, because abnormal liver function tests often persist despite improvement in other organs after treatment, liver biopsy may be needed to exclude coexistent disease such as viral infection. Therefore, in acute GVHD liver biopsy contributes an impoant role in the exclusion of other causes of hepatic injury. o In contrast, liver biopsy is an impoant diagnostic test in establishing a diagnosis of chronic GVHD after bone marrow transplantation.",D

"A 35-year-old man has had an outbreak of pruritic lesions over the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees during the past month. He has a history of malabsorption that requires him to eat a special diet, but he has had no previous skin problems. On physical examination, the lesions are 0.4- to 0.7-cm vesicles. A 3-mm punch biopsy of one of the lesions over the elbow is performed and on microscopic examination shows the accumulation of neutrophils at the tips of dermal papillae and the formation of small blisters caused by separation at the dermo-epidermal junction. Immunofluorescence studies show granular deposits of IgA localized to tips of dermal papillae. Laboratory studies show serum antigliadin antibodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bullous pemphigoid,Contact dermatitis,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Discoid lupus erythematosus,"Dermatitis herpetiformis can accompany the celiac disease. The IgA or IgG antibodies formed against the gliadin protein in gluten that is ingested (commonly in wheat, rye, and barley grains) cross-react with reticulin. Reticulin is a component of the anchoring fibrils that attach the epidermal basement membrane to the superficial dermis. This explains the localization of the IgA to the tips of dermal papillae and the site of inflammation. A gluten-free diet may relieve the symptoms. Bullous pemphigoid can occur in older individuals, with an antibody directed at keratinocytes to produce flaccid bullae, but there is no association with celiac disease. Contact dermatitis is most likely to be seen on the hands and forearms. It is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction without immunoglobulin deposition and would not persist for 1 month. Discoid lupus erythematosus is seen in sun-exposed areas and has the appearance of an erythematous rash. Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity response to infections and drugs; it produces macules and papules with a red or vesicular center, but it is probably mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes and not by immunoglobulin deposition. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease in which IgG deposited in acantholytic areas forms vesicles that rupture to form erosions; it is not related to celiac disease.",C
Impoant step in activation of naive CD 4+ T cells and initiation of cell mediated immune response is played by Interleukin?,1,2,3,4,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 2 Activation of CD4+ T Cells: Naive CD4+ T cells recognize peptides displayed by dendritic cells and secrete IL-2, which functions as an autocrine growth factor to stimulate proliferation of the antigen- responsive T cells. The subsequent differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to TH1 or TH17 cells is driven by the cytokines produced by APCs at the time of T-cell acti- vation. In some situations the APCs (dendritic cells and macrophages) produce IL-12, which induces differentiation of CD4+ T cells to the TH1 subset. IFN-y produced by these effector cells promotes fuher TH1 development, thus amplifying the reaction. If the APCs produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and a close relative of IL-12 called IL-23, these stimulate differentiation of T cells to the TH17 subset.",B

A male patient 56 year old complains of swelling in legs. He is a known case of hypertension and is under treatment. On general physical examination pitting oedema is seen on legs and TSH level 3mU/L. Which of the following is not a cause of this condition?,Increase in hydrostatic pressure,Decreased colloid osmotic pressure,Due to lymphatic obstruction,Myxedema,"Most leg swelling is caused by oedema, the accumulation of ï¬uid within the interstitial space. Unilateral swelling usually indicates a localised pathology in either the venous or the lymphatic system, while bilateral oedema often represents generalised ï¬uid overload combined with the effects of gravity. However, all causes of unilateral leg swelling may present bilaterally, and generalised ï¬uid overload may present with asymmetrical (and therefore apparently unilateral) oedema. Fluid overload may be the result of cardiac failure, pulmonary hypertension (even in the absence of right ventricular failure), renal failure, hypoalbuminaemia or drugs (calcium channel blockers, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, non-steroidal anti-inï¬ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and others).
Â ApproximatelyÂ 60%Â ofÂ leanÂ bodyÂ weightÂ isÂ water,Â two-thirdsÂ ofÂ whichÂ isÂ intracellular.Â MostÂ ofÂ theÂ remaining water is found in extracellular compartments in the form of interstitial fluid; only 5% of the bodyâs water is in bloodÂ plasma.Â AsÂ notedÂ earlier,Â edemaÂ isÂ anÂ accumulationÂ of interstitial fluid within tissues.Â 

Increase in hydrostatic pressure are mainly caused by disorders that impair venous return. Local increases in intravascular pressure caused, for example, by deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity can cause edema restricted to the distal portion of the affected leg.
Reduction of plasma albumin concentrations leads to decreased colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood and loss of fluid from the circulation.
Edema may result from lymphatic obstruction that compromises resorption of fluid from interstitial spaces.

The following is true about bronchial carcinoids,Highly radiosensitive,Metastasis common,Carcinoid syndrome does not manifest,Commonly arise from terminal bronchioles,"BRONCHIAL CARCINOID ANDÂ OTHER NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOURS
Neuroendocrine tumours of the lung represent a continuumÂ spectrum of lung tumours with progressively increasing
aggressiveness which include: typical carcinoid (least aggressive), atypical carcinoid, and large cell endocrine
carcinoma, and also small cell carcinoma (most aggressive). All these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky)
cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoidsÂ used to be classified as âbronchial adenomasâ but now it is
known that they are locally invasive and have the capacity to metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at a
younger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearingÂ below the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarette
smoking.
CLINICAL FEATURES. Bronchial carcinoids occur at aÂ relatively early age and have equal sex incidence. Most of
the symptoms in bronchial carcinoids occur as a result ofÂ bronchial obstruction such as cough, haemoptysis, atelectasis

What one structural feature do all blood capillaries have in common -,Absence of intracellular fenestrations in the endothelial cells,Presence of intracellular fenestrations,A discontinuous basement membrane,None,"Ans. is None The blood flows from the hea through aery, aeriole, capillary, venule and vein, and then returns to the hea. Structure of aery and aeriole o It is made up three layers ? Tunica Intima o The inner most layer (towards lumen) of aery is intima. o It consists of endothelial cells which rest on basment membrane. o There is some subendothelial connective tissue. o Intima is separated from media by internal elastic lamina. Tunica Media o It is mainly contains smooth muscles and laminae of elastic tissue Media is separated from adventitia by external elastic lamina. Tunica Adyentitia o It is the outer most layer. o Contains collegen and elastic fibers. Structure of capillaries o Capillaries are thin walled vessels made up of single layer of endothelial cells with its basement membrane. o Capillaries are of three types ? Continous capillaries ? o These capillaries has continuous lining of endothelial cells with no fenestration. o Basement membrane is also continuous. Fenesterated capillaries o There are fenestration between the endothelial cells. o Basment membrane is continuous. Sinusoidal capillaries o Both endothelial cells and basement membrane have fenestration. o In resting tissues, most of the capillaries are collapsed and blood flows through the throughfare vessels from the aerioles to the venules. Structure of veins o Structure of vein is smiliar to aery except that ? 1.Wall is thinner Three tunicae are less well demarcated. Elastic tissue is scanty and not clearly organized into distinct internal and external elastic lamina. 4.Have valves (except venae cavae and common iliac vein). Note ? For one option go ahead with option d i.e continuous basement membrane, because the term capillary is used generally for the first two types of capillary (both have continuous basment membrane).

Endotoxin shock is initiated by aEUR',Endothelial injury,Peripheral vasodilation,Increased vascular permeability,Cytokines action,"Cytokines action Septic shock is caused by vasodilation and peripheral pooling of blood as a pa of systemic immune reaction to bacterial or fungal infection. Septic shock was earlier also known as endotoxic shock because it was believed to be most commonly associated with endotoxin secreted due to gram negative bacteria. Currently, septic shock is most .frequently triggered by grain positive bacterial infections followed by gram negative bacteria and fungi. Hence the older synonym of ""endotoxic shock"" is not appropriate. Septic shock may be caused by either gram positive or gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are different in different bacterias :- - Grain negative bacteria --> * Lipopolysaccharide entotoxin - Gram positive bacteria * Lipoteichoic acid Cell wall murantyl peotide 'Superantigens Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin The primary initial event in endotoxic shock is release of cytokines irrespective of whether it is caused by gram positive or gram negative organism -The sequence of events leading to the production of primary cytokines is different in gram negative and grain positive bacterias but the result is the same i.e. both the gram (-ye) and gram (+ve) bacterias leads to production of same mediators of inflammation i.e. TNFa and IL-1. The sequence of events after the release of primary mediators of inflammation is same in both the types of bacteria. - Once the primary cytokines i.e. TNFa and IL-1 are released they activate endothelium and leucocytes to release secondary mediators. - The secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage. So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock :- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNFa and IL-1. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cytokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock.",D

CT imaging of her abdomen shows an ill-defined pelvic soft- tissue density mass with a mottled lucent center and a small, square, radiopaque area. Review of her medical record reveals that a salpingo-oophorectomy for ectopic pregnancy was performed on the left side 3 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her persistent fever?",Abscess,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,Ovarian cystadenocarcinoma,Sarcoidosis,"She has fever of unknown origin (FUO), at least until a record review correlated with the CT imaging suggests that the mass is a residual hemostatic sponge placed at the time of surgery. Radiopaque markers or radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips can be incorporated into such objects for identification. The mild splenomegaly is consistent with intra-abdominal abscess. There is a long differential diagnosis list for FUO. A mass could represent a neoplasm, but lymphomas do not tend to have significant necrosis and a lucent center. Sarcoidosis tends to involve multiple organs, but lymph node enlargement is likely, although central caseation is not.

The most likely finding would be:,Granular IGa in reticular dermis,Fishnet IgG in epidermis,Linear IgG inderoepidermal junction,Linear IgA in dermal papillae,"Erosions on mucous membranes and skin and flaccid blisters on skin are clinical features of pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by acantholysis, induced by deposition of IgG autoantibodies in the intercellular area of epidermis. PV typically begins on mucosal surfaces and often progresses to involve the skin. PV is characterized by fragile, flaccid blisters that rupture to produce extensive denudation of mucous membranes and skin. PV typically involves the mouth, scalp, face, neck, axilla, groin, and trunk. Erosions can be induced in normal-appearing skin distant from active lesions by pressure or mechanical shear force. This phenomenon is known as the Nikolsky sign. On direct immunofluorescence in perilesional skin, it shows intercellular deposits of IgG giving a fishnet appearance. For detection of circulating IgG antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence is used. Ref: Illustrated Synopsis Of Dermatology & Sexually Transmitted Diseases By Khanna, 3rd edition, Page 63-66.",B

Produced by neutrophils in response to infectious pathogens (mainly bacteria and fungi) and inflammatory mediators (e.g., chemokines, cytokines , complement proteins, and ROS). The extracellular traps consist of a viscous meshwork of nuclear chromatin that binds and concentrates granule proteins such as antimicrobial peptides and enzymes. NET formation stas with ROS-dependent activation of an arginine deaminase that conves arginines to citrulline, leading to chromatin decondensation. In this process, the nuclei of the neutrophils are lost, leading to death of the neutrophils. NETs have also been detected in the blood during sepsis.

"A 45-year-old woman has experienced worsening arthritis of her hands and feet for the past 15 years. On physical examination, there are marked deformities of the hands and feet, with ulnar deviation of the hands and swan-neck deformities of the fingers. Laboratory studies show an elevated level of rheumatoid factor. CBC shows hemoglobin, 11.6 g/dL; hematocrit, 34.8%; MCV, 87 mm3; platelet count, 268,000/ mm3; and WBC count, 6800/ mm3. There is a normal serum haptoglobin level, serum iron concentration of 20 mg/ dL, total iron-binding capacity of 195 mg/dL, percent saturation of 10.2, and serum ferritin concentration of 317 ng/mL. No fibrin split products are detected. The reticulocyte concentration is 1.1%. What is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's hematologic abnormalities?",Autoantibodies against RBC membranes,Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains,Inadequate usage of stored iron,Sequestration of RBCs in splenic sinusoids,"The iron concentration and iron-binding capacity are low; however, in contrast to the finding in anemia of iron deficiency, the serum ferritin level is increased. This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Metastases are space-occupying lesions (myelophthisic process) that can lead to leukoerythroblastosis, with nucleated RBCs and immature WBCs appearing on the peripheral blood smear.",C

Differential expression of same gene depending on parent of origin is referred to as,Genomic imprinting,Mosaicism,Anticipation,Nonpenetrance,"It has now been established that functional differences exist between the paternal and the maternal copies of some genes. These differences arise from an epigenetic process called genomic imprinting, whereby ceain genes are differentially ""inactivated"" during paternal and maternal gametogenesis. Maternal imprinting refers to transcriptional silencing of the maternal allele, whereas paternal imprinting implies that the paternal allele is inactivated. At the molecular level, imprinting is associated with methylation of the gene promoter, as well as related events such asmodification of DNA-binding histone proteins, the sum total effect of which is to silence the gene.

Robbiti's pathology 9th ed. /41-43, 50COAGULATIVE NECROSIS* This pattern of necrosis is typically seen in hypoxic environments, such as infarction.* Coagulative necrosis occurs primarily in tissues such as the kidney, heart and adrenal glands.* Severe ischemia most commonly causes coagulative necrosis.* Coagulation occurs as a result of protein denaturation, causing the albumin in protein to form a firm and opaque state.* It is characterized by the formation of a gelatinous (gel- like) substance in dead tissues in which the architecture of the tissue is maintained, and can be observed by light microscopy.Also KnowQUEFACTIVE NECROSIS* It is characterized by the digestion of dead cells to form a viscous liquid mass. This is typical of bacterial, or sometimes fungal, infections because of their ability to stimulate an inflammatory response.* The necrotic liquid mass is frequently creamy yellow due to the presence of dead leukocytes and is commonly known as pus.* Hypoxic infarcts in the brain presents as this type of necrosis, because the brain contains little connective tissue but high amounts of digestive enzymes and lipids, and cells therefore can be readily digested by their own enzymes.CASEOUS NECROSIS* It can be considered a combination of coagulative and liquefactive necroses, typically caused by mycobacteria, fungi and some foreign substances.* The necrotic tissue appears as white and friable, like clumped cheese.* Microscopic examination shows amorphous granular debris enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border. Granuloma has this characteristic.FAT NECROSIS* It is specialized necrosis of fat tissue, resulting from the action of activated lipases on fatty tissues such as the pancreas.* In the pancreas it leads to acute pancreatitis, a condition where the pancreatic enzymes leak out into the peritoneal cavity, and liquefy the membrane by splitting the triglyceride esters into fatty acids through fat saponification.* Calcium, magnesium or sodium may bind to these lesions to produce a chalky-white substance. The calcium deposits are microscopically distinctive and may be large enough to be visible on radiographic examinations. To the naked eye, calcium deposits appear as gritty white flecks.Fibrinoid necrosis is a special form of necrosis usually caused by immune-mediated vascular damage.

False regarding cavernous hemangioma is,More infiltrative than capillary hemangioma,Undergo spontaneous regression,Intravascular thrombosis and dystrophic calcification seen commonly,Associated with VHL disease,"Cavernous hemangiomas are composed of large, dilated vascular channels. Compared with capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas are more infiltrative, frequently involve deep structures, and do not spontaneously regress. On histologic examination, the mass is sharply defined but unencapsulated and is composed of large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma. Intravascular thrombosis with associated dystrophic calcification is common. They may be locally destructive, so surgical excision may be required in some cases. More often the tumors are of little clinical significance, but they can be cosmetically troublesome and are vulnerable to traumatic ulceration and bleeding. Moreover, cavernous hemangiomas detected by imaging studies may be difficult to distinguish from their malignant counterpas. Brain hemangiomas also are problematic, as they can cause symptoms related to compression of adjacent tissue or rupture.Cavernous hemangiomas constitute one component of von Hippel-Lindau disease , in which vascular lesions are commonly found in the cerebellum, brain stem, retina, pancreas, and liver.

Most important factor associated with progression of HIV positive to AIDS is?,Nutrition,Viral load,Age,CD4 count,"Ans is 'd' i.e. CD4 count * HIV can infect and kill many different types of cells in the body, but the primary targets are immune cells called CD4 T-cells. The CD4 T-cells are white blood cells that help coordinate the immune system's response to infection and disease. CD4 T-cells count is the most important factor determining HIV progression.* Patients progress to AIDS when their CD4 cell counts drop below 200 cells per microliter of blood. Healthy individuals have a CD4 cell count between 600 and 1,200 cells per microliter of blood. Individuals with a CD4 cell lower than 200 cells per microliter of blood have the greatest risk of developing opportunistic infections.* The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV, based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms, and describes the infection in five groups. In those greater than six years of age it is:a. Stage 0: the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test.b. Stage 1: CD4 count > 500 cells/pi and no AIDS defining conditions.c. Stage 2: CD4 count 200 to 500 cells/pl and no AIDS defining conditions.d.

"Which of the following is known as the ""guardian of the genome"" -",p53,Mdm2,p14,ATM,"p53; Guardian of genome

p53 is a tumor suppressor gene.
p53 gene is located on chromosome 17.
p53 acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell.
p53 gene product, i.e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes.
The ma 'or functional activities of the 53 rotein are cell c cle arrest and initiation of a o v.tosis in res onse to DNA damage.
When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels.
p53 causes -

Cell cycle arrest


p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor.
p21 inhibit cyclin D-CDK-4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1Â phase.
This allows time for DNA repair.

DNA repair

p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage).
GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.
If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 â Relieve in cell cycle block.
If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis-inducing gene BAX.
So p53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA â p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer.
Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of the above protective mechanism.
p-53 is the most common target for genetic alteration in human tumors: A little over 50% of human tumorsÂ contain mutation in this gene.

Inheritance pattern of the disease in the family is,Autosomal recessive type,Autosomal dominant type,X-Linked dominant type,X-linked recessive type,"X-linked recessive inheritance is a mode of inheritance in which a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome causes the phenotype to be expressed in males (who are necessarily hemizygous for the gene mutation because they have one X and one Y chromosome) and in females who are homozygous for the gene mutation, see zygosity. X-linked inheritance means that the gene causing the trait or the disorder is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome. Carrier females who have only one copy of the mutation do not usually express the phenotype, although differences in X chromosome inactivation can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females since some cells will express one X allele and some will express the others Ref Robbins 9/e p 145",D

Reye's syndrome - histological finding,Budding and branching of mitochondria,Swelling of endoplasmic reticulum,Paranuclear microdense deposits,Glycogen depletion,"Glycogen depletion Histology of the liver on Reye's syndrome: Histology of the liver shows diffuse microvesicular steatosis (fatty vacuolization) with minimal inflammatory changes. Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent.

Several of these diseases are associated with blood vessel abnormalities, namely inflammation of the vessels (angiitis). Necrotizing granulomatous aeritis affecting the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys is seen in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. These areas of necrosis are characteristically large and serpiginous, and exhibit peripheral palisading of macrophages. In patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, the nose, sinus, antrum, and trachea often exhibit ulcerations. Originally the disease was lethal, but the prognosis is now much improved by immunosuppressive drugs. Eosinophilic granulomatous aeritis occurs in some patients with asthma who have eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates; this abnormality is called Churg-Strauss syndrome. The areas of necrosis are not large and serpiginous as in Wegener's. Granulomatous inflammation centered around bronchi (bronchocentric granulomatosis) is often related to allergic pulmonary aspergillosis. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a disease of middleaged people that is characterized by an angiocentric and angioinvasive infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells.

Commonest carcinoma of the with multifocal origin is,Schirrhous carcinoma,Adenocystic carcinoma,Lobular carcinoma,Ductal carcinoma,"Refer Robbins page no 1057 DCIS can be divided into two major architectural subtypes, comedo and noncomedo (Fig. 23-17). Some cases of DCIS have a single growth pattern, but most are comprised of a mixture of patterns. Nuclear grade and necrosis are better predictors of local recurrence and progression to invasion than architectural type. Comedo DCIS may occasionally produce vague nodularity, but more often it is detected on mammography as clustered or linear and branching areas of calcification (Fig. 23-17A). It is defined by two features: (1) tumor cells with pleomorphic, high- grade nuclei and (2) areas of central necrosis (Fig. 23-17B). Noncomedo DCIS lacks either high-grade nuclei or central necrosis. Several patterns may be seen. Cribriform DCIS may have rounded (cookie cutter-like) spaces (Fig. 23-17C) within the ducts, or a solid DCIS pattern. Micropapillary DCIS pro- duces bulbous protrusions without a fibrovascular core, often arranged in complex intraductal patterns (Fig. 23-17D).

What is the most likely cause of these findings?",Chronic renal failure,Hypervitaminosis D,Medullary thyroid carcinoma,Parathyroid adenoma,"When a patient develops hypercalcemia, a disorder of the parathyroid glands or malignancy at a visceral location must be considered. The elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) suggests primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, most commonly resulting from renal failure, is excluded when the serum inorganic phosphate level is low because phosphate is retained with chronic renal failure. Hypervitaminosis D can cause hypercalcemia because of increased calcium absorption, but in these cases, the PTH levels are expected to be near the low end of the reference range because of feedback suppression. Serum PTH levels near the high end of the reference range indicate autonomous PTH secretion unregulated by hypercalcemia. Although medullary carcinomas of the thyroid often have positive immunohistochemical staining for calcitonin, and plasma levels are sometimes increased, there is typically no major reduction in serum calcium as a result.",D

Tumorogenesis in aging is due to -,Telomerase reactivation,Telomerase inactivation,Increased apoptosis,Suppression of proto-oncogenes,"After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state.
How does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further.

Cells achieve this through telomer shortening 

Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends.
It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at tellninal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers.
Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken i1 NA, which signals cell cycle arrest.
The broken NA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis.
Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division.
	How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life???
In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase.
Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer.
It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence.
This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively????
In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours.
Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",A

A monoclonal Igk peak is demonstrated by serum electrophoresis. Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria. A bone marrow biopsy discloses foci of plasma cells, which account for 18% of all hematopoietic cells. What is the appropriate diagnosis?",Acute lymphoblastic lymphoma,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Extramedullary plasmacytoma,Multiple myeloma,"Plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma) is characterized by a multifocal infiltration of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. There are typically multiple destructive lytic lesions or diffuse demineralization of bone. Major diagnostic criteria for plasma cell myeloma include marrow plasmacytosis (>30%), plasmacytoma on biopsy, and immunoglobulin paraprotein (M-component). Neoplastic cells typically secrete a homogeneous complete or partial immunoglobulin chain, which can be seen in serum or urine electrophoresis. In this patient, the neoplastic clone secretes excess kappa light chains.

Histologic examination of the pleural mass at autopsy shows a biphasic pattern of epithelial and sarcomatous elements. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Carcinoid tumor,Large cell carcinoma,Malignant melanoma,Malignant mesothelioma,"Malignant mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a malignant neoplasm of mesothelial cells that is most common in the pleura, but also occurs in the peritoneum, pericardium, and the tunica vaginalis of the testis. The tumor is strongly linked to occupational inhalation of asbestos. Patients are often first seen with a pleural effusion or a pleural mass, chest pain, and nonspecific symptoms, such as weight loss and malaise. Pleural mesotheliomas tend to spread locally and extensively within the chest cavity, but do not typically invade the pulmonary parenchyma. Wide-spread metastases can occur. Mesothelioma is typically composed of both epithelial and sarcomatous elements (i.e., biphasic pattern). The other choices do not ordinarily encase the lung.Diagnosis: Malignant mesothelioma",D

No antibody deposits are identified by immunofluorescence microscopy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bullous pemphigoid,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Epidermolysis bullosa,Ichthyosis vulgaris,"EB comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders loosely bound by their hereditary nature and by a tendency to form blisters at sites of minor trauma. EB simplex has been attributed to mutations of genes encoding cytokeratin intermediate filaments. The clinical spectrum of the disease ranges from a minor annoyance to a widespread, life-threatening blistering disease. These blisters are almost always noted at birth or shortly thereafter. The classification of these disorders is based on the site of blister formation in the basement membrane zone. Although epidermolytic EB is cosmetically disturbing and sometimes debilitating, it is not life threatening. Blisters seen in bullous pemphigoid (choice A) and pemphigus vulgaris (choice E) are associated with immunoglobulin deposits that are visualized by direct immunofluorescence microscopy.

"A 12-year-old boy develops fever, accompanied by occasional headaches, malaise, fatigue, and nausea a month after being bitten by a dog. One day later, he experiences episodes of rigidity, hallucinations, breath-holding, and difficulty swallowing because of uncontrollable oral secretions. Dr. Louis Pasteur is consulted. He writes: ""The death of this child appearing to be inevitable, I decided, not without lively and sore anxiety, as may well be believed, to try ....... the method which I had found constantly successful with dogs. Consequently, 60 hours after the bites was inoculated under a fold of skin with half a syringeful of the spinal cord of a rabbit. In the following days, fresh inoculations were made. I thus made 13 inoculations."" The boy survives. Which of the following histologic findings in the brain of the dog is most likely to be present?",Multinucleate giant cells,Negri bodies,Perivascular lymphocytes,Pseudocysts with bradyzoites,"The child had rabies, an infectious disease in which the virus travels from the site of an infected animal bite up nerves to the CNS. Pathognomonic Negri bodies are cytoplasmic inclusions found in the hippocampal pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Worldwide, unvaccinated dogs remain the most common vector for transmission of this bullet-shaped virus to man. The suspected animal must be sacrificed to identify the virus in the brain. Infected neurons generally do not undergo cell death; instead, the virus induces neurotoxin production that affects surface receptor interaction with neurotransmitters. After symptoms develop, survival is rare. Multinucleated cells may be seen in microglial nodules associated with HIV infection. Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates are often seen with a variety of viruses, such as arboviruses or echoviruses, causing encephalitis. Toxoplasma gondii infection is characterized by finding enlarged, infected cells filled with bradyzoites. Spongiform change is characteristic of prion disease.",B

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic arthritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Lipoprotein - (a)

Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a).
An elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis.
How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis?
In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition).
So there is consistent deposition of fibrin.
Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plasminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in the reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen â Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system.
This enhances further fibrin deposition.
In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions.
So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C

The most impoant cells in type I hypersensitivity,Macrophages,Mast cells,Neutrophils,Lymphocytes,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Mast cells Type I hypersensitivity (Immediate hypersensitivity) o It is a rapidly developing immunological reaction occuring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in individuals previously sensitized to the antigen. o Immediate hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by Ig E, but T and B cells play impoant role in the development of these antibodies. o Type I reaction requires prior sensitization to a specific antigen (allergen). o Most exposures occur either by inhalation (respiratory route) or ingestion (GIT) of antigen. o Type one hypersensitivity has two phases :- 1.Initial response o After first antigen exposure, this antigen is presented to CD-4 helper T cells (TH2 type) by antigen presenting cells. These primed TH2 cells release IL-4 that acts on B-cells to form Ig E specific for that paicular antigen. The antigen specific lg E antibodies then bind to the surface receptors of mast cells and basophils. The process from first antigen exposure to the coating of mast cells by Ig E acts as sensitization (prior sensitization) and first exposure is also called priming or sensitizing exposure (dose). Subsequent exposure (shocking dose) to same antigen then result in activation of mast cells and basophils with release of mediator from these cells that leads to ? Smooth muscle spasm Increase mucus secretion from the epithelial cells. Vasodilatation Increased vascular permeability Recuritment of inflammatory cells Note - Most of the clinical effects are due to smooth muscle spasm. 2. Late phase response In this phase additional leukocytes are recruited. These cells amplify and sustain the inflammatory response without additional exposure to the triggred antigen. Among the cells that are recruited in the late-phase reaction, eosinophils are paicularly impoant. Eosinophils produce major basic protein and eosinophilic cataionic protein that are toxic to epithelial cells. Platelet activating factor (PAF) recruits and activates inflammatory cells and is most impoant cytokine in the initatiation of late phase response. Type I hypersensitivity occurs in two forms Anaphylaxis --> Acute, potentially fatal, systemic. Atom --> Chronic, Nonfatal, Lacalized. Remember o Mast cells are the most impoant cells in type I hypersensitivity. o Eosinophils are the most impoant cells in the late phase reaction of type I hypersensitivity. o Histamine is the most impoant mediator in type I hypersensitivity. o IL-4 is paicularly impoant, it is essential for turning on IgE secreting B cells. o PAF is the most impoant cytokine in the initiation of late phase reaction. o Most potent eosinophilic activating cytokine is IL-5.",B

Renal cell carcinoma is generally a slow-growing tumour and the tumour may have been present for years before it is detected. The classical clinical evidence for diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is the triad of gross haematuria, flank plain and palpable abdominal mass. The most common presenting abnormality is haematuria that occurs in about 60% of cases. By the time the tumour is detected, it has spread to distant sites haematogenous route to the lungs, brain and bone, and locally to the liver and perirenal lymph nodes. Systemic symptoms of fatiguability, weight loss, cachexia and intermittent fever unassociated with evidence of infection are found in many cases at presentation. A number of paraneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormone production by the renal cell carcinoma have been described.

(Gonadal dysgensis)o Short stature in Turner *s syndrome is also attributed to the loss ofhomeobox (SHOX) gene.o Homeobox gene is present on both the X chromosomes and is responsible for skeletal development.o Loss of this gene in Turner's syndrome results in short stature,o Congenital cardiac defects occur in Turner's syndrome.o Turner's syndrome results from complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome and is characterized primarily by hypogonadism in phenotypic females.o It is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females.Features of Turner syndrome in childreno The most severely affected patients generally present during infancy writh edema (owing to lymph stasis) of the dorsum of the hand and foot and sometimes swelling of the nape of the neck.o Swelling of the neck is related to markedly distended ly mphatic channels, producing so called cystic hygroma.o As these infants develop, the swelling subsides but often leave bilateral neck webbing and persistent looseness of skin on the back of the neck.o Congenital heart disease is also common, particularly preductal coarctation of Aorta and bicuspid Aortic valve,o C.V.S abnormalities are most important cause of mortality in children with Turner s syndrome.Features of Turner's syndrome in Adolescents and Adulto At puberty there is failure to develop normal secondary sex characteristics.o The genitalia remains infantile, breast development is inadequate and there is little pubic hair. Nipples are widely- spaced.o Turner syndrome is the single most important cause of primary- amenarrhoea accounting for approximately 1/3 of the cases.a Short stature (height rarely exceeds 150 cm).o The mental status of these patients is usually normal but subtle defects in nonverbal, visual spatial information processing have been noted (Recall that mental retardation is associated with the presence of extra chromosome) not with loss of X chromosome.o About 50% of the patients develop autoantibodies directed to the thyroid gland and upto one half of these patients develop hypothyroidism.o Glucose intolerance, obesity and insulin resistance are also seen.",A
Most common site for medulloblastoma is-,Cerebellum,Pituitary,Cerebrum,Pineal gland,"POORLY-DIFFERENTIATED AND EMBRYONAL TUMOURS CNS tumors composed of primitive undifferentiated cells include medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, and rarely, neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma. Medulloblastoma is the most common variety of primitive neuroectodermal tumor. The most common location is the cerebellum in the region of roof of the fouh ventricle, in the midline of the cerebellum, in the vermis, and in the cerebellar hemispheres. Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant tumor and spreads to local as well as to distant sites. It invades locally and by the CSF to meninges, ventricles and subarachnoid space and has a tendency for widespread metastases to extraneural sites such as to lungs, liver, veebrae, and pelvis. Microscopically, medulloblastoma is composed of small, poorly-differentiated cells with ill-defined cytoplasmic processes and a tendency to be arranged around blood vessels and occasionally forms pseudorosettes (Homer-Wright rosettes).

"A 39-year-old female presents with chronic abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and periodic facial flushing. Physical examination reveals wheezing and a slightly enlarged liver. Workup reveals several masses within the liver and a large mass in the small intestine. Which one of the listed substances is most likely to be elevated in the urine of this individual as a result of her disease?",5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA),Aminolevulinic acid (ALA),N-formiminoglutamate (FIGlu),Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA),"The patient shows signs of the carcinoid syndrome, which include flushing, diarrhea, and bronchoconstriction. The syndrome results from elaboration of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) by a primary carcinoid tumor in the lungs or ovary, or from hepatic metastases from a primary carcinoid tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. However, primary appendiceal carcinoid tumors, the most common gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, very rarely metastasize and are viually always asymptomatic. Carcinoid tumors arise from cells of the neuroendocrine system, which, as pa of the amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) system, are capable of secreting many products. Grossly, carcinoid tumors, which tend to be multiple when they occur in the stomach or intestines, are characteristically solid and firm and have a yellow-tan appearance on sectioning. Histologically they are composed of nests of relatively bland-appearing monotonous cells. Diagnosis is based on finding increased urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion from metabolism of excess serotonin. In contrast, increased urinary levels of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) are seen with lead toxicity, increased N-formiminoglutamate (FIGlu) with folate deficiency, and increased normetanephrine or vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) with tumors of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma in adults and neuroblastoma in children) Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Which of the substance listed below is most likely to be increased in this patient's serum,Acid phosphatase,Human chorionic gonadotropin,Alkaline phosphatase,a-Fetoprotein,"Tumors sometimes secrete specific substances that appear in the serum. These tumor markers can be used clinically for diagnosis, for staging, and for following patients after surgery to look for recurrences of the tumor. Two impoant tumor markers associated with testicular neoplasms are a-fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin-b (hCG-b). Increased levels of AFP are associated with embryonal cell carcinoma or endodermal sinus tumor, whereas increased levels of hCG are associated with choriocarcinoma. Increased levels of both AFP and hCG are seen with mixed germ cell tumors. It is impoant to note that although seminomas may be associated with increased levels of hCG, pure seminomas are never associated with increased levels of AFP.

In addition to the lymphoid system the nervous system is a major target of HIV infection. Macrophages and microglia cells in the central nervous system that belongs to the monocyte and macrophages lineages are the predominant types in the brain that are infected with HIV. It is widely believed that HIV is carried into the brain by infected monocytes. Ninety percent of patients demonstrate some form of neurological involvement at autopsy. C.N.S. involvement in AIDS usually produces AIDS dementia complex. The pathology associated with AIDS related congnitive motor complex sometimes called subacute encephalitis is located mainly in subcoical areas with relative sparing of cerebral coex. Between 10 and 20% of I-UV-infected patients present with neurologic signs as their first clinical manifestation of infection. In some, no other signs of AIDS develop. Between 50 and 70% of all AIDS patients eventually develop some features of what is called AIDS dementia or the AIDS related cognitive-motor complex. -This term is used to describe the characteristic pattern of cognitive, motor, and behavioral dysfunction, including mood disturbances, seen in AIDS patients.

B cell defectDiGeorge Syndrome {Thymic Hypoplasia) Robbins 9th/24lDiGeorge syndrome is a T-cell deficiency that results from failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. The latter give rise to the thymus, the parathyroids, some of the C cells of the thyroid, and the ultimobranchial body. Thus, individuals with this syndrome have a variable loss of T cell-mediated immunity (resulting from hypoplasia or lack of the thymus), tetany (resulting from lack of the parathyroids), and congenital defects of the heart and great vessels.Absence of cell-mediated immunity is caused by low numbers of T lymphocytes in the blood and lymphoid tissues and poor defense against certain fungal and viral infections.The T-cell zones of lymphoid organs--paracortical areas of the lymph nodes and the periarteriolar sheaths of the spleen--are depleted.

Buerger's Disease is associated with -,Alcoholism,Smoking,Trauma,Cold environment,"Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) 

Thromboangiitis obliterans is a distinctive disease that is characterized by segmental, thrombosing acute and chronic inflammation of medium-sized and small-sized arteries, and sometimes secondarily extending to veins and nerves.
Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarette-smoking persons.
It is more common in men but the incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women.
Buerger disease is associated with HLA -5 and HLA-A9.
In thromboangiitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen.
Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation.
Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (arteries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characteristic that is very rare with another form of vasculitis.

Clinical manifestations

Thrombangiitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities.
Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i.e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene.
Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest.

Buerger disease Vs atherosclerosis

Buerger disease is almost exclusively associated with smoking. Atherosclerosis is also associated with smoking, but it has other predisposing conditions also, e.g. diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia etc.

If both parents are sickle cell anemia patients then the likelyhood of off springs having the disease is,10%,25%,50%,100%,"Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person's parents. The most common type is known as sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin (hemoglobin S) found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid, sickle-like shape under ceain circumstances. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain (""sickle-cell crisis""), anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, and stroke. Long term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years. Sickle-cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the haemoglobin gene, one from each parent. This gene occurs in chromosome 11. Several subtypes exist, depending on the exact mutation in each haemoglobin gene.] An attack can be set off by temperature changes, stress, dehydration, and high altitude. A person with a single abnormal copy does not usually have symptoms and is said to have sickle-cell trait. Such people are also referred to as carriers. Diagnosis is by a blood test and some countries test all babies at bih for the disease. Diagnosis is also possible during pregnancy. Refer robbins 9/e p413",D

Gene involved in rett syndrome,P53,MECP2,RB,BRCA,"Rett syndrome (T), originally termed cerebroatrophic hyperammonemia, is a rare genetic postnatal neurological disorder of the grey matter of the brain that almost exclusively affects females but has also been found in male patients. The clinical features include small hands and feet and a deceleration of the rate of head growth (including microcephaly in some). Repetitive stereotyped hand movements, such as wringing and/or repeatedly putting hands into the mouth, are also noted. People with Rett syndrome are prone to gastrointestinal disorders and up to 80% have seizures. They typically have no verbal skills, and about 50% of affected individuals do not walk. Scoliosis, growth failure, and constipation are very common and can be problematic. The signs of this disorder are most easily confused with those of Angelman syndrome, cerebral palsy and autism. Rett syndrome occurs in approximately 1:10,000 live female bihs in all geographies, and across all ethnicities. The syndrome was first described by Austrian neurologist Andreas Rett in 1966.

Primary hyperaldosteronism doesn't lead to ?,Hyperkalemia,Hypernatremia,Hydrogen depletion and metablic alkalosis,Hypeension,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hyperkalemia Clinical manifestations of hvperaldosteronism Excess activation of the mineralocoicoid receptor leads to potassium depletion and increased sodium retention, with the latter causing an expansion of extracellular and plasma volume. Increased ENaC activity also results in hydrogen depletion that can cause metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone also has direct effects on the vascular system, where it increases cardiac remodeling and decreases compliance. Aldosterone excess may cause direct damage to the myocardium and the kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage due to systemic hypeension. Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide drug treatment, which leads to increased delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, thereby driving potassium excretion. Severe hypokalemia can be associated with muscle weakness, ove proximal myopathy, or even hypokalemic paralysis.

Which of the following conditions best explains these findings?",Aplastic anemia,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Chronic blood loss,Iron deficiency anemia,"The marked reticulocytosis and marrow hyperplasia indicate that the marrow is responding to a decrease in RBCs. The reticulocytes are larger RBCs that slightly increase the MCV. Anaplastic marrow is very hypocellular and unable to respond to anemia; it is associated with pancytopenia. The normal Coombs test results exclude autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Iron deficiency impairs the ability of the marrow to mount significant and sustained reticulocytosis. Iron deficiency anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic but could be partially masked here by reticulocytosis, which would not be as marked if iron were not available, but his diet is supplying needed iron. Infiltrative disorders, such as metastases in the marrow, would impair the ability to mount reticulocytosis of this degree.",C

Loss of hetrozygosity associated with,Acute myeloid leukemia,ALL,Retinoblastoma,Promyelocitic leukemia,"Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common malignant cancer of the eye in children, and it is almost exclusively found in young children. Though most children survive this cancer, they may lose their vision in the affected eye(s) or need to have the eye removed. Almost half of children with retinoblastoma have a hereditary genetic defect associated with retinoblastoma. In other cases, it is caused by a congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene, Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a gross chromosomal event that results in loss of the entire gene and the surrounding chromosomal region. Most diploid cells, for example human somatic cells, contain two copies of the genome, one from each parent (chromosome pair); each copy contains approximately 3 billion bases (adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) or thymine (T)). For the majority of positions in the genome the base present is consistent between individuals, however a small percentage may contain different bases (usually one of two; for instance, 'A' or 'G') and these positions are called 'single nucleotide polymorphisms' or 'SNPs'. When the genomic copies derived from each parent have different bases for these polymorphic regions (SNPs) the region is said to be heterozygous. Most of the chromosomes within somatic cells of individuals are paired, allowing for SNP locations to be potentially heterozygous. However, one parental copy of a region can sometimes be lost, which results in the region having just one copy. The single copy cannot be heterozygous at SNP locations and therefore the region shows loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Loss of heterozygosity due to loss of one parental copy in a region is also called hemizygosity in that region.",C

"When stem cells transform to form cells characteristic of other tissues, the process is called as -",De-differentiation,Re-differentiation,Trans-differentiation,Sub-differentiation,"Transdifferentiation 

Transdifferentiation takes place when a non-stem cell transforms into a different type of cell, or when an already differentiated stem cell creates cells outside its already established differentiation.
Remember very important fact that it is the non-stem cell or already differentiated stem cell (i.e. mature cell) that is transformed into another type of cell. It is not stem cell that is transforming.

Transdifferentiation is a type of metaplasia.


Then, what is the difference between transdifferentiation and metaplasia.


In Transdifferentiation only differentiated stem cell is transformed into another cell type, while in metaplasia any of the two, either stem cell or differentiated cell can transform into another cell type.

True about salivary gland tumour is:,MEC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,ACC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,MEC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,ACC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,"Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma is predicated by the location, histopathologic grade, and clinical stage of the tumor. Early-stage tumors of the parotid often can be treated by subtotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Advanced tumors may necessitate total removalÂ of the parotid gland,Â with sacrifice of the facial nerve. Submandibular glandÂ tumors areÂ treated byÂ assured surgical excision. For low-grade neoplasms, only a modest margin of surrounding normal tissue may need to be removed, but high-grade or tumors warrant wider resection, similar to that required for squamous cell carcinomas. IfÂ there is underlying bone destruction, then the involved boneÂ must be excised.Â 
Â 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a relentless tumor that is prone to local recurrence and eventual distant metastasis. Surgical resection is usually the treatment of choice. Adjuvant radiation therapy may slightly improve patient survival in some cases, although recent SEER data suggest that radiation therapy does little to improve prognosis overall. Because metastasis to regional lymph nodes is uncommon (6% to 10% of cases), neck dissection usually is not indicated.Â

Raised iron content is NOT found in which organ in Hemochromatosis -,Heart,Skin,Testis,Pituitary,"In hemochromatosis, hypogonadism is caused by impairment of hypothalamic pituitary function and not due to deposition of Iron in the Testis.
Hemochromatosis

Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas.
The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year.
It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which are hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis, the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one-third of which accumulates in the liver.
The iron accumulation is lifelong, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first manifests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life.
Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissues

The clinical and radiologic presentation are typical; an increased hat size may also be a clue. In its early stages, Paget's disease is characterised by osteolysis, producing patchwork areas of bone resorption with bizarre, large osteoclasts. In the middle stage of the disease, secondary osteoblastic activity compensates with new bone formation, producing the mosaic pattern. In late Paget's, the bones are dense and osteosclerotic. Paget's disease is suspected to be related to prior viral infection, but the cause remains mysterious. Complications include myelophthisic anemia, high output cardiac failure, pain secondary to nerve compression, deformities secondary to skeletal changes, and in about 1% of patients, osteosarcoma or other sarcoma, typically involving the jaw, pelvis, or femur. An increased incidence of astrocytomas is associated with tuberous sclerosis.Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a disease of young adults, although older patients may have the lymphocyte-depleted form.Meningiomas are mostly benign tumors that affect adults, especially females.

Characteristic pathological finding in carcinoid of hea -,Fibrous endocordial thickening of right ventricle andtricuspid valve,Collagen deposition in wall of right ventricle and tricuspid valve,Interstitial fibrous thickening of right ventricle and pulmonic valve,Mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the wall of right atrium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fibrous endocardial thickening of right ventricel and tricuspid valve Carcinoid hea disease o Carcinoid hea disease is the cardiac manifestation of the systemic syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors. o It generally involves the endocardium and valve of the right side of hea. o Cardivascular lesions consist of firm plaque like endocardial fibrous thickenings on the inside surfaces of the cardiac chambers and the tricuspid and pulmonary valves. Occasionally they involve the major blood vessels of the right side, the inferior vena cava and the pulmonary aery. o These plaque like thickenings are composed predominantly of smooth muscle cells and sparase collagen fibres embedded in an acid mucopolysaccharide-rich matrix materials. Elastic fibers are not present in the plaque. The most common cardiac manifestation is tricuspid regurgitation. Stenosis of right sided valve may also develop. Why does right sided hea involvement more common ? o Carcinoid tumors produce a variety of bioactive products that produce these (above described) hea lesions. o Among these, serotonin is most impoant. Serotonin is inactivated during its passage through lung. o As you all know, left side of hea recieve blood from pulmonary circulation, left sided hear lesions are uncommon (Because serotonin has already been metabolized in lung). Similarly, gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors do not induce carcinoid hea disease (neither right nor left) as bioactive mediators released into the poal circulation are metabolized in the liver. o Therefore carcinoid hea disease is produced by tumors that have extensive hepatic metastasis (liver releases the mediators directly into IVC) or carcinoid tumors of organs that are outside poal circulation (e.g., ovary). Left sided hea involvement o Left sided hea involvement occurs only under unusual circumstances. 1.Patent foramen ovale Blood containing serotonin passes from right to left shunt. 2.Primary or metastatic carcinoid tumor of lung --) Pulmonary circulation deliveres serotonin directly to left side of hea. 3.Use of drugs that have serotonergic activity e.g., fenfluramine, phenteramine, methylsergide or ergotamine.",A

Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of a1.-antitrypsin.o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall,o As a,-antitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratoiy bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemaB. Pathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages,o So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role,o Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolvticallv digest this antiprotease,o Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema.o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione),o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate a(-antitrypsin, resulting in functional a,- antitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.",A

The cancer involves dermal lymphatics and therefore has a high incidence of systemic metastasis and a poor prognosis. If the lymphatics become blocked, then the area of skin may develop lymphedema and ""peau d'orange"" or orange peel appearance. The overlying skin in inflammatory breast cancer is usually swollen, red, and tender. Acute inflammation is a rare finding in breast cancer and may be associated with secondary infection or abscess. Chronic inflammation in breast cancer is a non-specific finding. In medullary breast cancer, a type of invasive ductal carcinoma, there are a large number of lymphocytes around the tumor and a desmoplastic reaction is often absent in the surrounding tissue. This type of cancer carries a somewhat better prognosis. Epidermal invasion by cancer cells is a poor prognostic indicator. Intraepidermal malignant cells are called Paget cells.

They are scattered throughout the lung parenchyma but are initially more often located in the upper zones of the lungs. These nodular lesions frequently have simultaneous deposition of coal-dust and may develop calcification. The pleura is grossly thickened and adherent to the chest wall. There may be similar fibrotic nodules on the pleura and within the regional lymph nodes. The nodular lesions are detectable as egg-shell shadows in chest X-rays. The lesions may undergo ischaemic necrosis and develop cavitation, or be complicated by tuberculosis and rheumatoid pneumoconiosis Histologically, The following features are observed 1. The silicotic nodules are located in the region of respiratory bronchioles, adjacent alveoli, pulmonary aeries, in the pleura and the regional lymph nodes 2. The silicotic nodules consist of central hyalinised material with scanty cellularity and some amount of dust. The hyalinised centre is surrounded by concentric laminations of collagen which is fuher enclosed by more cellular connective tissue, dust-filled macrophages and a few lymphocytes and plasma cells. Some of these nodules may have calcium deposits. 3. The collagenous nodules have cleft-like spaces between the lamellae of collagen which when examined polariscopically may demonstrate numerous birefringent paicles of silica. 4. The severe and progressive form of the disease may result in coalescence of adjacent nodules and cause complicated silicosis similar to progressive massive fibrosis of coal-workers' pneumoconiosis (described above). 5. The intervening lung parenchyma may show hyperinflation or emphysema.. 6. Cavitation when present may be due to ischaemic necrosis in the nodules, or may reveal changes of tuberculosis or rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan's syndrome), discussed already.",A

Which of the following features is not shared between âT cellsâ and B cellsâ?,Antigen Specific Receptors,Class I MHC Expression,Positive selection during development,All of the above,"This appeared to be a tough question but let us analyze all the options step wise.

Both B cells and T cells have antigen specific receptors. T cells have an antigen specific T cell receptor (TCR) composed of a and b polypeptide chains in 95% cases to bind with the antigen. B cells have a B cell receptor (BCR) having unique antigen specificity composed of IgM and IgD on their surface to bind with the antigen.
Since MHC I is expressed on all the nucleated cells, so, it is likely to be present on both âBâ as well as âTâ cells. As discussed in our accompanying DVD on Immunology, the T cells undergo both negative and positive selection. Both these are described below:
Positive selection: T cells in the thymic cortex are allowed to survive only if their T cell receptor has affinity for the MHC molecule. If the T cells do not have any affinity for the MHC molecule, they are programmed to die. This is important because only if this affinity is present, the T cells can interact with the antigen presenting cells. So, positive selection is required for self MHC restriction.
Negative selection: T cells come in the thymic medulla after being already positively selected in the thymic cortex. In the medulla, if a T cell has affinity for âself antigensâ, they are eliminated. This is called as negative selection. It is therefore required for the self tolerance.
Similar to the negative selection of the T cells, the B cells may also recognize âself antigensâ in the bone marrow. In this situation, the B cell undergoes antigen receptor gene rearrangement so as to express new antigen receptors. These new receptors are designed as to not recognize âself antigensâ. This process is described as âreceptor editingâ. If because of any reason receptor editing does not take place, the B cells undergo apoptosis. This is the negative selection of B cells in the bone marrow.",C

"Two siblings with osteogenesis imperfect, but their parents are normal. Mechanism of inheritance is -",Anticipation,Genomic imprinting,Germ line mosaicism,New mutation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Germ line mosaicism o In some autosomal dominant disorders (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta) phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected child. This clearly violates the law of inheritance. Studies indicate that gonadal (germ line) mosaicism may be responsible for such unusual inheritance. Germline mosaicism o Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. o Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. o A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. o Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. o Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation.",C

"During heterosexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing HIV contacts vaginal squamous mucosa. Cells capture virions and transport the virus via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Within the germinal centers of these lymph nodes, the virions infect CD4+ lymphocytes and proliferate, causing CD4+ cell lysis with release of more virions, which are taken up on the surface of cells having Fc receptors, allowing continued infection by HIV of more CD4+ cells passing through the nodes. Which of the following types of cells is most likely to capture HIV on its surface via Fc receptors?",B lymphocyte,CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte,Follicular dendritic cell,Natural Killer cell,"Dendritic cells are a form of antigen-presenting cell. Dendritic cells in epithelia are known as Langerhans cells, and those within germinal centers are called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. They have cell surface Fc receptors that capture antibody-coated HIV virions through the Fc portion of the antibody. These virions attached to the FDCs can infect passing CD4+ lymphocytes. Dendritic cells elaborate type I interferons that up-regulate antiviral proteins in neighboring cells. B cells are a component of humoral immunity, and antibody to HIV does not serve a protective function, but allows serologic detection of infection. CD8+ cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that lack the receptor necessary for infection by HIV. Because they survive selectively, the CD4+:CD8+ ratio is reversed so that it is typically less than 1 with advanced HIV infection. Innate lymphoid cells resemble NK cells, but shape further lymphoid reactions. Langhans giant cells are ""committees"" of activated macrophages that are part of a granulomatous response. Macrophages are a type of antigen- presenting cell that can become infected by HIV without destruction.

âAschoff bodiesâ are seen in:,Rheumatoid arthritis,Rheumatic fever,Bacterial endocarditis,Marantic endocarditis,"Rheumatic fever (RF)
Morphology

During acute RF, focal inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.
Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytesÂ (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cellsÂ (Pathognomonic for RF).
These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin isÂ disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation ""caterpillar cells""), and may becomeÂ multinucleated.
During acute RF,Â diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of theÂ heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis).
Inflammation of the endocardium and the left sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis withinÂ the cusps or along the tendinous cords.
Overlying these necrotic foci are small (1 - to 2- mm) vegetations, called verrucae,Â along theÂ lines of closure.
Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings calledÂ MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium.

Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease

The changes of the mitral valve in are:


Leaflet thickening
Commissural fusion
Shortening, thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords


In chronic disease, the mitral valve is virtually always involved
The mitral valve is affected alone in 65% to 70% of cases, and along with the aortic valve in another 25%Â of cases.
Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create ""fish mouth"" or âbuttonholeâÂ stenoses.",B
"Toll like receptors, recognize bacterial products and stimulates immune response by -",Perforin and granzyme mediated apoptosis,FADD ligand apoptosis,Transcriptions of nuclear factor mediated by NFKb which recruits cytokines,Cyclin,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system. They are single, membrane-spanning, non-catalytic receptors usually expressed in sentinel cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes. Once these microbes have breached physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs, which activate immune cell responses. The TLRs include TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLR10, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13, though the latter two are not found in humansThe ability of immune system to recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens is, in pa, due to the presence of Immune receptors called toll-like receptors (TLRs) that are expressed on the membranes of leukocytes including dendritic cells, macrophages, natural killer cells, cells of the adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) and non immune cells (epithelial and endothelial cells, and fibroblasts). The binding of ligands - either in the form of adjuvant used in vaccinations or in the form of invasive moieties during times of natural infection - to the TLR marks the key molecular events that ultimately lead to innate immune responses and the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Upon activation, TLRs recruit adapter proteins (proteins that mediate other protein-protein interactions) within the cytosol of the immune cell in order to propagate the antigen-induced signal transduction pathway. These recruited proteins are then responsible for the subsequent activation of other downstream proteins, including protein kinases (IKKi, IRAK1, IRAK4, and TBK1) that fuher amplify the signal and ultimately lead to the upregulation or suppression of genes that orchestrate inflammatory responses and other transcriptional events. Some of these events lead to cytokine production, proliferation, and survival, while others lead to greater adaptive immunity. If the ligand is a bacterial factor, the pathogen might be phagocytosed and digested, and its antigens presented to CD4+ T cells. In the case of a viral factor, the infected cell may shut off its protein synthesis and may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Immune cells that have detected a virus may also release anti-viral factors such as interferons. Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an impoant link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.

Most common type of malignancy of stomach is:September 2007,Adenocarcinoma,Squamous carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,Lymphoma,"Ans. A: AdenocarcinomaGastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%).Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria.Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate.Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"".Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma).Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A

"All of the following are examples of tumor markers, except -",Alpha-HCG(aHCG),Alpha-Feto protein,Throglobulin,ss2-microglobulin,"Reference :Robbins basic pathology 9th edition pg no 225 : Tumor Markers Biochemical assays for tumorassociated enzymes, hor mones, and other tumor markers in the blood cannot be utilized for de nitive diagnosis of cancer; however, they can be useful screening tests and in some instances have utility in quantitating the response to therapy or detecting disease recurrence. The application of these assays is con sidered with many of the speci c forms of neoplasia dis cussed in other chapters, so only a few examples suf ce here. PSA, used to screen for prostatic adenocarcinoma, may be one of the most frequently and successfully used tumor markers in clinical practice. Prostatic carcinoma can be suspected when elevated levels of PSA are found in the blood. However, PSA screening also highlights problems encountered with use of viually every tumor marker. Although PSA levels often are elevated in cancer, PSA levels also may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (Chapter 17). Fuhermore, there is no PSA level that ensures that a patient does not have prostate cancer. Thus, the PSA test suffers from both low sensitivity and low speci city. PSA assay is extremely valuable, however, for detecting residual disease or recurrence following treatment for prostate cancer. Other tumor markers occasionally used in clinical practice include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is elaborated by carcinomas of the colon, pancreas, stomach, and breast, and alpha fetoprotein, which is pro duced by hepatocellular carcinomas, yolk sac remnants in the gonads, and occasionally teratocarcinomas and embry onal cell carcinomas. Unfounately, like PSA, both of these markers can be produced in a variety of nonneoplastic conditions as well. Thus, CEA and alpha fetoprotein assays lack both speci city and sensitivity required for the early detection of cancers. As with PSA screening, they are still paicularly useful in the detection of recurrences after excision. With successful resection of the tumor, these markers disappear from the serum; their reappearance almost always signi es the beginning of the end",A
Poorly differentiated carcinoma express-,Cytokeratin,Vimentin,ILA,desmin,"Cytokeratins are proteins of keratin-containing intermediate filaments found in the intracytoplasmic cytoskeleton of epithelial tissue. The term ""cytokeratin"" began to be used in the late 1970s (for example, see ""Intermediate-sized filaments of human endothelial cells"" by Franke, Schmid, Osborn and Weber) when the protein subunits of keratin intermediate filaments inside cells were first being identified and characterizedThe subsets of cytokeratins which an epithelial cell expresses depends mainly on the type of epithelium, the moment in the course of terminal differentiation and the stage of development. Thus this specific cytokeratin fingerprint allows the classification of all epithelia upon their cytokeratin expression profile. Fuhermore, this applies also to the malignant counterpas of the epithelia (carcinomas), as the cytokeratin profile tends to remain constant when an epithelium undergoes malignant transformation. The main clinical implication is that the study of the cytokeratin profile by immunohistochemistry techniques is a tool of immense value widely used for tumor diagnosis and characterization in surgical pathology.",A

Which part of the IgE antibody is responsible for binding to mast cells and basophils?,Light chain,Immunoglobulin fold,Fc region,Complement binding site,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Fc region * IgE primes the IgE-mediated allergic response by binding to Fc receptors found on the surface of mast cells and basophils. Fc receptors are also found on eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages and platelets in humans. There are two types of Fee receptors:A. FceRI (type I Fee receptor), the high-affinity IgE receptor.B. FceRII (type II Fee receptor), also known as CD23, the low-affinity IgE receptor.* IgE can upregulate the expression of both types of Fee receptors. FceRI is expressed on mast cells, basophils, and the antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Binding of antigens to IgE already bound by the FceRI on mast cells causes cross-linking of the bound IgE and the aggregation of the underlying FceRI, leading to the degranulation and the release of mediators from the cells.",C

Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used for ?,Phagocytosis,Complement,T cell,B cell,"Phagocytosis In the previous discussion we have seen that with phagocytosis neutrophils gets activated and there is rapid burst of oxygen consumption and activation of hexose monophosphate shunt. The rapid burst occurs due to rapid activation of the enzyme complex NADPH oxidase which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (0,-). It catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion which is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide and other toxic oxygen products (011-) (free radicals). H.,02 then combines with myeloperoxidase and halide to form an effective antibacterial compound. (HOCC-) Chronic granulomatous disorder Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase system, required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of the four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H202 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Thus the), are not able to kill the bacterias).

Calcitonin is a marker of -,Prostate cancer,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,Pheochromocytoma,Pancreatic cancer,Harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition. medulla carcinoma is a less frequent type derived from para follicular or C cells present in the thyroid. Like normal C cells tumor cells of medullary carcinoma secrete calcitonin the hypo calcimic hormone. So calcitonin is an impoant tumor marker of medullary carcinoma of thyroid. .,B
Wound contraction is mediated by -,Myofibroblasts,Epithelial cells,Collagen,Elastin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., MyofibroblastsWound contraction is a feature of healing by secondary intention. This is the feature that most clearly differentiates primary from secondary healing.Contraction has been ascribed to the presence of myofibroblasis - altered fibroblasts that have the ultrastructual characteristics of smooth muscle cells.In above explanation, I have explained healing in general. Here I am giving brief description of wound healing. Skin wound healingSkin wounds are classically described to heal by primary or secondary intention.A. Healing by primary intentionIt occurs in wounds with opposed edges, e.g., surgical incision.The healing process follows a series of sequantial steps : ?Immediate after incisionIncisional space filled with blood containing fibrin and blood cells.Dehydration of the surface clot forms scab that covers the wound.Within 24 hoursNeutrophils appear at the margins of wound.In 24-48 hoursEpithelial cells move from the wound edges along the cut margin of dermis, depositing basement membrane components as they move.They fuse in the midline beneath the surface scab, producing a continuous but thin epithelium layer that closes the wound.By day 3Neutrophils are largely replaced by macrophages.Granulation tissue progressively invades the incision space.Collegen fibers now present in the margin but do not bridge the incision.ci By day SIncisional space is largely filled with granulation tissue.Neovascularization is maximum.Collegen fibrils become more abundant and begin to bridge the incision.The epidermis recovers its normal thickness.Et During second weekLeukocytes and edema have disappeared.There is continued accumulation of collegen and proliferation of fibroblast.o By the end of first monthScar is made up of a cellular connective tissue devoid of inflammatory infiltrate covered now by intact epidermis.B. Healing by secondary intentionIt occurs in wounds with seperated edges in which there is more extensive loss of cells and tissue.Regeneration of parenchymal cells cannot completely restore the original architecture, and hence abundant granulation tissue grows.Healing by secondary intention differ from primary intention in several respects : ?1. Inflammatory reaction is more intense.2. Much larger amounts of granulation tissue are formed.3. Wound contraction occurs --> Feature that most clearly differentiate secondary from primary healing.Permanent wound contraction requires the action of myolifibroblasts - Fibroblasts that have the ultrastructural characteristic of smooth muscle cells.",A
Which among the following is not a hormonal tumor marker?,b-HCG,Calcitonin,Catacholamine,Neuron specific enolase,"Elevations in Beta-hCG are also found in patients with choriocarcinoma of the uterus, embryonal carcinomas, polyembryomas, mixed cell tumors, and, less commonly, dysgerminomas. Beta-hCG and human placental lactogen (hPL) are the most useful markers for trophoblastic disease. Calcitonin plays an impoant role as a tumor marker in monitoring patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and in the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. Urinary and plasma catecholamines epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), homovanillic acid (HVA) are the tumor markers for pheochromocytoma. NSE is not a hormone.

Thyrotoxicosis not associated with hypehyroidism is caused by all Except,Granulomatous thyroiditis,Struma ovarii,Factitious thyrotoxicosis,TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma,"Thyrotoxicosis is a hypermetabolic state caused by elevated circulating levels of free T3 and T4. Hypehyroidism is hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. Hypehyroidism is the most common cause of thyrotoxicosis, however, in ceain conditions, the oversupply is related to either excessive release of preformed thyroid hormone (e.g., in thyroiditis) or to an extrathyroidal source, rather than hyperfunction of the gland (Struma ovarii, exogenous intake)In TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, TSH will stimulate the thyroid, so its secondary hypehyroidism.Robbins pathology Pg: 1083",D

The increased pulmonary arterial pressure leads to hypertrophy of the right side of the heart. The large pulmonary arteries show atherosclerosis; the arterioles show plexogenic arteriopathy with a tuft of capillary formations producing a network, or web, that spans the lumens of dilated thin-walled arteries. BMPR2, a cell surface protein belonging to the TGF-b receptor superfamily, causes inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and favors apoptosis. In the absence of BMPR2 signaling, smooth muscle proliferation occurs, and pulmonary hypertension ensues. Inactivating germline mutations in the BMPR2 gene are found in 50% of the familial (primary) cases of pulmonary hypertension and in 26% of sporadic cases. None of the other molecules listed regulate pulmonary arterial wall structure. Endothelial nitric oxide controls vascular caliber. B-type natriuretic peptide and renin regulate sodium and water homeostasis, plasma volume, and systemic arterial pressure. Mutation in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) occurs in Marfan syndrome.

Chronic granulomatous disease results from inherited defects in the genes encoding components of phagocyte oxidase, which generates superoxide (O2* -). The most common variants are an X-linked defect in one of the membrane-bound components (gp91phox) and autosomal recessive defects in the genes encoding two of the cytoplasmic components (p47phox and p67phox). The name of this disease comes from the macrophage-rich chronic inflammatory reaction that tries to control the infection when the initial neutrophil defence is inadequate. This often leads to collections of activated macrophages that wall off the microbes, forming granulomas.

Inherited coagulation disorder is all except -,Protein C deficiency,Protein S deficiency,Leiden mutation,Lupus anticoagulant,"Primary (inherited) hypercoagulability most often is caused by mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes: Approximately 2% to 15% of whites carry a specific factor V mutation (called the Leiden mutation, after the Dutch city where it was first described). The mutation alters an amino acid residue in factor V and renders it resistant to protein C. A single-nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the 3'-untranslated region of the prothrombin gene is a fairly common allele (found in 1% to 2% of the general population). This variant results in increased prothrombin transcription and is associated with a nearly threefold increased risk for venous thromboses. Less common primary hypercoagulable states include inherited deficiencies of anticoagulants such as antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S; affected patients typically present with venous thrombosis and recurrent thromboembolism in adolescence or early adult life.

Reed Sternberg cells are characteristically seen in: March 2013,Non specific infection,Burkitts lymphoma,Acute myeloid leukemia,Hodgkins lymphoma,"Ans. D i.e. Hodgkins lymphoma Reed-Sternberg cells They are usually derived from B lymphocytes, classically considered crippled germinal center B cells. Seen against a sea of B cells, they give the tissue a moth-eaten appearance. They are named after Dorothy Reed Mendenhall and Carl Sternberg, who provided the first definitive microscopic descriptions of Hodgkin's disease. Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bibbed nucleus (thus resembling an ""owl's eye"" appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli. Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 andCD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 and CD45. The presence of these cells is necessary in the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma - the absence of Reed-Sternberg cells has very high negative predictive value. They can also be found in reactive lymphadenopathy (such as infectious mononucleosis, carbamazepine associated lymphadenopathy) and very often in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. A special type of Reed-Sternberg cells is the lacunar histiocyte, whose cytoplasm retracts when fixed in formalin, so the nuclei give the appearance of cells that lie with empty spaces (called lacunae) between them. These are characteristic of the nodular sclerosis subtype of Hodgkin's lymphoma",D

Endothelial injuryo Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade.o Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis.o After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 andthere is increased permeability to endothelium.o TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression.2. Migration of leukocyteso When VCAM- 1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium.o Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space.o Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells --> formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak.o Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modifiedLDL).Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferationo Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-a and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation.4.

Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",A

Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level.

Pt with mitral stenosis in labour wants analgesia for normal delivery. Which form of Anaesthesia to be used for her?,Inhalational Anaesthesia,Spinal Anaesthesia,Epidural Anaesthesia,Opioids,"Epidural anesthesia during PregnancyCombined spinal-epidural analgesia during labour using intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg produces good analgesia without major hemodynamic changes during the first stage of labour. During the second stage of labour, only the uterine contractile force should be allowed rather than the maternal expulsive effo that is always associated with the Valsalva maneuver. Therefore, the second stage of delivery should be cut sho by instrumentation. Supplementary analgesia for instrumentation with slow epidural boluses of fentanyl and a low concentration of bupivacaine reduces SVR and the cardiac pre-load.One of the major advantages of epidural analgesia is that it can be administered in incremental doses and that the total dose could be titrated to the desired sensory level.This coupled with the slower onset of anesthesia, allows the maternal cardiovascular system to compensate for the occurrence of sympathetic blockade, resulting in a lower risk of hypotension and decreased uteroplacental perfusion.Moreover, the segmental blockade spares the lower extremity ""muscle pump,"" aiding in venous return, and also decreases the incidence of thromboembolic events. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious intravenous administration of crystalloid and administration of small bolus doses of phenylephrine maintain maternal hemodynamic stability.(Refer: William's Obstetrics, 22nd edition, pg no: 483)",C

Chediak Higashi syndrome is characterized by following except -,Is autosomal recessive disorder,Mutation in LYST gene,Effective phagolysosome formation.,Oculocutaneous albinism,"Chediak Higashi syndrome

It is an autosomal recessive disorder.
Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to a mutationÂ in the LYST gene.
This gene provides instructions for making a protein,Â known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. ThisÂ protein plays a role in transport of materials into lysosomes.
Lysosomes contain several enzymes. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break downÂ several toxins.
During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming a phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes areÂ formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.
MutationÂ in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and functionÂ of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannotÂ fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impairedÂ bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.
As a result, most people with the chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, startingÂ in infancy or early childhood. These infectionsÂ are life-threatening,
Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are alsoÂ affected.
The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes, Dense bodies of platelets, Granules ofÂ Schwann cells.
There are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.
In pigment cells called melanocytes, the melanosome becomes abnormally large so there is reducedÂ productionÂ of melanin. Thus people with Chediak Higashi syndrome have oculocutaneous albinism i.eÂ the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.Â 
Abnormality in platelets produces bleeding disorders.
DefectiveÂ in platelets produce bleeding disorders.
DefectiveÂ granules in Schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy,
Most children with ChediakÂ Higashi syndrome ultimatelyÂ reach a stage of the disorder known asÂ accelerated phase, (lymphoma-like a stage).
This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infectionÂ (E.B.virus). In theÂ accelerated phase, defectiveÂ white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body'sÂ organs.
The accelerated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infectionsÂ and organ failure. They are usually life-threatening and lead to death.",C

MALT lymphomas appear to have similar clinical, pathological and molecular features regardless of organs of origin. The most common cause of ""pro-lymphomatous"" inflammation in the stomach is chronic H. pylori infection, which is found in association with most cases of gastric MALToma.The most striking evidence linking H. pylori gastritis to MALToma is that eradication of the infection with infection with antibiotics induces durable remissions with low rates of recurrence in most patients.",D

On physical examination, the 7-cm area of erythematous skin is tender with a rough, firm surface resembling an orange peel. There is swelling of the right breast, nipple retraction, and right axillary non-tender lymphadenopathy. Excisional biopsy of skin and breast is most likely to show which of the following lesions?",Acute mastitis,Atypical epithelial hyperplasia,Fat necrosis,Infiltrating ductal carcinoma,"The gross appearance of the skin is consistent with the invasion of dermal lymphatics by carcinoma - the so-called inflammatory carcinoma, which is not a histologic type of breast cancer, but a descriptive phrase based upon the gross appearance (peaud'orange) resembling an inflammatory process. Nipple retraction and non-tender axillary lymphadenopathy also suggest invasive ductal carcinoma. Atypical ductal hyperplasia may increase the risk of carcinoma, but it is not capable of invasion and does not produce visible surface skin changes. Acute mastitis may produce pain and swelling, but it is more likely to occur in association with breastfeeding, and as an inflammatory process would be more likely to produce painful lymphadenopathy.

Which of the following cardiac complications may develop in a 33 year old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) because of her underlying condition?,Hemorrhagic pericarditis,Infective endocarditis,Libman-Sacks endocarditis,Mitral valve prolapse,"Libman-Sacks endocarditis affects patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Small granular vegetations consisting of fibrin develop on the undersurface of the leaflets of mitral and aoic valves. Fragments of vegetations may detach, resulting in embolism. Eventually, vegetations heal by organization of fibrin and subsequent fibrosis, leading to distoion of valve leaflets and resultant insufficiency or stenosis. The pathogenesis is unclear but is probably related to thrombotic diathesis. Hemorrhagic pericarditis is usually a consequence of tuberculosis or metastatic spread of cancer to the pericardium. An exudate containing blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, producing pain and a characteristic auscultatory phenomenon known as a pericardial rub. SLE is associated instead with fibrinous pericarditis, which also manifests with chest pain and pericardial rub. Infective endocarditis is prevalent in patients with damaged or prosthetic valves and in intravenous drug abusers. It is associated with formation of bulky, friable vegetations that consist of masses of fibrin, neutrophils, and bacteria. Such vegetations cause extensive destruction of valve leaflets and may release fragments into the bloodstream, with resultant septic embolism. There is no association between SLE and mitral valve prolapse, which is a frequent, usually asymptomatic, valvular abnormality that occurs in 2% to 3% of the general population. Mitral valve prolapse is also associated with Marfan syndrome. Complications include sudden death, thromboembolism, and mitral regurgitation. Ref: Kaul M.S., Tapson V.F., St. Clair E. (2011).

Mutation of which of the following gene is most impoant in paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria-,Decay accelerating factor (DAF),Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL),Glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI),CD8 binding protein,"in PNH ,these GPI(Glycosyl Phosphatidyl Inositol) -linked proteins are deficient because of somatic mutations that inactivate PIGA.PIGA is X linked and subject to lyonisation.PNH stems from acquired mutations in gene PIGA, which is required for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG), a membrane anchor that is a component of many proteins. Without the ""PIG-tail,"" these proteins cannot be expressed on the cell surface. The affected proteins include several that limit the activation of complement. As a result, PIGA-deficient precursors give rise to red cells that are inordinately sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. Leukocytes are also deficient in these protective pro- teins, but nucleated cells are generally less sensitive to com- plement than are red cells, and as a result the red cells take the brunt of the attack. The paroxysmal nocturnal hemolysis that gives the disorder its name occurs because the fixation of complement is enhanced by the slight decrease in blood pH that accompanies sleep (owing to CO2 retention). However, most patients present less dramatically with anemia due to chronic low-level hemolysis. Another complication that is often serious and sometimes fatal is venous throm- bosis. The etiopathogenesis of the prothrombotic state is somehow also related to the activity of the complement membrane attack complex, as inhibitors of this complex (described below) greatly lessen the incidence of thrombosis. Because PIGA is X-linked, normal cells have only a single active PIGA gene, mutation of which is sufficient to give rise to PIGA deficiency. Because all myeloid lineages are affected in PNH, the responsible mutations must occur in an early myeloid progenitor with self-renewal capacity. Remarkably, many normal individuals harbor small numbers of bone marrow cells bearing PIGA mutations identical to those that cause PNH. It is believed that clinically evident PNH occurs only in rare instances in which the PIGA mutant clone has a survival advantage. One setting in which this may be true is in primary bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), which most often appears to be caused by immune-mediated destruction or suppression of marrow stem cells. It is hypoth- esized that PIGA-deficient stem cells somehow escape the immune attack and eventually replace the normal marrow elements. Targeted therapy with an antibody that inhibits the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex is effective at diminishing both the hemolysis and the thrombotic complications, but also places patients at high risk for Neisseria infections, includ- ing meningococcal sepsis.

Platelet aggregation studies reveal a normal platelet response to ristocetin, but with other substances (including collagen, ADP, and epinephrine), this patient's platelets exhibit a primary wave defect. Based on these findings, this patient most likely has",Afibrinogenemia,Bernard-Soulier syndrome,Glanzmann's thrombasthenia,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,"Platelet aggregation refers to platelets binding to other platelets. One mechanism for this involves fibrinogen, which can act as a molecular bridge between adjacent platelets by binding to GpIIb and GpIIIa receptors on the surface of platelets. Abnormalities of platelet aggregation (aggregation defects or primary wave defects) include Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and afibrinogenemia. Patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a deficiency of GpIIb-IIIa and defective platelet aggregation. Patients with low or no fibrinogen levels characteristically have prolonged PT, PTT, and TT values: in fact, they are so prolonged they are unmeasurable. In contrast to platelet aggregation, platelet secretion refers to the secretion of the contents of two types of granules within the platelet cytoplasm. a granules contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor, while dense bodies contain ADP, ionized calcium, histamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Decreased platelet secretion (activation defects) is seen with deficiencies of these granules; these diseases are called storage pool defects. They can involve either a granules (gray platelet syndrome) or dense bodies (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or TAR). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (small platelets), and immunodeficiency consisting of decreased levels of IgM and progressive loss of T cell function.These patients have recurrent infections with bacteria, viruses, and fungi. TAR refers to the combination of thrombocytopenia and absent radii. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",A

These clinicopathologic findings are best explained by which of the following mechanisms of disease?",Anti-insulin antibodies,Increased peripheral insulin uptake,Irregular insulin secretion,Peripheral insulin resistance,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from a complex interplay between underlying resistance to the action of insulin in its metabolic target tissues (liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue) and a reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which fails to compensate for the increased demand for insulin. In obese persons, the release of inhibitory mediators from adipose tissue interferes with intracellular signaling by insulin. Hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance also downregulates the number of insulin receptors on the plasma membrane. The other choices have not been related to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.Diagnosis: Diabetes mellitus, type 2",D

Which of the following pulmonary condition is associated with widespread formation of hyaline membranes in the alveolar cavities?,Asthma,Bacterial pneumonia,Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis,Diffuse alveolar damage,"Diffuse alveolar damage, clinically referred to as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is characterized by diffuse damage to the alveolar/capillary barrier, which may result from diverse acute conditions. The four most frequent causes are trauma, sepsis, shock, and gastric aspiration. The pathogenesis is not entirely clear, but influx of neutrophils and release of cytokines, eicosanoids, and free radicals seem to be crucial in promoting alveolar damage. The most characteristic histopathologic hallmark of diffuse alveolar damage is formation of hyaline membranes within the alveolar cavities. These consist of proteinaceous material of plasma origin and necrotic debris from desquamated epithelium. The condition has a 60% moality and manifests with acute respiratory failure.Also Know:The pathologic features of asthma are relatively nonspecific and are similar, for example, to those of chronic bronchitis, including chronic inflammatory infiltration, hyperplasia of mucous glands, and hyperophy of smooth muscle. The presence of numerous eosinophils, however, is more characteristic of asthma. Bacterial pneumonia is characterized by intra-alveolar exudation of neutrophils, fibrin, and erythrocytes. Bacteria are also present within the alveolar cavities. Desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) is a form of interstitial disease referred to as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In contrast to usual interstitial pneumonitis (another form of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), DIP is more responsive to steroid treatment. Histopathologically, DIP leads to hyperplasia of pneumocytes and accumulation of histiocytes that fill the alveolar cavities. Ref: Levy B.D., Choi A.M. (2012). Chapter 268.

The tip-offs in the description are the references to compressed glands and lobular orientation. Sclerosing adenosis is a common component of fibrocystic disease, and occurs when fibrosis distos the normal lobular architecture. The result can be some fairly bizarre, but completely benign, compressed glands that may mimic carcinoma on both frozen and permanent sections. Low power examination is often helpful, as this emphasizes the lobular character of the lesion. Note: Lesions actually involving the epithelium of the duct system typically have multiple layers of cells and range from usual ductal hyperplasia (with low risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by the presence of both myoepithelial cells and epithelial cells within the duct) through atypical ductal hyperplasia (with medium risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by ductal carcinoma in situ-like features only involving poions of a duct) to ductal carcinoma in situ (with relatively high risk of invasive carcinoma and characterized by clearly abnormal features such as loss of myoepithelial cells and formation of cribriform patterns involving complete cross-sections of ducts).

(AIIMS November 2013 repeat)'Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results from the substitution of valine from glutamic acid at position 6 of the beta-globin gene (Point mutation). - Ghai 7/e p310Point mutations within coding sequences:A point mutation may alter the code in a triplet of bases and lead to the replacement of one amino acid by another in the gene product.An excellent example of this type is the sickle mutation affecting the B-globin chain of hemoglobinQ. Here the nucleotide triplet CTC (or GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in mRNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia.Sickle Cell DiseaseSickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descend.Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of B-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ.In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ.Pathogenesis:HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated.Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form.With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ.Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestationsChronic hemolysisQMicrovascular occlusionsQTissue damageQMorphology:Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, retieulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants).The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ.Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in x-raysQ.Increased breakdown of hemoglobin can cause pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemiaQ.Splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage (autosplenectomy)Q",A

An ultrasound is performed, and shows a mass in the uterine fundus. A hysterectomy is performed, and pathologic examination of the removed uterus reveals a malignant tumor of the endometrial glands and stroma. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Endolymphatic stromal myosis,Endometrial carcinoma,Endometrial stromal sarcoma,Malignant mixed mullerian tumor,"Malignant mixed mullerian tumor is a tumor with 2 components, stromal and epithelial (endometrial glands), both of which are malignant. This is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that has a 25% 5-year survival rate. It usually affects older patients and presents with postmenopausal bleeding. The stromal component can contain metaplastic components such as cailage and bone. Interestingly, usually only the epithelial component metastasizes. Endolymphatic stromal myosis is a type of endometrial stromal tumor of intermediate malignancy. It appears as small pieces of stroma between myometrial bundles that infiltrate lymph channels. Patients may have pain or bleeding, or may be asymptomatic. Recurrences happen late in the course of the disease (years) in half of patients and metastasis occurs in 15%. There is no epithelial component, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial carcinoma is a malignancy of the epithelial glandular component of the endometrium. Abnormal bleeding is the usual presentation. High estrogen states cause this tissue to proliferate. There is no stromal component of this tumor, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a true sarcoma arising from the endometrial stroma that infiltrates the myometrium and invades vessels. There is no epithelial component. Ref: DeUgae C.M. (2013).

Serologic tests for antithyroid antibodies are negative. Which of the following is an important complication of this patient's endocrinopathy?",Autoimmune hepatitis,Cardiac arrhythmia,Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid,Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid,"Hyperthyroidism refers to the clinical consequences of an excessive amount of circulating thyroid hormone. The principal metabolic products of the thyroid gland are triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine; T4). T4 is principally a prohormone; the major effector of thyroid function is T3. These molecules are formed by the iodination of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin within the follicular cells. Iodinated thyroglobulin is then secreted into the lumen of the follicle. Many patients with nontoxic goiter, usually over the age of 50 years, eventually develop a toxic form of the disease. Since patients with toxic goiter tend to be older, cardiac complications, including atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, dominate the clinical presentation.Diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism, toxic goiter",B

Saponification of fat derived from peripancreatic fat cells exposed to pancreatic enzymes is a typical feature of fat necrosis. Lipase, released from pancreatic acinar cells during an attack of acute pancreatitis, hydrolyzes fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Free fatty acids bind with calcium to form soaps, which is a process known as saponification. Hypocalcemia is a typical finding in patients who had a recent bout of acute pancreatitis.

A fibrous scar gradually replaces the area of myocardial necrosis. Chronic inflammation is typically driven by ongoing stimuli such as persistent infection, autoimmunity, or irritation from endogenous or exogenous chemical agents, and it is not a feature of ischemic myocardial injury. Coagulative necrosis is typical of myocardial infarction, but after 1 month, a scar would be present. The destruction of myocardial fibers precludes complete resolution.

"A 45-year-old male presents with fever, chronic diarrhea, and weight loss. He is found to have multiple pain and swelling of his joints (migratory polyahritis) and generalized lymphadenopathy. Physical examination reveals skin hyperpigmentation. A biopsy from his small intestines reveals the presence of macrophages in the lamina propria that contain PASpositive cytoplasm. The best diagnosis for this individual is",Crohn's disease,Hanup disease,Nontropical sprue,Whipple's disease,"The causes of malabsorption are vast, but in a few cases biopsy specimens of the small intestine may provide clues to a specific diagnosis. Whipple's disease is a systemic disease associated with malabsorption, fever, skin pigmentation, lymphadenopathy, and ahritis. Biopsy of the small intestine typically reveals the lamina propria to be infiltrated by numerous PAS-positive macrophages that contain glycoprotein and rod-shaped bacteria. The organism, Tropheryma whippelii, is a gram-positive actinomycete. The disease responds promptly to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Abetalipoproteinemia is a genetic defect in the synthesis of apolipoprotein B that leads to an inability to synthesize prebetalipoproteins (VLDLs), betalipoproteins (LDLs), and chylomicrons. These individuals have no chylomicrons, VLDLs, or LDLs in their blood. A biopsy of the small intestine reveals the mucosal absorptive cells to be vacuolated by lipid (triglyceride) inclusions, and peripheral smear reveals numerous acanthocytes, which are red blood cells that have numerous irregular spikes on their cell surface. The symptoms of malabsorption may be paially reversed by ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides rather than long-chain triglycerides, because these medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed directly into the poal system and are not incorporated into lipoproteins. Tropical and nontropical (celiac) sprue are both characterized by shoened to absent villi in the small intestines (atrophy). Celiac sprue is a disease of malabsorption related to a sensitivity to gluten, which is found in wheat, oats, barley, and rye. This disease is related to HLA-B8 and to previous infection with type 12 adenovirus. These patients respond to removal of gluten from their diet. Tropical sprue is an acquired disease found in tropical areas, such as the Caribbean, the Far East, and India. It is the result of a chronic bacterial infection. Granulomas in mucosa and submucosa of an intestinal biopsy, if infectious causes have been excluded, are highly suggestive of Crohn's disease. Fibrosis of the lamina propria and submucosa may be seen in patients with systemic sclerosis. Bacterial overgrowth, a result of numerous causes such as the blind loop syndrome, strictures, achlorhydria, or immune deficiencies, may also cause malabsorption. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",D

All are affected in Graft-Versus host reaction :,Skin,>G.I.T,>Liver,>Lung,"Lung Graft versus host disease Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone man-ow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the mayor clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's inunune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant.",D
"Serum marker indicating active viral replication in hepatitis-B is: September 2006, March 2013",HBsAg,HBeAg,HBcAg,HBV DNA,"Ans. B: HBeAg, D: HBV DNA The first detectable viral marker for hepatitis-B is HBeAg, followed by hepatitis B, e-antigen (HBeAg) and HBV DNA. Titers may be high during the incubation period, but HBV DNA and HBeAg levels begin to fall at the onset of illness and may be undetectable at the time of peak clinical illness. Core-antigen does not appear in blood, but antibody to this antigen (anti-HBc) is detectable with the onset of clinical symptoms. The immunoglobulin M (IgM) fraction is used in an impoant diagnostic assay for acute hepatitis B, infection. Before current molecular assays were available, it was the only marker detectable in the window period, the time between the disappearance of HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs. Patients who clear the virus lose HBsAg and develop anti-HBsAb, a long-lasting antibody associated with immunity. The presence of anti-HBsAb and anti-HBcAb (IgG) indicates recovery and immunity in a previously infected individual, whereas a successful vaccination response produces antibody only to HBsAg. HBeAg is another viral marker detectable in blood and correlates with active viral replication and therefore high viral load and infectivity.

True about telomerase:,Has RNA polymerase activity,Causes carcinogenesis,Present in somatic cells,Absent in germ cells,"After each mitosis (cell doubling), there is progressive shortening of telomeres which are the terminal tips of chromosomes.
Telomerase is the RNA enzyme that helps in repair of such damage to DNA and maintains normal telomere length in successive cell divisions. However, it has been seen that after repetitive mitosis for a maximum of 60 to 70 times, telomeres are lost in normal cells and the cells cease to undergo mitosis.
Telomerase is active in normal stem cells, but not in normal somatic cells.
Cancer cells in most malignancies have markedly upregulated telomerase enzyme, and hence telomere length is maintained. Thus, cancer cells avoid ageing, mitosis does not slow down or cease, thereby immortalising the cancer cells.

Gene silencing RNA,rRNA,tRNA,miRNA,None,"A microRNA (abbreted miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule (containing about 22 nucleotides) found in plants, animals and some viruses, that functions in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. While the majority of miRNAs are located within the cell, some miRNAs, commonly known as circulating miRNAs or extracellular miRNAs, have also been found in extracellular environment, including various biological fluids and cell culture media. Encoded by eukaryotic nuclear DNA in plants and animals and by viral DNA in ceain viruses whose genome is based on DNA, miRNAs function base-pairing with complementary sequences within mRNA molecules. As a result, these mRNA molecules are silenced, by one or more of the following processes: Cleavage of the mRNA strand into two pieces, Destabilization of the mRNA through shoening of its poly(A) tail, and Less efficient translation of the mRNA into proteins by ribosomes. miRNAs resemble the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form sho hairpins, whereas siRNAs derive from longer regions of double-stranded RNA. The human genome may encode over 1000 miRNAs, which are abundant in many mammalian cell types[ and appear to target about 60% of the genes of humans and other mammals",C

So, how is it possible for hypogammaglobulinemia to occur in multiple myoloma.J In about one quaer of patients with multiple myeloma only light chains are produced. These light chains are called Bence Jones protein. The characteristic feature of these light chains is that they are very small and are rapidly excreted in the urine. So all the abnormal immunoglobulin that is secreted in multiple myeloma is excreted.o Another point, which should be kept in mind is that the normal plasma cells in a patient with myeloma are not capable of immunoglobulin synthesis. So a situation develops where all the abnormally synthesized immunoglobulin by the neoplastic cells is excreted where as the remaining normal plasma cells are incapable of normal immunoglobulin synthesis. Thus, there is little immunoglobulin left in the serum causing hypogammaglobulinemia.o Renal failure may occur because of hypercalcemia, damage by Bence Jones protein, urate nephropathy an Amyloidosis (AL type).o ESR is increased due to hyperviscosity.",D

Increased numbers of Hyaline casts can occur with exercise, heat exposure, dehydration, fever, congestive heart failure and diuretic.

Renal tubular epithelial cell casts -

These casts results when the epithelial cells of the renal tubules are being excreted along with the casts.
Renal tubular epithelial casts are most suggestive of tubular injury as in acute tubular necrosis.
They are also found in other disorders including eclampsia, heavy metal poisoning, ethylene glycol intoxication (most of these cases lead to acute tubular necrosis).

Granular casts -

These casts are fairly common and occur in both pathological and non-pathological condition.
Granular casts can result either from the breakdown of cellular casts to a point where the cells that once were within them are no longer distinguishable or they can result from the inclusion of aggregates of plasma proteins, fibrinogen or immune complexes within the cast upon formation.
They can be further divided into coarse granular casts and fine granular casts.
Fine granular casts can appear in non-pathological conditions such as vigorous exercise, but the presence of coarse granular cast is abnormal and presents in wide variety of clinical diseases.
They are common in renal parenchymal disease.

Broadcasts -

These casts originate from dilated chronically damaged tubules or the collecting ducts, therefore, they are called renal failure casts. 
These are formed in collecting duct as a result of urinary stasis.
Broadcasts are two to six times the size of other types of casts.
Broadcasts or renal failure casts are usually seen in patients with advanced renal failure.

Dystrophin links the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton to the exterior of the cell through a transmembrane complex of proteins and glycoproteins that binds to laminin. Dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers thus lack the normal interaction between the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix. This disruption may be responsible for the observed increased osmotic fragility of dystrophic muscle, the excessive influx of calcium ions, and the release of soluble muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase into the serum. The other proteins are not altered in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Diagnosis: Duchenne muscular dystrophy",C
Which of the following condition(s) are associated with raised ANCA except,Wegener's granulomatosis,Polyaeritis Nodosa,Microscopic Polyangitis,Churg-Strauss syndrome,"Many patients with vasculitis have circulating antibodies that react with neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens, so-called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). ANCAs are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies directed against constituents (mainly enzymes) of neutrophil primary granules, monocyte lysosomes, and endothelial cells. ANCAs are very useful diagnostic markers; their titers generally mirror clinical severity, and a rise in titers after periods of quiescence is predictive of disease recurrence. PR3-ANCAs are associated with Wegener granulomatosis. MPO-ANCAs are associated with microscopic polyangiitis and Churg-Strauss syndrome. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no.350)",B

"On Stopping Alcohol, all the following changes are reversible EXCEPT",Hepatitis,Cirrhosis,Microvesicular fatty change,Macrovesicular fatty change,"Alcoholic steatofibrosis. Alcoholic hepatitis is often accom- panied by prominent activation of sinusoidal stellate cells and poal fibroblasts, giving rise to fibrosis. Fibrosis begins with sclerosis of central veins. Perisinusoidal scar then accumulates in the space of Disse of the centrilobular region, spreading outward, encircling individual or small clusters of hepatocytes in a chicken wire fence pattern (Fig. 18-19). These webs of scar eventually link to poal tracts and then begin to condense into central-poal fibrous septa. With developing nodularity, cirrhosis becomes established. When alcohol use continues without interruption over the long term, the continual subdivision of established nodules by new webs of, perisinusoidal scarring leads to a classic micronodular or Laennec cirrhosis first described for end-stage alcoholic liver disease (Fig. 18-21). Early stages of scarring can regress with cessation of alcohol use, but the faher along toward cirrhosis the liver gets, the more vascular derangements prevent a full restoration of normal.

There are three primary types of mesothelioma: Malignant pleural mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the lungs (pleura) Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) Malignant pericardial mesothelioma - occurs in the lining of the hea (pericardium)Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory and scarring disease affecting the tissue of the lungs. People with the condition may experience severe shoness of breath and are at an increased risk for ceain cancers, including lung cancer and, less commonly, mesothelioma. Asbestosis specifically refers to fibrosis within the lung tissue from asbestos, and not scarring around the outside of the lungs. It is caused by the breathing in and retention of asbestos fibers. It usually occurs after high intensity and/or long-term exposure to asbestos (paicularly in those individuals working on the production or end-use of products containing asbestos) and is therefore regarded as an occupational lung disease.

Electron-microscopic examination of these histiocytes is most likely to reveal the presence of:,Birbeck's granules in the cytoplasm,Myelin figures in the cytoplasm,Parallel rays of tubular structures in lysosomes,Electron dense deposit in the mitochondria,"PAS stain is a widely used stain which gives positive reaction with glycogen (primarily) and non glycogen substances like glycoprotein, glycolipids, proteoglycans and neutral mucins. Whether the PAS positivity of a paicular cell is due to presence of glycogen or due to latter can be differentiated with diastase (glycogen digesting enzyme). If the cell is PAS positive due to glycogen, the pretreatment with diastase will make it PAS negative. But if the cell is PAS positive due to non glycogen substances, the cell will retain its PAS positivity even after pretreatment with diastase. So, in the given question, the presence of PAS positive and diastase resistant material indicates presence of non glycogen substances. * The clinical feature of delayed milestones and hepatosplenomegaly in 1 year old boy is suggestive of some lysosomal storage disorder (like Niemann Picks disease). * This disease is characterized by the presence of large foam cells in bone marrow, liver and spleen.

"If both the parents are carriers of the beta-thalassemia gene, the chance of having a child with thalassemia major in each pregnancy is",25%,50%,75%,100%,"Normally, the majority of adult hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of four protein chains, two a and two b globin chains arranged into a heterotetramer. In thalassemia, patients have defects in either the a or b globin chain, causing production of abnormal red blood cells (In sickle-cell disease, the mutation is specific to b globin). The thalassemias are classified according to which chain of the hemoglobin molecule is affected. In a-thalassemias, production of the a globin chain is affected, while in b-thalassemia, production of the b globin chain is affected. The b globin chains are encoded by a single gene on chromosome 11; a globin chains are encoded by two closely linked genes on chromosome 16 Thus, in a normal person with two copies of each chromosome, two loci encode the b chain, and four loci encode the a chain.Thalassemias are genetic disorders inherited from a person's parents.

Gender: Men are more likely to develop CML, CLL and AML than women.
Age: The risk of most leukemias, with the exception of ALL, typically increases with age.

2) Genetics

Family history: First-degree relatives of CLL patients, or having an identical twin who has or had AML or ALL,Â increases the risk for developing the disease.
Genetic diseases: AML has been associated with Down syndrome,Â Klinefelter syndrome, Patau syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, Ataxia telangiectasia,Â and Kostmann syndrome, may play a role in the development of leukemia.

Redistribution of cytochrome c is pre- vented by overproduction of the apoptotic protein BCL2 and is promoted by the proapoptotic protein BAX.# Occurs during:- Embryogenesis,- Hormone induction (menstruation),- Immune cell - mediated death,- Injurious stimuli (e.g., radiation, hypoxia),- Atrophy (e.g., endometrial lining during menopause).Additional Educational points: GeneAssociated tumor1ablCML2c-mycBurkitt's lymphoma3bcl-2Follicular and undifferentiated lymphomas (inhibits apoptosis)4erb-B2Breast, ovarian, and gastric carcinomas5rasColon carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, thyroid cancer, and AML6L-mycLung tumor7N-mycNeuroblastoma8retMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types It and ill9c-kitGi stromal tumor (GIST)Representative Oncogenes at Chromosomal Translocations Gene (Chromosome)TranslocationMalignancy1ABL(9q34.1)-BCR (22q11)(9;22)(q34;q11)Chronic myelogenous leukemia2ATF1 (12q13)-EWS (22q12)(12;22)(q13;q12)Malignant melanoma of soft parts (MMSP)3BCL1 (11ql3.3)-IgH (14q32)(11;14)(q13;q32)Mantle cell lymphoma4BCL2 (18q21.3)-IgH (14q32)(14;18)(q32;q21)Follicular lymphoma5FLI1 (llq24)-EWS (22q12)(11;22)(q24;q12)Ewing's sarcoma6LCK (lp34)-TCRB (7q35)(1;7)(p34;q35)T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)7C-MYC (8q24)-IgH (14q32)(8;14)(q24;q32)Burkitt's lymphoma, B cell ALL8WT1 (11p13)-EWS (22q12)(11;22)(p13;q12)Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT)9PAX3 (2q35)-FKHR/ALV(13q14)(2;13)(q35;q14)Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma10PAX7 (1p36)-KHR/ALV(13q14)(1;13)(p36;q14)Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma11RET (10q11.2)(10;17)(q11.2;q23)Papillary thyroid carcinomas",D

Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of pannus formation in this patient?",Calcification of the synovium,Chronic inflammation of synovium,Degeneration of cartilage,Dislocation of a portion of bone,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammatory disease in which chronic polyarthritis involves diarthrodial joints symmetrically and bilaterally. Synovial lining cells undergo hyperplasia. The result is a synovial lining thrown into numerous villi and frond-like folds that fill the peripheral recesses of the joint. As the synovium undergoes hyperplasia and hypertrophy, it creeps over the surface of the articular cartilage and adjacent structures. This inflammatory synovium is termed a pannus (cloak). The pannus covers the articular cartilage and isolates it from the synovial fluid. Synovial calcification (choice A) does not occur in RA. Pannus may destroy cartilage (choice C) by depriving it of nourishment.Diagnosis: Rheumatoid arthritis",B

What is true about interferon?,Are specific for individual viruses,Are protective against only viruses,Induce enzyme synthesis in the target cell,Are divided into 5 subtypes,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Induce enzyme synthesis in the target cell o Interferons (IFNs) are a group of signaling proteins, made and released by host cells in response to the presence of several pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and also tumor cellso IFNs belong to the large class of proteins known as cytokines.o IFNs also have various other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages; they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens.o They are typically divided among three classes: Type IIFN, Type IIIFN, and Type III IFN.o In response to interferon, cells produce large amounts of an enzyme known as protein kinase R (PKR). This enzyme phosphorylates a protein known as eIF-2 in response to new viral infections. The phosphorylated eif-2 forms an inactive complex with another protein, called eif2b, to reduce protein synthesis within the cell.",C

Which of the following is the LEAST likely to be associated with gross hematuria?,Acute glomerulonephritis,Renal trauma,Ureteral calculi,Acute cystitis,"Gross hematuria is the term used to describe pink-to-red-tinged urine color due to the presence of a relatively large amount of blood. Although microscopic hematuria is frequently present in acute glomerulonephritis, the total amount of blood in the urine is usually not sufficient to result in gross hematuria. Renal trauma can produce enough damage to the renal vasculature to result in the loss of large amounts of blood into the urine and the development of gross hematuria. Ureteral calculi often present with gross hematuria secondary to injury to the mucosa of the ureter. Similarly, injury to the bladder mucosa in acute cystitis can result in considerable blood loss, hence the expression ""hemorrhagic cystitis"". Necrosis of tumor tissue can result in blood loss from bladder neoplasms, which often present with gross hematuria. Ref: Robbins Basic Pathology, 8th Ed, page 554-559",A

All of the following is true except aEUR',NADPH oxidase acts superoxide ions,Chediak-Higashi syndrome is due to defective phagolysosome,In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected,Myeloperodixase action is mainly due to OCIaEUR',"In Brutons aganunaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected [Ref : Harrison 171h/e p. 381; Bobbin's 7""Ve p. 60, 61, 62, 210, 591 During phagocytosis there is rapid respiratory burst which is brought about by rapid burst in the activity of NADPH oxidase. Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (02-) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (1-1,02) free radical. The 11,0, generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself However, the azurophilic , granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as Cl? conves H202 to hypochlorite (HOCI). Hypochloth'e (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H20,- MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterial. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are ? - Melanosotnes of melanocytes - Dense bodies of platelets - Granules of schwann cells In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour (-)f skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy. More on chediak higashi syndrome Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked disease that occurs mainly in males. It is caused due to defect in the gene Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Bruton's tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in B cell maturation as well as mast cell activation. Defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase leads to failure of maturation of B cells. B cells cannot mature beyond pro B cell stage. In the absence of mature B cell, patient lacks lymphoid tissue and fails to develop plasma cells, (the cells that produce antibodies). Thus there is absence of immunoglobulins of all classes in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia. Germinal centres, where B cells proliferate and differentiate are poorly developed, in all lymphoid tissues including the .spleen, tonsils, adenoids, peripheral lymph nodes. Peyer patches in the intestine are small or absent. Clinical features Patients with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia do not manifest any symptoms till 6 months of life (due to the presence-of maternal antibodies). These patients are susceptible to infections with capsulated bacterias because antibody response is vital to kill encapsulated bacterias. Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, 11 ifluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsoni us). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",C

B: ActinomycetesMycetoma is a chronic localized granulomatous inflammatory lesion common in the tropics and sub-tropics.Multiple siAuses, soft tissue swelling and discharge of coloured granules characterize a mycetoma foot. Chronic sinuses discharging granules are caused by (1) Eumycetes (true fungi), (2) Schizomycetes, which includesActinomycosis (aerobic higher filamentous bacteria) andBotryomycosis (bacterial infection).- Actinomycosis is often caused by Actinomadura or Nocardia species wherein it gains entry after penetrating trauma (splinter, gravel or thorn prick).Young males are commonly affected and 75% of the lesions occur in the lower limbs.The disease slowly progresses from a nodule to multiple sinuses discharging coloured granules. Involvement of bone is late following dermal and soft tissue spread.- Botryomycosis (a misnomer), a chronic suppurative infection is caused by bacteria involving skin or viscera . This rare condition mimics a deep mycotic infection and is often caused by Staphylococcus or Pseudomonas species of bacteria. The feet and hands are commonly affected and penetrating trauma may be a predisposing factor. It usually presents as a nodule, sinus or ulcer, which is initially localized.The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based on clinical findings, demonstration of characteristic granules and culture of the organism from a deep tissue biopsy.Immunological studies (counter immuno electrophoresis and ELISA) are also used. Botryomycosis is diagnosed based on a positive gram's stain and culture; negative fungal cultures and demonstration of the characteristic botryomycotic granules at histopathology from a deep biopsy.In endemic areas, subcutaneous swelling with sinuses should be considered as mycetoma unless proved otherwise.

Classic example of missense mutation -,Thalassemia,Sickle cell disease,Sideroblastic anemia,Hemochromatosis,"Ans. is i.e., Sickle cell diseaseIn sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation.Mutationso A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA.o Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to inherited disease.o Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations.o Mutations may be classified into three categories -1. Gene mutationso The vast majority of mutations associated with hereditary disease are gene mutations.o These may of different types depending w'hether it involves complete gene or single base -(a) Point mutationo A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.o When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine - Transition.o When a purine is substituded by a pyrimidine or vice-versa - Transversion.o This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.o Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.o Example is sickle mutation in which CTC codon in [3-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid is changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.o Another type of point mutation is nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.o Example is [3-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for glutamin is changed to stop codon UAG after point mutation.Deletion and insertionso Deletion or insertion of one or two base lead to alterations in the readi ng frame of the DNA strand - frame shift mutation.o If the number of base pairs invoved is three or a multiple of three ffamshift does not occur (because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.Trinucleotide repeat mutationo Normally a codon is triplet ie trinucleotide.o In this type of mutation a codon, ie trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,o For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. there are 250-4000 tandem repeates of CGG.Chromosome mutationo Result from rearrangement of genetic material that give rise to visible structural changes in the chromosome..Genome mutationo Involves loss or gain of whole chromosome, e.g. monosomy - Turner syndrome, trisomy - Down syndrome.",B

It is thicker than epidermis and supplies the strength and integrity to the skin
It has a rich blood supply
It contains adnexal structures i.e.â Hair follicles, Sebaceous glands, Sweat glands.
The importance of these adnexal structures is that they contain epithelial cells that can proliferate and can heal a partial thickness wound by epithelialisation.

Superficial burns

Involve only epidermis and superficial dermis
The adnexal structures are left intact so they can heal by epithelialisation.

All are features of Intravascular hemolysis except -,Thrombocytopenia,Hemosiderinuria,Decreased haptoglobin,Raised indirect bilirubin,"Hemolytic anemia

Hemolytic anemia is anemia due to hemolysis, i.e. the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.
Hemolytic anemia has the following features -


A shortened red cell lifespan, i.e. premature destruction of red cells.
Elevated erythropoietin level and increased erythropoiesis in the marrow and other sites, to compensate for the loss of red cellsâÂ  characterized by increased reticulocyte count.
Accumulation of the products of hemoglobin catabolism due to an increased rate of red cell destruction.


Hemolysis may occur either inside the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or within the mononuclear phagocytic system of spleen, liver or bone marrow (extravascular hemolysis).

Intravascular hemolysis 

Due to the destruction of RBC, hemoglobin is released into blood â Hemoglobinemia.
Excess of hemoglobin may be excreted by kidney â hemoglobinuria.
Some of the hemoglobin is reabsorbed in kidney and is converted to hemosiderin which is then excreted â hemosiderinuria.
Free hemoglobin in plasma bound to haptoglobin and this complex is rapidly cleared by mononuclear phagocytic system Decreased haptoglobin.
When haptoglobin is depleted, free hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin â methemoglobinemia.
Excess heme groups are catabolized to bilirubin within the mononuclear phagocytic system â Increased indirect bilirubin and jaundice.
LDH is stored in the blood. During hemolysis this enzyme is released in the blood â Increased serum LDH.",A
APC gene is involved in?,Colorectal carcinoma,Gastric carcinoma,Gastric lymphoma,Esophageal adenocarcinoma,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Colorectal carcinoma Molecular pathogenesis of colorectal carcinoma* Two distinct genetic pathways have been described, both of which involve the stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations:1) APC/b-Catenin pathway (Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence)# It accounts for up 80% of sporadic colon tumours. In includes mutation ofAPC early in the neoplastic process. APC protein normally binds to and promotes the degradation of b-catenin. When both copies of the APC gene are inactivate by mutation, loss of APC function results in b-catenin accumulation.# b-catenin translocates to the nucleus where it inactivates the transcription of genes, such as those encoding MYC and Cyclin D1, which promote proliferation. This is followed by additional mutation in K-RASy which also promote proliferation.# Neoplastic progression is also associated with mutation in other tumour suppressur genes such as those encoding SMAD2 and SMAD4, which are effectors of TGF-b signaling. The tumor suppressor p53 is mutated in 70-80% of colon cancers.# Expression of telomerase is also increased as lesions become more advanced.2) Microstatellite instability pathway (DNA mismatch repair deficiency)# Mutations accumulate in microsatellite repeat, a conditions referred to as microsatellite instability.

"A 37-year-old woman has noted an excessively heavy menstrual flow each of the past 6 months.

On admission to the hospital, she has melena and after a transfusion of platelets, her platelet count does not increase. Which of the following describes the most likely basis for her bleeding tendency?",Abnormal production of platelets by megakaryocytes,Defective platelet-endothelial interactions,Destruction of antibody-coated platelets by the spleen,Excessive loss of platelets in menstrual blood,"This patient's bleeding tendency is caused by a low platelet count. She most likely has idiopathic chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in which platelets are destroyed in the spleen after being coated with antibodies to platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX. These antibodies coat both the patient's platelets and any transfused platelets. Because the spleen is the major source of the antibody and the site of platelet destruction, a splenectomy can be beneficial if corticosteroid therapy is not. There is no defect in the production of platelets. Platelet functions are normal in ITP. Chronic blood loss would not lead to thrombocytopenia when normal bone marrow function is present. Abnormal platelet-endothelial interactions are more likely to cause thrombosis. Suppression of pluripotent stem cells gives rise to aplastic anemia, which is accompanied by pancytopenia.",C

In-situ DNA nick end labeling can quantitate ?,Fraction of cells in apoptotic pathways,Fraction of cells in S phase,p53 gene produce,bcr/abl gene,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Fraction of cells in apoptotic pathways In-situ DNA nick and labelling o DNA breaks can be detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate in situ nick end-labeling (TUNEL). o Apoptosis is currently one of the most intensively researched areas of science, and numerous ways exist to measure the process. Among the morphological, biochemical and molecular changes occurring in the dying cells, DNA fragmentation is widely recognized as a hallmark of apoptosis, and its detection is the most common analysis for identifying Apoptosis. o Cleaved chromosal DNA of apoptosis can be detected by in situ DNA nick end-labeling. Caution : One has to keep in mind that these methods are based on the detection of DNA strand breaks. There are rare situations when apoptosis is induced without DNA degradation. Conversely. extensive DNA degradation, even specific to the internucleosomal linker DNA, may accompany necrosis. Thus, one should always use another independent assay, along with the TUNEL method, to confirm and characterize apoptosis.",A

Amyloidosis causes which type of cardiomyopathy?,Constrictive,Restrictive,Hypertrophic,Any of the above,"Ans. B. Restrictive. (Ref. Robbins Basic Pathology 8th/ Table 11-5).Restrictive cardiomyopathy results in a stiff, noncompliant myocardium and can be due to depositions (e.g., amyloidosis and hemochromatosis), increased interstitial fibrosis (e.g., caused by irradiation), or to endomyocardial scarring. Myocarditis results from muscle injury caused by an inflammatory process that may be secondary to infections or immune reactions. Coxsackieviruses A and B are the most common causes in the U.S. Clinically, myocarditis may be asymptomatic, give rise to acute heart failure, or evolve into dilated cardiomyopathy.Cardiomyopathy is a term applied to intrinsic disease of the cardiac muscle; there may be specific causes, or it may be idiopathic. There are three general pathophysiologic categories of cardiomyopathy: dilated (90%), hypertrophic, and restrictive (least common). Dilated cardiomyopathy results in systolic (contractile) dysfunction. It may be acquired, for example, following myocarditis, toxic exposures (e.g., alcohol), or pregnancy (peripartum). In 25% to 35% of cases genetic defects in cytoskeletal proteins are causal. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy results in diastolic (relaxation) dysfunction. The vast majority of cases are due to autosomal dominant mutations in the genes encoding the contractile apparatus, in particular ?-myosin heavy chain.

Because of the wall thinning that accompanies dilation, the ventricular thickness may be less than, equal to, or greater than normal. Mural thrombi are common and may be a source of thromboemboli. By definition there is no primary valve pathology. Microscopically most myocytes are hypertrophied with enlarged nuclei, but many are attenuated, stretched, and irregular. There is variable interstitial and endocardial fibrosis.# The essential gross feature of HCM is massive myocardial hypertrophy without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern of HCM involves disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum relative to the left ventricle free wall (so-called asymmetrical septal hypertrophy). On longitudinal sectioning, the ventricular cavity loses its usual round- to-ovoid shape and ""banana-like"" configuration. The characteristic histologic features in HCM are severe myocyte hypertrophy, myocyte (and myofiber) disarray, and interstitial and replacement fibrosis.# In idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy the ventricles are of approximately normal size or slightly enlarged, the cavities are not dilated, and the myocardium is firm. Biatrial dilation is commonly observed. Microscopically there is interstitial fibrosis, varying from minimal and patchy to extensive and diffuse. Restrictive cardiomyopathy of disparate causes may have similar gross morphology. However, endomyocardial biopsy can reveal disease-specific features (e.g., amyloid, iron overload, sarcoid granulomas).",B
"Fibrinoid necrosis may be observed in all of the following, EXCEPT:",Malignant hypeension,Polyaeritis nodosa,Diabetic glomerulosclerosis,Aschoff's nodule,"Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of connective tissue necrosis seen paicularly in autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatic fever, polyaeritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Collagen and smooth muscle in the media of blood vessels are especially involved. Fibrinoid necrosis of aerioles also occurs in accelerated (malignant) hypeension. Fibrinoid necrosis is characterized by loss of normal structure and replacement by a homogeneous, bright pink-staining necrotic material that resembles fibrin microscopically. Areas of fibrinoid necrosis contain various amounts of immunoglobulins and complement, albumin, breakdown products of collagen, and fibrin. Also Know: Fat Necrosis: Fat necrosis most characteristically occurs in acute pancreatitis when pancreatic enzymes are liberated from the ducts into surrounding tissue. Pancreatic lipase acts on the triglycerides in fat cells, breaking these down into glycerol and fatty acids, which complex with plasma calcium ions to form calcium soaps. Liquefactive Necrosis: Liquefaction of necrotic cells results when lysosomal enzymes released by the necrotic cells cause rapid liquefaction. Lysis of a cell as a result of the action of its own enzymes is autolysis. Liquefactive necrosis is typically seen in the brain following ischemia. Coagulative Necrosis: In this type of necrosis, the necrotic cell retains its cellular outline, often for several days. The cell, devoid of its nucleus, appears as a mass of coagulated, pink-staining, homogeneous cytoplasm. Coagulative necrosis typically occurs in solid organs, such as the kidney, hea (myocardium), and adrenal gland, usually as a result of deficient blood supply and anoxia. It is also seen with other types of injury, eg, coagulative necrosis of liver cells due to viruses or toxic chemicals, and coagulative necrosis of skin in burns. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R.

"In apoptosis, permeabilization of the membrane occurs in",Nuclear membrane,Cytoplasmic membrane,Lysosome,Mitochondrial membrane,"Mitochondria contain several proteins that are capable of inducing apoptosis; these proteins include cytochrome c and other proteins that neutralize endogenous inhibitors ofapoptosis. When cells are deprived of growth factors and other survival signals, or are exposed to agents that damage DNA, or accumulate unacceptable amounts of misfolded proteins, a number of sensors are activated. These sensors are members of the Bcl-2 family called ""BH3 proteins"" (because they contain only the third of multiple conserved domains of the Bcl-2 family). They, in turn, activate two pro-apoptotic members of the family called Bax and Bak, which dimerize, inse into the mitochondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol.( Robbins Basic Pathology, 9th edition, page 18 )",D

Disassociative sensory loss is seen with :,Syringomyelia,Spinal Metastasis,Spinal neurofibroma,Tabes dorsalis,"Ans. is 'a' ie Syringomyelia Syringomyelia is a disease where cavity formation occurs in the spinal cord. As this cavity is usually a extension of the central canal, the Fibres passing from the centre of the spiral cord ie. (Spinothalamic tract) are first to be affected.Spinothalamic tract carries pain & temperature sensation. Therefore these sensation are first to be affected.The tracts which pass from the lateral parts of spinal cord are not affected in the beginning. The sensations carried by these tracts remain intact.So Syringomyelia causes selective loss of pain temperature sensations with sparing of other sensations such as fine touch and proprioception (this is carried by post column which pass in lateral parts of spinal cord) this type of sensory loss is known as dissociative sensory loss.Other important features of SvringomeveliaIn Syringomyelia there is involvement of lower cervical & high thoracic region.The classic presentation is a central cord Syndrome with disassociated sensory loss and areflexic weakness in upper limbs.",A

Normal transferrin is saturated with iron ?,20%,35%,50%,70%,"Ans. is `b' i.e., 35% o In normal individuals, transferrin is about one third saturated with iron, yielding serum iron levels that average 120 g/dl in men and 100 g/dl in women. Serum ferritin o Most of the ferritin is stored is different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow). o Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma. Since plasma ferritin is derived largely form the storage pool of body iron, its level correlate well with body iron stores. i.e., when there is iron depletion, body store of iron is reduced that inturn leads to decrease in plasma ferritin. Transferrin saturation and iron binding capicity 3 Iron is transpoed in the plasma by transferrin. o Normally transferrin is 33% saturated (77% free) with iron, yield serum iron levels that average 100-120 g/dl. So, if serum transferrin will be 100% saturated the serum iron will be 300 g/dl. that means the total iron binding capacity of transferrin is 300 to 350 g/dl. o When iron store is depleted e.g., in iron dificiency anemia, there is increased synthesis of transferrin that results in increased total iron binding capacity. o When iron store is repleted e.g., anemia of chronic disease, there is decreased synthesis of transferrin that results in decreased total iron binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptors Erythroid precursors have receptors for transferrin by which they recieve iron from transferrin that is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. o When erythroid precursors mature, these receptors are shed into plasma and can be masured as serum transferrin receptors concentration. o In iron deficiency state, there is increased erythropoisis in bone marrow --> T concentration of erythroid precursor that results in increased total number of transferrin receptor T serum transferrin receptor concentration.",B

Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern in the pedigree given below-,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,"It is an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance.
The features which suggest the X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance are-
A single abnormal X chromosome is sufficient to express the disease.
All of the female offspringâs of a diseased male XY will receive the abnormal X chromosome and express the disease, whereas none of the male offspring to the diseased father will have the disease (as sons don't receive X chromosome from their father).
A diseased mother can transmit the abnormal X chromosome to both daughter and sons equally.

Important facts 

If a female is transmitting the disease to all offspringâs (both males and females) and a male is not transmitting the disease to any child, it is mitochondrialÂ inheritance.
If a male is transmitting the disease only to daughters (all daughters) and not to the sons whereas female transmit the disease to half daughters and half of the sons, it is X-linked dominant.
If only males are affected in a pedigree, it is likely to be an X-linked recessive disease (females act as carriers; only transmit the disease and themselves remain unaffected).
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to half of the offspringâs, it is an autosomal dominant disorder.
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to one-fourth of the offspringâs, it is likely to be an autosomal recessive disorder.",D

The condition may have an acute onset due to isolated exposure or may be chronic due to repeated low-dose exposure. ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A list of impoant organic (biologic) dusts which may be inhaled to produce hypersensitivity pneumonitis is already given in. The immunologic mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity pneumonitis from any of these causes appear to be either type III immune-complex disease or type IV delayedhypersensitivity reaction. 1. Farmers' lung is the classic example resulting from exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes generated by humid and warm mouldy hay. 2. Bagassosis occurs in individuals engaged in manufacture of paper and cardboard from sugarcane bagasse. Spores of thermophilic actinomycetes grow rapidly in mouldy sugarcane bagasse which are inhaled. 3. Byssinosis is an occupational lung disease occurring in workers exposed to fibres of cotton, flex and hemp for a number of years. The role of immunologic mechanisms in byssinosis is not as clear as in exposure to other organic dusts. 4. Bird-breeders' (Bird-fanciers') lung occurs in pigeon breeders, parrot breeders, chicken farmers and bird-fanciers who are exposed to bird-droppings and danders from their feathers. 5.

Infrarenal abdominal aoa is most frequently affected by the atherosclerotic process and is the most common site of aneurysm formation. Abdominal aoa is more prone to develop aneurysm because it is less elastic, resulting from less elastin and more collagen, and it has higher pulsatile stress compared with ascending aoa. Media of infrarenal aoa in humans has no vaso vasorum, so inner media receive nutrition by diffusion from aoic lumen. Intimal thickening by atherosclerosis disturbs nutrition and hence wall nutrition.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Myositis ossificans,Fibrous dysplasia,Malignant fibrous histiocytoma,Nodular fasciitis,"Myositis ossificans affects young persons and, although it is entirely benign, often mimics a malignant neoplasm. The lesion typically results from blunt trauma to the muscle and soft tissues, usually of the lower limb. Peripheral neovascularization of the resulting hematoma leads in a short time to the formation of bone spicules in the soft tissue because the local environment is similar to that of an initial hematoma in a healing fracture. Because myositis ossificans often occurs near a bone, on radiography, it may be misdiagnosed as a malignant bone-forming tumor.

Which of the following is NOT the role of histamine in acute inflammation?,It mediates increase in vascular permeability,It mediates chemotaxis,Release of pain causing substances,Causes vasoconstriction,"Vasodilation is the most impoant vascular effect of histamine in humans. It involves both H1 and H2 receptors distributed throughout the resistance vessels in most vascular beds. Histamine's effect on small vessels results in efflux of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces and an increase lymph flow, causing edema. The gaps between endothelial cells also may permit passage of circulating cells recruited to tissues during the mast cell response. In the epidermis, it causes itch; in the dermis, it evokes pain, sometimes accompanied by itching. Also know: Triple Response of Lewis: If histamine is injected intradermally, it elicits a characteristic phenomenon known as the triple response. This consists of: A localized red spot within a few seconds and reaches a maximum in 1 minute. A brighter red flush, or ""flare,"" extending around 1 cm developing more slowly. A wheal that is discernible in 1-2 minutes. The initial red spot results from the direct vasodilating effect of histamine (H1 receptor-mediated NO production). The flare is due to histamine-induced stimulation of axon reflexes that cause vasodilation indirectly. The wheal reflects histamine's capacity to increase capillary permeability (edema formation).

"True about telomeres:
(A) Made up of repeated sequence of TTAGGG
(B) Telomerase shortens it
(C) it is shortened in cancer cells,
(D) It is responsible for cell ageing",AD,AB,BC,CA,"""At birth, human telomeres are 15- to 20-kb pairs long and are composed of tandem repeats of a sixnucleotide
sequence (TTAGGG) that associates with specialized telomere-binding proteins to form a Tloop
structure that protects the ends of chromosomes from being mistakenly recognized as damaged. The
loss of telomeric repeats with each cell division cycle causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to
growth arrest (called senescence) when one or more critically short telomeres trigger a p53-regulated
DNA-damage checkpoint response""-Â 

How dividing cells can count their divisions is under intensive investigation. One likely mechanism is
that with each cell division, there is incomplete replication of chromosome ends (telomere shortening),
which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest. Telomeres are short repeated sequences of DNA (TTAGGG)Â present at the linear ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication ofÂ chromosome ends and protecting chromosomal termini from fusion and degradation.
When soma tic cells replicate, a small section ofthe telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres become progressively shortened.
As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The lengths of the telomeres are normally maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase.Â 
Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of
chromosomes The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, thus providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is usually absent in most somatic tissues. Therefore, as cells age, their telomeres become shorter, and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones. Conversely, in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, and telomeres are not shortened,Â 
suggesting that telomere elongation might be an importantâpossibly essentialâstep in tumor formation.
Despite such alluring observations, however, the relationship of telomerase activity and telomeric length
to aging and cancer still needs to be fully established
Germ cells and stem cells both contain active telomerase, but only the germ cells have sufficient levelsÂ of the enzyme to stabilize telomere length completely. Telomerase activation in cancer cells inactivates
the teleomericclock that limits the proliferative capacity of normal somatic cells.",A

HLA is also called Major histocompatibility complex. The histocompatibility antigens (human leukocyte antigens - HLA) are cell surface antigens that induce an immune response leading to rejection of allogrufts. The principal physiologic function of the cell surface histocompatibility molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins for presentation to antigen specific T cells. The histocompatibility antigens are encoded by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes, Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or Human leukocyte antigens complex (HLA complex). - HLA complex of genes is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6. It consists of three separate clusters of genes: HLA Complex [MHC Responses of MHC molecules Class 1 MHC class I molecules bind and process peptide that are derived from proteins synthesized within the cells, e.g. viral protein in viral infected cells and antigen of cancerous cells. These cells (cancerous or virus infected) have a tendency to display unusual, non self antigens on their surface. After binding to MHC-I, these antigens are processed and presented to cytotoxic CD-8 T cells (MHC-I restricted). Cytotoxic CD-8 T cell - MHC I reaction cause -- Graft rejection - Cell mediated cytolysis of viral infected or tumor cells. Class II Class 11 molecules present exogenous antigen (e.g. extracellular microbes, soluble proteins). These antigens are first internalized and undergo proteolytic cleavage in lysosome.

"A 29-year-old female presents with severe pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea). During workup, an endometrial biopsy is obtained. The pathology repo from this specimen makes the diagnosis of chronic endometritis. Based on this pathology repo, which one of the following was present in the biopsy sample of the endometrium?",Neutrophils,Lymphocytes,Lymphoid follicles,Plasma cells,") The endometrium and myometrium are relatively resistant to infections. Therefore, inflammation of the endometrium (endometritis) is rare. The diagnosis of endometritis depends on finding inflammatory cells within the endometrium that are not present during the normal menstrual cycle. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils) are normally present during menstruation, while a stromal lymphocytic infiltrate can be seen at other times during the menstrual cycle. Lymphoid aggregates and lymphoid follicles may also be seen in normal endometrium. Therefore the presence of any of these types of leukocytes is not diagnostic of endometritis. Acute endometritis is usually caused by bacterial infection following delivery or miscarriage and is characterized by the presence of neutrophils in endometrial tissue that is not menstrual endometrium. The histologic diagnosis of chronic endometritis depends on finding plasma cells within the endometrium. All it takes is one plasma cell to make the diagnosis. Chronic endometritis may be seen in patients with intrauterine devices (IUDs), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), retained products of conception (postpaum), or tuberculosis. The latter is characterized histologically by the presence of caseating granulomas with Langhans giant cells. These are secondary causes of chronic endometritis. In a significant number of cases, no underlying cause is found. Decidualized stromal cells are the result of the effects of progesterone and are seen normally in the late secretory phase or in patients who are pregnant. Histologically, these stromal cells contain abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",D

Defect leading to thalassemia lies in -,Haemoglobin,Osmotic fragility,RBC membrane,Platelets,"Disorders of haemoglobin
Disorders of haemoglobin may be of two types : -
1. The qualitative defect of haemoglobin (hemoglobinopathy)

Hemoglobinopathies are disorders of haemoglobin, characterized by a defect that results in the abnormal structure of one of the globin chain of haemoglobin.
Examples are - Sickle cell anemia, HbC, HbE, HbD-Punjab, HbO-Arab, Hb Lepore.

2. The quantitative defect of haemoglobin

These disorders are characterized by a defect that results in a decreased rate of synthesis of one of the globin chain of haemoglobin.

The best prognosis in carcinoma stomach is with -,Superficial spreading type,Ulcerative type,Linitis plastica type,Polypoidal type,"Gastric Carcinoma is classified on the basis of â
1) Depth of invasion
2) Growth patternÂ Â Â Â Â 
3) Histologic subtype

The depth of invasion -

The morphological feature having the greatest impact on clinical outcome ( prognosis) is the depth of invasion.
On the basis of the depth of invasion, stomach cancers are divided into -

A. Early gastric carcinoma (superficial spreading type)

Lesions are confined to the mucosa and submucosa regardless of the presence or absence of perigastric lymph node metastasis.
Has the best prognosis.

B. Advanced gastric carcinoma

A neoplasm that has extended below the submucosa into the muscular wall and spread more widely.â

Growth pattern -

Based on a growth pattern, gastric carcinoma is divided into:-


Exophytic âÂ  Protrusion of tumor mass into the lumen
Flat or depressedÂ Â â There is no obvious tumor mass within the mucosa
Excavated (ulcerative)Â Â â Erosive crater is present in the wall of the stomach .


All the three types may be evident at early or advanced stage --> If evident at an advanced stage, prognosis is poor, and if evident at early stage prognosis is good.
An uncommon fourth type of growth pattern is:-

D. Linitis plastica ( Scirrhous Ca) â Abroad region of the gastric wall or entire stomach is extensively infiltratedÂ by malignancy, creating a rigid, thicked leather bottle stomach. It has the worst prognosis.
Histologic subtypes -

The two most important histologic subtypes are

A. Intestinal type â Composed of neoplastic intestinal glands resmbling those of colonic adenocarcinoma.
B. Diffuse variant â Composed of gastric type of mucous cells, which generally do not form glands. The appearance of the cells is ""Signet ring"" appearance because the mucin in the cell pushes the nucleus to the periphery. It is seen more frequently with E-Cadherin mutation.",A

The histopathological hallmark of Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing vasculitis of small aeries and veins together with granuloma formation which may be either intravascular or extravascular. An impoant point to note, Though it is called granulomatous vasculitis:? - Granulomas in Wegener's .granulomatosis are seen only in lungs or respiratory tract. Granulottm formation is rarely seen in other organs. Other organs, only demonstrate necrotizing vasculitis. So Wegener's granulomatosis can also be defined as Granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tracts together with glomerulonephritis. Robbin's defines Wegener's granulomatosis as ""necrotizing vasculitis"" (not granulomatous vasculitis). According to Robbin's Wegener's granulomatosis is a necrotizing vasculitis characterized by a triad of :? - Acute necrotizing granuloma of upper respiratory tract (ear, nose, sinuses, throat) or the lower respiratory tract. - Necrotizing or granulomatous vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels (e.g. capillaries, venules, aeriole and aeria) most prominent in the lungs and upper airways but affecting other sites as well. - Renal disease in the form of focal necrotizing often crescenteric glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis Wegener's. glomerulonephritis is characterized by ""focal and segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis"".

Which of the following is the most likely condition?",Cat-scratch disease,Hodgkin disease,Reactive non-specific lymphadenitis,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"The history is consistent with Hodgkin disease (HD). Impoant clinical clues include painless lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and generalized pruritus. All forms of lymphoma lead to effacement of the nodal architecture on cut surfaces. In this case, fibrotic bands appear to divide the node into multiple nodules. This finding is suggestive of the nodular sclerosis subtype of HD, which usually affects children and young adults. Fuhermore, the histologic finding of large cells with prominent nucleoli (Reed-Sternberg cells) within a polymorphic cellular background is consistent with HD. Remember that the nodular sclerosis type of HD is characterized by a subtype of Reed-Sternberg cells called lacunar cells. These are similar to classic Reed-Sternberg cells in their large, inclusion-like nucleoli, but appear surrounded by a clear halo (hence the attribute ""lacunar""). Cat-scratch disease is due to a small gram-negative bacillus (Baonella henselae), which is transmitted to humans by a scratch or a bite by a cat. Swelling of lymph nodes develops days after the skin lesion. The history is generally sufficient for diagnosis, but occasionally a lymph node biopsy is performed for confirmation. This reveals characteristic stellate abscesses, which are also seen with tularemia and lymphogranuloma venereum. Reactive non-specific lymphadenitis results in hyperplasia of germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, where maturation of B-cells takes place--follicular hyperplasia. This is probably the most common form of lymphadenopathy in otherwise healthy individuals. However, a careful search of the inciting conditions (dental abscess, skin infection, etc.) must be undeaken before reaching a conclusion of reactive lymphadenitis without histologic analysis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with effacement of lymph node architecture, and replacement by a population of atypical or frankly anaplastic lymphocytes. The presence of a polymorphic cellular background, and especially the finding of Reed-Sternberg cells, excludes non-Hodgkin lymphomas.",B

Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is characterized histologically in the lung by,Asteroid bodies in giant cells within bronchioles,Loose fibrous tissue within bronchioles and alveoli,Multiple rheumatoid nodules within the interstitial tissue,Numerous eosinophils within the walls of the alveoli,"Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a nonspecific reaction to multiple infectious or inflammatory lesions of the lungs. Causes of BOOP include infections (viral and bacterial), chemical toxins, drugs, and collagen vascular diseases. The lungs respond to these agents, causing bronchiolar injury by forming loose, fibrous tissue within the bronchioles (bronchiolitis obliterans) and alveoli (organizing pneumonia). Patients present with cough and dyspnea, and chest x-ray reveals interstitial infiltrates. Patients usually improve gradually, but steroid therapy may be needed. In contrast, asteroid bodies in giant cells are a nonspecific finding but can be found in the noncaseating granulomas of sarcoidosis. Multiple rheumatoid nodules within the interstitial tissue can be seen with rheumatoid ahritis, or might be pa of Caplan's syndrome.

Of these, loss of p16/INK4a is clearly implicated in human melanoma, and experimental evidence also suppos a role for loss of p14/ARF. As already mentioned, p16/ INK4a inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), thus reinforcing the ability of the RB tumor suppressor to block cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. By contrast, p14/ARF enhances the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor by inhibiting MDM2, an oncoprotein that stimulates p53 degradation. CDKN2A is mutated in approximately 10% of sporadic melanomas, and these mutations uniformly abolish the production of p16/INK4a and more variably affect p14/ ARF. However, it is suspected that these mutations are the tip of the ""oncogenic iceberg"" with respect to molec- ular lesions affecting the G1 checkpoint.

Plasma cells produce specific antibodies by the process of?,Class selection,Clonal selection,Isotope selection,Isotope switching,"Clonal selection

B-cells are able to make a specific antibody against a specific antigen. It is due to the presence of specificÂ receptor on B-cells - B-cell receptor (BCR), that is usually an immunoglobulin Ig M or Ig D. An antigenÂ interacts with B-cell that shows best fit by virtue of its BCR. The antigen binds to this receptor, and theÂ B-cell is stimulated to divide and form a clone (clonal selection). This clone of cells will become plasmaÂ cells that will secrete antibody of a particular specificity and same class.
Plasma cells make an antibody of a single specificity, of a single immunoglobulin class and allotype, andÂ of a single light chain type only. An exception is seen in the primary antibody response, when a plasmaÂ cell producing IgM initially, may later be switched to IgG production (called isotype switching or classÂ switching).",B

Antitrypsin deficiency is associated with-,Restrictive lung pathology,Cystric fibrosis,Emphysema,Carcinoma,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., EmphysemaPathogenesis of Emphysema The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i.e. centriacinar and panacinar.o The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung.o Proteases (elastase) cause destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage.o acantitrypsin is the major antiprotease (antielastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation.Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of arantinypsin.o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall.o As occantitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemaPathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages.So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role.Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease.Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an impoant role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema.o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione).o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate occantitrypsin, resulting in functional acantitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.Why smoking related emphysema involves centriacinar poion ?The impaction of smoke paicles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers.",C

Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens examined microscopically show macrophages filled with acid-fast infectious organisms. Which of the following infections have these persons developed?",Aspergillus niger,Candida albicans,Legionella pneumophila,Mycobacterium avium-complex,"Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections such as Mycobacterium avium-complex (MAC) are likely to become disseminated illnesses in immunocompromised persons. In immunocompetent persons, such infections are more likely to resemble tuberculosis. The acid-fast MAC organisms proliferate profusely in macrophages within the mononuclear phagocyte system. Extensive and severe aspergillosis and candidiasis are more likely to occur with profound neutropenia, not lymphocytopenia. Legionella produces an extensive bacterial pneumonia, not disseminated disease. Nocardiosis occurs in immunocompromised patients, and the organisms can be weakly acid-fast, but focal nodules or a chronic abscessing inflammatory response are more likely.",D

True statement regarding Hirschsprung's disease-,Giant ganglia are present,Mucosa is involved and show foldings,Manometry excludes the disease,Rectal biopsy is contraindicated in infants.,"Anorectal manometry is a useful screening procedure for the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. A normal response in course of manometric evaluation precludes the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.
However, the confirmation of diagnosis in case of Hirschsprung's disease is done by rectal biopsy.

Pathogenesis of Hirchsprung disease

The enteric neuronal plexuses develop from neural crest cells, which migrate into the bowel wall during developÂ­ment, mostly in a cephalad to caudad direction.
Hirschsprung disease results when the migration of neural crest cells arrests at some point before reaching the anus â inappropriate premature death.
This produces an intestinal segment that lacks both Meissner submucosal and Auerbach myenteric plexus.
Loss of enteric neural coordination leads to functional obstruction and intestinal dilation proximal to the affected segment.",C

True about Apoptosis are all except :,>Inflammation is present,>Chromosomal brekage,>Clumping of chromatin,>Cell shrinkage,"inflammation is present [Ref. Robbins 7th/e p 31, 271 At early stage of apoptosis dying cells secrete soluble factors that recruit phagocytes. Apoptotic cells express phosplzatidylserine in the outer layers of their plasma membrane. Some times thrombospondin is also expressed on the surface of apoptotic bodies. These alterations permit the early recognition of dead cells by the macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis without the release of proinflammatory cellular components. In this way apoptotic response disposes of cells with minimal compromise to the surrounding tissue. The process of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is so efficient that dead cells disappear without leaving a trace and inflammation is viually absent. Thus apoptosis is fundamentally different from necrosis which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity enzymatic digestion of cells and frequently a host reaction. In case of apoptosis, the cell membrane remains intact. The two most striking features of apoptosis are: 1.1n contrast to necrosis it does not elicit inflammation 2. Considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histological section (because it occurs very rapidly). Morphological changes in apoptosis 1. Cell shrinkage This is the earliest change. It is due to damage of cytoskeletal proteins that provide structural suppo to the cell. 2. Chromatic Condensation (Pyknosis) This is due to breakdown and clumping of chromatin. This is most characteristic feature of apoptosis 3.Formation of cytoplasimic blebs and apoptotic bodies ---> End stage is characterised by bleb formation. 4. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation It is due to activity of endoneuclease and caspases. 5.Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and bodies by adjacent macrophages or healthy parenchymal cells. In histological sections apoptotic cell appears as round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with dens nucleus chromatin fragments. Note : Cell shrinkage and fragmentation allow the cells to be efficiently phagocytosed without release of proinflammatory cellular component.",A

"During a viral infection, a 23-year-old female develops enlarged lymph nodes at multiple sites (lymphadenopathy). A biopsy from one of these enlarged lymph nodes reveals a proliferation of reactive T immunoblasts, cells that have prominent nucleoli. These reactive T cells are most likely to be found in which one of the following regions of the lymph node?",Hilum,Medullary sinuses,Paracoex,Primary follicles,"Lymph nodes may be enlarged (lymphadenopathy) secondary to reactive processes, which can be either acute or chronic. Acute reaction (acute nonspecific lymphadenitis) can result in focal or generalized lymphadenopathy. Focal lymph node enlargement is usually the result of bacterial infection. Sections from involved lymph nodes reveal infiltration by neutrophils. In contrast, generalized acute lymphadenopathy is usually the result of viral infections and usually produces a proliferation of reactive T lymphocytes called T immunoblasts. These reactive T cells tend to have prominent nucleoli and can be easily mistaken for malignant lymphocytes or malignant Hodgkin cells. Reactive processes involving lymph nodes typically involve different and specific poions of the lymph nodes depending upon the type of cell that is reacting. For example, reactive B lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia of the lymphoid follicles and germinal centers (follicular hyperplasia). Examples of diseases that are associated with follicular hyperplasia include chronic inflammation caused by organisms, rheumatoid ahritis, and AIDS. Lymph nodes from patients with AIDS undergo characteristic changes that begin with follicular hyperplasia with loss of mantle zones, intrafollicular hemorrhage (""follicle lysis""), and monocytoid B cell proliferation. Subsequently there is depletion of lymphocytes (CD4+ lymphocytes) in both the follicles and the interfollicular areas. In contrast to reactive B cell processes, reactive T lymphocytes typically result in hyperplasia involving the T cell areas of the lymph node, namely the interfollicular regions and the paracoex. Examples of clinical situations associated with a T lymphocyte response include viral infections, vaccinations, use of some drugs (paicularly Dilantin), and systemic lupus erythematosus. The sinusoidal pattern of reaction involves expansion of the sinuses by benign macrophages, as seen in reactive proliferations of the mononuclearphagocytic system.

Which of the following syndrome is not associated with the Talonâs cusp?,Sturge Weber syndrome,Rubinstein Taybi syndrome,Mohr syndrome,Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,"Talon cusps appear to occur more frequently in Asians, Native Americans, the Inuit, and those of Arab descent. Both sexes may be affected, and the occurrence may be unilateral or bilateral.Â 
In isolated cases, genetic influences appear to have an effect, because identical talon cusps occasionally have been documented in twins.Â 
Talon cusps also have been seen in patients with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Mohr syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, incontinentia pigmenti achromians, Berardinelli-Seip syndrome, and Sturge-Weber angiomatosis. Although the strength of association between the presence of talon cusps and these syndromes generally is not clear, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is strongly correlated as demonstrated by a study of 45 affected patients in which 92% demonstrated talon cusps.

True about Apoptosis include the following except:,Inflammation is present,Chromosomal breakage,Clumping of chromatin,Cell shrinkage,"Ans. A. Inflammation is present. (Ref Kumar: Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease,8th /Ch 1)Apoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cells' own nuclear DNA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly devoured, before the contents have leaked out, and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host.APOPTOSIS (Programmed cell death; ATP required)# Intrinsic or extrinsic pathway; ^activation of cytosolic caspases that mediate cellular breakdown.# No significant inflammation (unlike necrosis).# Characterized by deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm, cell shrinkage, nuclear shrinkage (pyknosis) and basophilia, membrane blebbing, nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), and formation of apoptotic bodies, which are then phagocytosed. DNA laddering is a sensitive indicator of apoptosis; during karyorrhexis, endonucleases cleave at internucleosomal regions, yielding 180-bp fragments.# Radiation causes apoptosis of tumors and surrounding tissue via free radical and dsDNA breakage.# Rapidly dividing cells (e.g., skin, GI mucosa) are very susceptible to radiation -induced apoptosis.",A
"A 63-year-old man is in stable condition after an acute myocardial infarction when he became hypotensive for 3 hours before paramedical personnel arrived. Over the next week, the serum urea nitrogen level increases to 48 mg/dL, the serum creatinine level increases to 5 mg/dL, and the urine output decrease. He undergoes hemodialysis for the next 2 weeks and then develops marked polyuria, with urine output of 2 to 3 L/day. His renal function gradually returns to normal. Release of which of the following substances most likely participated in the elevation of BUN, creatinine, and reduced urinary output?",Aldosterone,Endothelin,Erythropoietin,Natriuretic peptide,"The most common cause of acute tubular necrosis is ischemic injury. The hypotension that develops after myocardial infarction causes decreased renal blood flow, with intrarenal vasoconstriction. Sublethal endothelial injury from reduced renal blood flow leads to the increased release of the vasoconstrictor endothelin and diminished amounts of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostaglandin. The ischemic form of acute tubular injury is often accompanied by the rupture of the basement membrane (tubulorrhexis). An initiating phase that lasts approximately 1 day is followed by a maintenance phase during which progressive oliguria and increasing blood urea nitrogen levels occur, with salt and water overload. This is followed by a recovery phase, during which there is a steady increase in urinary output and hypokalemia. Eventually, the tubular function is restored. Treatment of this acute renal failure results in the recovery of nearly all patients. Aldosterone plays a role in sodium absorption. Erythropoietin drives RBC production. Natriuretic peptide increases when there is congestive heart failure, but does not lead to renal ischemia. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) controls free water clearance.",B

Recent estimates on adenocarcinoma place this as the most frequent histologic subtype of lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is fuher subclassified into 4 types: i) Acinar adenocarcinoma which has predominance of glandular structure and often occurs in the larger bronchi. ii) Papillary adenocarcinoma which has a pronounced papillary configuration and is frequently peripherally located in the lungs and is found in relation to pulmonary scars (scar carcinoma). iii) Bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma is characterised by cuboidal to tall columnar and mucus-secreting epithelial cells growing along the existing alveoli and forming numerous papillary structures .

Which of the is not a channelopathy -,Cystic fibrosis,Liddles syndrome,Tay-sach's disease,Hypokaelemic periodic paralysis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Tay-Sach's disease Ion channels provide pores for the passive diffusion of ions across biological membranes.They are often highly selective for a particular ionic species, leading to a classification into sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl)and unspecific cation channels. Ion channels serve many functions apart from electrical signal transduction: chem ical signalling (Ca2+as a second messenger), transepithelial transport, regulation of cytoplasmic or vesicular ion concentration and pH, and regulation of cell volume. Therefore, ion channel dysfunction can cause diseases in many tissues.The list of human diseases known to be associated with defects in ion channels has grown considerably during the past years.

Both antibody-dependent and independent complement pathway converge at which complement component ?,C3,C5,C1a,C8,"All three pathways of complement activation lead to the formation of an active enzyme called the C3 convease, which splits C3 into two functionally distinct fragments, C3a and C3b. C3a is released, and C3b becomes covalently attached to the cell or molecule where complement is being activated. More C3b then binds to the previously generated fragments to form C5 convease, which cleaves C5 to release C5a and leave C5b attached to the cell surface. C5b binds the late components (C6C9), culminating in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, composed of multiple C9 molecules). The terminal pathway that is common to all pathways of the complement system leads to the membrane attack complex and consists of factors C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9 (C5b6789).

Pink puffers are associated with?,Emphysema,Chronic bronchitis,Pneumonia,Bronchiectasis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Emphysema * A ""pink puffer"" is a person where emphysema is the primary underlying pathology. In emphysema, not only there is less surface area for gas exchange, there is also less vascular bed for gas exchange. The body then has to compensate by hyperventilation (the ""puffer""). Their arterial blood gases (ABGs) actually are relatively normal because of this compensatory hyperventilation. They actually have less hypoxemia (compared to blue bloaters) and appear to have a ""pink"" complexion and hence ""pink puffer"". Some of the pink appearance may also be due to the work (use of neck and chest muscles) these folks put into just drawing a breath.* A ""blue bloater"" is a person where the primary underlying lung pathology is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by excessive mucus production with airway obstruction resulting from hyperplasia of mucus- producing glands, goblet cell metaplasia, and chronic inflammation around bronchi. Unlike emphysema, the pulmonary capillary bed is undamaged. Instead, the body responds to the increased obstruction by decreasing ventilation and increasing cardiac output. There is a dreadful ventilation to perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxemia and polycythemia. In addition, they also have increased carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia). Because of increasing obstruction, their residual lung volume gradually increases (the ""bloating"" part). They are hypoxemic/cyanotic because they actually have worse hypoxemia than pink puffers and this manifests as bluish lips and faces--the ""blue"" part.",A

If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father. o If both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major. o Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester. o If CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents. o If the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait), pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan. o It is woh noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. o Therefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 (eg. serum electrophoresis).",A

'Electron microscopy' is diagnostic of the disease. It shows diffuse thinning of basement membrane early in the disease which thickens over time. In fully developed disease there are irregular foci of thickening alternating with attenuation (thinning) of GBM with pronounced splitting and lamination of lamina densa, giving typical ""basket-weave appearance"".o The disease usually affects males (as other X-linked disorders) in the age group of 5-20 years.

Angiogenesis is a function of which of the following type of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF):,FGF 1,FGF 2,FGF 3,FGF 4,"Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) contain more than 20 members. FGFs contribute to wound healing responses, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, development, and other processes through several functions: Wound repair: FGF-2 and KGF (FGF-7) contribute to re-epithelialization of skin wounds. New blood vessel formation (angiogenesis): FGF-2, in paicular, has the ability to induce new blood vessel formation (discussed later). Hematopoiesis: FGFs have been implicated in the differentiation of specific lineages of blood cells and development of bone marrow stroma. Development: FGFs play a role in skeletal and cardiac muscle development, lung maturation, and the specification of the liver from endodermal cells Ref: Robbins 8th edition, Chapter 3.",B

Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis all are true except?,Parathormone level is increased,PTHrP level is increased,Calcitriol level is increased,Oral steroids are useful,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Parathormone level is increased Calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis* Extrarenal synthesis ofcalcitriol is central to the pathogenesis of abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis.* Sarcoidosis causes an increase in 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, which is usually hydroxylated within the kidney, but in sarcoidosis patients hydroxylation of vitamin D can occur outside the kidneys, mainly inside the immune cells found in the granulomas and produces 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3, which is the main cause for hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.* Gamma-interferon produced by activated lymphocytes and macrophages, also plays a major role in the synthesis of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3.* Above 1-ahydroxylation is controlled by PTH and calcitriol. PTH is stimulated by circulating vitamin D metabolites and low levels of ionized calcium to form a bioregulatory loop 8c PTH release is inhibited by hypercalcaemia and high levels ofcalcitriol, which explains why the PTH level is suppressed in sarcoidosis.* PTHrP has similar properties to PTH, stimulating 1 -a hydroxylation of 25(OH)2D3 and affecting bone turnover but unlike PTH, PTHrP gene expression is not regulated by calcium and vitamin D metabolites, but rather by TNFa and IL-6, two cytokines that are up-regulated in sarcoidosis. They are produced by macrophages and have autocrine actions, up-regulating PTHrP expression and therefore increasing calcitriol synthesis* To date corticosteroids have been the first-line therapy in hypercalcaemic sarcoidosis because of their effectiveness in rapidly restoring normocalcaemia and the lack of a recognized alternative therapy.* It is generally accepted that a corrected serum calcium concentration of >3.0 mmol/1 or evidence of renal complications in the presence of a lesser degree of hypercalcaemia is an indication for therapy.",A

"Although more than 400 blood groups have been identified, the ABO blood group system remains the most important in clinical medicine because -",It was the first blood group system to be discovered -,"It has four different blood groups A,B, AB, O (H).",ABO(H) antigens are present in most body tissues and fluids,ABO(H) antibodies are invariably present in plasma when person's RBC lacks the corresponding antigen,"The basic difference between the ABO blood group system and other blood group systems (such as Rh, Kell, Duffy, MNSs blood groups), which makes the ABO group so important is that -

Preformed ABO antibodies (agglutinins) are present in person serum when his RBCs lack the corresponding antigen (ie. anti B antibody would be present in a person of type A and type O blood groups. These two blood groups do not have the 'B' antigen on the RBCs)Â 


This is not the case with other blood groups. Preformed antibodies are not present. They are formed only after an exposure to the antigen, for example, an Rh-negative person do not have anti- Rh antibodies, these antibodies are formed only after an exposure to Rh-positive blood (by a blood transfusion, i.e. this makes the first blood transfusion safe even if mismatched)
These preformed antibodies, rapidly destroy the RBCs of any mismatched blood transfusion.
Read the following lines from the Journal of hematology-
""In clinical transfusion practice, the ABO blood groups are the most important and can never be ignored in red cell transfusion, because individuals who genetically lack any antigen, have antibodies against the red cell types that they have not inherited. These antibodies can destroy red cells rapidly in circulation"".",D

The inheritance pattern of Familial hypercholesterolemia is,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,"Mutations involving single genes follow one of three patterns of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Familial hypercholesterolemia Huntington disease Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hereditary spherocytosis Neurofibromatosis, type 1 Adult polycystic kidney disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. It is caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene that encodes the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the form in which 70% of total plasma cholesterol is transpoed. A brief review of the synthesis and transpo of cholesterol follows. Normal Cholesterol Metabolism. Cholesterol may be derived from the diet or from endogenous synthesis. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are incorporated into chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa, which drain by way of the gut lymphatics into the blood. These chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by an endothelial lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of muscle and fat. The chylomicron remnants, rich in cholesterol, are then delivered to the liver. Some of the cholesterol enters the metabolic pool (to be described), and some is excreted as free cholesterol or bile acids into the biliary tract. The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and LDL begins in the liver (Fig. 6-2). The first step in the synthesis of LDL is the secretion of triglyceride-rich very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver into the blood. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL paicle undergoes lipolysis and is conveed to intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL). In comparison with VLDL, the content of triglyceride is reduced and that of cholesteryl esters enriched in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), but IDL retains on its surface two of the three VLDL- associated apolipoproteins B-100 and E. Fuher metabo- lism of IDL occurs along two pathways: Most of the IDL paicles are directly taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor described later; others are conveed to cholesterol- rich LDL by a fuher loss of triglycerides and apolipopro- tein E. In the liver cells, IDL is recycled to generate VLDL. Two thirds of the resultant LDL paicles are metabo- lized by the LDL receptor pathway, and the rest is metabo- lized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipo- proteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transpo of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely impoant role in LDL metabolism. The first step in the receptor-mediated transpo of LDL involves binding to the cell surface receptor, followed by endocy- totic internalization inside so-called ""clathrin-coated pits"" (Fig. 6-3). Within the cell, the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomes, and the LDL molecule is enzymatically degraded, resulting ultimately in the release of free cholesterol into the cytoplasm. The cholesterol not only is used by the cell for membrane synthesis but also takes pa in intracel- lular cholesterol homeostasis by a sophisticated system of feed- back control: * It suppresses cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. * It stimulates the formation of cholesterol esters for storage of excess cholesterol. * It downregulates the synthesis of cell surface LDL recep- tors, thus protecting cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. The transpo of LDL by the scavenger receptors, alluded to earlier, seems to take place in cells of the mononuclear- phagocyte system and possibly in other cells as well. Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for chemically modified (e.g., acetylated or oxidized) LDLs. The amount catabolized by this ""scavenger receptor"" pathway is directly related to the plasma cholesterol level. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no. 219)",B

Paroxymal noctural hemoglobinuria is due to ?,Acquired red cell defect,Congential red cell defect,Auto immune defect,Lead poisoning,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Acquired red cell defect Paroxysmal Nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). o PNH is the only hemolytic anemia caused by an acquired intrinsic defect in the cell membrane. o PNH results from acquired mutation that inhibits the synthesis of Glycosylphospatidylinositol (GPI). Several protective proteins called complement regulating proteins are anchored to cell membrane by GPI. These protective proteins prevent activation of complement and there by complement mediated lysis of blood cells. Deficiency of GPI results in absence of these proteins and blood cells become unusually sensitive to complement mediated lysis. o The GPI - linked proteins that are missing are : - Inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD-59) Decay accelerating factor (CD 55) Their absence results in hemolysis C8 binding protein. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor - Its absence promotes thrombosis. Leukocyte alkaline phosphotase (LAP) Decreased LAP score. o Because the causative somatic mutations occur in pluripotent stem cells, all its clonal progeny i.e., red cells, white cells, and platelets are deficient in GPI linked protein. So, all these cells are sensitive to complement mediated lysis that results in : - - Anemia, Leucopenia, Granulocytopenia, Thrombocytopenia",A

There is an area of necrosis in the center of some nodules. Numerous acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated by Ziehl-Neelsen staining within the cytoplasm of epithelioid cells. Silver stains for fungi are negative. Which of the following is the MOST likely condition that predisposed the patient to this pulmonary disease?",Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),Common variable immunodeficiency,Cystic fibrosis,Depressed level of consciousness,"The lesion shown is a necrotizing granuloma developing as a result of infection by acid-fast bacilli (most likely mycobacteria). Granulomatous inflammation is a specialized form of chronic inflammation, which begins with the uptake of foreign antigens by macrophages. These cells process and present the antigen to helper T lymphocytes, which in turn activate macrophages by interferon-g secretion. Granulomas may be due to infectious and noninfectious causes. Usually, infectious granulomas are necrotizing and non-infectious granulomas are non-necrotizing, but there are many exceptions to this rule. Among the infectious causes, mycobacterial infections are of the utmost impoance, especially in patients with AIDS. Fungi may also cause granulomas, which may be of the necrotizing or non-necrotizing type. By definition, however, caseating necrosis is pathognomonic of mycobacterial infection.Also know:Common variable immunodeficiency is one of the most common forms of congenital immune deficiency syndrome. It is due to inability of lymphocytes to mature into plasma cells. Consequently, levels of immunoglobulins are depressed, and patients suffer from depressed humoral immunity. Cell-mediated immunity (on which granuloma formation is largely dependent) is intact. Cystic fibrosis predisposes to recurrent bronchopneumonia and development of bronchiectasis. Depressed level of consciousness predisposes to aspiration of gastric contents and development of aspiration pneumonia. Sheets of macrophages are often observed, but not necrotizing granulomas (unless there are additional predisposing conditions, such as AIDS). Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 7.

True about GVHD is?,Occurs when host is immunocompetent,Most common organ involved is lung,Most common in renal transplant,Occurs when donor cells are immunocompetent,"Graft versus host (GVH) Disease:

Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or theirÂ precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognizeÂ alloantigens in the host.
Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplantationÂ but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion ofÂ un-irradiated blood.
Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation.
When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogeneic donors, the immunocompetent, TÂ cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and reactÂ against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues
In clinical practice, GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HLAÂ matched donor and recipient

The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

"In Von willebrand disease, there is -",Factor VII deficiency,Factor VIII C deficiency,Factor X deficiency,Defects in vWF,"Von willebrand disease is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder due to qualitative or quantitative defect in vWF. von Willebrand Disease von Willebrand disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder. It usually presents as spontaneous bleed- ing from mucous membranes, excessive bleeding from wounds, and menorrhagia. It is underrecognized, as the diagnosis requires sophisticated tests and the clinical manifestations often are quite mild. Actually, this disease is surprisingly prevalent, paicularly in persons of European descent. It is estimated that approximately 1% of people in the United States have von Willebrand disease, making it the most common inher- ited bleeding disorder. People with von Willebrand disease have compound defects in platelet function and coagulation, but in most cases only the platelet defect produces clinical findings. The exceptions are rare patients with homozygous von Willebrand disease, in whom there is a concomitant defi- ciency of factor VIII severe enough to produce features resembling those of hemophilia (described later on). The classic and most common variant of von Willebrand disease (type I) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the quantity of circulating vWF is reduced. There is also a measur- able but clinically insignificant decrease in factor VIII levels. The other, less common varieties of von Willebrand disease are caused by mutations that produce both qualita- tive and quantitative defects in vWF. Type II is divided into several subtypes characterized by the selective loss of high- molecular-weight multimers of vWF. Because these large mul- timers are the most active form, there is a functional deficiency of vWF. In type IIA, the high-molecular-weight multimers are not synthesized, leading to a true deficiency. In type IIB, abnormal ""hyperfunctional"" high-molecular- weight multimers are synthesized that are rapidly removed from the circulation. These high-molecular-weight multiA mers cause spontaneous platelet aggregation (a situation reminiscent of the very-high-molecular-weight multimer aggregates seen in TTP); indeed, some people with type IIB von Willebrand disease have mild chronic thrombocytope- nia, presumably due to platelet consumption.

All are true about Virchow's triad except ?,Concerns the risk of intravascular thrombus,Depends on endothelial injury,Depends on platelet activation,Depends on stasis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Depends on platelet activation Thrombosis Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) inside a blood vessel or hea, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis ? When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss - hemostasis. If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i.e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i.e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. Thrombosis may occur without injury (e.g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad) :? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. Disturbances in blood flow Stasis- Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by ? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood. Retard the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors. Turbulence can cause endothelial injury or dysfunction.",C

It is caused by an increase in the estrogen-to-androgen ratio. This abnormality may sometimes be found in males at the time of pubey. Other causes of gynecomastia include Klinefelter's syndrome (decreased secretion of testosterone), testicular feminization (androgen insensitivity), testicular tumors, cirrhosis of the liver, alcohol abuse, increased gonadotropin levels (such as choriocarcinoma of the testis), increased prolactin levels, drugs (such as digoxin), or hypehyroidism. Testicular neoplasms that are associated with gynecomastia are tumors that secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which increases the synthesis of estradiol.

Microscopically, the oedema fluid separates the connective tissue fibres of subcutaneous tissues. Depending upon the protein content, the oedema fluid may appear homogenous, pale, eosinophilic or may be deeply eosinophilic and granular.
Oedema in glomerulonephritis. Oedema occurs in conditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema). In contrast to nephrotic oedema, nephritic oedema is not due to hypoproteinaemia but is due to excessive reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism. The protein content of oedema fluid in glomerulonephritis is quite low (less than 0.5 g / dl).
The nephritic oedema is usually mild as compared to nephrotic oedema and begins in the loose tissue such as on the face around eyes, ankles and genitalia. Oedema in these conditions is usually not affected by gravity (unlike cardiac oedema).",B

The most common source of pulmonary embolism is-,Amniotic fluid embolism,Renal artery embolism,Large veins of lower limb,Cardiothoracic surgery,"Pulmonary embolism

Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of pulmonary artery or one of its branches.
Pulmonary embolism is an extremely common and highly lethal condition that is a leading cause of death in all ageÂ groups.

Etiology

In more than 95% of instances, venous emboli originating from deep leg vein thrombi above the level of knee i.e. in popliteal, femoral or iliac veins.
Although the most common site of deep vein thrombosis is calf veins, calf veins thrombosis is itself associated with a low risk of embolism, but when the thrombosis progresses proximally to involve the larger veins above the leg then the risk becomes very high.
So, Â Most common site of DVT â Calf veins

Most common source of pulmonary embolism âÂ DVT of proximal veins of lower limb i.e., popliteal, femoralÂ or iliac veins.
Pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism

If the size of embolus is large, it may be impacted at the bifurcation of main pulmonary artery âÂ Saddle embolus, or may be passed out into the smaller, branching arterioles.
More commonly, there are multiple emboli, or a large embolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which are then impacted in a number of vessels, particularly affecting the lower lobes of lungs.
Rarely, Paradoxical embolism may occur by passage of an embolus from the right side of the heart into the left heart through ASD or VSD. In this way, pulmonary emboli may reach systemic circulation.",C

Before cutting into the specimen, the pathologist makes a careful gross examination, which demonstrates that most of the specimen has replacement of the normally fatty breast tissue with strands of dense, white, firm tissue. In a few areas, roughly spherical lesions up to 3-cm diameter with a bluish hue to them are seen. Palpation of these areas produces a fluctuant sensation. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis based on the gross evaluation?",Breast cancer,Changes of pregnancy,Fibroadenoma,Fibrocystic disease,"While a careful pathologist will wait for appropriate frozen or permanent tissue histologic examination, the description given in the question stem is most suggestive of fibrocystic disease. The fibrous pa of the lesion forms the dense, white tissue strands, while the blue lesions are what are called ""blue-domed cysts"". The blue color comes from the presence of darkly colored fluid (which usually means old hemorrhage) within the cyst. The interior cyst wall is usually smooth. These blue-domed cysts are a ourite of examiners because they produce a distinctive gross picture and should be specifically associated with fibrocystic disease, but you should be aware that in real life they do not occur with anything near the frequency of fibrocystic disease without obvious large cysts grossly (but many smaller cysts on microscopic examination). Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a very common lesion, and a frequent source of palpable lumps in the breast, which may require fuher evaluation through either excisional biopsy (as in this case), Tru-cut needle biopsy (producing a thin core about 1 cm long), or needle aspiration (producing fluid or cells for cytology). Also know: While a diagnosis of breast cancer should obviously be confirmed microscopically before telling the clinician, invasive breast cancer can be suspected when there is a hard, white, nodular area of the breast that has irregular (but often reasonably well-defined - in contrast to the fibrotic areas of fibrocystic disease) boundaries. The changes of pregnancy cannot be reliably picked up on gross examination of the breast. Fibroadenoma , like breast cancer, tends to produce a well-defined mass lesion, but it typically has smooth borders and may have a slightly gray and slightly mucoid (e.g., shiny or oily appearing) surface on cross-section.

Non-Frame shift Mutation of Dystrophin gene causes:,Duchenne Muscular dystrophy,Becker's Muscular Dystrophy,Myotonic Dystrophy,Limb Girdle Dystrophy,"Duchenne&;s and Becker&;s Muscular Dystrophies are both caused by a mutation on the dystrophin gene located on the X Chromosome (Xp21). An out-of-Frame mutation typically results in complete disruption of dystrophin production and causes Duchenne&;s Dystrophy. An in-Frame mutation results in a shoened but semi-functional dystrophin and causes Becker&;s Dystrophy. X-Linked recessive mutation of the dystrophin gene on the Sacrolemmal membrane Mutations are located in the Dystrophin gene on XP21 Since these are X-Linked Recessive disorders, they occur primarily in boys. (Females are usually Asymptomatic carriers with a normal gene on one X Chromosome and a mutant gene on the other X-Chromosome. Frame-shift-mutation (Out-of-Frame) - Results in complete loss of dystrophin - Duchenne muscular dystrophy Non-Frame shift mutation (In-Frame) - Results in paial function of dystrophin - Becker muscular dystrophy Clincal severity more dependent on in-frame versus out-of-frame mutation (""reading-frame-rule""), rather than the location of the mutation along the gene. Mutations disrupting the translational reading frame of the gene (Frameshift mutation) result in near total loss of dystrophin and usually lead to DMD, while in-frame mutation result in the translation of semi-functional dsytrophin of abnormal size and/or amount, typically resulting in outlier of BMD clinical phenotypes. Although there are exceptions to the ""reading-frame rule"", 92% of phenotypic differences are explained by in-frame and out-of-frame mutations. Ref: Robbins and cotran 9th edition Vol 2",B
What is the best method for confirming amyloidosis-,Colonoscopy,Sigmoidoscopy,Rectal biopsy,Tongue biopsy,"âThe most definitiveÂ investigation for Amyloidosis is biopsyâ.

For many years rectal biopsy was the firstÂ procedure of choice.
An important clinical advance was the recognition that the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are often involvedÂ in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficientÂ tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis.Â 
Thus, a biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary.
For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitiveÂ diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using anÂ endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample.
Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specificÂ diagnosis is often made byÂ studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy thereby avoiding an invasiveÂ procedure.
When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firmÂ diagnosis, biopsyÂ samples can be collected from other organs.
In addition, an advantage to performing a biopsy of an involved organ (e.g., kidney heart) is thatÂ it definitivelyÂ establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid.
It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity.

The best sites of biopsy are: -

Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity)
Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity)

Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: -

Salivary glands
Skin

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of -,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic ahritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Atherosclerosis Lipoprotein - (a) o Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a). o Elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. o How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis ? In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent doposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plosminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen --> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances fuher fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C

"A 69-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after falling off a step stool and fracturing her hip. Her past medical history is significant for several bouts of pneumonia during the past year. Laboratory results indicate a normal white blood cell count, but platelets are decreased, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated. X-rays reveal multiple lytic bone lesions. Serum electrophoresis demonstrates an M-protein spike. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Monoclonal gammopathy of unceain significance,Multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma),Plasmacytoma,"The patient is suffering from multiple myeloma, a neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells (or their precursors) found within the bone marrow. These malignant cells are responsible for the production of excessive amounts of immunoglobulin (usually IgG or IgA), producing an M- protein spike, and increasing the ESR. The decreased platelet count probably reflects infiltration of the bone marrow by myeloma cells. It is not unusual for patients with malignant myeloma to have recurring bacterial infections, paicularly pneumococcal pneumonia, because the overall production of normal immunoglobulins of all isotypes is decreased. Lytic bone lesions due to infiltration by myeloma cells may lead to pathological fractures. All of the other disorders listed can be associated with an M-protein spike, but this is a nonspecific finding. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is ruled out by the normal white count, since this type of leukemia is generally associated with an absolute lymphocytosis. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance are generally asymptomatic, although they have a predisposition for subsequently developing myeloma, lymphoma, amyloidosis, or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Plasmacytoma (solitary myeloma) is a rare, isolated plasma cell neoplasm in bone or soft tissues. If the primary cancer is in bone, it is likely to disseminate; extraosseous tumors tend to remain localized. Since this patient had multiple lytic bone lesions, multiple myeloma is the correct diagnosis. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 30. The Lymphoid System: III.

Varices occur in about two-thirds of all patients with cirrhosis, and in the majority of patients the etiology is alcoholic cirrhosis. The cirrhosis causes poal hypeension, which shunts blood into connecting channels between the poal and caval systems, such as the subepithelial plexus of veins in the lower esophagus. Varices produce no symptoms until they rupture and cause massive bleeding (hematemesis), which may lead to death. Other diseases, such as gastritis, esophageal laceration (Mallory-Weiss tears), or peptic ulcer disease, may cause hematemesis In contrast, columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus is seen with Barrett's esophagus; decreased ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus are seen with achalasia, a disorder that is characterized by aperistalsis, incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) with swallowing, and increased resting tone of the LES, all of which lead to esophageal dilation and symptoms of progressive dysphagia.

Because cecum has the largest diameter, it develops the greatest wall tension. Therefore cecum is the most common site for angiodysplasia. 2. Genetic (developmental) factor Some data link angiodysplasia with aoic sstenosis and Meckel diveiculum suggesting the possibility of a developmental component.",A
True about aplastic anemia -,Splenomegaly,Nucleated RBC in peripheral blood,Reticulocytopenia,Thrombocytopenia,"In aplastic anemia destruction of hemopoietic stem cells occurs ,it results in reduced reticulocyte count. The bone marrow in aplastic anemia is markedly hypocellular, with greater than 90% of the interabecular space being occupied by fat. The limited cellularity often consists only of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Anemia may cause fatty change in the liver. Thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia may result in hemorrhages and bacterial infections, respectively. The requirement for transfusions may eventually lead to hemosiderosis.

Enamel hypo-calciï¬cation and hypo-maturation of tooth is seen in:,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Dentinogenesis imperfecta,Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome,Turner tooth,"Tricho-Dento-Osseous SyndromeÂ 
The tricho-dento-osseous (TOP)Â syndrome is a hereditary condition, which chiefly involves the hair, teeth, and bones. The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and the mutations are mapped to the DLX gene located at chromosome 17q21.3-q22. DLX gene plays a role in the development of craniofacial bone in the early embryogenesis. Later, it is expressed in structures that involve epithelial-mesenchymal interaction such as teeth, hair follicle, and skin.
The dental findings include yellow-brown discoloration of teeth, enamel hypoplasia, and severe attrition of enamel. Such defective enamel may be a cause for commonly occurring dental abscesses.Â Wide pulp chamber (taurdontism), especially involving the molars, has been reported.
Radiographic FeaturesÂ 
In dental X-rays, large pulp chambers are noticed, often in the molars.Â In addition, teeth may remain uneruptedÂ for long, leading to partial anodontia.Â 
Key Concept:
AÂ patternÂ ofÂ teethÂ alterationÂ similarÂ toÂ amelogenesis imperfecta with taurodontism is seen in the systemic disorder,Â tricho-dento-osseousÂ syndrome.

All these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky) cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoids used to be classified as 'bronchial adenomas' but now it is known that they are locally invasive and have the capacity to metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at a younger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearing below the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarette smoking. CLINICAL FEATURES. Bronchial carcinoids occur at a relatively early age and have equal sex incidence. Most of the symptoms in bronchial carcinoids occur as a result of bronchial obstruction such as cough, haemoptysis, atelectasis and secondary infection. About 5-10% of bronchial carcinoids metastasise to the liver and these cases are capable of producing carcinoid syndrome.",B

Malignant mesothelioma is a diffuse lesion that spreads widely in the pleural surface and is usually associated with extensive pleural effusion and direct invasion of thoracic structures.
Malignant mesothelioma may be of following types, depending on the type of mesothelial cells that is present in the tumor.

1. Epithelioid type

Mesothelial cells develop as epithelium like lining cells.
Consists of cuboidal, columnar or flattened cells forming tubular or papillary structures.
Epithelioid type of mesothelioma resembles adenocarcinoma of lung and can be differentiated from it by following featurs:-


Positive staining for mucopolysaccharide.
Lack of staining for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
Strong staining for keratin.
Positive staining for calretinin, wilms' tumor 1 susceptibility gene product, cytokeratin 5/6, mesothelin and thrombomodulin.
Presence of long microvilli and abundant tonofilaments but absent microvillous rootlets and lamellar bodies.

2. Sarcomatoid (mesenchymal type)

Mesothelial cells develop as mesenchymal stromal cells.
They appear as spindle cell sarcoma, resembling fibrosarcoma.

3. Mixed type (Biphasic type)

Contains both epithelioid and sarcomatoid patterns.",A

Acute GVHD is caused by-,B lymphocyte,T lymphocyte,Macrophage,NKcell,"GraftÂ versus host (gvh) diseases

GraftÂ versus host disease occurs in any situationÂ in which immunologically competent cells or theirÂ precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patientsÂ and the transferred cells recognizeÂ alloantigensÂ in the host.
GraftÂ versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantationÂ of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion ofÂ unirradiated blood.
Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primaryÂ disease orÂ prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation.
When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogeneic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognize the recipientâs HLA antigen as a foreign antigenÂ and reactÂ against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+Â T cells recognize and attack host tissues.
In clinical practice,Â GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HLAÂ matched donor and recipient.

Pathological changes in GVH diseases

There are three principal target tissuesÂ affected in GVHD: Skin, liver, and gut. GVHD may be acute orÂ chronic:-

A) Acute GVHD

Acute GVHD occurs within 100 days (usually 10-50 days) of bone marrow transplantation. TheÂ manifestationsÂ of acute GVHD are

1. Skin

It is the most commonly affected tissueÂ in acute GVHD. There is generalized rashÂ (maculopapular).

Histological findings are
i. Perivascular mononuclear infiltrates.
ii. Vacuolar degradation of dermo-epidermal junction
iii. DyskeratoticÂ or eosinophilic bodies in the epidermis.
iv. Epidermolysis & bullae.
v. DenudationÂ of epidermis (separationÂ of epidermis from dermis),
2. Gut

The primary clinical manifestationÂ of gut GVHD is diarrhoea and abdominal pain. There isÂ lymphocyticÂ infiltrate at the crypts with accompanied necrosis and drop out of crypt cells.

3. Liver

LymphocyticÂ infiltrates in the interlobular and marginal bile ducts are characteristicÂ histopathologic findings. This results in hepatitisÂ with necrosis of hepatocytes and bites ductÂ epithelial cells. There is inflammationÂ of the parenchyma and portal tracts. These findingsÂ lead to a clinically identifiable cholestaticÂ picture.

B) Chronic GVHD

It occurs after 100 days of bone marrow transplantation. ManifestationsÂ are:-

1. Skin

Extensive cutaneous injury, with the destruction of skin appendages and fibrosis of the dermis.

2. Gut

Damage to GIT may result in necrosis, ulcerationÂ fibrosis and strictures.

3. Liver

The findings of liver damage are i) Portal tract inflammation ii)Â Selective bile duct destruction

iii. Endothelitis of the portal vein and hepatitis vein radicles, in which a subendothelialÂ lymphocyticÂ infiltrate lifts the endothelium from its basement membrane.

IMMUNE SURVEILLANCE IN CANCER Robbins 8th/331-32Most cancers occur in persons who do not suffer from any overt immunodeficiency. It is evident then that tumor ceils must develop mechanisms to escape or evade the immune system in immunocompetent hosts.Several such mechanisms may be operative: They are-# Selective outgrowth of antigen-negative variants: During tumor progression, strongly immunogenic subclones may be eliminated.# Loss or reduced expression of MHC molecules: Tumor cells may fail to express normal levels of HLA class I molecules, thereby escaping attack by cytotoxic T cells. Such cells, however, may trigger NK cells# Lack of costimulatiom tumor cells may express peptide antigens with class I molecules, they often do not express costlmitlatory molecules. This not only prevents sensitization, but also may renderT cells anergic or, worse, cause them to undergo apoptosis. Because dendritic cells express high levels of co stimulatory molecules, it Is expected that such dendritic cell immunization will stimulate antitumor T cells.# Immunosuppression: Many oncogenic agents (e.g., chemicals and ionizing radiation) suppress host immune responses. Tumors or tumor products (like TGF-b) may also be immunosuppressive.# Antigen masking: The cell-surface antigens of tumors may be hidden, or masked, from the immune system by glycocalyx molecules, such as sialic acid-containing mucopolysaccharides. This may be a consequence of the fact that tumor cells often express more of these glycocalyx molecules than normal cells do.# Apoptosis of cytotoxic T cells: Some melanomas and hepatocellular carcinomas express Fas ligand.

True Statement about silicosis -a) Produces pleural plaqueb) Associated with tuberculosisc) Lower lobe infiltrationd) Hilar adenopathy,c,d,bd,ac,"Silicosis

Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica).
Currently, it is the most prevalent occupational disease in the world.
Silicosis is a slowly progressive disease, usually presenting after decades of exposure as slowly progressive nodular fibrosing pneumoconiosis.
Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms but crystalline forms are much more fibrogenic. The crystalline form are quartz, crystobalite.
Silicosis is characterized in its early stages by nodules in the upper zones of the lung. As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars.
Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura. Sometimes thin sheets of calcification occur in the lymph nodes and are seen radiographically as egg shell calcification i.e. (calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification.
It the disease continues to progress, expansion and coalescence of lesions produce progressive massive fibrosis.
Histologically the lesions of silicosis consists of concentric layers of hyalinized collagen surrounded by a dense capsule of more condensed collagen.
Examination of the nodules by polarized microscopy reveals the birefringent silica particles.
Silicosis is associated with an increased susceptibility to TB. It is postulated that silicosis results in depression of cell mediated immunity and the crystalline silica may inhibit the ability of pulmonary macrophages to kill phagocytosed mycobacteria.

A microbiology laboratory repos growth of Staphylococcus aureus from pus drained from a breast abscess. What is the most likely condition predisposing the patient to the development of a breast abscess?,Breast feeding,Endocarditis,Inflammatory breast carcinoma,Menopause,"Acute mastitis, frequently complicated by breast abscess formation, typically develops in the postpaum period, when the nipples are first subjected to the physical stresses of breast feeding. Bacteria enter the breast cracks in the nipple, and flourish in the microenvironment of the lactating breast. Acute mastitis causes redness, pain, and swelling in the affected breast; Staph. aureus is the most common pathogen. Although endocarditis could send septic emboli to the breast, Staph. aureus endocarditis is more commonly associated with bacteremia and fevers, proliferative glomerulonephritis, valvular dysfunction, and emboli to the brain, kidneys, hea, and gut. Inflammatory breast carcinoma does not invoke an inflammatory response, and it is not associated with an infection. Inflammatory breast carcinoma is characterized by tumor spread into the dermal lymphatics, producing diffuse induration and skin tenderness with the typical peau d'orange appearance. Mastitis arising in the perimenopausal period is usually a chronic mastitis, caused by obstruction of ducts due to inspissated secretions. Chronic mastitis is sterile.

Other chemokines are produced constitutively in tissues and function in organogenesis to organize different cell types in different anatomic regions of tissues.About 40 different chemokines and 20 different receptors for chemokines have been identified.They are classified into 4 major groups according to the arrangement of conserved cysteine residue in mature proteins.,B
"Histologic sections of a kidney reveal patchy necrosis of epithelial cells of both the proximal and distal tubules with flattening of the epithelial cells, rupture of the basement membrane (tubulorrhexis), and marked interstitial edema. Acute inflammatory cells are not seen. What is the best diagnosis?",Acute pyelonephritis,Acute tubular necrosis,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Chronic pyelonephritis,"Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) may produce oliguria, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased fractional excretion of sodium, and an abnormal urinary sediment. ATN may be caused by renal ischemia (ischemic ATN) or chemical toxins (toxic ATN). Renal ischemia is the most common cause of ATN, while toxic ATN may be caused by antibiotics (such as aminoglycosides and amphotericin B), heavy metals (such as cisplatin), radiographic agents, and endogenous toxins (such as myoglobin and hemoglobin). Both ischemic ATN and toxic ATN are characterized by the finding of eosinophilic hyalin or pigmented granular casts in the urine. Histologically, both ischemic and toxic ATN reveal interstitial edema, flattening of the tubular epithelial cells, and tubular epithelial cell necrosis. One difference between these two etiologies is that the tubular epithelial cell necrosis is extensive with toxic ATN, while the necrosis with ischemic ATN is patchy with interposed unaffected segments. This can be quite variable, however, and ceain causes may be associated with damage to specific poions of the kidney. Both ischemia and heavy metals primarily damage the epithelial cells of the proximal straight tubules, while aminoglycosides primarily affect the proximal convoluted tubule.

Which of the following genetic abnormalities is most often related to the development of this disease?",Confined placental mosaicism,Expanded trinucleotide repeat,Frameshift mutation,Nondisjunction,"Most cases of Tay-Sachs disease are caused by inseion of four nucleotides into the coding region of the gene for the alpha-subunit of the hexosaminidase A gene. This produces a frameshift mutation, resulting in the creation of a premature stop codon downstream from the inseed nucleotides. The disease presents as described in the question, and is more common in Ashkenazi Jews. The carrier rate in this population is 1 in 25. There is presently no effective treatment and survival beyond four years of age is rare. Confined placental mosaicism is caused by a genetic aberration (e.g., a trisomy) occurring in the trophoblast or extraembryonic progenitor cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo. This leads to abnormal placental development and intrauterine growth retardation. Expansion of tandem nucleotide repeats is thought to be etiologically involved in Fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease.

Jumping gene is known as?,Transposon,Retroposon,Insertion sequence,Integron,"* Transposons, also called jumping genes, are pieces of DNA that move readily from one site to another.* They move either within or between the DNAs of bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages in a manner, that plasmid genes can become part of the chromosomal complement of genes.* Interestingly, when transposons transfer to a new site, it is usually a copy of the transposon that moves, while the original remains in situ (like photocopying).* Transposons can code for metabolic or drug resistance enzymes and toxins. They may also cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes.* In contrast to plasmids or bacterial viruses, transposons cannot replicate independently of the recipient DNA. More than one transposon can be located in the DNA for example, resistance genes. Thus, transposons can jump from:# The host genomic DNA to a plasmid# One plasmid to another# A plasmid to genomic DNA.* An insertion sequence is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes.",A

These DNA clones are labeled with fluorescent dyes and applied to metaphase chromosome spreads or interphase nuclei that are pretreated so as to ""melt"" the genomic DNA. The probe hybridizes to its homologous genomic sequence and thus labels a specific chromosomal region that can be visualized under a fluorescent microscope. FISH can be performed on prenatal samples, peripheral blood cells, touch preparations from cancer biopsies, and even fixed archival tissue sections. FISH is used to detect numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy); subtle microdeletions or complex translocations that are not demonstrable by routine karyotyping; and gene amplification The number of chromosomes that can be detected simultaneously by chromosome painting is limited by the availability of fluorescent dyes that emit different wavelengths of visible light.

"Carcinoma of lung, breast marker is-",CEA,AFP,HCG,CA-15-3,"The CEA blood test is not reliable for diagnosing cancer or as a screening test for early detection of cancer. Most types of cancer do not result in a high CEA level. Serum from individuals with colorectal carcinoma often has higher levels of CEA than healthy individuals (above approximately 2.5 ug/L). CEA measurement is mainly used as a tumor marker to monitor colorectal carcinoma treatment, to identify recurrences after surgical resection, for staging or to localize cancer spread through measurement of biological fluids. CEA levels may also be raised in gastric carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, lung carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and medullary thyroid carcinoma, as well as some non-neoplastic conditions like ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, COPD, Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism as well as in smokers. CEA elevation is known to be affected by multiple factors. It varies inversely with tumor grade; well-differentiated tumors secrete more CEA. CEA is elevated more in tumors with lymph node and distant metastasis than in organ-confined tumors and, thus, varies directly with tumor stage.

Chediakhigashi syndrome is characterized by following except ?,Is autosomal recessive disorder,Mutation in LYST gene,Occulocutaneous albinism,Effective phagolysosome formation,"Ans. is `d' i.e., Effective phagolysosome formation Chediakhigashi syndrome :?It is an autosomal recessive disorder.Chediakhigashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene.This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes.Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins.During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterias.Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome.Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation.As a result, most people with chediakhigashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening.Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected.The other cells involved are - Melanosomes of melanocytes Dense bodies of platelets Granules of schwann cellsThere are giant primary granules in neutrophils and other granules bearing cells.In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism-Le the colour of skin, hair and eye is reduced.Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders.Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy.Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase, (lymphoma like stage).This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs.The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death.",D

"When a functional gene is inherited from one parent only, the condition is known as",Genomic imprinting,Mosaicism,Alleles,Chimerism,"Genomic imprinting is the epigenetic phenomenon by which ceain genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. If the allele inherited from the father is imprinted, it is thereby silenced, and only the allele from the mother is expressed. If the allele from the mother is imprinted, then only the allele from the father is expressed. Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in fungi, plants and animals. As of 2014, there are about 150 imprinted genes known in the mouse and about half that in humans. Genomic imprinting is an inheritance process independent of the classical Mendelian inheritance. It is an epigenetic process that involves DNA methylation and histone methylation without altering the genetic sequence. These epigenetic marks are established (""imprinted"") in the germline (sperm or egg cells) of the parents and are maintained through mitotic cell divisions in the somatic cells of an organism. Appropriate imprinting of ceain genes is impoant for normal development. Human diseases involving genomic imprinting include Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome.",A

Which of the following is required for post-translational modification?,Vitamin B12,Biotin,Beta-carotene,Vitamin C,"Ans. (d) Vitamin CRef: Robbiris pathology 9th ed. 18* As the collagen molecule is produced, it undergoes many changes, termed post-translational modifications.* These modifications take place in the Golgi compartment of the ER.* Collagen, like most proteins that are destined for transport to the extracellular spaces for their function or activity, is produced initially as a larger precursor molecule called procollagen.* Procollagen contains additional peptides at both ends that are unlike collagen. On one end of the molecule, called the amino terminal end, special bonds called disulfide bonds are formed among three procollagen chains and ensure that the chains line up in the proper alignment. This step is called registration. Once registration occurs, the three chains wrap around each other forming a string-like structure.* One of the first modifications to take place is the very critical step of hydroxylation of selected proline and lysine amino acids in the newly synthesized procollagen protein",D

True about shock -a) In early stage cardiac output and BP are maintainedb) There is decreased sympathetic activityc) Renin secretion may be increased d) Aldosterone secretion is decreased,a,bc,ac,b,"Stages of shock 

Shock tends to evolve through three general phages : -

A. Non progressive (Initial or compensated reversible) shock
In the early stage of shock, there is activation of compensatory mechanisms that attempt to maintain adequate perfusion of the heart and brain, and to maintain adequate cardiac output and blood pressure.
These compensatory mechanisms include : -
	1. Due to decrease perfusion pressure, baroreceptors are stimulated that leads to increased sympathetic discharge & catecholamines release with reduced vagal activity. All these cause : -
	a)Â Peripheral vasoconstriction Cool clammy extrimities (In hyperdynamic stage of septic shock and in neurogenic shock the extrimities are warm due to vasodilatation).
	b)Â Tachycardia
	2. Decreased renal perfusion and sympathetic stimulation cause increased renin release from the kidney and activation of renin angiotensin system. So that : -
Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction and release of aldosterone.
Aldosterone causes fluid and salt conservation by kidney.
In this stage patient can be managed by correcting the underlying cause, e.g., fluid therapy in hypovolemic. Shock and control of infection in septic shock.

B. Progressive (Decompensated reversible) shock
Due to continued tissue hypoxia, aerobic respiration replaced by anaerobic glycolysis that leads to formation of lactic acid âÂ Lactic acidosis & pH.
Acidosis (â pH) causes blunting of venoconstrictor effect of catecholamine â Venodilatation â Pooling of blood in peripheral veins. As there is arteriolar constriction ( â peripheral resistance) and venodilatation (â venous return) â Cardiac output is decreased.
Peripheral pooling of blood and decreased cardiac output cause anoxic injury to endothelial cells that may cause DIC.
Decreased perfusion to vital organs like brain causes mental confusion & drowsiness and decreased perfusion to kidney causes decline in urinary output.
In this stage patient can be managed but more aggresive management is required i.e., along with correction of underlying cause; intropic agent, vasopressor, oxygen and resuscitation may be required.

C. Irreversible shock
Unless there is intervention in previous stages, the process enters in an irreversable stage in which there is multiple organ damage.
In this stage survival is not possible even after intervention.",C

Which of the following would best describe the changes within the kidney in this patient?",Plasma cell interstitial nephritis,IgG linear fluorescence along the glomerular basement membrane,Granular deposits of antibodies in the glomerular basement membrane,Diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane by subepithelial immune deposits,"Glomerular injury caused by circulating antigen-antibody complexes is a secondary effect from a nonrenal primary source. Numerous clinical examples exist of a serum sickness-like nephritis as a consequence of systemic infection, with classic clinical models such as syphilis, hepatitis B, malaria, and bacterial endocarditis leading to renal disease. Immune complexes to antigens from any of these sources are circulating within the vascular system and become entrapped within the filtration system of the glomerular basement membranes. This can be seen as granular, bumpy deposits by immunofluorescence within the basement membranes of the glomeruli. Linear fluorescence, on the other hand, is seen in primary antiglomerular basement membrane disease, in which antibodies are directed against the glomerular basement membrane itself. Plasma cell interstitial nephritis is seen in immunologic rejection of transplanted kidneys. Nodular glomerulosclerosis is an effect of diabetes mellitus. The presence of red blood cell casts in the urine nearly always indicates that there has been glomerular injury but is not specific for any given cause. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane caused by subepithelial immune deposits is seen in membranous glomerulonephritis. While the morphology of membranous glomerulonephritis is different from that of nephritis caused by circulating antigen-antibody complexes (immune complexes), there are similarities in the pathogenesis in that both disorders may be a consequence of or exist in association with infections such as hepatitis B, syphilis, or malaria. Other causes of membranous glomerulonephritis include reactions to penicillamine and gold, and ceain malignancies such as malignant melanoma.

Programmed cell death is known as-,Cytolysis,Apoptosis,Necrosis,Proptosis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Apoptosis o Programmed cell death is apoptosis. o But remember this impoant fact that not all apoptosis are programmed cell death (read text below) Apoptosis o Apoptosis is pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated intracellular program in which cell destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cell's own nuclear DNA, and nuclear & cytoplasmic proteins. o Apoptosis generally involves single cells in contrast to necrosis that usually involve a group of cells. o Apoptosis may be of two types ? A. Physiological (most of the time) Programmed cell death. B. Pathological Unprogrammed cell death. A.Physiological apoptosis o Death by apoptosis is a normal phenomenon that serves to eliminate cells that are no longer needed. o It is impoant in the following physiologic situation :? The programmed destruction of cells during embryogenesis, including implantation, organogenesis, and metamorphosis. Hormone dependent involution in adult, e.g., endometrial cell breakdown during menstural cycle, ovarian follicular atresia in the menopause, the regression of lactating breast after weaning, and prostatic atrophy after castration. Cell deletion in proliferating cell population in order to maintain a constant number, e.g., intestinal crypt epithelium. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose, such as neutrophils after an acute inflammatory response, and lymphocytes at the end of an immune response. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocytes in thymus. Cell death induced by cytotoxic T cells to eliminate virus infected and neoplastic cells. Same mechanism occurs in graft versus host disease. B.Pathological apoptosis o Apoptosis may also be pathological. o When cells are damaged beyond repair, especially when the damage affects the cell's DNA, the irreparably damaged cells are eliminated : ? Cell death produced by injuries stimuli --> Radiation and cytotoxic anticancer drugs damage DNA, and if repair mechanisms cannot cope with the injury, the cell kills itself by apoptosis. In these situations, elimination of the cell may be a better alternative than risking mutations and translocations in the damaged DNA which may result in malignant transformation.

In contrast to infective endocarditis, the sterile valvular lesions of NBTE are nondestructive.
The vegetations in NBTE are typically small (1 to 5 mm in diameter)Â  and valvular damage is not aÂ prerequisite.Â Indeed, the condition usually occurs on previously normal valves.Â Rather, hypercoagulable states are the usual precursor to NBTE; such conditions include chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation,Â hyperestrogenic states, and those associated with underlying malignancy, particularly mucinous adenocarcinomas.Â This last association probably relates to the procoagulant effect of circulating mucin and/or tissue factor elaborated by these tumors. Endocardial trauma, such as from an indwelling catheter, also is a well-recognized predisposing condition.

Effect of HbS on RBCs o In deoxygenated condition, the HbS molecules undergo polymerization and aggregation. o With continued deoxygenation, aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distoed sickle or holly-leaf shape. Sickling of red cells is reversible initialy, i.e., with oxygenation, HbS depolymerizes and cell shape normalizes. o However, with repeated episodes of deoxygenation and sickling, membrane damage occurs and cells become irreversibly sickled, and retain their abnormal shape even when full oxygenated. o With membrane damage water comes out of the cell resulting in intracellular dehydration ---> T MCHC. Due to membrane damage, sickle red cells become abnormally sticky --> responsible for microvascular occlusions.

The name of tumor is usually based on the cell, e.g. smooth muscle cell tumor â leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, skeletal muscle cell tumor rhabdomyosarcoma.

Benign tumors

In general, benign tumors are designed by attaching the suffix - oma, e.g tumor of fibroblasts â fibroma, tumor of cartilagenous cells â chondroma.

Malignant tumors

Malignant tumors arising in mesenchymal cell origin are usually called sarcoma, e.g. fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma.
Malignant tumors of epithelial cell origin are called carcinoma.


Carcinoma may be further classified â one with glandular growth pattern, i.e. adenocarcinoma and the other one producing recognizable squamous cells of epithelium, i.e. squamous cell carcinoma.

Germ layers and tumor

The great majority of the neoplasm is composed of cells representative of a single germ layer.
Teratomas, in contrast, are made up of a variety of parenchymal cell types representative of more than one germ layer, usually all three.
They arise from totipotent cells and so are principally encountered in the gonads. These totipotent cells differentiate along various germ lines, that can be identified as skin, fat, muscle, tooth structure, hair or any other tissue of the body. An example is a dermoid cyst of the ovary is a benign teratoma (note mature teratoma is benign, while immature teratoma is malignant).

Most common type of malignancy of stomach is: September 2007,Adenocarcinoma,Squamous carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,Lymphoma,"Ans. A: Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A

Procalcitonin is considered as marker for:,Sepsis,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,Vitamin D resistant rickets,Parathyroid adenoma,"ANSWER: A. Sepsis REF: Clinical endocrine oncology by Ian D. Hay, John A. H. Wass Page 91 See APPENDIX-26 below for list of tumor markers Calcitonin (CT) is the main medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) tumor marker. However, it has several limitations, including a concentration-dependent biphasic half-life, sensitivity to rapid in vitro degradation, and the presence of different isoforms/fragments. Procalcitonin (PCT), the prohormone of calcitonin, is free of these limitations but is currently used only as a sepsis marker. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antimicrobial chemotherapy is of paramount importance to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with sepsi Inflammatory markers currently in use, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) do not reliably differentiate between the systemic inflammatory response and sepsis. Procalcitonin (PCT), a precursor of calcitonin, is a 116 amino acid protein that has been proposed as a marker of disease severity in conditions such as septicaemia, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI) and fungal and parasitic infection. In particular, serial measurements are useful in order to monitor response to therapy. Together with good clinical judgement and judicious use of antimicrobial agents, PCT should serve as a valuable adjunct in the diagnosis and management of sepsis.

This disorder typically features diffuse atrophic gastritis, antibodies to parietal cells and the intrinsic factor, and increased serum gastrin due to G-cell hyperplasia. Immunologic destruction of parietal cells and antibody targeting of intrinsic factor interfere with intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 . As a result, all lineages of bone marrow precursors show asynchronous maturation between the nucleus and cytoplasm (megaloblastic cells), and the peripheral blood displays megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia that is caused by malabsorption of vitamin B12 , occasioned by a deficiency of the intrinsic factor, is referred to as ""pernicious anemia.""

"A 67-year-old male is found on rectal examination to have a single, hard, irregular nodule within his prostate. A biopsy of this lesion reveals the presence of small glands lined by a single layer of cells with enlarged, prominent nucleoli. From what poion of the prostate did this lesion most likely originate?",Anterior zone,Central zone,Peripheral zone,Transition zone,"Knowledge of the anatomic division of the prostate is impoant in understanding the locations of the major pathologic diseases of the prostate. Most adenocarcinomas of the prostate originate in the peripheral zone, while hyperplastic nodules originate in the transition zone. This anatomic differentiation is the result of the physiologic fact that the transition zone is paicularly estrogen-sensitive, while the peripheral zone is paicularly androgensensitive. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is formed from testosterone by the action of 5-a-reductase, is responsible for the development of the prostate during fetal growth and also at the time of pubey. With aging, DHT levels are increased in the prostate, where DHT binds to nuclear DNA and causes prostatic hyperplasia. This hyperplastic effect by DHT is augmented by estrogen, which appears to function by induction of androgen receptors, and therefore this hyperplasia occurs in the poion of the prostate that is paicularly estrogen-sensitive.

What is the most accurate diagnosis for this bladder tumor?","Adenocarcinoma, noninvasive",Inveed papilloma,Transitional cell carcinoma in situ,"Papillary transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), noninvasive","Neoplastic lesions of the urinary bladder may either be benign or malignant. There is some controversy involving some types of benign lesions of the bladder. In paicular, there is disagreement as to whether papillary lesions may be benign (papillomas). Many pathologists would classify papillary transitional lesions that lack cellular atypia or numerous mitoses as grade I (low-grade) papillary transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) and not papillomas. Pathologists do agree, however, on the existence of a rare type of benign lesion called an inveed papilloma, which is characterized by nodular mucosal lesions that histologically have an endophytic growth pattern. Malignant neoplasms of the bladder may be transitional cell carcinomas, which are by far the most common type of tumor of the urinary bladder; squamous cell carcinomas, which produce keratin; or adenocarcinomas, which form glandular structures. TCCs may be either papillary or flat lesions. Papillary TCCs, which are the most common type of bladder cancer, may be either invasive or noninvasive. Noninvasive papillary TCCs are not referred to as being in situ, as that term implies a noninvasive, nonpapillary lesion. Nonpapillary (flat) TCCs may also be invasive (into the lamina propria or muscularis) or noninvasive (in situ). In contrast, squamous cell carcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare except in Egypt and other areas of the Middle East, where they are associated with schistosomiasis. Similarly, adenocarcinomas of the urinary bladder are quite rare, except that they may be associated with urachal epithelial remnants located in the dome of the bladder, glandular metaplasia, or cystitis glandularis.

Which of the following statements best characterizes natural killer cells?,They are a subset of T cells,They are involved in type III hypersensitivity reactions,They require prior sensitization in order to kill virally infected cells or tumor cells,They paicipate in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reactions,"Natural killer (NK) cells account for 5% to 10% of lymphocytes. They paicipate in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity reactions (type II hypersensitivity reactions). NK cells are not T cells and are sometimes referred to as null cells. They can lyse virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. NK cells are frequently referred to as large granular lymphocytes, and would not be confused with small B cells. When activated by interleukin-l, NK cells become lymphocyte-activated killer cells (LAK cells), which can be used to treat ceain cancers. NK cells are a source of gamma interferon, which induces class II expression and activates macroptIages.",D
"A 23-year-old, sexually active man has been treated for Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection 6 times during the past 5 years. He now comes to the physician because of the increasing number and size of warty lesions slowly enlarging on his external genitalia during the past year. On physical examination, there are multiple 1- to 3-mm sessile, nonulcerated, papillary excrescences over the inner surface of the penile prepuce. These lesions are excised, but 2 years later, similar lesions appear. Which of the following conditions most likely predisposed him to the development of these recurrent lesions?",Candida albicans infection,Circumcision,Human papillomavirus infection,Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection,"Condyloma acuminatum is a benign, recurrent squamous epithelial proliferation resulting from infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, one of many sexually transmitted diseases that can occur in sexually active individuals. Koilocytosis is particularly characteristic of HPV infection. Candidiasis can be associated with inflammation, such as balanoposthitis, but not condylomata. Recurrent gonococcal infection indicates that the patient is sexually active and at risk for additional infections, but is not the cause for the condylomata. The gonococcal infection causes suppurative lesions in which there may be liquefactive necrosis and a neutrophilic exudate or mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Circumcision generally reduces risks for infections. Phimosis is a nonretractile prepuce, and paraphimosis refers to forcible retraction of the prepuce that produces pain and urinary obstruction.",C
"In the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, the activation of RAS is counteracted by-",Protein kinase C,GTPase activating protein,Phosphatidylinositol,Inositol triphosphate,"RAS protein is a signal transducing protein.
Signal transducing proteins receive growth signals from outside the cell and transmit it to the nucleus.
Normally RAS proteins are attached to the cytoplasmic aspect of the plasma membrane where they keep on converting between an active signal transmitting state and an inactive quiescent state.
In the inactive state,Â the RAS proteins bind Guanosine diphosphate (GDP).
When the cells are stimulated by growth factors or other receptor - ligand interactions, RAS becomes activated by exchanging GDP for GTP.
This activates RAS then recruits raf - 1 and activates MAP-kinase pathway.
The MAP kinases so activated target nuclear transcription factors and then they promote mitogenesis.
The net result of this pathway is activation of protein phosphorylation cascade which amplifies the signal and stimulates quiescent cells to enter the growth cycle.
In the normal cells the activated state of this RAS protein is transient because the normal RAS proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity.
This GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP to GDP and thus returns the RAS protein to its normal quiescent stage.
Now, what is the role of GTPase activating proteins, (GAPS) in this pathway.
The GTPase activating protien (GAPS) significantly accelarates the intrinsic GTPase activity of the active RAS protein.
The (GAPs) bind to the active RAS and augment its GTPase activity by more than 1000 fold leading to rapid hydrolysis of GTP back to GDP.
Thus GAPs function as brakes that prevents uncontrolled RAS activity.
Mutation of the RAS protein causes cancer.
Mutation in the RAS protein causes permanent activation of the RAS protein. The mutant RAS protein can bind to GAP but their GTPase activity fails to be augumented. Therefore the mutant RASÂ proteins are trapped in their excited GTP bound form. This causes pathological activation of mitogenic signalling pathway leading to continuous stimulation of cells without any external trigger.

MHC restriction is a pa of all except aEUR',Antiviral cytotoxic T cell,Antibacterial helper T cell/cytotoxic cells,Allograft rejection,Autoimmune disorder,"Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex : Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i.e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this ??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell .first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell's surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host's own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

Granulomatous arteritis is the most characteristic of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated granulomatous vasculitis, which often involves the kidney but typically involves the lung and other organs. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is seen with long-standing essential hypertension of moderate severity. These lesions give rise to benign nephrosclerosis.

Which of the following is the MOST common histological variant of prostate cancer?,Adenocarcinoma,Sarcoma,Seminoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,"Prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas that arise from the prostatic acinar cells. In eighty-five percent of the cases, the adenocarcinoma is multifocal. Prostate cancers are graded according to their dysplasia, utilizing the Gleason scoring system. Sarcoma of the prostate accounts for 0.1% of all malignant prostatic tumors. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most frequent mesenchymal tumor within the prostate, and is seen almost exclusively in childhood. Seminomas are not seen within the prostate. Seminoma is a germ cell tumor of the testis. Primary squamous carcinoma of the prostate is rare and is associated with a poor survival. More commonly, squamous differentiation occurs in the primary and metastatic deposits of adenocarcinomas after estrogen therapy. Also Know: Over 75% of cancers occur in the outer pa of the gland--mainly in the posterior pa. The most widely used and the one that correlates best with survival is Gleason's system, which uses two numbers representing the two predominant patterns in the tumor. The best- and worst-differentiated patterns, according to this system, are 1,1 (pure grade 1 lesions) and 5,5 (pure grade 5 lesions), respectively; a grade 2,4 carcinoma would show a mixture of moderately and poorly differentiated areas.

Oxygen dependent killing is done through-,NADPH oxidase,Superoxide dismutase,Catalase,Glutathione peroxidase,"ROS are synthesized the NADPH oxidase (phagocyte oxidase) pathway and are released from neutrophils and macrophages that are activated by microbes, immune complexes, cytokines, and a variety of other inflammatory stimuli. NADPH oxidase also called respiratory burst oxidase When the ROS are produced within lysosomes they function to destroy phagocytosed microbes and necrotic cells Catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are free radical scavengers that prevent oxygen-mediated injury The NADPH oxidase complex is dormant under normal circumstances, but is activated to assemble in the membranes during respiratory burst The activated NADPH oxidase generates superoxide which has roles in animal immune response and plant signalling. Superoxide can be produced in phagosomeswhich have ingested bacteria and fungi or it can be produced outside of the cell. Superoxide kills bacteria and fungi by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood.It is presumed that superoxide kills bacteria directly, as the virulence of many pathogens is dramatically attenuated when their superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes are deleted. However, superoxide can also spontaneously form hydrogen peroxide that undergoes fuher reactions to generate other (ROS) like hydrochlorus acid (the reactive agent in bleach). It may also inactivate critical metabolic enzymes, initiate lipid peroxidation, damage iron sulphate clustersand liberate redox-active iron, which allows the generation of indiscriminate oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical ref robbins basic pathology 9th ed page 49",A

A 52-year-old woman has long-standing rheumatoid ahritis (RA) and is being treated with coicosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Which of the following cardiac complications may arise in this clinical setting?,Constrictive pericarditis,Restrictive cardiomyopathy,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Hyperophic cardiomyopathy,"Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as RA are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, hea, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i.e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Note:Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis.Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. Most cases of hyperophic cardiomyopathy are familial and due to mutations in one of the genes encoding proteins of the sarcomeres, most frequently b-myosin heavy chain. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to asymmetric hyperophy of the left ventricle, with prominent thickening of the interventricular septum. In this case, too, impairment of ventricular compliance is the basic mechanism leading to reduced diastolic filling and hea failure. Ref: Stevenson L.W., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 238.

"A 27-year-old male presents with a testicular mass, which is resected and diagnosed as being a yolk sac tumor. Which one of the listed substances is most likely to be increased in this patient's serum as a result of being secreted from the cells of this tumor?",Acid phosphatase,a fetoprotein (AFP),Alkaline phosphatase,b-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-hCG),"Germ cell tumors of the testis often secrete enzymes or polypeptide hormones, examples of which include a fetoprotein (AFP) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). AFP is synthesized by the fetal gut, liver, and yolk sac. It may be secreted by either yolk sac tumors (endodermal sinus tumors) or embryonal carcinomas. AFP may also be secreted by liver cell carcinomas. b-hCG is a glycoprotein that is normally synthesized by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. Markedly elevated serum levels are most often associated with choriocarcinomas, which are characterized histologically by a mixture of malignant cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Mildly elevated serum levels of b-hCG may be found in patients with other types of germ cell tumors if they contain syncytiotrophoblast-like giant cells. This is found in about 10% of classic seminomas, which are characterized histologically by large cells with distinct cell membranes and clear cytoplasm. An impoant, distinct variant of seminoma is the spermatocytic seminoma. It is characterized by being found in older individuals and by the fact that it does not metastasize. Histologically, a spermatocytic seminoma is characterized by maturation of the tumor cells, some of which histologically resemble secondary spermatocytes. To summarize: markedly elevated levels of hCG are associated with choriocarcinomas, while elevated levels of AFP are most characteristic of yolk sac tumors and embryonal carcinomas. But there are many areas of overlap between tumors, and many tumors are composed of multiple types of germ cell cancers. The only definitive statement that can be made is that elevated serum levels of AFP cannot be seen in a tumor that is a pure seminoma.

Necrosis with putrefaction is called as:,Desiccation,Gangrene,Liquefaction,Coagulative necrosis,"GANGRENE
Gangrene is a form of necrosis of tissue with superadded putrefaction. The type of necrosis is usually coagulative due to ischemia (e.g. in gangrene of the bowel, gangrene of limb).Â  On the other hand,Â  gangrenous or necrotizing inflammation is characterized by primary inflammation provoked by virulent bacteria resulting in massive tissue necrosis. Thus, the end-result of necrotizing inflammation and gangrene is the same but the way the two are produced is different.Â  The examples of necrotising inflammation are gangrenous appendicitis, gangrenous stomatitis (noma, cancrum oris). There are 2 main forms of gangreneâdry and wet, and a variant form of wet gangrene called gas gangrene. In all types of gangrene, necrosis undergoes liquefaction by the action of putrefactive bacteria.

Steroid resistant nephritic syndrome ?,Nephrin,Alpha-actinin-4,Podocin,Transient Receptor Potential 6,Podocin The glomerular capillary wall is a filtering membrane and consists of the following structures i) Endothelial cells ii) Glomerular basement membrane iii) Visceral epithelial cells (podocytes) iv) Mesangial cells The visceral epithelial cell known as podocyte is impoant for the maintenance of glomerular barrier function. They are structurally complex cells that possess interdigitating foot processes (pedicels). The adjacent foot processes are separated by 20-30 rim wide filtration slits. The filtration slit or slit diaphragm maintains glomerular barrier function. They present a size selective distal diffusion barrier to the filtration of proteins and it is the cell type that is largely responsible for the synthesis of GBM components. Proteins located in the slit diaphragm control glomerular permeability. Impoant proteins have been identified in this regard - Nephrin - Podocin (impoant in structural organization of slit diaphragm) - CD2 associated protein and - Actin cytoskeleton The impoance of these proteins in maintaining glomerular permeability is demonstrated by the observation that mutations in the gene encoding them give rise to nephrotic syndrome.

Which of the following helps in generating oxygen burst in the neurophils ?,NADPH oxidase,Sod (superoxide dismutase),Catalase,Glutathione peroxidose,"NADPH oxidase Although oxygen is the lifeline of all cells and tissues, its molecular form i.e., oxygen free radicals (or reactive oxygen intermediate) are devastating for cells. Cells generate energy by reducing molecular oxygen to water. During this process small amounts of paially reduced reactive oxygen forms are produced as a byproduct of respiration. They are called free radicals or reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are chemical species that have single unpaired electron in an outer orbit. This makes them highly reactive. Free radicals are devastating for the cell as they damage lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Examples of free radical or reactive oxygen species Superoxide 02- Hydroxyl radical OH? Hydrogen peroxide (H202) The noxious effect of free radicals on various cellular material is being utilized by neutrophils to kill bacterias or other microorganisms. Once the neutrophils phagocytize the bacterias there is rapid respiratory burst in the neutrophils which leads to increased oxygen consumption, glycogenolysis and increased glucose oxidation. These reactions lead to rapid burst of superoxide (and other. free radical) production as a by product of the oxidation. This rapid burst in oxidative respiration is made possible by the rapid activation of an enzyme complex, NADPH oxidase, which oxidizes NADPH and in the process reduces oxygen to superoxide anion (024 NADPH oxidase is an enzyme complex that consists of at least seven proteins. The enzyme consists of two complex ? a) Membrane complex b) Cytosolic complex In resting neutrophils various components of this enzyme complex is located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. When the neutrophils are activated the enzyme complex shifts to the phagosomal membrane. The H202generated by the NADPH oxidase system is generally not able to efficiently kill microbes by itself However, azurophilic granules of neutrophils release the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halides such as Cl- conves 11202 to HOCL. The latter is a potent antimicrobial agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H202 - MPO halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils.",A

Irreversible cell injury is indicated by,Accumulation of calcium in endoplasmic reticulum,Myelin figures,ATP depletion,Shifting of Ribosomes,"The hallmark of irreversible cell injury is a loss of integrity of cell membrane and lysosomal membranes Myelin figures are phospholipid deposits formed as a result of cell membrane integrity loss; Seen in the very late phase of reversible injury and irreversible injury. Necrosis Necrosis is the type of cell death that is associated with loss of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular contents cul- minating in dissolution of cells, largely resulting from the degradative action of enzymes on lethally injured cells. The leaked cellular contents often elicit a local host reaction, called inflammation, that attempts to eliminate the dead cells and sta the subsequent repair process (Chapter 2). The enzymes responsible for digestion of the cell may be derived from the lysosomes of the dying cells themselves and from the lysosomes of leukocytes that are recruited as pa of the inflammatory reaction to the dead cells. MORPHOLOGY Necrosis is characterized by changes in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the injured cells (Figs. 1-6, left, and 1-8, C). * Cytoplasmic changes. Necrotic cells show increased eosinophilia (i.e., pink staining from the eosin dye--the E in the hematoxylin and eosin stain), attributable in pa to increased binding of eosin to denatured cyto- plasmic proteins and in pa to loss of the basophilia that is normally impaed by the ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the cytoplasm (basophilia is the blue staining from the hema- toxylin dye--the H in ""H&E""). Compared with ble cells, the cell may have a more glassy, homogeneous appear- ance, mostly because of the loss of glycogen paicles. Myelin figures are more prominent in necrotic cells than during reversible injury. When enzymes have digested cytoplasmic organelles, the cytoplasm becomes vacuo- lated and appears ""moth-eaten."" By electron microscopy, necrotic cells are characterized by discontinuities in plasma and organelle membranes, marked dilation of mitochon- dria with the appearance of large amorphous densities, disruption of lysosomes, and intracytoplasmic myelin figures. * Nuclear changes. Nuclear changes assume one of three patterns, all due to breakdown of DNA and chromatin. The basophilia of the chromatin may fade (karyolysis), presumably secondary to deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity. A second pattern is pyknosis, characterized by nuclear shrinkage and increased basophilia; the DNA con- denses into a solid shrunken mass. In the third pattern, karyorrhexis, the pyknotic nucleus undergoes fragmen- tation. In 1 to 2 days, the nucleus in a dead cell may completely disappear. Electron microscopy reveals pro- found nuclear changes culminating in nuclear dissolution. * Fates of necrotic cells. Necrotic cells may persist for some time or may be digested by enzymes and disappear. Dead cells may be replaced by myelin figures, which are either phagocytosed by other cells or fuher degraded into fatty acids. These fatty acids bind calcium salts, which may result in the dead cells ultimately becoming calcified. Refer robbins 9/e p834",B

Other neoplasms found in HIV patients are: B-cell NHL, primary brain lymphoma and invasive carcinoma cervix.# HHV-8 or KSHV is strongly implicated as a viral cofactor in the pathogenesis of KS.# Cutaneous lesions are the most common.# Factor VIII of coagulation cascade is immunohistochemistry marker of KS.# Clinically, the initial lesion may be a small, raised reddish-purple nodule on the skin, a discoloration on the oral mucosa, or a swollen lymph node.# Lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas, particularly the tip of the nose, and have a propensity to occur in areas of trauma (Koebner phenomenon).# Some 80% of patients with pulmonary KS have cutaneous lesions, which appear as raised macules.# Apart from skin, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs are the organ systems most commonly affected by KS.# Lesions have been reported in virtually every organ, including the heart and the CNS.# In contrast to most malignancies, in which lymph node involvement implies metastatic spread and a poor prognosis, lymph node involvement may be seen very early in KS and is of no special clinical significance.# CXR characteristically shows bilateral ground-glass haziness, lower lobe infiltrates that obscure the margins of the mediastinum and diaphragm.# Pleural effusions are seen in 70% of cases of pulmonary KS, a fact that is often helpful in the differential diagnosis.# A diagnosis of KS is based upon biopsy of a suspicious lesion.# Histologically one sees a proliferation of spindle cells and endothelial cells, extravasation of red blood cells, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and, in early cases, an inflammatory cell infiltrate.Management of KS:# Spontaneous regressions have been reported in the setting of HAART.# Treatment is indicated under two main circumstances. The first is when a single lesion or a limited number of lesions are causing significant discomfort or cosmetic problems, such as with prominent facial lesions, lesions overlying a joint, or lesions in the oropharynx that interfere with swallowing or breathing.# Under these circumstances, Rx with localized radiation, intralesional vinblastine, or cryotherapy may be indicated.# Note that patients with HIV infection are particularly sensitive to side effects of radiation therapy.# The single most important determinant of response appears to be the CD4 T cell count.# IFN-alpha provides an added advantage of having antiretroviral activity; thus, it may be the appropriate first choice for single-agent systemic therapy for early patients with disseminated disease.# Liposomal daunorubicin, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel have been approved by the FDA for this indication. Liposomal daunorubicin is approved as first-line therapy for patients with advanced KS.",A
"A 25-year-old man experiences acute onset of fever, cough, dyspnea, headache, and malaise a day after moving into a new apartment. His symptoms subside over 3 days when he visits a friend in another city. On the day of his return, the symptoms recur. There are no remarkable findings on physical examination. A chest radiograph also is unremarkable. Which of the following pathogenic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings?",Antigen-antibody complex-mediated injury,Antibody-mediated injury to basement membrane,Formation of mycolic acid as a result of tubercular infection,Generation of prostaglandins by basophil recruitment,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has acute symptoms that occur soon after exposure to an antigen, often actinomycetes or fungi (molds) growing in contaminated HVAC systems (air conditioner or ventilation ducts). The symptoms improve when the patient leaves the environment where the antigen is located. The pulmonary pathologic changes are usually minimal, with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates. It is mainly a type III hypersensitivity reaction, but with more chronic exposure to the antigen, there may be a component of type IV hypersensitivity with granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Attachment of antibody to basement membrane occurs in Goodpasture syndrome. Mycolic acid is a component of the cell wall of mycobacteria, and infections with these organisms are chronic, not episodic. Prostaglandins are produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism during acute inflammation, and they mediate pain and vasodilation. Histamine release is characteristic of a type I hypersensitivity reaction that more typically occurs in allergic disease. A toxic injury is more typical of inhalation of a toxic gas, such as sulfur dioxide (so-called silo filler's disease).",A

Cluster of nests of squamous epithelial cells found microscopically in tissue taken from approximate site used by dentist for injection of Inferior alveolar nerve,Juxtra oral organ of Chievitz,Max Joseph organ,Both,None,"The juxtaoral organ is a small structure located within the soft tissue overlying the angle of the mandible in the buccotemporal space. It is composed of an epithelial parenchyma embedded in a highly organized connective tissue stroma rich in nerves and sensory receptors innervated by the buccal nerve. This metabolically active structure presumably serves as a mechanosensor in the lateral wall of the oral cavity. Needless surgical removal of this juxtaoral structure is therefore best avoided. In children, the normal organ may be discovered as a small mass in the cheeks, which may lead to extensive and unnecessary investigations. Hyperplasia of the parenchyma may occur, but carcinoma originating from this organ has not been reported.
Conclusion: Awareness of this normal anatomic structure is important, because the finding of epithelial islands intimately admixed with nerves could be misinterpreted as perineural invasion by carcinoma.",A
True about NK cells are all of the following except: March 2005,Mediates type IV hypersensitivity,Kill viruses,They are large granular lymphocytes,Releases small cytoplasmic granules of proteins called perforin and granzyme,"Ans. A: Mediates type IV hypersensitivity NK cells are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte that constitute a major component of the innate immune system. NK cells play a major role in the rejection of tumors and cells infected by viruses. They kill cells by releasing small cytoplasmic granules of proteins called perforin and granzyme that cause the target cell to die by apoptosis. NK cells are defined as large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and constitute the third kind of cells differentiated from the common lymphoid progenitor generating B and T lymphocytes. They do not express T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) or Pan T marker CD3 or surface immunoglobulins (Ig) B cell receptors but they usually express the surface markers CD16 and CD56 in humans. Up to 80% of NK cells also express CD8. They were named ""natural killers"" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing ""self"" markers of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Type IV (cell mediated immunity) is mediated by T-cells.",A

The ability of stem cells to cross the barrier of differentiation to transform into a cell of another lineage expressing the molecular characteristics of different cell type with the ability to perform the function of the new cell type is referred as:,De differentiation,Re differentiation,Trans differentiation,Sub differentiation,"Transdifferentiation is definedÂ as:-

The change of a cell or tissue from one differentiated state to another.
The differentiation of a tissue-specificÂ stem cell into another type of cell as for example a bone marrow stem cellÂ differentiating into a neuron.

Dedifferentiation

It is a cellular process commonly believed to be uniquely available to lower life forms such as worms andÂ amphibians in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage.
Cells in cell culture can lose properties they originally had such as protein expression or change shape. ThisÂ process is also termed dedifferentiation.
Dedifferentiation can also be observed in some tumour e.g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas which will show moreÂ immature areas in an otherwise differentiated liposarcoma.
Regression of a specialized cell or tissue to a simpler, more embryonic, unspecialized form i.e. a reversal of cellÂ development so that differentiation that had occurred previously is lost and the cells become more generalized inÂ structure.

Mediastinal lymph node calcification is seen in which one of the following-,Metastatic neoplasm,Lymphoma,Sarcoidosis,Bronchiectasis,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (""lymphangitic"" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are ""nonmatted"" (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",C
Immune complex deposition is-,Type I HS,Type II HS,Type III HS,Type IV HS,"Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com-plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro-teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen-antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e.g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions. Immune complex diseases are some of the most common immunologic diseases Robbins 9 th edition page 129",C

Whether the PAS positivity of a particular cell is due to presence of glycogen or due to latter can be differentiated with diastase (glycogen digesting enzyme).
If the cell is PAS positive due to glycogen, the pretreatment with diastase will make it PAS negative. But if the cell is PAS positive due to non glycogen substances, the cell will retain its PAS positivity even after pretreatment with diastase. So, in the given question, the presence of PAS positive and diastase resistant material indicates presence of non glycogen substances.
The clinical feature of delayed milestones and hepatosplenomegaly in 1 year old boy is suggestive of some lysosomal storage disorder (like Niemann Picks disease).

"A 36-year-old male presents because his skin has been darkening recently. You notice that his skin has a dark, somewhat bronze color. Workup reveals signs of diabetes mellitus. His serum iron is found to be 1150 mg/dL, and his transferrin saturation is 98%. A liver biopsy is performed and reveals extensive deposits of hemosiderin in the hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. The mechanism most likely responsible for this constellation of findings is",Defective excretion of copper into the bile,Defective synthesis of a1 antitrypsin,Excessive reabsorption of iron from the small intestines,Excessive absorption of galactose from the small intestines,"Abnormalities of metabolism are associated with a diverse group of liver diseases. Hemochromatosis (excessive accumulation of body iron) may be primary or secondary. Primary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism that is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. The classic clinical triad for this disease consists of micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation. The combination of diabetes and skin pigmentation is called bronze diabetes. In the majority of patients serum iron is above 250 mg/dL, serum ferritin is above 500 ng/dL, and iron (transferrin) saturation approaches 100%. In patients with primary hemochromatosis, the excess iron is deposited in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells of many organs, including the liver and pancreas. Liver deposition of iron leads to cirrhosis, which in turn increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Iron deposition in the islets of the pancreas leads to diabetes mellitus. Iron deposition in the hea leads to congestive hea failure, which is the major cause of death in these patients. Deposition of iron in the joints leads to ahritis, while deposition in the testes leads to atrophy. Secondary hemochromatosis, also called systemic hemosiderosis, is most common in patients with hemolytic anemias, such as thalassemia. Excess iron may also be due to an excessive number of transfusions or to increased absorption of dietary iron. In idiopathic (primary) hemochromatosis, iron accumulates in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells, but in secondary hemochromatosis the iron is deposited in the mononuclear phagocytic system. In both conditions the iron is deposited as hemosiderin, which stains an intense blue color with Prussian blue stain. Since the iron deposition does not usually occur in the parenchymal cells in secondary hemochromatosis, there usually is no organ dysfunction or injury Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",C

Factors influencing wound healing are the following:,Nutrition,Adequate blood supply,Size and location of wound,All of the above,"Factors That Impair Tissue RepairÂ 
Tissue repair may be impaired by a variety of factors that reduce the quality or adequacy of the reparative process. Factors that interfere with healing may be extrinsic (e.g., infection) or intrinsic to the injured tissue, and systemic or local:

Infection is one of the most important causes of delayed healing; it prolongs inflammation and potentially increases the local tissue injury.
Diabetes is a metabolic disease that compromises tissue repair for many reasons, and is an important systemic cause of abnormal wound healing.
Nutritional status has profound effects on repair; protein malnutrition and vitamin C deficiency, for example, inhibit collagen synthesis and retard healing.
Glucocorticoids (steroids) have well-documented anti-inflammatory effects, and their administration may result in weak scarsÂ because they inhibit TGF-Î²Â production and diminish fibrosis. In some instances, however, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are desirable. For example, in corneal infections, glucocorticoids may be prescribed (along with antibiotics) to reduce the likelihood of opacity due to collagen deposition.
Mechanical factors such as increased local pressure or torsion may cause wounds to pull apart (dehisce).
Poor perfusion, resulting either from arteriosclerosis and diabetes or from obstructed venous drainage (e.g., in varicose veins), also impairs healing.
Foreign bodies such as fragments of steel, glass, or even bone impede healing.
The type and extent of tissue injury affects subsequent repair. Complete restoration can occur only in tissues composed of cells capable of proliferating: even then, an extensive injury will probably result in incomplete tissue regeneration and at least partial loss of function. Injury to tissues composed of non-dividing cells must inevitably result in scarring; such is the case with healing of a myocardial infarct.
The location of the injury and the character of the tissue in which the injury occurs also are important.

Petechiae measure less than 2 mm in size, purpuric lesions measure 2 mm to 1 cm, and ecchymoses are larger than 1 cm. Erythema and telangiectasis do not involve hemorrhage outside of blood vessels. They can be differentiated from true hemorrhages into the skin by the fact that they blanch if direct pressure is applied to them. True purpura may be caused by hemostatic or nonhemostatic defects. Hemostatic defects are caused by platelet or coagulation abnormalities, while nonhemostatic defects generally involve the blood vessels. These vascular abnormalities can be separated into palpable and nonpalpable purpura. The latter may be caused by excess coicosteroids (Cushing's syndrome), vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), infectious agents, or abnormal connective tissue diseases (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). Causes of palpable purpura include diseases that cause cutaneous vasculitis, such as collagen vascular diseases and Henoch-Schonlein purpura. The latter, also known as anaphylactoid purpura, is a type of hypersensitivity vasculitis found in children. It usually develops 1 to 3 weeks following a streptococcal infection, but it may also occur in relation to allergic food reactions.

Most common type of emphysema is: March 2013,Centriacinar,Panacinar,Paraseptal,Irregular,"Ans. A i.e. Centriacinar Emphysema It is COPD. It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs. - Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema. - Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax.

A 23-year-old female presented with jaundice and pallor for 2 months. Her peripheral blood smear shows the presence of spherocytes. The most relevant investigation to arrive at a diagnosis is:,Tests for PNH,Osmotic fragility test,Coombs test,Reticulocyte count,"The presence of spherocytes can be seen in the following conditions:

Hereditary spherocytosis
Autoimmune hemlolytic anemia
G6PD deficiency
Infections
Burns
Hemolytic disease of new born
PNH is not a cause for the presence of spherocytes; so, no test for this condition is required.
Osmotic fragility is increased with spherocytes. So, it does not add anything to our existing information about the disease causing spherocyte formation.
Reticulocyte count is expected to be elevated in the setting of haemolytic anemia (suggested by jaundice and pallor).

Coombs test is done for detection of the antibodies formed against the normal antigens present on the surface of cells like platelets and red blood cells. So, it is going to be positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia whereas negative in hereditary spherocytosis. Thus, a differentiation between these conditions can be done.",C
Which of the following is NOT true about Cutaneous calciphylaxis?,Potentially lethal condition,Exemplifies dystrophic calcification,Characterized by progressive cutaneous vascular calcification,"Includes increased calcium, phosphate, and parathor- mone patients with chronic renal failure","Ans. b (Exemplifies dystrophic calcification). (Ref. Harrison's medicine 18th/pg. Ch. 280)'In calcinosis cutis there are firm white to white-yellow papules with an irregular surface. When the contents are expressed, a chalky white material is seen. Dystrophic calcification is seen at sites of previous inflammation or damage to the skin. It develops in acne scars as well as on the distal extremities of patients with scleroderma and in the subcutaneous tissue and intermuscular fascial planes in DM. The latter is more extensive and is more commonly seen in children. An elevated calcium phosphate product, most commonly due to secondary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of renal failure, can lead to nodules of metastatic calcinosis cutis, which tend to be subcutaneous and periarticular. These patients can also develop calcification of muscular arteries and subsequent ischemic necrosis (calciphylaxis).Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathv)# It is a devastating condition seen almost exclusively in patients with advanced CKD.# It is heralded by livedo reticularis and advances to patches of ischemic necrosis, especially on the legs, thighs, abdomen, and breasts. Pathologically, there is evidence of vascular occlusion in association with extensive vascular and soft tissue calcification.# It appears that this condition is increasing in incidence. Originally it was ascribed to severe abnormalities in calcium and phosphorus control in dialysis patients, usually associated with advanced hyperparathyroidism. However, more recently, calciphylaxis has been seen with increasing frequency in the absence of severe hyperparathyroidism.# Other etiologies have been suggested, including the increased use of oral calcium as a phosphate binder. Warfarin is commonly used in hemodialysis patients, and one of the effects of warfarin therapy is to decrease the vitamin K- dependent regeneration of matrix GLA protein. This latter protein is important in preventing vascular calcification. Thus, warfarin treatment is considered a risk factor for calciphylaxis, and if a patient develops this syndrome, this medication should be discontinued and replaced with alternative forms of anticoagulation.",B

CA 19-9 is a marker for which of the following:September 2011,Pancreatic carcinoma,Breast carcinoma,Ovarian carcinoma,Lung carcinoma,"Ans. A: Pancreatic carcinomaCA 19-9 is tumour marker for colon cancer and pancreatic cancerCA19-9/ Carbohydrate antigen 19-9/ Cancer antigen 19-9/ Sialylated Lewis (a) antigenIt was discovered in patients with colon cancer and pancreatic cancer in 1981.Increased levels of CA19-9 are also found in non-malignant conditions, such as Mirizzi's syndrome and diseases ofthe bile ducts and liver.Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the use of CA19-9 as a test for cancer, paicularly pancreatic cancer.The reason is that the test may be falsely normal (false negative) in many cases, or abnormally elevated in people who have no cancer at all (false positive).The main use of CA19-9 is therefore to see whether a pancreatic tumor is secreting it; if that is the case, then the levels should fall when the tumor is treated, and they may rise again if the disease recurs.In patients who lack the Lewis antigen (a blood type protein on red blood cells), which is about 5% of the population, CA19-9 is not elevated in pancreatic cancer even with large tumors because they have a deficiency of a fucosyltransferase enzyme that is needed to produce CA19-9 as well as the Lewis antigen",A

Values return to normal within three to four days.CK-MB: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 24 hours. Values return to normal within 72 hours.Troponin T: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours.Troponin I: The values begin to rise within two to four hours and peak at 48 hours.Myoglobin: The values begin to rise within one to two hours and peak at four to eight hours. Values return to normal within 12-24 hours.Homocysteine: Moderate, intermediate, and severe hyperhomocysteinemia refer to concentrations between 16 and 30, between 31 and 100, and less than 100 micromol/ L, respectively.C-reactive proteinMyoglobin is a protein found in both skeletal and myocardial muscle.It is released rapidly after tissue injury and may be elevated as early as one hour after myocardial injury, though it may also be elevated due to skeletal muscle trauma.However, if myoglobin values do not rise within three to four hours after a person shows acute symptoms, it is highly unlikely that he or she had an MI.",C

Which of the following congenital lesion is deformity:,Potter sequence,CTEV,Congenital heart disease,Cleft lip,"Ans: B (CTEV) CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Robbins 7th/470-74# Congenital anomalies are morphologic defects that are present at birth, but some, such as cardiac defects and renal anomalies, may not become clinically apparent until years later.The term congenital does not imply or exclude a genetic basis for the birth defect. It is estimated that about 3% of newborns have a major anomaly, defined as an anomaly having either cosmetic or functional significance.Various kinds of errors in morphogenesis are--mal- formations, disruptions, deformations, sequences, and syndromes.MalformationsIt represents primary errors of morphogenesis, in other words there is an intrinsically abnormal developmental process.They are usually multifactorial rather than the result of a single gene or chromosomal defect.Some, such as congenital heart defects and anencephaiy (absence of brain), involve single body systems, whereas in other cases multiple malformations involving many organs may coexist.DisruptionsIt result from secondary destruction of an organ or body region that was previously normal in development; thus, in contrast to malformations, disruptions arise from an extrinsic disturbance in morphogenesis.Understandably, disruptions are not heritable and hence are not associated with risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies.Deformations Robbins 7th/472It like disruptions, also representan extrinsic disturbance of deve/opmentratherthananintrinsicerrorofmorphogenesis.Deformations are common problems, affecting approximately 2% of newborn infants to varying degrees. Fundamental to the pathogenesis of deformations is localized or generalized compression of the growing fetus by abnormal biomechanical forces, leading eventually to a variety of structural abnormalities.The most common underlying factor responsible for deformations is uterine constraint. Between the 35th and 38th weeks of gestation, rapid increase in the size of the fetus outpaces the growth of the uterus, and the relative amount of amniotic fluid (which normally acts as a cushion) also decreases. Thus, even the normal fetus is subjected to some form of uterine constraint.Several factors increase the likelihood of excessive compression of the fetus resulting in deformations. Maternal factors include first pregnancy, small uterus, malformed (bicornuate) uterus, and leiomyomas. Fetal or placental factors include oligohydramnios, multiple fetuses, and abnormal fetal presentation.An example of a deformation is clubfeet (CTEV), often a component of Potter sequenceSequenceIt is a pattern of cascade anomalies. Approximately half the time, congenital anomalies occur singly; in the remaining cases, multiple congenital anomalies are recognized.In some instances, the constellation of anomalies may be explained by a single, localized aberration in organogenesis (malformation, disruption, or deformation) leading to secondary effects in other organs.A good example of a sequence is the oligohydramnios (or Potter) sequenceSyndromeIt is a constellation of congenital anomalies, believed to be pathologically related, that, in contrast to a sequence, cannot be explained on the basis of a single, localized, initiating defect.Syndromes are most often caused by a single etiologic agent, such as a viral infection or specific chromosomal abnormalitv, which simultaneously affects several tissues.Fig. Malformations. Human malformations can range in severity from the incidental to the lethal. Polydactyly (one or more extra digits) and syndactyly (fusion of digits), both of which are illustrated in A, have little functional consequence when they occur in isolation. Similarly, cleft lip (B), with or without associated cleft palate, is compatible with life when it occurs as an isolated anomaly; in the present case, however, this child had an underlying malformation syndrome (trisomy 13) and expired because of severe cardiac defects. The stillbirth illustrated in C represents a severe and essentially lethal malformation, where the midface structures are fused or ill-formed; in a/most all cases, this degree of external dysmorphogenesis is associated with severe internaI anomalies such as maldevelopment of the brain and cardiac defects.",B

Immune complex Hypersensitivity reaction is- rpt,Type-I,Type-II,Type-III,Type-IV,"Robbins basic pathology 9th edition page no 115 Type 3 hypersensitivity includes immune complex diseases. Antigen antibody(immune) complexes that are formed in circulation may deposit in blood vessels leads to complement activation and acute inflammation. Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com- plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro- teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen- antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e.g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions. Immune complex diseases are some of the most common immunologic diseases (Table 4-4).",C

In this disorder, neoplastic B cells differentiate to IgM-producing cells; there is a monoclonal IgM spike in the serum. These IgM molecules aggregate and produce hyperviscosity, and some of them agglutinate at low temperatures and produce cold agglutinin disease. Myeloma, which is typically accompanied by a monoclonal gammopathy, most often does not cause liver and spleen enlargement, and morphologically, the cells resemble plasma cells. Light chains in urine (Bence Jones proteins) also are a feature of multiple myeloma. Hypercalcemia occurs with myeloma because myeloma cells produce MIP1-a that up-regulates RANKL production and increased osteoclastic activity, so punched-out lytic bone lesions are typical of multiple myeloma. A t (14;18) translocation is characteristic of a follicular lymphoma. There is typically no leukemic phase to Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.",D

"A 68-year-old man has had worsening dyspnea and orthopnea for the past 3 years with increased production of frothy sputum. On examination, crackles are auscultated at lung bases. A chest radiograph shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates, distinct Kerley B lines, and a prominent left heart border. Laboratory studies show Na+, 135 mmol/L; K+, 3.8 mmol/L; Cl-, 99 mmol/L; CO2, 25 mmol/L; glucose, 76 mg/ dL; creatinine, 1.5 mg/dL; and urea nitrogen, 30 mg/dL. Fractional excretion of sodium is less than 1%. Plasma renin, aldosterone, and antidiuretic hormone levels all are increased. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is 200 pg/mL (normal <100 pg/mL). Which of the following pathologic findings is this man most likely to have?",Aldosteronoma,Bilateral adrenal atrophy,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Ischemic heart disease,"He has left-sided heart failure with pulmonary edema and congestion. His reduced cardiac output leads to diminished renal blood flow that stimulates the renin-angiotensin mechanism to retain salt and water to increase plasma volume. He has prerenal azotemia with a high BUN-to-creatinine ratio and low fractional excretion of sodium. The other options do not explain his pulmonary edema. An aldosterone- secreting adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome) would increase aldosterone, but decrease the plasma renin. In chronic adrenal failure (Addison disease), there should be hyperkalemia and hypoglycemia accompanying hyponatremia. Chronic glomerulonephritis with chronic renal failure would be associated with a BUN-to-creatinine ratio around 10:1. Pulmonary fibrosis would lead to cor pulmonale and a prominent right heart border with features of right-sided congestive heart failure. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a paraneoplastic syndrome that can occur with pulmonary small cell carcinomas, and secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) would increase ADH and cause more severe hyponatremia, but would not have a major effect on the renin-angiotensin mechanism, and sodium excretion would be higher.",D

"A perimenopausal woman presents with increasing swallowing difficulty and fatigue. Physical examination reveals that her thyroid is enlarged (palpable goiter). Laboratory examination of her serum reveals T4 of 4.9 mg/dL, free T4 of 2.5 ng/dL, and TSH of 5.5 mIU/mL. No thyroidstimulating immunoglobulins are identified in the serum, but antimicrosomal antibodies are present. Which one of the listed histologic findings, if present in a thyroid biopsy from this individual, would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis?",Lymphocytic infiltrate without follicle formation,Intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and scattered oxyphilic cells,Hyperplasia of follicular cells with scalloping of colloid at the margin of follicles,Granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells surrounding fragments of colloid,"Four types of thyroiditis may be associated with hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, one of the autoimmune thyroid diseases, is associated with the HLA-B8 haplotype and high titers of circulating autoantibodies, including antimicrosomal, antithyroglobulin, and anti-TSH receptor antibodies. This abnormality is not uncommon in the United States. Histologically, there is infiltration of the thyroid stroma by an intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, with the formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centers. This produces destruction and atrophy of the follicles and transforms the thyroid follicular cells into acidophilic cells. There are many different names for these cells, including oxyphilic cells, oncocytes, Huhle cells, and Askanazy cells. Not uncommonly, patients develop hypothyroidism as a result of follicle disruption, and the manifestations consist of fatigue, myxedema, cold intolerance, hair coarsening, and constipation. Rarely, cases of Hashimoto's thyroiditis may develop hypehyroidism (Hashitoxicosis), while the combination of Hashimoto's disease, pernicious anemia, and type I diabetes mellitus is called Schmidt's syndrome. This is one type of multiglandular syndrome. Although subacute thyroiditis and Riedel's thyroiditis may have similar symptoms to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, biopsy findings in these disorders are distinctly different. Subacute (de Quervain's, granulomatous, or giant cell) thyroiditis is a self-limited viral infection of the thyroid. It typically follows an upper respiratory tract infection. Patients develop the acute onset of fever and painful thyroid enlargement, and may develop a transient hypothyroidism. Histologically there is destruction of the follicles with a granulomatous reaction and multinucleated giant cells that surround fragments of colloid. One-half of patients with Riedel's thyroiditis are hypothyroid, but, in contrast to the other types of thyroiditis, microscopic examination reveals dense fibrosis of the thyroid gland, often extending into extrathyroidal soft tissue. This fibrosis produces a rock-hard enlarged thyroid gland that may produce the feeling of suffocation. This combination of signs and symptoms may be mistaken clinically for a malignant process. Additionally, these patients may develop similar fibrosis in the mediastinum or retroperitoneum. Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is also a self-limited, painless enlargement of the thyroid that is associated with hypothyroidism, but that lacks antithyroid antibodies or lymphoid germinal centers within the thyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",B
"A gastric biopsy is performed on a patient with suspected graft-versus-host disease following bone marrow transplantation. The biopsy demonstrates many isolated dying epithelial cells in crypts showing fragmented, hyperchromatic nuclei and small discrete blebs containing both cytoplasm and nuclear fragments. The biopsy proves which of the following?",Apoptosis,Caseous necrosis,Coagulative necrosis,Gangrenous necrosis,"The changes described are those of apoptosis, which is a form of programmed cell death. Apoptosis can be seen in a variety of settings. In this case, it is occurring in the context of graft-versus-host disease, which is mediated by CD8+ and CD4+ cells. Apoptosis also occurs during embryogenesis, during hormone-dependent involution in the adult (eg, during menstruation), during rapid proliferation of cell populations (eg, intestinal crypt epithelia), and in the immune system (e.g., in developing thymus). It can also occur after duct obstruction in organs such as pancreas and during some viral diseases. The hallmark of this programmed method of cell death is the fragmentation of the cell with formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies that are phagocytized by other healthy cells. Caseous necrosis, such as is seen in tuberculosis, shows necrotic, amorphous granular debris surrounded by a granulomatous response.

Most tumors occur in adults and have a slight female predominance. Approximately 75 to 85% occur in the parotids, 10 to 20% in the submandibular glands, and the remainder in the minor glands. In the parotid the vast majority are benign, whereas in the minor glands 35 to 50% are malignant. Clinically, most tumors of the salivary glands present as palpable masses, regardless of histologic type. The most common neoplasm of the parotid gland is the pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor), which histologically reveals epithelial structures embedded within a mesenchyme-like stroma consisting of mucoid, myxoid, or chondroid tissue. A malignant tumor may develop from a pleomorphic adenoma, in which case it is called a carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. The second most common tumor is Wahin's tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum), which histologically reveals cleftlike spaces lined by oncocytic epithelial cells overlying a stroma with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The epithelial cells are oncocytic because their pink cytoplasm is packed with mitochondria Three malignant tumors of the salivary glands are mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and acinic cell carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas consist of a mixture of squamous epithelial cells and mucus-secreting cells. The mucus-secreting cells of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma can demonstrate intracellular mucin with a special mucicarmine stain. Adenoid cystic carcinomas form tubular or cribriform patterns histologically and have a tendency to invade along perineural spaces, especially the facial nerve. Acinic cell carcinomas contain glands with cleared or vacuolated epithelial cells. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Multiple laboratory tests are performed yearly during this study. An increase in which of the following is most likely to indicate the greatest relative risk for the development of one of these diseases?,Anti-proteinase 3 (PR3),C-reactive protein (CRP),Cryoglobulin,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),"CRP is an acute-phase reactant that increases in response to inflammation. It causes endothelial cell activation, promotes thrombosis, and increases leukocyte adhesiveness in developing atheroma. Because atherogenesis is partly an inflammatory process, CRP is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. PR3 is one type of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) associated with some vasculitides such as microscopic polyangiitis. Cryoglobulins may be found with some forms of immune complex-mediated vasculitis.

1) secretes â IL-2 and interferon - Î³
B. T helper - 2 (T[f
2) secretes â IL-4,IL-5, IL-6, EL-13
T-cells
o T cells are amongst the two important cells of adaptive immune system (others are B-cells).
o T cell precursors arise in bone marrow (also in yolk sac & liver before birth) and migrate to the thymus,
o Maturity ofT-cells takes place in the thymus (So, T cells arise in bone marrow and mature in thymus),
o T-cells constitutes 60%-70% of the circulating peripheral lymphocytes.
o Based on their surface markers. target cells and functions the following T cell category have been identified:
1. Helper/Inducer T cells
These cells have CD4 surface marker and are MHC class II restricted.
These are further subdivided into: -
A. Effector CD4 helper T cells
o These cells secrete cytokines and other products that perform all major functions,
o These cells are of following types.
i. TH, cells
These cells are activated by IFN-Î³
These cells produce IL-2, IFNyand IL-12.
These cells facilitate delayed hypersensitivity, cell mediated immunity. Macrophage activation,
Killing of intracellular microbes e.g., tuberculosis & leprosy.
These cells also induce destruction of target cell by : -
i. Activating CD8 T cells to become cytotoxic cells; and
ii. Activating NK cells.
ii. TH, cells
These cells are activated by IL-4.
These cells secrete IL-4,1L-5, IL-6 and IL-13.
these cells facilitates the synthesis of antibodies particularly IgE and cause activation of mast
Cells and eosinophils â Therefore, provide defence against Helminthic parasites.
iii. TH17 cells
A third subset of CD4 T-cells (besides TH1 and TH2) has been discovered recently and is
Called the
TH17 cells.
If the antigen producing cells produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-23,
These work in collaboration with TGF-(3 to stimulate differentiation of T-cells to the TH 17
cells.
TH17 cells are powerful recruiters of neutrophils and monocytes, and thus play major roles in
severe inflammatoiy diseases.
They may also be important for defense against some bacterial and fungal infections in which
neutrophilic inflammation is a prominent feature.
TH 17 cells are activated by some microbial antigens and by self antigens in autoimmune
diseases. Activated TH17 cells secret IL-17, IL-22 and chemokines. Collectively, these
cytokines recruit neutrophils and monocytes.
TH17 cells produce IL-21, which amplifies the TH17 (self) response.
B. Memory CD4 helper T cells
o Provide memory, i.e., retain the antigenic affinity of the originally activated T cells and are used to
act aslater effector cells during a second immune response.
2. Cytolytk/cytotoik T cells
These cells have CD8 surface marker and are MHC class I restricted.
They kill and lyse target cells including tumor cells, virus infected cells and allograft; and participate in
Type II Hypersensitivity.
3. Suppressor T-cells
These cells have CDg surface marker and are MHC class I restricted.
These cells down regulate immune response.
o Helper T cell (CD4 T cell) is known as the master regulator of the immune system.
o The ratio of CD4 and CD8 T cell is normally 2 :1.",A

A hyperacutely rejecting kidney rapidly becomes cyanotic, mottled, and flaccid, and may excrete a mere few drops of bloody urine. Immunoglobulin and complement are deposited in the vessel wall, causing endothelial injury and fibrin-platelet thrombi. Neutrophils rapidly accumulate within aerioles, glomeruli, and peritubular capillaries. As these changes become diffuse and intense, the glomeruli undergo thrombotic occlusion of the capillaries, and fibrinoid necrosis occurs in aerial walls.

Which of the following porphyrias is not inherited as an Autosomal Dominant disorder -,Acute Intermittent Porphyria,Congenital Erythropoietic Porphyria,Porphyria Cutanea Tarda,Hereditary Coproporphyria,"Porphyrins are normal pigment present in haemoglobin, myoglobin and cytochrome. Porphyria refers to an uncommon disorder of inborn abnormality of porphyrin metabolism. It results from a genetic deficiency of one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of haem, resulting in excessive production of porphyrins. Often, the genetic deficiency is precipitated by the intake of some drugs. Porphyrias are associated with excretion of intermediate products in the urine--delta-aminolaevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin. Porphyrias are broadly of 2 types--erythropoietic and hepatic. (a) Erythropoietic porphyrias: These have a defective synthesis of haem in the red cell precursors in the bone marrow. These may be fuher of 2 subtypes: Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, in which the urine is red due to the presence of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin. The skin of these infants is highly photosensitive. Bones and skin show red-brown discolouration. Erythropoietic protoporphyria, in which there is an excess of protoporphyrin but no excess of porphyrin in the urine. (b) Hepatic porphyrias. These are more common and have a normal erythroid precursor but have a defect in the synthesis of haem in the liver. Its fuher subtypes include the following: Acute intermittent porphyria is characterised by acute episodes of 3 patterns: abdominal, neurological, and psychotic. These patients do not have photosensitivity. There is excessive delta-aminolaevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine. Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common of all porphyrias. Porphyrins collect in the liver and a small quantity is excreted in the urine. Skin lesions are similar to those of invariegate porphyria. Most of the patients have associated haemosiderosis with cirrhosis which may eventually develop into hepatocellular carcinoma. Mixed (Variegate) porphyrias. It is rare and combines skin photosensitivity with acute abdominal and neurological manifestations. Ref: TEXTBOOK OF PATHOLOGY 6th EDITION - HARSH MOHAN PAGE NO:42-43",B

At this point, the risk of development of opportunistic infections and neoplasms typical of AIDS increases greatly. The extent of viremia also is an indication of the progression of HIV infection; an increase in HIV-1 RNA levels is seen as immunologic containment of HIV fails. In HIV infection, the numbers of CD8+ lymphocytes tend to be maintained. Cells of the granulocytic series are relatively unaffected, although patients with AIDS may have cytopenias. Follicular dendritic cells can be infected by HIV and pass the virions to CD4+ cells and macrophages, but the follicular dendritic cells and the macrophages are not destroyed in large numbers by the virus and can become a reservoir for infection.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome) is a life-threatening disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease usually follows recovery from an influenza-like upper respiratory tract infection and is characterized by a motor neuropathy that leads to an ascending paralysis that begins with weakness in the distal extremities and rapidly involves proximal muscles. Sensory changes are usually minimal. The disease is thought to result from immune-mediated segmental demyelination. In rare patients, instead of an acute course, Guillain-Barre syndrome takes a chronic course with remissions and relapses.

Immunity against cancer cells-,Basophills,Eosinophils,NK cells,Neutrophils,"NK cells are cytotoxic; small granules in their cytoplasm contain proteins such as perforin and proteases known as granzymes. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the cell membrane of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either apoptosis or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell lysis is impoant in immunology: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the virions, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. a-defensins, antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of neutrophils",C

Which is the cause of hemolysis in G6-PD deficiency?,Hemoglobin defect,Oxidative stress,Membrane defect,Vitamin B12 deficiency,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Oxidative stress * Normally RBCs are protected from oxidant injury by reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equivalent for this reaction is provided by NADPH. This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate.* If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione. So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs. G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.",B

Most of the patients have deficiency of complement regulatory proteins, factor H (most common), Factor I, and CD46 (membrane cofactor protein). Other conditions that cause atypical HUS are antiphospholipid syndrome, pregnancy or postpaum period, systemic sclerosis, malignant hypeension, chemotherapeutic (mitomycin, cyclosporine, cisplatin, gemcitabine), irradiation to kidney. o HUS patients with neurological symptoms has normal ADAMTS 13 which distinguish it from TTP in which ADAMTS 13 is deficient. o Chronic disease of kidney is confined to atypical HUS or TTP (not in typical HUS) and kidney may show reduplication (splitting) of basement membrane (double contours or tram tracks) and onion-skinning of vessels.",D
True about fibronectin nephropathy are all except?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Gomerular enlargement and PAS+ trichrome mesangial deposit,Glomerulus do not consistently stain for Ig and complement,Ultrastructural feature is presence of large electron mesangial or subendothelial deposit,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Autosomal recessiveFibronectin nephropathy o Fibronectin nephropathy a disease of autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is characterized by massive glomerular accumulation of plasma fibronectin.o Fibronectin is a multifunctional, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is active in cellular adhesion and migration. It is produced : -(i) Locally in the glomerulus by mesangial cells (cellular fibronectin).(ii) Liver synthesizes fibronectin that circulates (plasma fibronectin).o In fibronectin nephropathy, plasma fibronectin is accumulated.Pathological findingso The principal light microscopic change is glomerular enlargement and lobulation resulting from PAS and trichrome-positive mesangial deposits and mild mesangial proliferation. this process displaces the glomerular capillaries to the periphery of the lobule and decreases their luminal diameter. With Jones stain, the preserved GBM is usually at the periphery of the thickened capillary wall. There are no specific changes in renal tubules, interstitium or blood vessels.o By immunofluresence microscopy, the glomeruli do not consistently stain for immunoglobulin or complement components.o Immunohistological stain for fibronectin is strongly positive in the mesangial and subendothelial location.o The most consistent ultrastructural finding is large (giant), mesangial and subendothelial electron dense deposits that mirror the location of the PAS - positive fibronectin deposits.",A
Normal upper limit of CA - 125 is ?,25 U/ ml,45 U/ ml,65 U/ ml,85 U/ ml,"Ans. is `a' i.e., 25 U/ ml The normal value is less than 35 U/mL 1) Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) It is a glycoprotein produced by fetal gut, pancreas and liver. It is used as tumor marker for colorectal cancer (major use), lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It is also increased in non-neoplastic conditions like alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatitis, IBD (CD, UC), smoking and pancreatitis. In colorectal cancer it is used for screening; response and follow up after surgery (CEA should diseapper in 6 weeks after resection), prognosis (higher levels suggests high tumor burden) and to see recurrence on follow up. CEA antigen has no correlation with hepatic metastasis. CEA lacks sensitivity as well as specificity, hence cannot be used to confirm the diagnosis. 2) Alpha-feto protein (AFP) It is a glycoprotein synthesized normally early in fetal life by yolk sac, fetal liver and fetal GIT. It is structurally and genetically related to albumin. AFP is raised in liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), lung carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and non-seminoma germ cell tumor of testis/ovary (yolk sac tumor/endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal carcinoma, teratoma). AFP is also raised in some non-neoplastic conditions like cirrhosis, hepatitis, and pregnancy. 3) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) It is a placental hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts. It is glycoprotein with two subunits (dimer) : a-subunit and /3-subunit. But only the P subunit of HCG is typically measured as a tumour marker because of specificity of the 13 subunit. The i3 subunit of HCG has unique sequences that are not shared with other human glycoprotein hormones. It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the 13 chain. a-HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical. So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is 13 HCG. HCG (13-HCG) is raised in gestational trophoblastic disease (hydatidiform moles), gonadal germ cell tumor (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma), and pregnancy. 4) CA-125 Most impoant cancer with elevated CA-125 is epithelial ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also elevated in cancers of endometrium, cervix, fallopian tubes, pancreas, breast, lung and colon. Non-neoplastic conditions causing elevation of CA-125 are pregnancy, mensturation, endometriosis, PID, abdominal TB, peritonitis and uterine fibroid.

It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively conves thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. pharmacokinetics: Distribution: approximates plasma volume Metabolism: Primarily hepatic Half-life elimination: Biphasic: Initial: 20-24 minutes; Terminal: 90-130 minutes Excretion: Clearance: Plasma: 99-119 mL/minute Ref Robbins 9/e pg 234",B

"In lobar pneumonia, the presence of fibrinosuppurative exudate with disintegration of red cells is seen in the stage of -",Congestion,Red hepatization,Gray hepatization,Resolution,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no.468 STAGE OF CONGESTION: INITIAL PHASE . The initial phase represents the early acute inflammatory response to bacterial infection and lasts for 1 to 2 days. Grossly, the affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested. Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid. Histologically, typical features of acute inflammatory response to the organisms are seen. These are as under i) Dilatation and congestion of the capillaries in the alveolar walls. ii) Pale eosinophilic oedema fluid in the air spaces. iii) A few red cells and neutrophils in the intra-alveolar fluid. iv) Numerous bacteria demonstrated in the alveolar fluid by Gram's staining. 2. RED HEPATISATION: EARLY CONSOLIDATION This phase lasts for 2 to 4 days. The term hepatisation in pneumonia refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section. Grossly, the affected lobe is red, firm and consolidated. The cut surface of the involved lobe is airless, red-pink, dry, granular and has liver-like consistency. The stage of red hepatisation is accompanied by serofibrinous pleurisy. Histologically, the following features are observed. i) The oedema fluid of the preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin. ii) There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils and extravasation of red cells. iii) Many neutrophils show ingested bacteria. iv) The alveolar septa are less prominent than in the first stage due to cellular exudation. 3. GREY HEPATISATION: LATE CONSOLIDATION This phase lasts for 4 to 8 days. Grossly, the affected lobe is firm and heavy. The cut surface is dry, granular and grey in appearance with liverlike consistency.. The change in colour from red to grey begins at the hilum and spreads towards the periphery. Fibrinous pleurisy is prominent. Histologically, the following changes are present i) The fibrin strands are dense and more numerous. ii) The cellular exudate of neutrophils is reduced due to disintegration of many inflammatory cells as evidenced by their pyknotic nuclei. The red cells are also fewer. The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate. iii) The cellular exudate is often separated from the septal walls by a thin clear space. iv) The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms. 4. RESOLUTION . This stage begins by 8th to 9th day if no chemotherapy is administered and is completed in 1 to 3 weeks. However, antibiotic therapy induces resolution on about 3rd day. Resolution proceeds in a progressive manner. Grossly, the previously solid fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action, eventually restoring the normal aeration in the affected lobe. The process of softening begins centrally and spreads to the periphery. The cut surface is grey-red or diy brown and frothy, yellow, creamy fluid can be expressed on pressing. The pleural reaction may also show resolution but may undergo organisation leading to fibrous obliteration of pleural cavity. Histologically, the following features are noted: i) Macrophages are the predominant cells in the alveolar spaces, while neutrophils diminish in number. Many of the macrophages contain engulfed neutrophils and debris. ii) Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion. iii) Alveolar capillaries are engorged. iv) There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, paly by expectoration but mainly by lymphatics, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with aeration.",C

First sign/symptom of renal graft rejection is?-,Fever,Rash,Increase Creatinine on exam,Tenderness,"On the basis of the time course and morphology of rejection reactions, they have been classified as hyperacute, acute, and chronic Chronic RejectionPatients present with chronic rejection late after transplantation (months to years) with a progressive rise in serum creatinine levels (an index of renal function) over a period of 4 to 6 months. Chronic rejection is dominated by vascular changes, interstitial fibrosis, and loss of renal parenchyma; there are typically only mild or no ongoing cellular parenchymal infiltrates. The vascular changes occur predominantly in the aeries and aerioles, which exhibit intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis. These lesions ultimately compromise vascular perfusion and result in renal ischemia manifested by loss or hyalinization of glomeruli, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy. The vascular lesion may be caused by cytokines released by activated T cells that act on the cells of the vascular wall, and it may be the end stage of the proliferative aeritis described earlier.

Hephaestin is similar to ceruloplasmin, the copper-carrying protein.Sr. Ferritin# Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma.# Its levels correlate well with body iron stores.# During earliest iron deficiency period, iron stores--reflected by the serum ferritin level or the appearance of stainable iron on bone marrow aspirations--decrease.# As long as iron stores are present and can be mobilized, the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and red cell protoporphyrin levels remain within normal limits. At this stage, red cell morphology and indices are normal.# Gradually, the TIBC increases, as do red cell protoporphyrin levels.# The serum ferritin level is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores.# By definition, marrow iron stores are absent when the serum ferritin level is <15 pg/L.DIAGNOSIS OF MICROCYTIC ANEMIATestsIron deficiencyInflammationThalassemiaSideroblasticSmearMicro/hypoNormal micro/ hypoMicro/hypo with targetingVariableSI<30<50Normal to highNormal to highTIBC>360<300NormalNormalPercent saturation<1010-2030-8030-80Ferritin (pg/L)<1530-20050-30050-300Hemoglobin patternNormalNormalAbnormalNormalDIAGNOSIS OF HYPOPROLIFERATIVE ANEMIASTestsIron DeficiencyInflammationRenal DiseaseHypometabolicAnemiaMild to severeMildMild to severeMildMCV (ft)60-9080-909090MorphologyNormo-microcyticNormocyticNormocyticNormocyticSI<30<50NormalNormalTIBC>360<300NormalNormalSaturation (%)<1010-20NormalNormalSerum ferritin (mg/L)<1530-200115-150NormalIron stores02-4+1-4+Normal",A

Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases.
Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by the high level of blood bilirubin.
On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types : -

1. Prehepatic jaundice

Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results in an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver.
The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of the liver is overwhelmed and unconjugated bilirubin is increased â Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i.e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e.g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc.

2. Hepatic jaundice

Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile.
This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis.

3. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundice

Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e.g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc.
Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.",C

In a recipient who has previously rejected a kidney transplant
Multiparous women who develop anti-HLA antibodies against paternal antigens shed from the fetus may have preformed antibodies to grafts taken from their husbands or children
Prior blood transfusions
In recipients not previously sensitized to transplantation antigens, exposure to the class I and class II HLA antigens of the donor graft may evoke antibodies. The initial target of these antibodies in rejection seems to be the graft vasculature.

"A 24-year-old female presents with severe pain during menses (dysmenorrhea). To treat her symptoms, you advise her to take indomethacin in the hopes that it will reduce her pain by interfering with the production of",Bradykinin,Histamine,Phospholipase A2,Prostaglandin F2,"Ceain drugs are impoant in the control of acute inflammation because they inhibit poions of the metabolic pathways involving arachidonic acid. For example, coicosteroids induce the synthesis of lipocoins, a family of proteins that are inhibitors of phospholipase A2. They decrease the formation of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Aspirin, indomethacin, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in contrast, inhibit cyclooxygenase and therefore inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The prostaglandins have several impoant functions. For example, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced within the anterior hypothalamus in response to interleukin 1 secretion from leukocytes, results in fever. Therefore aspirin can be used to treat fever by inhibiting PGE2 production. PGE2 is also a vasodilator that can keep a ductus aeriosus open. At bih, breathing decreases pulmonary resistance and reverses the flow of blood through the ductus aeriosus. The oxygenated blood flowing from the aoa into the ductus inhibits prostaglandin production and closes the ductus aeriosus. Therefore prostaglandin E2 can be given clinically to keep the ductus aeriosus open, while indomethacin can be used to close a patent ductus. Prostaglandin F2 (PGF2) causes uterine contractions, which can result in dysmenorrhea. Indomethacin can be used to treat dysmenorrhea by inhibiting the production of PGF2. Bradykinin is a nonapeptide that increases vascular permeability, contracts smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels, and causes pain. It is pa of the kinin system and is formed from high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK). Histamine, a vasoactive amine that is stored in mast cells, basophils, and platelets, acts on H1 receptors to cause dilation of aerioles and increased vascular permeability of venules.

Sweat chloride in cystic fibrosis ?,Decreased,Increased,No change,May increase or decrease,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Increased CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis follows on autosomal recessive transmission. There is a defect in ion transpo of epithelial cells that affects fluid secretion in Exocrine glands (pancreas) Epithelial lining of respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Pathophysiologv In normal duct epithelia, chloride is transpoed by plasma membrane channels (chloride channels) The primary defect in cystic fibrosis results from abnormal function of an epithelial chloride channel protein encoded by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7q 31.2. Protein encoded by CFTR is a chloride channel through which chloride passes In cystic fibrosis activity of chloride channel is decreased. Along with chloride channel, CFTR can regulate other channel also, for example epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system). Normal CFTR gene product Defective (mutated) Crl R gene product in cystic fibrosis Induce Cl- conductance through itself (chloride channel) Reduced or lost Cl conductance Inhibits Na+ conductance through Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane ENaC Clinical features of CF Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i.e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl- into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen). Therefore clinical features are tissue specific: Respiratory tract Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i.e. there is active secretion of C1-. CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen. Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity) Both these decreased Cl secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area). This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis. 1.Intestine Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion andenhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen. This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents obstruction of small and largeintestine. Pancreas The absence of CFTR Cl channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Ct -HCHD3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct. The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis. Hepatobiliary system Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions-biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis. Sweat glands In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i.e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na' from lumen. Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of NaC1- Hypeonic sweat with increased Na+ and Ct in sweat.",B

Commonest site of intestinal T.B.,Stomach,Jejunum,Ileum,Colon,"Ans, is 'C' i.e., ileum o Most common site of intestinal T.B. is ileum.o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms,o Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis.o Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonar\! tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis,o Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate.o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumen,o It usually occurs in the ileocecal region,o Clinical featuresAttacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea.Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mas in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction.o Barium meal radiography will revealPersistent narrowing of the affected segment ie the terminal ileum and the caecum.The caecum is pulled up and may become subhepatic.As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caeca! angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecat angle is 90o. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 150o.o Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.A TT is given both cases.If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)o Thus, all the options are correct in this question but (d) option is partly correct as conservative nv'n is not the t/t of choice. The t/t of choice depends on the presence or absense of obstructive sympt. In case of obstruction, surgery is the t/t of choice,o Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis),o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved.o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt loss.o Barium meal shows - absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment,o TreatmentA course of A TT is adequateOperation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",C

Follicular carcinomas may be grossly infiltrative or minimally invasive. The latter are sharply demarcated lesions that may be impossible to distinguish from follicular adenomas on gross examination. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface, to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion.

"In aortic dissection, blood enters in -",Intima,Media,Adventitia,Any of the above layer,"Aortic dissection 

Aortic dissection is a catastrophic illness characterized by dissection of blood between and along the laminar planes of aortic media.
Blood enters inside the arterial wall (in the media layer) and leads to the formation of blood-filled channels within the aortic wall, which often ruptures outward causing massive haemorrhage.
The most frequent pre-existing histologically detectable lesion is cystic medial degeneration.
In aortic dissection, there is an intimial tear through which the blood enters into the media.
Usually, the tear is within 10 cms of the aortic valve.
The dissecting hematoma spreads characteristically along the laminar planes of the aorta, usually between the middle and outer third.
Some times, blood ruptures into the lumen distally, i.e. there is the second tear distally. So that a complete new vascular channel is formed inside the media of aortic wall. Blood enters from proximal tear into the media and comes out into the lumen from the distal tear.
This is called double - barrel aorta with a false-channel in the media.
Later on, this false channel becomes endothelized â chronic dissection.

Â  Classification of Aortic dissection

The risk and nature of serious complications of dissection depend strongly on the level of aorta affected, with the most serious complications occurring from the aortic valve to the arch.
Thus aortic dissections are generally classified into two types -

1. Proximal lesion (Type A)

More common and more dangerous.
Involve either the ascending portion only or both ascending and the descending portion of aorta.

2.Â Â  Distal lesion (Type B)

Involve only descending part distal to the subclavian artery.",B

Which is not a risk factor of endometrial carcinoma -,Obesity,Smoking,Infeility,Tarnoxifen,"ETIOPATHOGENESIS. The exact aetiology of endometrial cancer remains unknown. However, a few factors associated with increased frequency of its development are chronic unopposed oestrogen excess, obesity, diabetes, hypeension and nulliparous state. There is irrefutable evidence of the relationship of endometrial carcinoma with prolonged oestrogenic stimulation. These evidence are as under 1. Endometrial carcinoma has an association with endometrial hyperplasia (discussed above) in which there are unopposed chronic hyperoestrogenism and frequent anovulatory cycles. 2. In postmenopausal years when endometrial carcinoma occurs characteristically, there is an excessive synthesis of oestrogen in the body from adrenal as well as from ovarian sources. 3. Women having oestrogen-secreting tumours (e.g. granulosa cell tumour) have increased risk of developing synchronous endometrial cancer. 4. Patients receiving prolonged exogenous oestrogen therapy are at higher risk of developing this cancer. 5. Women of breast cancer receiving tamoxifen for a prolonged period have 2-fold increased risk of developing uterine cancer. 6.

LARGE GRANULAR LYMPHOCYTES/NATURAL KILLER CELLS
- Harrison l7/ 2024-29

Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) or NK cells account for ~5-10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes.NKs cells are nonadherent, nonphagocytic cells with large azurophilic cytoplasmic granules.
NKs cells express surface receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (CD16) and for NCAM-1 (CD56), andÂ many NK cells express some T lineage markers, particularly CD8, and proliferate in response to IL-2.Â NK cells arise in both bone marrow and thymic microenvironments
Functionally, NK cells share features with both monocytes-macrophages and neutrophils in that theyÂ mediate both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and NK cell activity.
NK cell activity may play an important role in immune surveillance and destruction of malignant and virally infected host cells
NK cell hyporesponsi%reness is also observed in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome, an autosomalÂ recessive disease associated with fusion of cytoplasmic granules and defective degranulation ofÂ neutrophil lysosomes.
The ability' of NK cells to kill target cells is inversely related to target cell expression of MHC class lÂ molecules.
To eliminate malignant and virally infected cells. NK cells also require activation through recognition ofÂ NK activation molecules on the surface of target cells.
Recent evidence suggests that NK cells, though not possessing rearranging immune recognition genes,Â may be able to mediate recall responses for certain immune reactions such as contact hypersensitivity.
Some NK cells express CD3 and are termed NK/T cells\ NK/T cells can also express oligoclonal formsÂ of the TCR for an antigen that can recognize lipid molecules of intracellular bacteria when presented in theÂ context of CD 1 molecules on A PCs. This mode of recognition of intracellular bacteria such as ListeriaÂ monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis by NK/T cells leads to induction of activation of DCs and is thoughtÂ to bean important defence mechanism against these organisms",A

TB infection is due to deletion of which of the following genes?,ATG5,BCL-2,PTEN,P-53,"ATG 5 Gene isresponsible for controlling function of macrophages which leads to autophagy . Autophagy is a highly conserved process that degrades ceain intracellular contents in both physiological and pathological conditions. Autophagy-related proteins (ATG) are key players in this pathway, among which ATG5 is indispensable in both canonical and non-canonical autophagy. Recent studies demonstrate that ATG5 modulates the immune system and crosstalks with apoptosis. However, our knowledge of the pathogenesis and regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in various immune related diseases is lacking. Thus, a deeper understanding of ATG5&;s role in the autophagy mechanism may shed light on the link between autophagy and the immune response, and lead to the development of new therapies for autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory diseases like TB,T2DM,SLE. In this focused review, we discuss the latest insights into the role of ATG5 in autoimmunity. Although these studies are at a relatively early stage, ATG5 may eventually come to be regarded as a ""guardian of immune integrity."" Notably, accumulating evidence indicates that other ATG genes may have similar functions. REF : robbins 10th ed",A

Factors affecting sickling in sickle cell anemia are?,HbS concentration,HbA,pH,All,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., HbS concentration; 'b' i.e., HbA; 'c' i.e., pH Factors affecting sickling Amount of HbS and interaction with other hemoglobins. o Most impoant factor for sickling is the amount of HbS and its interaction with other types of hemoglobin. o In homozygous individuals, all the hemoglobin in red blood cell is HbS, and undergo sickling. o In heterozygous, only 40% of hemoglobin is HbS --> Sickling does not occur because HbA (remaining 60% of normal hemoglobin) has an inhibitory effect on polymerization of HbS. o Fetal hemoglobin HbF also has inhibitory effect on sickling of HbS ----> Newborns do not manifest the disease until they are 5 to 6 months of age, when the amount of HbF in the cells falls close to the adult level. o HbC has a greater tendency to copolymerize with deoxygenated HbS. 2. Hemoglobin concentration o The rate of HbS polymerization is strongly dependent upon the hemologbin concentration per cell i.e., MCHC. o Higher HbS concentration increase the probability that aggregation and polymerization will occur during any given period of time. o Thus, intracellular dehydration, which increases the MCHC, faciliatates sickling. o Conversly, conditions that decrease MCHC reduce disease severity e.g., when sickle cell anemia occurs with athalassemia 3. Deoxygenation with HbS o Polymerization of HbS occurs only in deoxygenated state. o A decrease in pH reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, thereby increasing the fraction of deoxygenated HbS at any given oxygen tension and augmenting the tendency of sickling. 4. The length of time red cell are exposed to low oxygen tension. o Normal transient times for red cells passing through capillaries are not sufficient for significant aggregation of deoxygenated HbS to occurs. o Hence, sickling of red cells is confined to microvascular beds where blood flow is sluggish. o This is normally the case in spleen and bone marrow which are predominantly affected by sickle cell disease.",D

Which of the following is not seen HIV involvement of CNS -,Perivascular giant cell,Vacuolar degeneration of post column,Microglial nodule formation,Inclusion bodies,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the first 15 years or so after recognition of AIDS, neuropathologic changes were demonstrated at postmoem examination in as many as 80% to 90% of cases, owing to direct effects of virus on the nervous system, oppounistic infections, and primary CNS lymphoma. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAA) has decreased the frequency of these secondary effects of HIV infection. However, cognitive dysfunction ranging from mild to fullblown dementia that is lumped under the umbrella term HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) continues to be a source of morbidity. The cognitive symptoms are believed to stem from HIV infection of microglial cells in the brain. This leads to activation of innate immune responses, both in infected microglial cells and unaffected bystanders. The ensuing neuronal injury likely stems from a combination of cytokine-induced inflammation and toxic effects of HIV-derived proteins. Aseptic meningitis occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of onset of primary infection by HIV in about 10% of patients; antibodies to HIV can be demonstrated, and the virus can be isolated from the CSF. The few neuropathologic studies of the early and acute phases of symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV invasion of the nervous system have shown mild lymphocytic meningitis, perivascular inflammation, and some myelin loss in the hemispheres. After the acute phase, an HIV encephalitis (HIVE) commonly can be found if affected persons come to autopsy.HIV encephalitis is best characterized microscopically as a chronic inflammatory reaction with widely distributed infiltrates of microglial nodules, sometimes with associated foci of tissue necrosis and reactive gliosis. The microglial nodules also are found in the vicinity of small blood vessels, which show abnormally prominent endothelial cells and perivascular foamy or pigment-laden macrophages. These changes occur especially in the subcoical white matter, diencephalon, and brain stem. An impoant component of the microglial nodule is the macrophage-derived multinucleate giant cell. In some cases, there is also a disorder of white matter characterized by multifocal or diffuse areas of myelin pallor with associated axonal swellings and gliosis. HIV is present in CD4+ mononuclear and multinucleate macrophages and microglia. Ref: Robbins Basic Pathology 9th edition pg no 828",D

The lymphocytosis and monocytosis are consistent with tuberculosis. Nonsmokers are unlikely to develop primary lung neoplasms, and adenocarcinoma is the most common in that setting. Smokers are most likely to develop squamous cell carcinomas and small cell anaplastic carcinomas. Individuals who are immunocompromised are most likely to develop fungal infections, particularly with Aspergillus spp., which have branching septate hyphae. Charcot-Leyden crystals form from eosinophil granules in individuals with allergic asthma. Foreign body giant cells can be seen with lipid pneumonias.

Which of the following acute-phase reactants is responsible for the anemia associated with chronic inflammation?,Fibrinogen,Serum amyloid (SAA),C-reactive protein (CRP),Hepcidin,"Acute-phase proteins are plasma proteins, mostly synthesized in the liver, whose plasma concentrations may increaseÂ  severalÂ  hundred-foldÂ  asÂ  partÂ  ofÂ  theÂ  response toÂ  inflammatoryÂ  stimuli.
ThreeÂ  ofÂ  theÂ  best-knownÂ  of these proteins are:

Fibrinogen.Â 
Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein.Â 

Acute-phase proteins have beneficial effects during acute inflammation, but prolonged production of these proteins (especially SAA) in states of chronic inflammation can, in some cases, cause secondary amyloidosis.
Chronically elevated plasma concentrations of hepcidin reduce the availability of iron and are responsible for the anemia associated with chronic inflammation.
Systemic effects of inflammation:

Fever: Cytokines (TNF, IL-I) stimulate production of PGs in hypothalamus.
Production of acute-phase proteins: C-reactive protein, others; synthesis stimulated by cytokines (IL-6, others) acting on liver cells.
Leukocytosis: Cytokines (CSFs) stimulate production of leukocytes from precursors in the bone marrow.
In some severe infections, septic shock: Fall in blood pressure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, metabolic abnormalities; induced by high levels of TBF and other cytokines.

The protein that is mutated in this disorder normally does which of the following functions?",Activates the GTPase activity of Ras,Cleaves cellular proteins during apoptosis,Functions as a cell cycle checkpoint regulator,Promotes angiogenesis,"The normal function of NF1 is to promote the intrinsic GTPase function of the RAS oncogene. Mechanism:- RAS has an intrinsic GTPase activity that is accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which bind to active RAS and augment its GTPase activity by more than 1000-fold, thereby terminating signal transduction. Thus, GAPs prevent uncontrolled RAS activity. When the Ras protein is bound to GTP, the growth-promoting function of the molecule is ""ON"". On hydrolysis of the GTP to GDP, Ras is conveed to an inactive state. GAPs (GTPase Activating Proteins), such as NF-1, suppress cell growth by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. Disabling mutations of neurofibromin 1, a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) encoded by the NF1 gene, are associated with the inherited cancer syndrome familial neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 is therefore an example of a tumor suppressor gene that acts through negative regulation of RAS signaling (inhibitor of RAS/MAPK signaling).

Aschoff nodules are characteristically seen in: (Repeat),Rheumatic carditis,Infective endocarditis,Viral Myocarditis,Libman-Sacks endocarditis,"Ans: A (Rheumatic carditis) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Pg: 529Explanation:Rheumatic Fever (RF)MorphologyDuring acute RF, local inflammatory lesions are found in various tissues.Distinctive lesions occur in the heart, called Aschoff bodies, which consist of foci of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), occasional plasma cells, andPlump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells (pathognomonic for RF) with abundant cytoplasm and multiple central round-to ovoid nuclei in which the chromatin is disposed in a central, slender, wavy ribbon (Hence, also known as ""caterpillar cells"").During acute RF. diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the heart, causing pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis).Inflammation of the endocardium and the leftsided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or along the tendinous cords.Overlying these necrotic foci are small (l - to 2- mm) vegetations, called verrucae. along the lines of closure.These vegetations place RHD within a small group of disorders that are associated with vegetative valve disease, each with its own characteristic morphologic features.Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets, may induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium.The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shortening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords.In chronic disease the mitral valve is virtually always involved.The mitral valve is affected alone in 65% to 70% of cases, and along with the aortic valve in another 25% of cases.Tricuspid valve involvement is infrequent, and the pulmonary valve is only rarely affected. Because of the increase in calcific aortic stenosis and the reduced frequency of RHD. rheumatic aortic stenosis now accounts for less than 10% of cases of acquired aortic stenosis.Fibrous bridging across the valvular commissures and calcification create ""fish mouth"" or ""buttonhole"" stenoses.With tight mitral stenosis, the left atrium progressively dilates and may harbor mural thrombi in the appendage or along the wall, either of which can embolize.Microscopically, in the mitral leaflets there is organization of the acute inflammation and 'subsequent diffuse fibrosis and neovascularization that obliterate the originally layered and avascular leaflet architecture.",A

In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia. Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. Normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder. Bone marrow examination may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt.

Which of the following clinical findings is most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients?",Cachexia,Cardiac murmur,Icterus,Loss of sensation,"Cachexia is a common finding in advanced cancers, and weight loss without dieting in an adult is a ""red flag"" for malignancy. The exact cause for this is unknown, but increases in circulating factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may play a role. Cardiac murmurs may occur in the development of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, a feature of a hypercoagulable state that may occur with advanced malignancies. Icterus is most likely to occur when there is obstruction of the biliary tract by a mass (e.g., as in pancreatic cancer), but metastases are unlikely to cause such an obstruction. Neurologic abnormalities may occur in local tumor growth impinging on nerves, but dull constant pain is the most likely abnormality in malignant neoplasms that invade nerves.

During angiogenesis recruitment of pericytes and periendothelial cells is due to,VEGF & PDGF,"Angiopoietins, TGF & PDGF","TGF, VEFG & PDGF","VEGF, IL-6","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Angiopoietins, TGF & PDGF Angiogenesis Blood vessels formation in adults is known as angiogenesis or neovascularization. It can occur by two ways:? 1. Angiogenesis from pre-existing blood vessels The major steps in this process are :? Vasodilatation by NO, and VEGF-induced increased permeability of the pre-existing vessel. Preoteolytic degradation of basement membrane by metalloproteinases (MMPs) and disruption of cellto-cell contact between endothelial cells by plasminogen activator. Migration of endothelial cells towards angiogenic stimulus. Proliferation of endothelial cells, just behind the leading front of migrating cells. Maturation of endothelial cells. Recruitment of periendothelial cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) to form the mature cells. 2. Angiogenesis from endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) EPCs can be recruited from the bone marrow into tissues to initiate angiogenesis. Growth factors involved in the process of angiogenesis VEGF is the most impoant growth factor in adult tissues undergoing angiogenesis. The most impoant receptor for VEGF is VEGFR-2, a tyrosine kinase receptor. VEGF induces the migration of EPCs in the bone marrow, and enhances the proliferation and differentiation of these cells at sites of angiogenesis. FGF 2 can also stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. Newly formed vessels are fragile and need to become stabilized, which requires the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells (periendothelial cells). Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang 1 & 2), PDGF and TGF-/3 paicipate in stabilization process. Remember VEGF transcription is regulated by the transcription factor HIF, which is induced by hypoxia.",B

Bilirubin is the degradation product of -,Albumin,Globulin,Heme,Transferrin,"Bilirubin metabolism 

Bilirubin is the end product of heme degradation.
The heme is derived from -


Senescent erythrocytes by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the spleen, liver and bone marrow (major source).
Turnover of hemoproteins (e.g. cytochrome p.450).


Heme is oxidized to biliverdin by heme oxygenase.
Biliverdin is then reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.
Bilirubin is transported to the liver in bound form with albumin.
There is the carrier-mediated uptake of bilirubin in the liver.
This bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDP glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) to from conjugated bilirubin (bilirubin glucuronides).
Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into bile.
Most of the conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated and degraded to urobilinogen.
The most of the urobilinogen is excreted in the faeces.
Approximately 20% of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed in the ileum and colon and is returned to the liver, and promptly excreted into bile â Enterohepatic circulation.

Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,Iron deficiency anemia,"Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",A

Ruffled membrane is seen in -,White fibrous cailage,Osteoblast,Osteoclast,Elastic cailage,"Membrane ruffling (also known as cell ruffling) is the formation of a motile cell surface that contains a meshwork of newly polymerized actin filaments. It can also be regarded as one of the earliest structural changes observed in the cell. The GTP-binding protein Rac is the regulator of this membrane ruffling. Changes in the Polyphosphoinositide metabolism and changes in the Ca2+ level of the cell may also play an impoant role. A number of actin-binding and organizing proteins localize to membrane ruffles and potentially target to transducing molecules. The characteristic feature of migrating cells Membrane Ruffling is a characteristic feature of many actively migrating cells. When the membrane is unable to attach to the substrate, the membrane protrusion is recycled back into the cell.

On the other hand. Tubercular ulcers are placed transversely along the ileum (Mnemonic: (neck) tie lies longitudinallyÂ on the body).

Features of Typhoid ulcer -

Salmonella typhi primarily affects the ileum and colon, the terminal ileum is affected most often.
The Peyer's patches show ovoid ulcers with their long axes along the axis of the ileum (remember that in intestinal tuberculosis, the ulcers are transverse to the axis of the bowel).
The margins of the ulcer are slightly raised, and the base of the ulcers is base black due to the sloughed mucosa.
Though the enteric fever is an example of acute inflammation, neutrophils are invariably absent from cellular infiltrate and this is reflected in leucopenia with neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis in peripheral blood. The cellular infiltrates in typhoid consists of phagocytic histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Complications of Typhoid -

The glomeruli contain small fibrin thrombi. These may be associated with only a subtle, reactive swelling of the endothelial cells or varying degrees of focal glomerulitis.
The microvascular occlusions give rise to small infarcts in the renal cortex. In severe cases, the ischemia can destroy the entire cortex and cause bilateral renal cortical necrosis. Involvement of the adrenal glands can produce the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
Microinfarcts also are commonly encountered in the brain and are often surrounded by microscopic or gross foci of hemorrhage. These can give rise to bizarre neurologic signs. Similar changes are seen in the heart and often in the anterior pituitary.
DIC may contribute to the development of Sheehan postpartumÂ pituitaryÂ necrosis.

"An 8-month-old male infant is admitted to the hospital because of a bacterial respiratory infection. The infant responds to appropriate antibiotic therapy, but is readmitted several weeks later because of severe otitis media. Over the next several months, the infant is admitted to the hospital multiple times for recurrent bacterial infections. Workup reveals extremely low serum antibody levels. The infant has no previous history of viral or fungal infections. The most likely diagnosis for this infant is",Isolated IgA deficiency,X-linked agammaglobulinemia of Bruton,Chronic granulomatous disease,DiGeorge's syndrome,"In X-linked agammaglobulinemia of Bruton, B cells are absent but numbers and function of T cells are normal. This abnormality results from defective maturation of B lymphocytes beyond the pre-B stage. This maturation defect leads to decreased or absent numbers of plasma cells, and therefore immunoglobulin levels are markedly decreased. Male infants with Bruton's disease begin having trouble with recurrent bacterial infections at about the age of 9 months, which is when maternal antibodies are no longer present in the affected infant. Therapy for Bruton's disease consists primarily of IV gamma globulin. Isolated deficiency of IgA is probably the most common form of immunodeficiency. It is due to a block in the terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop chronic sinopulmonary infections. Patients are prone to developing diarrhea (Giardia infection) and also have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), the neutrophils and macrophages have deficient H2O2production due to abnormalities involving the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These individuals have frequent infections that are caused by catalase-positive organisms, such as S. aureus, because the catalase produced by these organisms destroys the little hydrogen peroxide that is produced DiGeorge's syndrome is a T cell-deficiency disorder that results from hypoplasia of the thymus due to abnormal development of the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches. The parathyroid glands are also abnormal, and these individuals develop hypocalcemia and tetany. Congenital hea defects are also present.

Which among the following is poor prognostic indicator in ALL in children?,Age,"TLC 4000-10,000",Presence of testicular involvement at presentation,Presence of blasts in peripheral smear,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood. The diagnosis of ALL is made by bone marrow examination, which shows a homogeneous infiltration of leukemic blasts replacing normal marrow elements. Two most impoant prognostic features are WBC count and age. Children less than one year of age have a very poor prognosis. Infant leukemia is often associated with a genetic abnormality t(4;11) translocation and has high WBC count. Children aged 1-9 years have good prognosis. WBC count more than 50,000/L at diagnosis is associated with a poor prognosis. Cure rates depend on specific prognostic features present at diagnosis, biologic features of the leukemic blast, and the response to therapy.

One of the following feature is true regarding Crohn's disease,Presence of Non-caseating granulomas,Associated with Backwash ileitis,Presence of Pseudopolyps,Associated with Broad based ulcers,"(A) Presence of Non-caseating granulomas[?]Non-caseating Granuloma of Crohn's disease:oMost valuable diagnostic feature of Crohn's disease is the presence of Non-caseating granuloma (a sarcoid or tuberculoid reaction) in the affected tissue of the bowel wall.oGranumlomas develop in all layers of the intestines from the mucosa to serosa (most frequent in sub mucosa).oGranuloma is defined as a collection of epitheloid cells & with or without giant cells.oNoncaseating granulomas are hallmark of Crohn's disease & found in approximately 35% of casesoMay occur in areas of active disease or univolved regions in any layer of the intestinal wall. These may also be seen in mesenteric lymph nodes.oCutaneous granuloma as form nodules are known as metastatic Crohn's disease.oAbsence of granulomas does not preclude a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.oTransmural involvement is characteristic feature of Crohn's diseaseoSkip lesions is characteristic of Crohn's disease & may help in differentiating from ulcerative colitis.Other Options[?]Ulcerative ColitisoGrossly, ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous fashion to involve part or all of the colon.oDisease of the entire colon is termed pancolitis, while left-sided disease extends no farther than the transverse colon. Limited distal disease may be referred to descriptively as ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.oSmall intestine is normal, although mild mucosal inflammation of the distal ileum, termed backwash ileitis, may be present in severe cases of pancolitis.oSkip lesions are not seen (although focal appendiceal or cecal inflammation may occasionally be present in left-sided ulcerative colitis).oGrossly, involved colonic mucosa may be slightly red and granular or have extensive, broad-based ulcers.oThere can be an abrupt transition between diseased and uninvolved colon.oUlcers are aligned along the long axis of the colon but do not typically replicate the serpentine ulcers of Crohn disease. Isolated islands of regenerating mucosa often bulge into the lumen to create pseudopolyps & the tips of these polyps may fuse to create mucosal bridges. Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy with a flat and smooth mucosal surface that lacks normal folds.oUnlike Crohn disease, mural thickening is not present, the serosal surface is normal, and strictures do not occur. However, inflammation and inflammatory mediators can damage the muscularis propria and disturb neuromuscular function leading to colonic dilation and toxic megacolon, which carries a significant risk of perforation,oSubmucosal fibrosis, mucosal atrophy, and distorted mucosal architecture remain as residua of healed disease but histology may also revert to near normal after prolonged remission.oGranulomas are not present in ulcerative colitis.

If this chemical was a strong acid, which of the following histopathologic findings would be expected in the esophagus of this child?",Apoptosis,Coagulative necrosis,Fat necrosis,Hyaline sclerosis,"Chemical injury to the esophagus usually reflects accidental poisoning in children, attempted suicide in adults, or contact with medication. Ingestion of strong acids produces an immediate coagulative necrosis in the esophagus, which results in a protective eschar that limits injury and further chemical penetration. By contrast, ingestion of strong alkaline solutions is accompanied by liquefactive necrosis (choice E), with inflammation and saponification of membrane lipids. Alkaline solutions are particularly insidious because they are generally odorless and tasteless and, therefore, easily swallowed before protective reflexes come into play.Diagnosis: Chemical esophagitis",B
Concentric hyperophy of hea is caused by:September 2007,Hyperophic cardiomyopathy,Congestive hea failure,Systemic hypeension,Mitral regurgitation,"Ans. A: Hyperophic cardiomyopathyIn the case of chronic pressure overload as occurs with chronic hypeension or aoic valve stenosis, the ventricular chamber radius may not change; however, the wall thickness greatly increases as new sarcomere are added in-parallel to existing sarcomeres. This is termed concentric hyperophy.This type of ventricle becomes ""stiff"" (i.e., compliance is reduced), which can impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction. Sometimes the chamber radius is increased and the wall thickness is increased moderately - this is termed eccentric hyperophy - and can occur when there is both volume and pressure overload. An example of this would be when systolic dysfunction and a volume overload state occur in a concentrically hyperophied hea, thus stimulating chronic chamber dilation. Chamber dilation occurs as new sarcomeres are added in-series to existing sarcomeres",A

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease features include:,Can be diagnosed intrauterine,Proceeds to renal failure till children reaches school going age,Can be palpated abdominally,Hypertension doesn't develop until late stages of the disease,"Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

These diseases have similar names and findings, which makes them easily confused with each other. For example, minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis may all produce nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by marked proteinuria. This finding can be documented by the presence of protein in a dipstick examination of the urine. Although signs of nephritic syndrome, such as hematuria, may be seen with FSGS, young children are more often found to have acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. This illness typically occurs 1 to 3 weeks after a group A a-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the pharynx or skin, such as impetigo or scarlet fever.

Which of the following laboratory studies is most likely to afford the best method of monitoring disease control in this man?,"Cholesterol, total",Fasting plasma glucose,Glycosylated hemoglobin,Microalbuminuria E Random plasma glucose,"Nonenzymatic glycosylation refers to the chemical process whereby glucose attaches to proteins without the aid of enzymes. The degree of glycosylation is proportionate to the level of blood glucose. Many proteins, including hemoglobin, undergo nonenzymatic glycosylation. Because RBCs have a life span of about 120 days, the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin is a function of the blood glucose level over the previous 120-day period. The level of glycosylated hemoglobin is not appreciably affected by short-term changes in plasma glucose levels. Random glucose testing is an immediate way of monitoring short-term adjustments with diet and medications such as insulin and oral agents. Fasting glucose testing affords a better way to diagnose diabetes mellitus initially. Measurements of cholesterol and fructosamine have no value in managing diabetes mellitus. Microalbuminuria may presage the development of the diabetic renal disease. The ""incretin effect"" is diminished in patients with type 2 diabetes, and the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists can help to restore incretin function and lead to improved glycemic control and loss of weight via increased satiety.",C

Most common CNS neoplasm in HIV patient -,Meduloblastoma,Astrocytoma,Primary CNS lymphoma,Ependymoma,"neuropathologic changes were demonstrated at postmoem examination in as many as 80% to 90% of cases, owing to direct effects of the virus on the nervous system, oppounistic infections, and primary CNS lymphoma. Introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy(HAA) has decreased the frequency of these secondary effects of HIV infection. However, cognitive dysfunction ranging from mild to full-blown dementia that is lumped under the umbrella term HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) continues to be a source of morbidity. The cognitive symptoms are believed to stem from HIV infection of microglial cells in the brain. This leads to the activation of innate immune responses, both in infected microglial cells and unaffected bystanders. Robbins Basic pathology 9th edition page no 828",C
"Following an injury to a blood vessel, immediate haemostasis is achieved by -",Fibrin deposition,Platelet adhesion,Vasoconstriction,Thrombosis,"Hemostasis
o Hemostasis is a physiological process whereby bleeding is halted, thus protectingÂ the integrity' of theÂ vascular system after tissue injury.
o It is responsible for minimizing blood loss,
o It is commonly referred to as stoppage of bleeding,
o The hemostatic mechanisms have several functions : -
1. Maintain blood in fluid state while circulating within the vascular system.
2 Arrest bleeding at the site of injury by formation of hemostatic plug.
3. Ensure the removal of hemostaticÂ plug when healing is complete.
o The components of normal hemostasis include: -
1. Blood vessels (endothelium)
2. Platelets
3. Plasma coagulation factors and their inhibitors.
4. Fibrinolytic system.
o When a blood vessel is injured, several steps occur in hemostasis at the site of injury': -
A. Vasoconstriction
o After initial injury, there is a brief period arteriolar vasoconstriction, minimizing vesselÂ diameter and stowing bleeding.
o This is due to reflex neurogenic mechanism and augmented by a potent endothelium derivedÂ vasoconstrictor endothelin.
o However this effect is transient, bleeding would resume if there will no activation of platelet andÂ coagulation system.
B. Primary hemostasis
o Endothelial injury exposes highly thrombogenic subendothelial extracellular matrix which allowsÂ the platelets to bind (adhere) with collagen of ECM.
o Binding of platelets activates these cells and platelets release secretory' granules.
o These secretory' products (from secretory granules) recruit additional platelets to form primaryÂ hemostatic (platelet plug).
C. Secondary hemostasis
o CoagulationÂ system is activatedÂ and thrombin is generated,
o Thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin.
o Ultimately these events form an irreversibly fused mass of platelets, thrombin RBCs andÂ fibrinogen â Definitive secondary hemostatic plug.
D. Repair of vessels and dissolution of the clot
o The clot attracts and stimulates the growth of fibroblast and smooth muscle cells within theÂ vessel wall, and begins the repair process.
o At this stage the fibrinolytic system is also activated, resulting in the dissolution of the clot.",C

Lack of differentiation is called -,Anaplasia,Dysplasia,Metaplasia,Hyperplasia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Anaplasia First I would like to explain following frequently asked terms ? Differentiation Differentiation refers to the process by which a less specialized cell (immature) becomes a more specialized (mature) cell type, to perform a specific function. o All specialized cells are derived from stem cells that can give rise to various type of cells. o For example, hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow can give rise to red blood cells, or WBCs, or platelets through various stages of development. o This process of development from stem cells to mature cells is differentiation. So, in differentiation cells acquire a type. o For neoplastic cells, differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic cells resemble comparabale to normal cells, both morphologically and functionally -3 well differentiated cells resemble to normal cells, while undifferentiated cells do not resemble at all, poorly differentiated cells paially resemble to normal cells. Polarity It means orientation and organization of cells in a tissue, i.e. correct positioning of cells in a tissue. Pleomorphism o Pleomorphism is variation in size and shape. It may occur in cells or / and nuclei. Hyperchromatasia o Nuclei contain an abundance of DNA and are extremely dark staining --> hyperchromatic nuclei. Anaplasia o Anaplasia means lack of differentiation. o It means ""to form backward"", implying a reversion from a high level of differentiation to a lower level. o This does not mean that the differentiation takes place in reverse direction, i.e. from mature specialized cells to unspecialized stem cells. o Rather, Anaplasia arise from stem cells that proliferate without differentiation (maturation). o So, anaplastic cells resemble primitive-appearing unspecialized cells. o Anaplasia is seen in malignant tumors --) Anaplasia is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. o But, It is not necessory that all malignant tumors are anaplastic (undifferentiated or poorly differentiated) some malignant tumors may be well differentiated, eg follicular carcinoma of thyroid.",A

Which is the most characteristic finding in Osteomalacia?,Abnormal osteoblastic activity,Crystalline structure of bone,Increased deposition of osteoid with decreased mineralization,Increased mineralization with decreased osteoid formation,"Osteomalacia (""soft bone"") is a structural abnormality of bone caused by defective mineralization of osteoid, which is produced in normal or increased amounts. Because it is not calcified normally, affected bones are soft. The newly formed osteoid matrix laid down by osteoblasts is inadequately mineralized, thus producing the excess of persistent osteoid characteristic of osteomalacia.Microscopic examination of undecalcified bone shows the presence of uncalcified osteoid, usually in the form of wide seams on the outer aspect of bony trabeculae. This is diagnostic of osteomalacia. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 67. Diseases of Bones. In P. Chandrasoma, C.R. Taylor (Eds), Concise Pathology, 3e.",C

Which of the following factors is MOST likely implicated in the pathogenesis of this neoplasm?",Cigarette smoking,Epstein-Barr virus infection,Ionizing radiation,Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene,"The neoplasm described here is known as lymphoepithelioma, an inappropriate designation that emphasizes the histologic features of a lymphocyte-rich squamous cell carcinoma. This tumor, AKA nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is the most frequent childhood malignancy in ceain African regions and one of the most frequent adult tumors in southern China. Epstein-Barr virus genome has been identified in most of these neoplasms. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for a number of malignant neoplasms, such as lung cancer. In the upper respiratory tract, cigarette smoking is a strong predisposing factor for laryngeal carcinoma, but it has not been linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation injury is a well-known risk factor for many human neoplasms, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer, but not for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although any cell type is susceptible to neoplastic transformation by radiation, there is a so of hierarchy of vulnerability. The most frequent radiation-induced cancers are leukemias and thyroid carcinoma, followed by breast, lung, and salivary gland tumors. Skin, bone, and the gastrointestinal tract are least vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene is found in most B-cell follicular lymphomas. bcl-2 is a member of a large family of genes that regulate apoptosis. bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, so that its overexpression allows neoplastic lymphocytes to survive for long periods and accumulate progressively in lymph nodes and bone marrow.

The hyperfunctioning thyroid gland leads to an increased T4 level, with positive feedback from the pituitary to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. There is about 50% concordance of Graves' disease among identical twins. The autoimmune character of this disorder is evidenced by an association with HLA-DR3 and by the presence of an autoantibody against TSH receptor that activates T4 secretion. An increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) level would increase the TSH level and increase the T4 , but feedback typically occurs at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus, and abnormal increases in TRH are uncommon.

Best investigation for diagnosing amyloidosis,Rectal biopsy,Colonscopy,CT scan,Upper GI endoscopy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Rectal biopsy ""The most definitive investigation for Amyloidosis is biopsy"".For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice.An important clinical advance was the recognition that the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are often involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis.Thus, biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary.For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitive diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using an endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample.Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specific diagnosis is often made by studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy there by avoiding an invasive procedure.When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firm diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs.In addition, an advantage to performing biopsy of an involved organ (e.g., kidney heart) is thatit definitively establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid.It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity.The best sites of biopsy are: -Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity)Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity)Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: -Salivary glandsSkinTongueGingivaStomachBone marrow",A

Which of the following is not true about idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?,Antibodies of IgM class,Autoantibodies to Gp IIb/ Ilia or IB IX,Increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow,Spleen is normal in size,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Antibodies of IgM class I dopathic thrombocytopenic purpura :? There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from formation of antiplatelet antibodies. Pathogenesis Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often Hb-lIla or Ib-IX. In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the .IgL, class. The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets. Pathology The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic. The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen, the spleen size remains normal. On histological examination there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic. Bone Marrow Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes. These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction. The impoance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure. A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.",A

"In sickle cell disease, which of the following does not influence the degree of sickling of red cells?",Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin,Intracellular pH,Intake of primaquine,Co-existing a-thalassemia,"Intake of primaquine acts as a trigger for hemolysis in G6PD deficiency, and not related to sickle cell disease/sickling. Sickle cell disease Caused by a point mutation in which there is replacement of glutamic acid by valine at position 6 of the beta chain generating a sticky patch on the surface of HbS. The sticky patch on the surface of adjacent HbS molecules cause their polymerization resulting in formation of long fibrous precipitates. HbA, HbF can also weakly interact with HbS & prevent its polymerization (HbF >> HbA), therefore individuals with co-inherited condition of hereditary persistence of fetal Hb (HPFH) have less severe due to reduced sickling. Intracellular dehydration, increases the MCHC, facilitates sickling. Condition reducing MCHC also lead to less severe disease, eg. individual who is homozygous for HbS also has coexistent a-thalassemia, which reduces Hb synthesis and leads to milder disease. A decrease in intracellular pH reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, thereby increasing the fraction of deoxygenated HbS at any given oxygen tension and augmenting the tendency for sickling.",C

Characteristically they are unilocular cysts containing hair and sebaceous material (Fig. 22-38). Sectioning reveals a thin wall lined by an opaque, gray-white, wrinkled epidermis, frequently with protruding hair shafts. Within the wall, it is common to find grossly evident tooth structures and areas of calcification. Microscopically, the cyst wall is composed of stratified squa- mous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures (Fig. 22-39). In most cases tissues from other germ layers can be identified, such as cailage, bone, thyroid, and neural tissue. Dermoid cysts are sometimes incorporated within the wall of a mucinous cystad- enoma. About 1% of the dermoids undergo malignant transformation, most commonly to squamous cell carci- noma, but also to other cancers as well (e.g., thyroid carcinoma, melanoma)",A
Which virus is implicated in Burkitts lymphoma?,HTLV,HPV,EBV,HHV8,"Explanation: BURKITT LYMPHOMA There are three clinical types:
1. African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
2. Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
3. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV.
These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells,
the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages.
These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic âstarry skyâ pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells.
It express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.
Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.
Molecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.
The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus  light-chain loci.
All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.
Clinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera,
particularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.
Burkitt lymphoma is very aggressive but responds well to intensive chemotherapy",C
"Few RBCs, raisede neutrophils with some hemorrhage in alveoli is seen in: March 2005",Gray hepatization,Red hepatization,Viral pneumonia,Resolving phase of lobar pneumonia,"Ans. B: Red hepatizationAll 4 phases may be seen in different pas of the same lung.Congestion (1-2 days)Red hepatization (2nd-4th day)Gray hepatization (4th-6th day)Resolution ( 8th-9th day)In the earliest stage of pneumococcal pneumonia, protein-rich edema fluid containing numerous organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae) fills the alveoli. Marked congestion of the capillaries is typical.Sholy after this congestion occurs there is a massive outpouring of polymorphonuclear leukocytes accompanied by intra-alveolar hemorrhage. Many of the red blood cells undergo lysis. These cells, together with polymprphonuclearleukocytes, produce the rusty sputum.Because the firm consistency of the affected lung is reminiscent of the liver, this stage has been named ""red hepatization"". The next phase, occurring after 2 or more days, depending on the success of treatment, involves the lysis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and the appearance of macrophages, which phagocytose the fragmented polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory debris.The lung is now no longer congested but still remains firm in this stage of ""gray hepatization"".The alveolar exudates is then removed and the lung gradually returns to normal.",B

Onion bulb appearance on nerve biopsy is seen in -,Amyloid neuropathy,Diabetic neuropathy,CIDP,Leprous neuritis,"chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) has been used to identify patients with a chronically progressive or relapsing symmetric sensorimotor disorder with cytoalbuminologic dissociation and interstitial and perivascular endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages. It can be considered the chronic equivalent of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, the most common form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Signs and symptoms CIDP typically stas insidiously and evolves slowly, in either a slowly progressive or a relapsing manner, with paial or complete recovery between recurrences; periods of worsening and improvement usually last weeks or months. Most expes consider the necessary duration of symptoms to be greater than 8 weeks for the diagnosis of CIDP to be made. Symptoms repoed include the following: Preceding infection (infrequent) Initial limb weakness, both proximal and distal Sensory symptoms (eg, tingling and numbness of hands and feet) Motor symptoms (usually predominant) In about 16% of patients, a relatively acute or subacute onset of symptoms In children, usually a more precipitous onset of symptoms Symptoms of autonomic system dysfunction (eg, ohostatic dizziness) Peinent physical findings are limited to the nervous system, except when the condition is associated with other diseases. Such findings may include the following. Signs of cranial nerve (CN) involvement (eg, facial muscle paralysis or diplopia) Gait abnormalities Motor deficits (eg, symmetric weakness of both proximal and distal muscles in upper and lower extremities) Diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes Sensory deficits (typically in stocking-glove distribution) Impaired coordination Diagnosis Laboratory studies that may be helpful include the following: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: Elevated protein levels are common (80% of patients); 10% of patients also have mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased gamma globulin Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA) level, biochemistry profile, and serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis (to exclude associated systemic disorders) In ceain instances, genetic testing Other tests and procedures that may be warranted are as follows: MRI of the spine with gadolinium enhancement Electromyography (EMG) is a critical test to determine whether the disorder is truly a peripheral neuropathy and whether the neuropathy is demyelinating Peripheral (sural) nerve biopsy (see the image below): This is considered when the diagnosis is not completely clear, when other causes cannot be excluded, or when profound axonal involvement is observed on EMG; biopsy was once commonly recommended for most patients before immunosuppressive therapy, but current guidelines no longer recommend it Electron micrograph of the peripheral nerve of a patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.

It is true that sarcoma -,Are malignant tumours of mesenchyme origin,Usualy spread by vascular invasion,Metastasise frequently to regional lymph node,Are only loosely invasive,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Are malignant tumours of mesenchyme origin & Usualy spread by vascular invasion o Distant metastasis of cancers may occur through one of three pathways. 1. Direct seeding of body cavities or surface o It occurs when a malignant neoplasm penetrates into a natural open field. o Most common cavity involved is peritoneal cavity, but other cavities may also be involved, e.g., pleural, pericardial, joint space, subarachnoid. Such seeding is paicularly characteristic of carcinomas arising in the ovaries. o Sometimes mucus secreting tumor of appendix (or less commonly ovary) fill the peritoneal cavity with a gelatinous neoplastic mass referred to as pseudomyxoma peritonei. 2. Lymphatic spread o This is the most common method of metastasis for carcinomas. Sarcoma may also use this route. o As tumors do not have lymphatics, this type of spread takes place through the lymphatic vessels located at the tumor margins. The pattern of lymph node involvement follows the natural routes of lymphatic drainage. o The first node in a regional lymphatics that receives lymph flow from the primary tumor is called sentinel lymphnode. Some times local lymph nodes may be bypassed because of venous lymphatic anastomosis -4 skip metastasis. 3. Hematogenous spread It is typical of sarcomas but is also seen in carcinomas. o Veins are more commonly involved than aeries because veins have thinner walls that can be penetrated readily, in contrast aeries have thicker walls. With venous invasion, the tumor cells in blood follow the venous flow draining the site of neoplasm. So, liver and lung are the most frequent organs involved in hematogenous spread because all poal area drainage flows to the liver and all caval blood flows to the lung. o Aerial spread may occur when tumor cells pass through the pulmonary capillary beds or pulmonary A-V shunts or when pulmonary metastasis give rise to additional tumor emboli.",A

Interstitial lung disease is seen in -,Rheumatoid ahritis,Sjogrens syndrome,SLE,all of the abobe,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no.495 ILD ASSOCIATED WITH CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES A number of connective tissue diseases or collagen diseases may result in chronic interstitial fibrosis and destruction of blood vessels. The lung involvement in impoant forms of collagen diseases is briefly considered here. 1. SCLERODERMA (PROGRESSIVE SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS). The lungs are involved in 80% cases of scleroderma. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is the most common form of pulmonary involvement. The disease usually involves the lower lobes and subpleural regions of the lungs and may lead to honeycombing of the lung. There is increased risk of development of cancer of the lung in pulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma. 2. RHEUMATOID AHRITIS. Pulmonary involvement in rheumatoid ahritis may result in pleural effusion, interstitial pneumonitis, necrobiotic nodules and rheumatoid pneumoconiosis (Caplan's syndrome). The parenchymatous lesions in rheumatoid ahritis are most commonly seen in the lower lobe. Necrobiotic nodules are the most specific manifestations of rheumatoid disease and closely resemble the subcutaneous nodules commonly found in rheumatoid ahritis. 3. SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly develop some form of lung disease during the course. The most common manifestation of SLE is pleurisy with small amount of pleural effusion that may contain LE cells. Other pulmonary lesions in SLE are interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary haemorrhage and vasculitis. 4. SJOGREN'S SYNDROME Patients with Sjogren's syndrome often have rheumatoid ahritis and associated pulmonary changes. Involvement of the bronchial mucous gland by a process similar to that in the salivary glands can lead to inadequate bronchial clearance and repeated infections. 5. DERMATOMYOSITIS AND POLYMYOSITIS. Interstitial pneumonitis and interstitial fibrosis commonly accompany dermatomyositis and polymyositis. 6. WEGENER'S GRANULOMATOSIS. Wegener's granulomatosis is an necro-inflammatory lesion having 4 components--granulomas of the upper respiratory tract, granulomas of the lungs, systemic vasculitis and focal necrotising glomerulonephritis. Localised or limited form of the disease occurs in the lungs without involvement of other organs. Pulmonary involvement is in the form of single or multiple granulomas.",D

Loss of hetrozygosity associated with ?,Acute myeloid leukemia,ALL,Retinoblastoma,Promyelocitic leukemia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma is a prime example of a tumour which is associated with loss of heterozygosity. This term is mostly used in the context of oncogenesis. o The mutations required to produce retinoblastomes involves the RB gene located on chromosome 13 q14. o RB gene is a tumour suppressor gene. RB gene is active in hypophosphorylated state and phosphorylation causes inactivation of RB, i.e. phosphorylated RB is inactive. o Retinoblastoma develops when both the normal alleles of the RB gene are inactivated or altered. o In familial case of retinoblastoma, children are born with one normal and one defective copy of the RB gene. Such a child is said to be heterozygous at the RB locus (one allele of the gene is normal while the other one is a mutant). This implies that heterozygosity for the RB gene does not affect cell behaviour i.e., (cancer does not develop as long as one gene is normal) o Cancer develops when both the alleles are mutant i.e., when the cell becomes homozygous for the mutant allele or you can put it in another way, when the cell loses heterozygosity for the normal RB gene (a condition known as loss of heterozygosity). o Make it clear that in oncology, loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allete in a somatic cell of the off spring becomes inactivated by mutation. This results in no normal tumour suppressor gene being produced and almost ceainly results in tumourogenesis. o It is a common occurrence in cancer, where it indicates the absence of a functional tumour suppressor gene in the lost region. o Loss of heterozygosity is the basis of two hit hypothesis of cancers (Knudson's hypothesis) o In hereditary cases of Retinoblastoma one genetic change (first hit) is inherited from the affected parent therefore it is present in all the somatic cells of the body. But one genetic change is not sufficient to produce cancer. o The second mutation (second hit) is required to produce cancer. It occurs in the retinal cells (which are carrying the first mutation). The mutation occuring in Retinal cells is acquired. In sporadic cases both mutations (hits) occur somatically within a single retinal cell whose progeny then form the tumour.",C

7 day old MI the most sensitive biochemical marker,Troponin T,CPK MB,LDH,Myoglobin,"TnI and TnT normally are not found in the circulation; however, after acute MI, both are detectable within 2 to 4 hours, with levels peaking at 48 hours and remaining elevated for 7 to 10 days. Although cardiac troponin and CK-MB are equally sensitive markers of the early stages of an MI, persistence of elevated troponin levels for approximately 10 days allows the diagnosis of an acute MI long after CK-MB levels have returned to normal. With reperfusion, both troponin and CK-MB levels may peak earlier owing to more rapid washout of the enzyme from the necrotic tissue. (Robbins basic pathology,9th edition,pg no.383)",A

Which is not true regarding Bernard syndrome-,Ristocetin aggregation is normal,Aggregation with collagen and ADP is normal,Large platelets,Thrombocytopenia,"Answer is option 1, The ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation is an ex vivo assay for live platelet function. It measures platelet aggregation with the help of von Willebrand factor and exogenous antibiotic ristocetin added in a graded fashion The ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) is an ex vivo assay for live platelet function. It measures platelet aggregation with the help of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and exogenous antibiotic ristocetinadded in a graded fashion. It is similar to the ristocetin cofactor assay but has the added benefit in that it helps in the diagnosis of type 2B/pseudo von Willebrand disease (vWD) and Bernard-Soulier syndrome because it uses patient's live endogenous platelets, whereas ristocetin cofactor assay tests the function of only the vWF and not the platelets. Ristocetin cofactor assay uses the patient's platelet poor plasma (with vWF but no platelets) and adds ristocetin and exogenous formalin-fixed platelets which can passively agglutinate (but not actively aggregate, as they are dead). Formalin does not allow the extrinsic platelets to secrete the vWF of their a-granules, and thus only the activity of the intrinsic vWF is tested. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 82",A
Which of the following statement about light microscopy finding in minimal change disease is TRUE?,Loss of foot process,Ami GBM Abs seen,IgA deposits seen,No change seen,"Light microscopy does not show obvious glomerular lesions in minimal change disease. Immunofluorescent microscopy is usually negative for deposits, occasionally it may show deposits of small amount of IgM in the mesangium. Electron microscopy shows effacement of foot process suppoing the epithelial podocytes with weakening of slit pores. Minimal change disease presents clinically with the abrupt onset of edema and nephrotic syndrome. Average protein excretion is 10gm/24hrs. Less common features are hypeension, microscopic hematuria, atopy, and decreased renal function. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at increased risk of thromboembolic events, develop severe hyperlipidemia, and may experience protein malnutrition.

All of the following are features of MEN 1 syndrome except: September 2007,Pancreatic tumor,Pituitary tumor,Hyperparathyroidism,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,"Ans. D: Medullary carcinoma of thyroid MEN-1/Wermer syndrome is characterized by abnormalities involving the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary gland; thus the mnemonic device, the 3P's. Parathyroid-Hyperparathyroidism is present in 80-95% of patients. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most common manifestation: about 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are more common than solitary adenomas. Pancreas-Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur in 60 to 70% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric. Multiple adenomas or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs; such tumors may arise from the small bowel rather than the pancreas. About 30% of tumors are malignant and have local or distant metastases. Malignant islet cell tumors due to MEN 1 syndrome often have a more benign course than do sporadically occurring malignant islet cell tumors. About 40% of islet cell tumors originate from a beta cell, secrete insulin (insulinoma), and can cause fasting hypoglycemia. Beta-Cell tumors are more common in patients < 40. About 60% of islet cell tumors originate from nonbeta-cell elements and tend to occur in patients > 40. Non-beta-cell tumors are somewhat more likely to be malignant Pituitary-Pituitary tumors occur in 15 to 42% of MEN 1 patients. From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea and excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable from sporadically occurring acromegaly. About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, producing Cushing's disease. Most of the remainder are nonfunctional.",D

Acanthosis means,Loss of intracellular connections,Abnormal premature keralinization,Diffuse epidermal hyperplasia,Thickening of stratum corneum,"HISTOPATHOLOGIC TERMS Before describing the pathology of common skin diseases, the following pathologic terms in common use need to be defined for the understanding of Dermatopathology: Acanthosis: Thickening of the epidermis due to hyperplasia of stratum Malpighi. Acantholysis: Loss of cohesion between epidermal cells with formation of intraepidermal space containing edema fluid and detached epithelial cells. Dyskeratosis: Abnormal development of epidermal cells resulting in rounded cells devoid of their prickles and having pyknotic nuclei. Dyskeratosis is a feature of premalignant and malignant lesions and is rarely seen in benign conditions. Hyperkeratosis: Thickening of the horny layer. Parakeratosis: Abnormal keratinization of the cells so that the horny layer contains nucleated keratinocytes rather than the normal non-nucleate keratin layer. Spongiosis: Intercellular edema of the epidermis which may progress to vesicle formation in the epidermis. Pigment incontinence: Loss of melanin pigment from damaged basal cell layer so that the pigment accumulates in the melanophages in the dermis.

"A 75-year-old man who lives alone in a poorly ventilated house without central heating uses a portable unvented kerosene heater to warm the house during the winter months. One morning, a neighbor finds him in an obtunded state. On physical examination, he appears cyanotic. Results of blood gas measurement on room air are PO2, 90 mm Hg; PCO2, 35 mm Hg; and pH, 7.3. Pulse oximetry shows low oxygen saturation. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have produced this man's illness?",Beryllium,Carbon monoxide,Nitrous oxide compounds,Oxygen,"Heating devices that burn hydrocarbons, such as petroleum products, generate carbon monoxide, which can build up to dangerous levels in unventilated or poorly ventilated houses. Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning produces central nervous system damage. Carbon monoxide binds much more tightly to the hemoglobin than does oxygen, resulting in hypoxia. Decreased mental functioning generally begins at carboxyhemoglobin levels greater than 20%, and death is likely at levels greater than 60%. The classic ""cherry red"" lividity is rare and more typical for severe acute poisoning. Acute exposure to beryllium may cause pneumonitis; chronic exposure results in a sarcoid like a pulmonary disease. Nitrous oxide compounds and ozone are found in smog and may cause respiratory discomfort with diminished respiratory function in very young individuals, very old individuals, and individuals with underlying respiratory diseases; but such exposure is not immediately life-threatening. In very high concentrations, oxygen can be toxic to the lungs and can promote diffuse alveolar damage. Sulfur dioxide emissions are a component of smog and promote acid rain; they may increase the risk of chronic bronchitis.",B
Endotoxin shock is initiated by -,Endothelial injury,Peripheral vasodilation,Increased vascular permeability,Cytokines action,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Cytokines action Septic shock Septic shock is the condition where shock is caused by infection. Currently, septic shock is most frequently triggered by gram positive bacterial infections, followed by gram? nagative bacteria and fungi. Hence, the older synonym of ""endotoxic shock"" is not appropriate. - Robbin's 8th/e 130. Pathogenesis of septic shock Septic shock is caused by gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The microbial triggers for septic shock are. i) Gram negative bacteria : - Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Gram positive bacteria : - Lipoteichoic acid, cell wall muramyl peptide, Superantigens (Staphylococal TSST, Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin). The initial event caused by all these trigers is the release of cytokines; However, mechanism is different : ? i) Gram negative bacteria (Endotoxic shock) o Lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) of gram negative organism has a core of lipid A and a complex polysaccharide coat. o Lipid A moiety of LPS bind to lipopolysaccharide binding protein and this complex then binds to CD-14 on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. o After that LPS is transferred to toll like receptor - o Signals from TLR-4 directly activate endothelium and leukocytes. ii) Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by : ? o Gram positive bacteria may cause septic shock by : ? i) Lipoteichoic acid of cell wall binds to toll like receptor-2 (TLR2) on the surface of monocyte/ macrophages and triggers the release of cytokines. ii) Superantigens are potent activators of T-lymphocytes. Superantigens bind directly to the lateral poion of TCR $ chain and MHC class II 13 chain and stimulate T-cells directly. Activated T-cells release IFN-y and IL-2 which stimulate macrophages to release primary cytotoxines. o All these result in release ofprimary cytokines. The impoant cytokines are TNF-a (most impoant cytokine in shock), IL-1 (2nd most impoant, IL-6). o After release of cytokines, the sequence of events is same for any type of septic shock : - a These cytokines activate endothelium and leukocytes which then release secondary mediators like NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL. (NO is responsible for vasodilation in septic shock). These secondary mediators cause vasodilatation, vascular leak and endothelial damage that results in shock. Release of excess primary mediators (cytokines) (TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6) Endothelial/leukocyte molecular activation Secondary mediators (NO, PAF, PG, LT, IL) Vasodilatation, capillary leak, endothelial damage Septic shock --> MODS --> Death So two mechanisms are impoant in septic shock :- i) Release of primary mediators of inflammation TNF? and IL-I. ii) Activation and damage to endothelium o Damage to endothelium leads to systemic inflammatory response which causes vasodilation and permeability leading to septic shock. o But the initial primary event is the release of primary mediators of inflammation cytokines as a result of interaction between bacterial cell wall components and host cell. The endothelium is subsequently activated and damaged by these mediators (cytokines). Therefore cvtokine release is the primary initiating factor in endotoxic shock. Infection (bacteria, fungi) Interaction of bacterial cell products with macrophages Release of primary mediation (cytokines) from macrophages Activation and damage to endothelium Release of secondary mediators o Vasodilation o Increased permeability o Decreased perfusion",D

MHC II is associated with:-,Antigen presenting cells,Red blood cells,Platelets,Epithelial cells,"During antigen recognition, CD4 molecules bind to class II MHC molecules that are displaying antigen (Fig. 6-5), and CD8 molecules bind to class I MHC molecules, and the CD4 or CD8 coreceptor initiates signals that are necessary for activation of the T cells. Because of this requirement for coreceptors, CD4+ helper T cells can recognize and respond to antigen displayed only by class II MHC molecules, whereas CD8+ cytotoxic T cells recognize cell-bound antigens only in association with class I MHC molecules; this segregation is described later. Integrins are adhesion molecules that promote the attachment of T-cells to APCs.

"During a routine breast self-examination, a 35-year-old female is concerned because her breasts feel ""lumpy."" She consults you as her primary care physician. After performing an examination, you reassure her that no masses are present and that the ""lumpiness"" is due to fibrocystic changes. Considering this clinical opinion, a pathologic finding that is consistent with the nonproliferative form of fibrocystic change is",A blue-domed cyst,A radial scar,Atypical hyperplasia,Papillomatosis,"Fibrocystic change of the breast is one of the most common features seen in the female breast. It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture. A radial scar refers to ductal proliferation around a central fibrotic area. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

Features of innate immunity A1E ?,Recognizes foreign antigen in blood,C reactive protein,Complement protein is a pa of innate immune system,Includes phagocytes and natural killer cells,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Recognised foreign antigen in blood The physiological function of the immune system is to protect individuals from infectious pathogens. The mechasnisms that are responsible for this protection fall into two broad categories ? Innate (Native Immunity) o It is the resistance to infections which an individual possesses by viue of his genetic and constitutional make up. o It is the first line of defence against infectious agents. o It is present since bih and is found both in inveebrates and veebrates. o It is not affected by prior contact with microorganisms or immunization ie antigen exposure is not required for its development. o There is no immunological memory. o It is nonspecific, it is active against a wide range of infectious agents. o Sometimes the innate immunity itself is able to control the infection on its own but sometimes the defence of the innate immunity is breached, then the adaptive immunity is called into action. Impoant components of the innate Immune system. Cells Macrophages, Dendritic cells, NK cells, NK-T cells, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, epithelial cells. Complement components Classical and alternative pathway. Antimicrobial peptides Defensins, cathelin, probiatics. 4.Pattern recognition receptors 5.Cytokines. Adaptive (Acquired) immunity o Adaptive immunity is found only in veebrates o It is based on the generation of antigen receptors on T and B lymphocytes by genn line gene rearrangements. o It is specific. o It is developed as a result of an antigenic stimulus (Immunological priming). o It provides immunological memory; subsequent antigen exposure leads to more rapid and vigorous immune responses. o The adaptive immune system consist of dual limbs of cellular and humoral immunity.

What is true about ulcerative colitis,Involves rectum and then whole colon backwards,Involves only colon,Skip lesions seen,Ileum not involved,"Classically, ulcerative colitis begins in the rectum, and in continuity extends upwards into the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, and sometimes may involve the entire colon. The colonic contents may rarely backflow into the terminal ileum in continuity, causing 'back-wash ileitis' in about 10% of cases. Grossly, the characteristic feature is the continuous involvement of the rectum and colon without any uninvolved skip areas compared to Crohn's disease.

Alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated in all of the following except-,Brain tumors,Obstructive jaundice,Bone tumors,Placental tumors,"ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE. Serum alkaline phosphatase is produced by many tissues, especially bone, liver,intestine and placenta and is excreted in the bile. Most of thenormal serum alkaline phosphatase (range 33-96 U/L) isderived from bone. Elevation in activity of the enzyme canthus be found in diseases of bone, liver and in pregnancy. Inthe absence of bone disease and pregnancy, an elevatedserum alkaline phosphatase levels generally reflecthepatobiliary disease. The greatest elevation (3 to 10 timesnormal) occurs in biliary tract obstruction. Slight to moderateincrease is seen in parenchymal liver diseases such as inhepatitis and cirrhosis and in metastatic liver disease.

Early diagnosis of acute hepatitis B infection is done by:March 2011,Presence of HBeAg in serum,Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serum,Presence of HBsAg in serum,Presence of IgG anti-HBc in serum,"Ans. B: Presence of IgM anti-HBc in serumAlthough HBsAg is the earliest virological marker in serum of patients with acute hepatitis B, it does not help in establishing the diagnosis of acute Hepatitis B infection (it may be seen in chronic cases or carrier state)It is the presence of IgM anti-HBc that confirms an acute Hepatitis B infectionHBsAgThe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is most frequently used to screen for the presence of this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection.However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host.Anti-HBc IgMThe infectious virion contains an inner ""core paicle"" enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core paicle is made of 180 or 240 copies of core protein, alternatively known as hepatitis B core antigen, or HBcAg.During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease.HbeAg and anti-HBeSholy after the appearance of the HBsAg, the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) will appear.Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivityDuring the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards.This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgGIf the host is able to clear the infection, eventually the HBsAg will become undetectable and will be followed by IgG antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG).The time between the removal of the HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period.A person negative for HBsAg but positive for anti-HBs has either cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.Hepatitis B carriersIndividuals who remain HBsAg positive for at least six months are considered to be hepatitis B carriers.Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, as revealed by biopsy.Carriers who have seroconveed to HBeAg negative status, paicularly those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.PCR testsThey have been developed to detect and measure the amount of HBV DNA, called the viral load, in clinical specimens.These tests are used to assess a person's infection status and to monitor treatment.Individuals with high viral loads, characteristically have ground glass hepatocytes on biopsy.",B

Sickle cell anemia is characterized by:September 2010,Microcytosis,Macrocytosis,Splenomegaly,Autosplenectomy,"Ans. D: AutosplenectomySickle cell anemia causes autosplenism by causing hypoxia and infarcts in the spleen. Since in the spleen blood flow is sluggish, the oxygen tension is low.When red blood cells with hemogblobin S are exposed to this low oxygen tension they tend to aggregate and polymerize. Sickled cells also express more adhesion molecules and appear more sticky. The sickle cells arrest in the hypoxic vascular bed in the spleen, resulting in a vicious cycle: decrease in 02, sickling and vascular obstruction from thrombus formation. Initially the spleen is enlarged, then progressively becomes smaller. The stasis of flow in the spleen causes hypoxic damage, thrombosis, infarction and fibrosis. In the end the spleen ""disappears"" completely (termed 'autosplenectomy').",D

Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used for:,Phagocytosis,Complement,T cell,B cell,"Nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT) is the original & most widely used test for chronic granulomatous disease. It is negative in chronic granulomatous disease & positive in normal individuals. It is used for detcting the production of reactive oxygen species in the phagocytes. Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase syst required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H2O2 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Hence they are able to kill the bacterias). Leucocytes from the patients of chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium di phagocytosis.

The standard recommended tuberculin test is the Mantoux test, which is administered by injecting a 0.1 mL of liquid containing 5 TU (tuberculin units) PPD (purified protein derivative) into the top layers of skin of the forearm. Doctors should read skin tests 48-72 hours after the injection. The basis of the reading of the skin test is the presence or absence and the amount of induration (localized swelling). A negative test does not always mean that a person is free of tuberculosis. A person who received a BCG vaccine against tuberculosis may also have a positive skin reaction to the TB test. A positive tuberculin skin test result signifies cell-mediated hypersensitivity to tubercular antigens, but does not differentiate between infection and disease.

Metastatic calcification of the gastrointestinal tract commonly affects the mucosa of:,Stomach,Esophagus,Ileum,Rectum,"Ans: A (Stomach) Ref: Robbins and Cotran, 'Pathologic Basis' of Disease 8th Edition, Elsevier, 2011, Page 38-9Explanation:Pathologic calcification is the abnormal tissue deposition of calcium salts, together with smaller amounts of iron, magnesium, and other mineral salts.There are two forms of pathologic calcification:Dystrophic CalcificationDeposition occurs locally in dying tissues.It occurs despite normal serum levels of calcium and in the absence of derangements in calcium metabolism.Dystrophic calcification is encountered in areas of necrosis, whether they are of coagulative, caseous, or liquefactive type, and in foci of enzymatic necrosis of fat.Calcification is almost always present in the atheromas of advanced atherosclerosis. It also commonly develops in aging or damaged heart valves, further hampering their function.Calcium salts appear macroscopically as fine, white granules or clumps, often felt as gritty deposits.On H & E stain, calcium salts have a basophilic, amorphous granular, sometimes clumped appearance. They can be intracellular, extracellular. or in both locations.In the course of time, heterotopic bone may be formed in the focus of calcification. On occasion single necrotic cells may constitute seed crystals that become encrusted by the mineral deposits. The progressive acquisition of outer layers may create lamellated configurations, called psammoma bodies because of their resemblance to grains of sand.Some types of papillary cancers (e.g., thyroid are apt to develop psammoma bodies.In asbestosis. calcium and iron salts gather about long slender spicules of asbestos in the lung, creating exotic, beaded dumbbell forms.In dystrophic calcification, the final common pathway is the formation of crystalline calcium phosphate mineral in the form of an apatite similar to the hydroxyapatite of bone.Metastatic CalcificationThe deposition of calcium salts in otherwise normal tissues.It almost always results from hypercalcemia secondary to some disturbance in calcium metabolism.Metastatic calcification may occur in normal tissues whenever there is hypercalcemia.Hypercalcemia also accentuates dystrophic calcification.There are four principal causes of hypercalcemia:Increased secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) w ith subsequent bone resorption, as in hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid tumors, and ectopic secretion of PTH-related protein by malignant tumors.Destruction of bone tissue, secondary to primary tumors of bone marrow (e.g.. multiple myeloma, leukemia or diffuse skeletal metastasis (e.g., breast cancer), accelerated bone turnover (e.g., Paget disease), or immobilization.Vitamin l)-related disorders, including vitamin I) intoxication, sarcoidosis (in which macrophages activate a vitamin D precursor), and idiopathic hypercalcemia of infancy (Williams syndrome), characterized by abnormal sensitiv itv to vitamin D; and Renal failure, which causes retention of phosphate, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism.Less common causes include aluminum intoxication, which occurs in patients on chronic renal dialysis, and milk-alkali syndrome, which is due to excessive ingestion of calcium and absorbable antacids such as milk or calcium carbonate.Metastatic calcification may occur widely throughout the body but principally affects the interstitial tissues of the gastric mucosa, kidneys, lungs, systemic arteries, and pulmonary veins.Though quite different in location, all of these tissues excrete acid and therefore have an internal alkaline compartment that predisposes them to metastatic calcification.In all these sites the calcium salts morphologically resemble those described in dystrophic calcification.Thus, they may occur as noncrystalline amorphous deposits or. at other times, as hydroxyapatite crystals.Usually the mineral salts cause no clinical dysfunction, but on occasion massive involvement of the lungs produces remarkable X-ray films and respiratory deficits.Massive deposits in the kidney (nephro- calcinosis) may in time cause renal damage.",A

"Two siblings with osteogenesis imperfect, but their parents are normal. Mechanism of inheritance is aEUR'",Anticipation,Genomic imprinting,Germ line mosaicism,New mutation,"Germ line mosaicism In some autosomal dominant disorders examplifled by osteogenesis imperfecta, phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected child. - This clearly violates the law of inheritance. Studies indicate that gonadal mosaicism may be responsible for such unusual inheritance. Mosaicism It means than an individual has 2 or more different cell lines derived from a single Zygote. - The persons body' is made up of a combination of cells with and without mutation for a paicular disease. - Because the mutation remains limited to a small poion of all of the body's cells, these individuals show no sign of the disease. Germline mosaicism Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. - Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. - A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. - Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. - Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation. Anticipation The signs and symptoms of some genetic conditions tend to become severe and appear at an earlier age as the disorder is passed from one generation to the next. - This phenomenon is called anticipation. Anticipation is most often seen with ceain genetic disorders of the nervous system such as Huntington's disease, Fragile x-syndrome and myotonic dystrophy. Anticipation typically occurs with disorders that are caused by an unusual type of mutation called a ""trinucleotide repeat expansion"". - A trinucleotide repeat is a sequence of three DNA building blocks (nucleotide) that is repeated a number of times in a row. - DNA segments with an abnormal number of these repeats are unstable and prone to errors during cell division. - The number of repeats can change as the gene is passed. from parent to child. - If the number of repeats increases it is known as trinucleotide repeat expansion. - In some cases the trinucleotide repeat may expand until the gene stops functioning normally,. - This expansion causes the feature of some disorders to become severe with each successive generation. Genomic imprinting People inherit two copies of their genes - one from their. father and one from their mother. Usually both copies of each gene are active or ""turned on"" in cells. But with genomic imprinting however, only one of the two copies is normally turned on. Which copy is active depends upon the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited. from a person's. father, others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. These genes are called ""imprinted genes"" because the gene was epigenetically silenced or marked in either the egg or sperm. Silencing or imprinting usually happens through the addition of methyl groups during egg or sperm formation. An individual normally has one active copy of an imprinting gene. Improper imprinting can result in individual having two active copies or two inactive copies. - This can lead to severe developmental anomalies, cancer and other problems e.g., - Prader willi - Angelman syndrome - They are both linked to same imprinting region of chromosomes 15.",C

Immunophenotype of mantle cell lymphoma Mantle cell lymphoma is neoplasm of B cells. Therefore it expresses B cell marker : CD19,CD20 Surface immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgM and IgD). Either /c or X light chain. As the tumor cells are derived from Mantle zone, they are positive for B cell marker of mantle zone i.e., CD-5. Mantle cell lymphoma is CD23 negative, this feature distinguish it from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) which is positive for both CD5 and CD23. The other characteristic marker of mantle cell lymphoma is cycline DI. Cytogenetic abnormalities. Mantle cell lymphoma is associated with an 11 : 14 translocation involving the IgH locus on chromosome 14 and the cyclin DI locus on chromosome 11. This leads to increased expression of cyclin D 1, which promotes GI to S phase progression during the cell cycle. 65 years old man with splenomegaly, lymphodenopathy CD-23 negative and CD-5 positive B-cell suggest the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma. Clinical features of mantle cell lymphoma It is usually present in fifth to sixth decade with male preponderance. The most common presentation is painless lymphodenopathy. Splenomegaly may occur.

In parts of Africa, where malaria is endemic, the gene frequency approaches 30% as a result of a protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
Much more serious are vaso-occlusive crises, which are characteristically associated with pain and often lead to tissue damage and significant morbidity and mortality. Among the most common and serious of these vasoocclusive crises are the following:

Hand-foot syndrome, resulting from infarction of bones in the hands and feet, is the most common presenting symptom in young children.Â 
Acute chest syndrome, in which sluggish blood flow in inflamed lung (e.g., an area of pneumonia) leads to sickling within hypoxemic pulmonary beds. This exacerbates pulmonary dysfunction, creating a vicious circle of worsening pulmonary and systemic hypoxemia, sickling, and vaso-occlusion. Acute chest syndrome may also be triggered by fat emboli emanating from infarcted bone.Â 

Patients with sickle cell disease also are predisposed to Salmonella osteomyelitis, possibly in part because of poorly understood acquired defects in complement function.

Rate of sickling in sickle cell anemia is directly proportional to all the following EXCEPT:,Raised HbS,Raised HbC,Raised HbF,Hb deoxygenation,"Ans. c (Raised HbF). (Ref. Robbin, Pathologic Basis of Diseases, 5th/592; 6th/611)A number of factors affect the rate and degree of sickling:# HbS (directly proportional)# HbF (inversely proportional as it inhibits polymerization of HbS)# HbC and HbD (directly proportional) HbSC have more severe disease than those with HbSA.# MCHC (directly proportional). Dehydration facilitates sickling by upper MCHC.# Fall in pH (directly proportional) by upper amount of deoxygenated Hb.Educational points:SICKLE CELL DISEASEPathogenesis# HbS (a2b6 Glu -Val) polymerizes reversibly when deoxygenated to form a gelatinous network of fibrous polymers that stiffen the RBC membrane, increase viscosity, and cause dehydration due to potassium leakage and calcium influx. These changes also produce the sickle shape.# Sickled cells lose the pliability needed to traverse small capillaries.# Hemolysis occurs because the spleen destroys the abnormal RBC.C/f:SyndromeC/fSickle cell traitUsually asymptomatic.Anemia and painful crises are exceedingly rare.An uncommon but highly distinctive symptom is painless hematuria often in adolescent males, probably due to papillary necrosis.Isosthenuria is more common.Sickle cell anemiaVasoocclusive crises with infarction of spleen, brain, marrow, kidney, lung;A septic necrosis of bone;Gallstones;Priapism;Ankle ulcers.Rx:# The most significant advance in the therapy of sickle cell anemia has been the introduction of hydroxyurea as a mainstay of therapy for patients with severe symptoms.# Hydroxyurea (10-30 mg/kg per day) increases fetal hemoglobin and may also exert beneficial affects on RBC hydration, vascular wall adherence, and suppression of the granulocyte and reticulocyte counts; dosage is titrated to maintain a white cell count between 5000 and 8000 per mL.# The 5-deoxyazacytidine (decitabine) can elevate HbF with acceptable toxicity.# Bone marrow transplantation can provide definitive cures but is effective and safe only in children.",C

Red infarct is seen in ?,Liver,Kidney,Brain,Lung,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Lung Red (Hemorrhagic) infarct : - Ovary, Lungs, Small intestine. White/Pale (anaemic) infarct : - Solid organs like hea, Spleen, Liver, Kidney, Brain. INFARCTION An infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis by occlusion of either the aerial supply or venous drainage in a paicular tissue. Pathogenesis Mostly it is caused by interrupted blood supply. ""Nearly 99% of all infarcts results from thrombotic or embolic events and almost all result from aerial occlusion"". Other causes of interrupted aerial supply are local vasospasm, extrinsic compression of a vessel by tumor, twisting of vessel e.g., in testicular torsion, expansion of atheroma due to hemorrhage within the plaque. Venous obstruction usually cause congesion, edema, infarction does not occur because bypass channels rapidly open after the thrombus, providing some outflow from the area, which inturn improves aerial inflow. Infarct cause by venous thrombosis is more likely in organs with a single venous outflow channel, such as in testis and ovary. Types of infarct Infarcts are classified on the basis of their color. Infarcts are classified into either Red (Haemorrhagic) or White or Pale (anaemic) infarcts, reflecting the amount of haemorrhage. Red infarcts (Haemorrhagic) : occur with : Venous occlusions (eg ovarian torsion); In loose tissues (such as lungs); In tissues with dual circulation (e.g. Lung & S. intestine) In tissues that were previously congested because of sluggish venous out flow. When flow is reestablilshed to a site of previous aerial occulusion and necrosis. White or Pale infarcts : occur with : Aerial occlusions, or In solid organs e.g. Hea, spleen, Liver, kidney and brain where the solidity of tissue limits the amount of haemorrhage that can seep into the area of ischaemic necrosis.",D

Pleomorphic adenoma is usually arise from-,Parotid gland,Sub mandibular gland,Minor salivary gland,Superficial lobe,"Pleomorphic AdenomaPleomorphic adenomas present as painless, slow-growing,mobile discrete masses. They represent about 60% of tumorsin the parotid, are less common in the submandibular glands,and are relatively rare in the minor salivary glands. Pleomorphicadenomas are benign tumors that consist of a mixture of ductal (epithelial) and myoepithelial cells, sothey exhibit both epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation.Epithelial elements are dispersed throughout thematrix, which may contain variable mixtures of myxoid,hyaline, chondroid (cailaginous), and even osseous tissue.In some pleomorphic adenomas, the epithelial elementspredominate; in others, they are present only in widelydispersed foci. This histologic diversity has given rise tothe alternative, albeit less preferred name mixed tumor. Thetumors consistently overexpress the transcription factorPLAG1, often because of chromosomal rearrangementsinvolving the PLAG1 gene, but how PLAG1 contributes totumor development is unknown.Pleomorphic adenomas typically manifest as rounded, well-demarcatedmasses rarely exceeding 6 cm in the greatestdimension. Although they are encapsulated, in some locations(paicularly the palate), the capsule is not fully developed,and expansile growth produces protrusions into thesurrounding tissues. The cut surface is gray-white and typicallycontains myxoid and blue translucent chondroid(cailage-like) areas. The most striking histologicfeature is their characteristic heterogeneity. Epithelial elements resembling ductal or myoepithelial cells are arrangedin ducts, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or evensheets. These typically are dispersed within a mesenchyme-likebackground of loose myxoid tissue containingislands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone (Fig. 14-6).Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ductslined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layerof deeply chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In otherinstances, there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelialcells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium alsomay be present. In most cases, no epithelial dysplasia ormitotic activity is evident. No difference in biologic behaviorhas been observed between the tumors composed largely ofepithelial elements and those composed largely of mesenchymalelements.

Absence of intra hepatic bile duct leads to which syndrme?,Von Meyenburg Complexes,Polycystic Liver Disease,Caroli Disease,Alagille Syndrome,"ANSWER: (D) Alagille SyndromeREF: Robbin s pathology chapter 18ANOMALIES OF THE BILIARY TREES (INCLUDING LIVER CYSTS)A heterogeneous group of lesions exist in which the primary abnormality is altered architecture or paucity of the intrahepatic biliary tree. Lesions may be found incidentally during radiographic studies, surgery, or at autopsy. Such conditions may become manifest as hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension in the absence of hepatic dysfunction, starting in late childhood or adolescence. There are five distinct conditions: von Meyenburg complexes, polycystic liver disease, congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli disease, and Alagille syndrome.Von Meyenburg Complexes: These are small clusters of modestly dilated bile ducts embedded in a fibrous, sometimes hyalinized, stroma located close to or within portal tracts. These lesions are often referred to as ""bile duct hamartomas"". Von Meyenburg complexes are common and without clinical significance except in the differential diagnosis of metastases to the liver.Polycystic Liver Disease: In this disease there are multiple diffuse cystic lesions in the liver, varying in number from a scattered few to hundreds. The cysts, lined by cuboidal or flattened biliary epithelium, contain straw-colored fluid.Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis: In this condition portal tracts are enlarged by irregular, broad bands of collagenous tissue, forming septa that divide the liver into irregular islands. Variable numbers of abnormally shaped bile ducts are embedded in the fibrous tissue, and are in continuity with the biliary treeCaroli Disease: In this disease the larger ducts of the intrahepatic biliary tree are segmentally dilated and may contain inspissated bile. Pure forms are rare; this disease is usually associated wdth portal tract fibrosis of the congenital hepatic fibrosis type.Alagille Syndrome (Syndromatic Paucity of Bile Ducts; Arteriohepatic Dysplasia): This is a rare autosomal dominant multi-organ disorder, in which the liver pathology is characterized by absence of bile ducts in portal tracts. The syndrome is caused by mutations or deletion of the gene encoding Jaggedl, which is located on chromosome 20p. Jaggedl is a cell surface protein that functions as a ligand for Notch receptors. Affected patients have five major clinical features: chronic cholestasis, peripheral stenosis of the pulmonary artery, butterfly-like vertebral arch defects, an eye defect known as posterior embryotoxon, and a peculiar hypertelic facies. Patients can survive into adulthood but are at risk for hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.",D
Examine the above pedigree cha. Which one of the following diseases is the most likely for this situation?,Neurofibromatosis,Beta-thalassemia,Colour blindness,Vitamin D resistant rickets,"Beta thalassemias (b thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders. They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at 1 in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the HBB gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation. HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads to the underproduction of HbA. Reductions in HbA available overall to fill the red blood cells in turn leads to microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia ultimately develops in respect to inadequate HBB for sufficient red blood cell functioning. Due to this factor, the patient may require blood transfusions to make up for the blockage in the beta-chains. Repeated blood transfusions can lead to build-up of iron overload, ultimately resulting in iron toxicity. This iron toxicity can cause various problems, including myocardial siderosis and hea failure leading to the patient's death.",B

All of the following are tumor suppressor genes except: September 200,NF1,pRb,SMAD1,p53,"Ans. C: SMAD1Tumor suppressor gene/anti-oncogene is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene is mutated to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes.The first tumor-suppressor protein discovered was the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb/RB1) in human retinoblastoma. Another impoant tumor suppressor is the p53 tumor-suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene.Homozygous loss of p53 is found in 70% of colon cancers, 30-50% of breast cancers, and 50% of lung cancers. Mutated p53 is also involved in the pathophysiology of leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, and neurogenic tumors. Abnormalities of the p53 gene can be inherited in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which increases the risk of developing various types of cancers. PTEN acts by opposing the action of PI3K, which is essential for anti-apoptotic, pro-tumorogenic Akt activation.NFl somatic mutations is associated with neuroblastomas and neurofibromatosis type 1 is associated with inherited mutations of NFl.Other examples of tumor suppressors include APC, SMAD2, SMAD4 and ST14.",C

Edema in nephrotic syndrome is due to aEUR',Na and water restriction,Increased venous pressure,Hypoalbuminemia,Hyperlipidemia,Hypoalbuminemia Edema is one of the major clinical manifestations of nephritic syndrome. Two major factors have been thought to be responsible for this problem and it is likely that both contribute to a variable decree in individual patients. i) Low colloid oncotic pressure :? - In nephrotic syndrome the initial event is a derangement in the capillary walls of glomeruli resulting in increased permeability to plasma proteins. - The increased permeability allows protein to escape from plasma to glomerular filtrate. Long standing loss of protein leads to hypoalbuntinemia. - The loss of protein (albumin) leads to reduced colloid oncotic pressure. Fluids are held in the intravascular compament because of the colloid oncotic pressure. When the colloid oncotic pressure is reduced the fluid cannot be retained in the intravascular compament and moves out in the interstitial fluid producing edema. ii)Sodium retention directly induced by renal disease.,C

Metastasis Metastasis is the spread and growth of malignant cells to produce secondry neoplasm at a site distant from and discontinous with the primary neoplasm. It is the most reliable feature of malignancy. o With few exceptions, all cancer metastatize. The major exceptions are glioma of CNS and basal cell carcinoma of skin, But both of these are locally invasive. Local invasion The malignant tumors progressively infiltrate and destroy the surrounding tissue and tumor cells move beyond the normal confins a process that is called local invasion. Due to local invasion, malignant tumors are poorly demarcated from the surrounding normal tissue and a well ? defined cleavage plane is lacking that makes their surgical resection difficult, and even if tumor appears well circumscribed, it is necessory to remove a considerable margin of apperently normal tissues adjacent to the neoplasm. ) After metastasis, it is the most reliable feature of malignancy.",B

Atherosclerosis initiation by fibroblast plaque is mediated by injury to -,Smooth muscle,Media,Adventitia,Endothelium,"The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is ""the response to injury hypothesis"".
According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the arterial wall initiated by injury to endothelium.

Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis 
Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis

1. Endothelial injury

Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade.
Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornerstone in the development of atherosclerosis.
After the injury, the endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium.
TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression.

2. Migration of leukocytes

When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium.
Leukocytes then cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space.
Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells -> formation of the earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak.
Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL).

3. Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation

Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-Î± and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation.

4. Maturation of plague

Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collagen) and convert a fatty streak into a mature fibro-fatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",D

All are true regarding apoptosis except:,Associated with inflammation,Phagocytosis of breakdown products,Programmed cell death,Cell shrinkage,"Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition, Chapter l, Pg: 3Explanation: ApoptosisApoptosis is a pathway of cell death that is induced by a tightly regulated suicide program in which cells destined to die activate enzymes that degrade the cells' own nuclear DMA and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins.Apoptotic cells break up into fragments, called apoptotic bodies, which contain portions of the cytoplasm and nucleus.The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell and bodies remains intact, but its structure is altered in such a way that these become ''tasty"" targets for phagocytes.The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly devoured, before the contents have leaked out. and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host.Apoptosis is different from NecrosisCharacteristics of NecrosisLoss of membrane integrityEnzymatic digestion of cellsLeakage of cellular contentsInflammatory reactionHowever, apoptosis and necrosis sometimes coexist, and apoptosis induced by some pathologic stimuli may progress to necrosis.Morphology of ApoptosisThe following morphologic features, some best seen with the electron microscope, characterize cells undergoing apoptosisCell shrinkage. The cell is smaller in size; the cytoplasm is dense; and the organelles, though relatively normal, are more tightly packed.Chromatin condensation. This is the most characteristic feature of apoptosis. The chromatin aggregates peripherally, under the nuclear membrane, into dense masses of various shapes and sizes. The nucleus itself may break up, producing two or more fragments.Formation of cytoplasmic blebs and apoptotic bodies. The apoptotic cell first show s extensive surface blebbing. then undergoes fragmentation into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies composed of cytoplasm and tightly packed organelles, with or without nuclear fragments.Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or cell bodies, usually hv macrophages. The apoptotic bodies are rapidly ingested by phagocytes and degraded by the phagocyte's lysosomal enzymes.Plasma membranes are thought to remain intact during apoptosis, until the last stages, when they become permeable to normally retained solutes.On histologic examination, in tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin, the apoptotic cell appears as a round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with fragments of dense nuclear chromatin.Because the cell shrinkage and formation of apoptotic bodies are rapid and the pieces are quickly phagocytosed, considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histologic sections.Apoptosis--(in contrast to necrosis)--does not elicit inflammation, making it more difficult to detect histologically.Two pathways for Apoptosis- Mitochondria] (Intrinsic Pathway)- Death receptor (Extrinsic Pathway)",A

"A patient with microcytic hypochromic anemia, Hb-9%, serum iron is 20 p./d1, ferritin level 800 mg/ml, transferrin percentage saturation is 64. What is possible diagnosis aEUR'",Atransferrinemia,Iron deficiency anemia,DMT 1 mutation,Hemochromatosis,"Atransferinemia Derangment in serum iron indices mentioned in the question : ? Microcytic hypochromic anemia Low serum iron - Normal (50-170 ,ug/dI) High serum. ferritin Normal (30-400 ng/ml) High serum transferrin Normal (30-50%) Let's look at the options first Iron deficiency anemia Can be easily ruled out as serum ferritin is low in Iron deficiency anemia. Hemochromatosis Hemochromato.sis is characterized by increased serum iron level. So, we are left with two options - Atransferinemia and DMT1 mutation These are classified in genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. - Here is a brief discussion on genetic, forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia -Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. - Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entices of iron deficiency anemia in nonbleeding and ""high cost diet"" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic ,fonns of iron deficiency anemia. - Apparently rare these genetic .forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration. These includes - Mutations in gene encoding DMT1 - Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5. - Hypotransferrinemia or Atransferriemia - Deficiency of ceruloplasmin - IRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia) Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 Mutation Atransferrinemia Glutaredoxin 5 Aceruloplasminemia Age at diagnosis At bih Late onset Midlife Laic onset Anemia Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microctic hypochromic Serum iron High Low High Low Transferrin saturation High High or non measurable High Low Serum ferritin Low or normal fen-itin High High High ,o Ringed sideroblasts No No Yes No Liver iron overload Yes Yes Yes Yes Brain damage No No No Yes Hepcidin levels Low et Not y measured Not yet measured Not yet measured Coming back to the question The serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i.e., low serum iron increased serum ferritn, increased transferring saturation. DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level. Atransferrinemia Transferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts. Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia. This leads to massive but .futile iron absorption. The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead. it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts. Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow. DMT Lmutation DMT1 is a tran.smembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endosomal membrane of the erythroid precursors. In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected. The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",A
True about Hemochromatosis is?,Iron deposits in the viscera and its destruction,Is genetically homogenous,Completely penetrant,Females are more commonly affected than male,"ANSWER: (A) Iron deposits in the viscera and its destructionREF: Robbins 8th edn Page 1642-43, Wintrobes 12th ed page 860, 862Option (A); Gray or bronze pigmentation is the most common physical examination abnormality in hemochromatosis homozygotes, occurring in approximately 35 to 84%. Other common physical examination findings include arthropathy (13 to 68%), hepatomegaly- hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (54 to 93%), splenomegaly (10 to 55%), irregular heartbeat, congestive heart failure, telangiectases, and loss of midline body hair or testicular atrophy.The morphologic changes in hereditary hemochromatosis are characterized principally by:Deposition of hemosiderin in the following organs (in decreasing order of severity): liver, pancreas, myocardium, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid and parathyroid glands, joints, and skin (detected by the Prussian blue histologic reaction or by atomic absorption analysis of tissue)Liver cirrhosis (micronodular)Pancreatic fibrosisOption (B) & (C); Penetrance in genetics is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene (allele or genotype) that also expresses an associated trait (phenotype). A condition, most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, is said to show complete penetrance. Only Hemochromatosis Type 4 & 5 are autosomal dominant, both of which are rare. Since Hemochromatosis shows both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant pattern it is genetically heterogenous not homogenousWintrobe's 12th ed Table 29.1Heritable DisorderChromosomalAssignmentHeritabilityCause of Iron LoadingHemochromatosis type 16p21.3Autosomal recessiveMutations of HFEHemochromatosis Type 2Alq21Autosomal recessiveUnknownHemochromatosis Type 2B19ql3Autosomal recessiveHepcidin antimicrobial peptide gene mutationsHemochromatosis type 37q22Autosomal recessiveInactivation of transferrin receptor 2Hemochromatosis type 42q32Autosomal dominantFerroportin gene mutationsHemochromatosis type 511q 12-q13Autosomal dominantH-ferritin gene mutationOption (D); Frequency of Hemochromatosis in Men and WomenBecause hemochromatosis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive condition, there should be equal numbers of male and female homozygotes. Overt iron-overload organ injury and illness occur more frequently in men than in women who have this disorder. Women are protected somewhat by the menstrual loss of 15 to 25 mg of iron each month, and by the transfer of approximately 750 mg of iron to the fetus during pregnancy. Menstrual blood losses and pregnancy do not explain all of the differences in body iron stores between male and female homozygotes. It is possible that an additional factor(s) prevents most women with hemochromatosis from absorbing and accumulating as much iron as affected men.",A

Vegetations can be single or multiple and may involve more than one valve; they can occasionally erode into the underlying myocardium and produce an abscess (ring abscess; Fig. 12-25B). Vegetations are prone to embolization; because the embolic fragments often contain virulent organisms, abscesses frequently develop where they lodge, leading to sequelae such as septic infarcts or mycotic aneurysms. The vegetations of subacute endocarditis are associated with less valvular destruction than those of acute endocarditis, although the distinction can be subtle. Microscopically, the vegetations of subacute IE typically exhibit granulation tissue at their bases indicative of healing.

Centrosome duplication takes place in -,M phase,GO phase,S phase,G2 phase,"Centrosome duplication is heavily regulated by cell cycle controls. This link between the cell cycle and the centrosome cycle is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). There has been ample evidence that Cdk2 is necessary for both DNA replication and centrosome duplication, which are both key events in S phase. It has also been shown that Cdk2 complexes with both cyclin A and cyclin E and this complex is critical for centrosome duplication. Three Cdk2 substrates have been proposed to be responsible for regulation of centriole duplication. These include: nucleophosmin (NPM/B23), CP110, and MPS1. Nucleophosmin is only found in unreplicated centrosomes and it's phosphorylation by Cdk2/cyclin E removes NPM from the centrosomes, initiating procentriole formation. CP110 is an impoant centrosomal protein that is phosphorylated by both mitotic and interphase Cdk/cyclin complexes and is thought to influence centrosome duplication in S phase. MPS1 is a protein kinase that is essential to the spindle assembly checkpoint, and may remodel an SAS6-cored intermediate between severed mother and daughter centrioles into a pair of cawheel protein complexes onto which procentrioles assembleS-phase (synthesis phase) is the pa of the cell cycle in which DNA is replicated, occurring between G1 phase and G2 phase.

Like other DNA viruses, the HHV-8 genome encodes proteins that interfere with the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways. The other choices are hereditary conditions associated with cancer; however, these patients do not typically acquire Kaposi sarcoma. The predominant malignancy seen in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (choice B) is lymphoma/leukemia.Diagnosis: Kaposi sarcoma, AIDS",A
