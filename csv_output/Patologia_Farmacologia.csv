True statements regarding hereditary spherocytosis are all of the following except: March 2012,Splenomegaly,Anemia,Spherocytosis is a pathognomic finding,It is due to intrinsic defect in RBC membrane skeleton,"Ans: C i.e. Spherocytosis is a pathognomic finding Hereditary spherocytosis The characteristic clinical features are anemia, moderate splenomegaly (500-1000 gm), and jaundice. The most specific morphologic finding of hereditary spherocytosis is spherocytosis but spherocytosis is not pathognomic, since other forms of membrane loss, such as in autoimmune haemolytic anemias, also cause the formation of spherocytes Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited disorder caused by intrinsic defects in the RBC membrane skeleton that render RBC spheroid, less deformable, and vulnerable to splenic sequestration and destruction.",C
Which of the following drug can cause cailage damage in children?,Cotrimoxazole,Penicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Metronidazole,"Ciprofloxacin (prototype) It is the most potent first generation FQ active against a broad range of bacteria, the most susceptible ones are the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, especially the Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria. The MIC of ciprofloxacin against these bacteria is usually < 0.1 J.Ig/ml, while grampositive bacteria are inhibited at relatively higher concentrations On the basis of the finding that administered to immature pups ciprofloxacin (and other FQs) caused cailage damage in weight bearing joints, the FQs have been contraindicated in children. However, under pressing situations like Pseudomonas pneumonia in cystic fibrosis and multi-resistant typhoid, ciprofloxacin has been administered to millions of children in India and elsewhere. Though a few cases of joint pain and swelling have been repoed, cailage damage has not occurred. Caution may seem prudent while using FQs in children.

Which of the following is not seen in'Hereditary Spherocytosis:,Direct Coomb's Positive,Increased Osmotic Fragility,Splenomegaly,Gall Stones,"Answer is A (Direct Coomb's Positive)Coomb's Negative Haemolytic Anaemia.Coomb's test is impoant to distinguish Hereditary Spherocytosis from Autoimmune haemolysis which is another common cause of Spherocytosis. Hereditary Spherocytosis is a coomb's negative haemolytic anemia (non-immune mediated) characterized clinically by anaemia, jaundice, splenomegaly and pigment gall stones. Typical Laboratory findings include spherocytosis (abundant spherocytes on peripheral smear) and increased osmotic fragility. There is no definitive treatment to correct the primary defect in the membrane cytoskeletal structure. Splenectomy remains the treatment of choice for severe cases of Hereditary Spherocytosis (since Spleen is the primary site of destruction of red blood cells and transit through the splenic circulation makes them more spherocytic thereby accelerating their death.",A
Hemorrhagic cystitis is caused by aEUR',Busulphan,Cisplatin,Cyclophosphamide,Doxorubicin,"Cyclophosphamide Hemorrhagic cystitis is commonly associated with Cyclophosphamide Cyclophocphamide is the most common cause of hemorrhagic cystitis. The drug Cyclophosphamide itself is not toxic. The drug toxicity is due to its hepatic conversion to the metabolite ""acrolein"" which is excreted in the urine and causes damage to the bladder mucosa - It is believed that urothelial damage occurs due to direct contact of the bladder wall with acrotein which causes edema, ulceration, neovascularisation, hemorrhage and necrosis - Thus patients receiving cyclophosphamide should always receive good hydration and a .foley's catheter is often placed to ensure immediate drainage of the bladder. The hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide can be reduced in intensity or prevented by intravenous administration of ""MESNA"" -MESNA is a thiol compound. The .free (Thiol) groups of MESNA combine directly with double bond of acrolein of form a stable nontoxic compound.

True about Apoptosis are all except :,>Inflammation is present,>Chromosomal brekage,>Clumping of chromatin,>Cell shrinkage,"inflammation is present [Ref. Robbins 7th/e p 31, 271 At early stage of apoptosis dying cells secrete soluble factors that recruit phagocytes. Apoptotic cells express phosplzatidylserine in the outer layers of their plasma membrane. Some times thrombospondin is also expressed on the surface of apoptotic bodies. These alterations permit the early recognition of dead cells by the macrophages, resulting in phagocytosis without the release of proinflammatory cellular components. In this way apoptotic response disposes of cells with minimal compromise to the surrounding tissue. The process of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is so efficient that dead cells disappear without leaving a trace and inflammation is viually absent. Thus apoptosis is fundamentally different from necrosis which is characterized by loss of membrane integrity enzymatic digestion of cells and frequently a host reaction. In case of apoptosis, the cell membrane remains intact. The two most striking features of apoptosis are: 1.1n contrast to necrosis it does not elicit inflammation 2. Considerable apoptosis may occur in tissues before it becomes apparent in histological section (because it occurs very rapidly). Morphological changes in apoptosis 1. Cell shrinkage This is the earliest change. It is due to damage of cytoskeletal proteins that provide structural suppo to the cell. 2. Chromatic Condensation (Pyknosis) This is due to breakdown and clumping of chromatin. This is most characteristic feature of apoptosis 3.Formation of cytoplasimic blebs and apoptotic bodies ---> End stage is characterised by bleb formation. 4. Chromosomal DNA fragmentation It is due to activity of endoneuclease and caspases. 5.Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and bodies by adjacent macrophages or healthy parenchymal cells. In histological sections apoptotic cell appears as round or oval mass of intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm with dens nucleus chromatin fragments. Note : Cell shrinkage and fragmentation allow the cells to be efficiently phagocytosed without release of proinflammatory cellular component.",A

Centrizonal necrosis of liver occurs with -a) Carbon tetrachloride (CC14) toxicityb) Heart failure (CHF)c) Smoking (chronic)d) Chronic alcoholism,ac,ab,ad,bc,"Hepatocellular necrosis: -

Liver necrosis is a common manifestation of many liver diseases and it can present in various ways.
If severe it can cause liver failure.
In some cases however the necrosis is subclinical, revealed only by elevations of liver enzymes in serum.
Various diseases can cause different patterns of necrosis. These are —

Focal Necrosis -
Randomly occurring necrosis of single cells or small clusters of cells.
It can involve any area of the lobule
All lobules are not involved.

Characteristic features on biopsy are -

Councilman bodies
Areas of lysed liver cells surrounded by collection of kupffer cells and inflammatory cells.

Causes of Focal necrosis -
Viral hepatitis, Bacterial infections, Toxic damage
Zonal necrosis -
The characteristic of zonal necrosis is that identical regions of liver lobules are involved.
All liver lobules are involved.
The necrosis is divided according to the zone involved
(Note: In focal necrosis any area of lobule and some lobules are involved.)

Types of zonal necrosis
(a) Centrizonal necrosis (centrilobular) → Necrosis in the cells surrounding central hepatic vein, seen in -

Cardiac failure or shock     
Carbon tetrachloride toxicity (CC14) 
Chloroform toxicity
Viral hepatities

(b) Peripheral zonal necrosis (periportal) → Necrosis is seen in areas around the portal tracts, Seen in
(i) Eclampsia                
(ii) Phosphorus poisoning
(c) Midzonal necrosis → Rare, seen in yellow fever

Also know —

Submassive necrosis → Occurrence of liver cell necrosis that is not limited by lobular boundaries i.e., the necrosis extends beyond lobular boundaries.
Massive liver necrosis → In this large areas of liver cell undergo necrosis. Only small areas are left intact.
Massive and submassive liver necrosis are clinically manifested as.

Gene for retinoblastoma is located on,Chromosome 13,Chromosome 1,Chromosome 10,Chromosome 5,"harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition. *autosomal dominant trait by retinoblastoma susceptibility gene located on chromosome 13. RB Gene: Governor of the Cell Cycle It is useful to begin with the retinoblastoma gene (RB), the first tumor suppressor gene to be discovered and, as it happens, a prototypical representative. As with many advances in medicine, the discovery of tumor suppressor genes was accomplished by the study of a rare disease--in this case, retinoblastoma, an uncommon childhood tumor. Approximately 60% of retinoblastomas are sporadic, and the remaining ones are familial, the predisposition to develop the tumor being transmitted as an autosomal dom- inant trait. To account for the sporadic and familial occur- rence of an identical tumor, Knudson, in 1974, proposed his now famous two-hit hypothesis, which in molecular terms can be stated as follows: * Two mutations (hits) are required to produce retinoblas- toma. These involve the RB gene, which has been mapped to chromosomal locus 13q14. Both of the normal alleles of the RB locus must be inactivated (hence the two hits) for the development of retinoblastoma (Fig. 5-21). * In familial cases, children inherit one defective copy of the RB gene in the germ line; the other copy is normal. Retinoblastoma develops when the normal RB gene is lost in retinoblasts as a result of somatic mutation. Because in retinoblastoma families only a single somatic mutation is required for expression of the disease, the familial transmission follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. * In sporadic cases, both normal RB alleles are lost by somatic mutation in one of the retinoblasts. The end result is the same: a retinal cell that has lost both of the normal copies of the RB gene becomes cancerous. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 183",A

Which of the following is a guanylate cyclase agonist used in irritable bowel syndrome?,Lubiprostine,Linaclotide,Tegaserod,Methyl naltrexone,"Linaclotide is a poorly absorbed 14-amino-acid peptide that binds to the guanylate cylase C receptor on the luminal surface of intestinal enterocytes, activating the cystic fibrosis transmembrane chloride conductance channel and stimulating intestinal fluid secretion. Therefore it is use in irritable bowel syndrome. Lubiprostone selectively stimulates type 2 chloride channels in epithelial cells thereby causing an efflux of chloride into the intestinal lumen. The resultant fluid secretion into the gastrointestinal lumen provides a bolus effect that softens stool, increases intestinal transit, and improves symptoms of constipation. Lubiprostone acts locally within the intestinal tract, is rapidly metabolized, and has very low systemic bioavailability. Tegaserod is a serotonin 5-HT 4 paial agonist that has high affinity for 5-HT 4 receptors but no appreciable binding to 5-HT 3 or dopamine receptors.

Formation and aggregation of the Ap peptide are now considered central to the pathogenesis of AD. Ap peptide is derived from the abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). When APP, a transmembrane protein, is cleaved by a-secretase within the Ap sequence, followed by g-secretases, a soluble nontoxic fragment is formed. Cleavage of the Ap sequence by b-secretase and then g-secretase gives rise to Ap peptides that aggregate and form the amyloid cores that elicit a microglial and astrocytic response to form neuritic plaques. Conformational change in prion protein leads to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, rapidly progressive dementia with spongiform encephalopathy but not neuritic plaques or amyloid deposition. Loss of dopaminergic neurons with a deficiency of dopamine is central to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Expansion of polyglutamine repeats owing to CAG trinucleotide repeat-expansion underlies Huntington disease. Although abnormally phosphorylated forms of tau protein are found in neurofibrillary tangles seen in AD, there is no mutation of the tau gene, and the tangles are not considered primary in the pathogenesis of AD.

Cell-mediated immunity is-,Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,"Cell-mediated (Type) hypersensitivity

It is initiated by activated T-lymphocytes.

It includes
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity - mediated by CD-4 T cells.
2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity - mediated by CDS- T cells.
1. Delayed-type hypersensitivity

In delayed hypersensitivity reactions, CD-4 T cells and macrophages are primarily involved.
The term delayed is used to differentiate it from a secondary' cellular response, which appears at 48-72 hours after antigen exposure and from an immediate hypersensitivity response, which generally appears within minutes,
Delayed hypersensitivity is a major mechanism of defence against various intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria, fungi and certain parasites.

Pathophysiology

Delayed hypersensitivity is characterized by the formation of granuloma - a localized mass that contains activated macrophages (epithelioid) cells surrounded by colour of lymphocytes and giant cells.
It is also called granulomatous Inflammation.
The cellular events start when an antigen (eg tuberculin antigen) on antigen presenting cell comes in contact with naive CD-4 T cells → naive CD-4 T cells recognize this peptide antigen in association with MHC – II and differentiate into T4-l cells.
Induction of T4-l cells is of central importance because the expression of delayed hypersensitivity largely depends on the cytokines secreted by T4-l cells.

2. T-cell mediated cytotoxicity

In this type of hypersensitivity, cytotoxic T cells kill virus-infected or tumor cells.",D

Factors influencing wound healing are the following:,Nutrition,Adequate blood supply,Size and location of wound,All of the above,"Factors That Impair Tissue Repair 
Tissue repair may be impaired by a variety of factors that reduce the quality or adequacy of the reparative process. Factors that interfere with healing may be extrinsic (e.g., infection) or intrinsic to the injured tissue, and systemic or local:

Infection is one of the most important causes of delayed healing; it prolongs inflammation and potentially increases the local tissue injury.
Diabetes is a metabolic disease that compromises tissue repair for many reasons, and is an important systemic cause of abnormal wound healing.
Nutritional status has profound effects on repair; protein malnutrition and vitamin C deficiency, for example, inhibit collagen synthesis and retard healing.
Glucocorticoids (steroids) have well-documented anti-inflammatory effects, and their administration may result in weak scars because they inhibit TGF-β production and diminish fibrosis. In some instances, however, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are desirable. For example, in corneal infections, glucocorticoids may be prescribed (along with antibiotics) to reduce the likelihood of opacity due to collagen deposition.
Mechanical factors such as increased local pressure or torsion may cause wounds to pull apart (dehisce).
Poor perfusion, resulting either from arteriosclerosis and diabetes or from obstructed venous drainage (e.g., in varicose veins), also impairs healing.
Foreign bodies such as fragments of steel, glass, or even bone impede healing.
The type and extent of tissue injury affects subsequent repair. Complete restoration can occur only in tissues composed of cells capable of proliferating: even then, an extensive injury will probably result in incomplete tissue regeneration and at least partial loss of function. Injury to tissues composed of non-dividing cells must inevitably result in scarring; such is the case with healing of a myocardial infarct.
The location of the injury and the character of the tissue in which the injury occurs also are important.

Serum erythropoietin levels are low for the level of Hb and hepcidin levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anemia of chronic disease,Aplastic anemia,Iron deficiency anemia,Megaloblastic anemia,"The increased ferritin concentration and reduced total iron-binding capacity are typical of anemia of chronic diseases, such as an autoimmune disease. Increased levels of cytokines such as interleukin-6 lead to increased hepatic production of hepcidin that stops ferroportin from releasing storage iron, promoting sequestration of storage iron, with poor use for erythropoiesis. The secretion of erythropoietin by the kidney is impaired. Various underlying diseases, including cancer, collagen vascular diseases, and chronic infections, can produce this pattern of anemia. An iron deficiency would produce microcytic anemia, with a low serum ferritin level and reduced hepcidin production. Aplastic anemia is unlikely because the platelet count and WBC count are normal. Megaloblastic anemias are macrocytic without an increase in iron stores. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are caused by serious acute conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation; these patients have thrombocytopenia caused by widespread thrombosis.

Which antithyroid drug can be safely used in pregnancy,Propylthiouracil,I121,Methimazole,Carbimazole,"This question has been repeated several times before. Remember these important points. 
All antithyroid drugs can cross placenta so risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitre is always there. Both carbimazole and propylthiouracil can be used during pregnancy, but propylthiouracil is the drug of choice because its greater protein binding allows low doses of propylthiouracil to be transferred across the placenta and therefore less chance of hypothyroidism. 
The lowest effective dose of propylthiouracil should be given and it is often possible to stop treatment in the last trimester since TSH Receptor antibodies tend to decline in pregnancy.
Radioactive iodine is C/I during pregnancy. It can destroy the fetal thyroid tissue resulting in cretinism Carbimazole and methimazole have been associated with rare cases of foetal aplasia cutis.",A

About half of cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma are due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Other risk factors include a family history of the condition and having HIV/AIDS. There are two major types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. Diagnosis is by finding Hodgkin's cells such as multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells (RS cells) in lymph nodes. Hodgkin lymphoma may be treated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant. The choice of treatment often depends on how advanced the cancer is and whether or not it has orable features. In early disease a cure is often possible.

ANCA are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies directed against antigens which are found within the primary granules of neutrophil and in the lysosomes of monocytes and in EC's.
The description of these autoantibodies is based on the immunofluorescence pattern of staining of ethanol-fixed neutrophils. With immunofluorescence two principal patterns are recognized:

1. Cytoplasmic (c-ANCA):

This shows cytoplasmic localization of the staining and the target antigen for this type of autoantibody is — proteinase-3 (PR3), a neutrophil granule constituent.

2. Perinuclear staining (p-ANCA) —

This shows perinuclear staining and the target antigen here is myeloperoxide (MPO). Remember that either of these antibodies may occur in a patient with ANCA associated small vessel vasculitis but

Others probably exist; although IL-18 - a membrane of the IL-1 family - does not appear to be pyrogenic cytokine. Each cytokine is encoded by a separate gene, and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF produce fever at low doses (10 to 100 ng/kg).> Fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1deg to 4degC, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is caused by infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level.

A: AdenocarcinomaGastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%).Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria.Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate.Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces).

It could be a nutritional deficiency in children and pregnant women, but more likely is due to chronic blood loss in adults. The ferritin concentration is a measure of storage iron because it is derived from the total body storage pool in the liver, spleen, and marrow. About 80% of functional body iron is contained in hemoglobin; the remainder is in muscle myoglobin. Individuals with severe liver disease can have an elevated serum ferritin level because of its release from liver stores. A bone marrow biopsy specimen provides a good indication of iron stores because the iron stain of the marrow shows hemosiderin in macrophages, but such a biopsy is an expensive procedure. Some patients with hemoglobinopathies, such as b-thalassemia, also can have microcytic anemia, but this is far less common than iron deficiency. The serum haptoglobin level is decreased with intravascular hemolysis, but the anemia is normocytic because the iron can be recycled. The serum iron concentration or transferrin level by itself gives no indication of iron stores because, in anemia of chronic disease, the patient's iron level can be normal to low, and the transferrin levels also can be normal to low, but iron stores are increased. Transferrin, a serum transport protein for iron, usually has about 33% iron saturation.",C

All of the following are true regarding CLL except: March 2008,Most common type of leukemia in adults,Males are commonly affected,ZAP-70 has prognostic impoance,Affects T-cells,"Ans. D: Affects T-cellsB-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)/chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), is the most common type of leukemia of the adults.CLL affects B cell lymphocytes.B cells originate in the bone marrow, develop in the lymph nodes, and normally fight infection by producing antibodies. In CLL, the DNA of a B cell is damaged, so that it can't produce antibodies. Additionally, B cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow and blood, where they crowd out healthy blood cells.Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 55, and the majority are men.Most people are diagnosed without symptoms as the result of a routine blood test that returns a high white blood cell count, but, as it advances, CLL results in swollen lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, and eventually anemia and infections. DNA analysis has distinguished two major types of CLL, with different survival times.CLL that is positive for the marker ZAP-70 has an average survival of 5 years.CLL that is negative for ZAP-70 has an average survival of more than 25 years.",D

Most common type of malignancy of stomach is: September 2007,Adenocarcinoma,Squamous carcinoma,Anaplastic carcinoma,Lymphoma,"Ans. A: Adenocarcinoma Gastric adenocarcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are commonly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa, and thence the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumor cells describe irregular tubular structures, harboring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (""back to back"" aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighboring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiate. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica, leather-bottle stomach) Tumor cells are discohesive and secrete mucus which is delivered in the interstitium producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically ""empty"" spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumor cell, it pushes the nucleus at the purpley""signet-ring cell"". Around 5% of gastric carcinomas are lymphomas (MALTomas, or MALT lymphoma). Carcinoid and stromal tumors may also occur.",A
Chronotrophic means: March 2010,Drugs affecting the contractility of hea,Drugs affecting hea rate,Drugs affecting the myocardial blood flow,Drugs affecting diastolic relaxation,"Ans. B: Drugs affecting hea rate Chronotropic effects are those drugs that change the hea rate. Chronotropic drugs may change the hea rate by affecting the nerves controlling the hea, or by changing the rhythm produced by the sinoatrial node. Positive chronotropes increase hea rate; negative chronotropes decrease hea rate. A dromotrope affects Atrioventricular node (AV node) conduction. A positive dromotrope increases AV nodal conduction, and a negative dromotrope decreases AV nodal conduction. A lusitrope is an agent that affects diastolic relaxation. Inotropes affects contractility of the hea. Chronotropic variables in systolic myocardial performance can be split left and right. Left sided systolic chronotropy can be appreciated as Aoic Valve open to close time. Right sided variables are represented by Pulmonary valve open to close time. Inveed as diastolic chronotropy, the variables are aoic valve close to open and pulmonic close to open time.",B

Which of the following statement(s) is/are about reticulocyte?,Smaller than RBC,↑in hemolytic anemia,Staining is done by Romanowsky stain,Contain nucleus,"Reticulocytes 

Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells. Reticulocytes (slightly larger than RBCs) typically compose about 1% of the red cells.
Reticulocytes develop and mature in the bone marrow and then circulate for about a day in the blood before developing into mature red blood cells.
Like red blood cells, reticulocytes do not have a nucleus.
Reticulocytes are so named because of a reticular (mesh-like) network of ribosomal RNA that becomes visible under a microscope with supravital stains such as methylene blue and Brillient cresyl blue.
Reticulocytes appear slightly bluer than other red cells when looked at with the normal Romanowsky stain.
When there is an increased production of red blood cells to overcome chronic or severe loss of mature RBCs, such as in hemolytic anemia, people often have markedly high number and percentage of reticulocests (reticulocytosis).
Decreased numbers of reticulocytes is seen in chemotherapy, aplastic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, Vit B folic acid deficiency, pernicious anemia, bone marrow malignancies, anemia of chronic disease.


Note :

Usually supravital stains (methylene blue and Brilliant cresyl blue) are used for reticulocytes.

Rosenthal fibres in astrocytoma is composed of,Heat shock proteins,Fibrillar proteins,GFAP,Globulins,"Well-differentiated astrocytomas are poorly defined, gray, infiltrative tumors that expand and disto the invaded brain without forming a discrete mass (Fig. 22-28, A). Infiltration beyond the grossly evident margins is always present. The cut surface of the tumor is either firm or soft and gelatinous; cystic degeneration may be seen. In glioblastoma, variation in the gross appearance of the tumor from region to region is characteristic (Fig. 22-28, B). Some areas are firm and white, others are soft and yellow (the result of tissue necrosis), and still others show regions of cystic degeneration and hemorrhage. Well-differentiated astrocytomas are characterized by a mild to moderate increase in the number of glial cell nuclei, somewhat variable nuclear pleomorphism, and an intervening feltwork of fine, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytic cell processes that give the background a fibrillary appearance. The transition between neoplastic and normal tissue is indistinct, and tumor cells can be seen infiltrating normal tissue many centimeters from the main lesion. Ana- plastic astrocytomas show regions that are more densely cellular and have greater nuclear pleomorphism; mitotic figures are present.

Blood level of which clotting factor declines most rapidly after the initiation of warfarin therapy,Factor X,Prothrombin,Factor VII,Factor IX,"WARFARIN(oral anticoagulant) Mech of action:- They act indirectly by interfering with the synthesis of vit K dependent clotting factors in liver. They apparently behave as competitive antagonists of vit K and lower the plasma levels of functional clotting factors in a dose-dependent manner. In fact, they inhibit the enzyme vit K epoxidereductase (VKOR) and interfere with regeneration of the active hydroquinone form of vit K. which acts as a cofactor for the enzyme g-glutamyl carboxylase that carries out the final step of g carboxylating glutamate residues of prothrombin and factors VII, IX and X. Factor VII has the shoest plasma t 1/2 (6 hr), its level falls first when warfarin is given, followed by factor IX (t 1/2 24 hr), factor X (t 1/2 40 hr) and prothrombin (t 1/2 60 hr). Though the synthesis of clotting factors diminishes within 2-4 hours of warfarin administration, anticoagulant effect develops gradually over the next 1-3 days as the levels of the clotting factors already present in plasma decline progressively.

Cyclosporine acts by decreasing the production of:,IL-1,IL-2,IL-6,IL-8,"Cyclosporine -It profoundly and selectively inhibits T lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 and other cytokine production and response of inducer T cells to IL-l, without any effect on suppressor T-cells. Stimulation of T cell receptor produces a cascade of Ca2+ dependent events and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. The Ca2+ ions after binding to calmodulin activate a membrane-associated serine/ threonine phosphatase called calcineurin which dephosphorylates regulatory protein 'nuclear factor of activated T-cell' (NFAT), permitting its intranuclear migration and transcription of cytokine genes leading to the production of IL-2 along with other interleukins, GM-CSF, TNFa, interferon, etc. Cyclosporine enters target cells and binds to cyclophilin, an immunophilin class of protein. The complex then binds to and inactivates calcineurin response of the helper T cell to antigenic stimulation fails. Cyclosporine also enhances expression of an inhibitor of IL-2 which attenuates IL-2 stimulated T -cell proliferation and production of killer lymphocytes.

Trigeminal neuralgia is an archetype of orofacial neuralgias which follows the anatomical distribution of the fifth cranial nerve. It mainly affects the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve and almost always exhibits a trigger zone, stimulation of which initiates paroxysm of pain. The pain is often accompanied by a brief facial spasm or tic. Pain distribution is unilateral and lasts for a few seconds to few minutes. Physical examination eliminates alternative diagnoses. Signs of cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic abnormality exclude the diagnosis of idiopathic TN and suggest that pain may be secondary to a structural lesion.

"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) differs from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In this reference, the DIC is most likely characterized by-",Significant numbers of schistocytes,A brisk reticulocytosis,Decreased coagulation factor levels,Significant thrombocytopenia,"DIC is characterized by excessive activation of the coagulation system. That leads to formation of microthrombi throughout the microcirculation of the body, often in a quixotically even distribution.
As a consequence of the thrombotic diathesis, there is consumption of platelets, fibrin and coagulation factors and secondary activation of fibrinolytic mechanism.
Thus DIC can present with signs and symptoms relating to tissue hypoxia and infarction caused by the myriad microthrombi or as a hemorrhagic disorder related to depletion of elements required for homeostasis, hence the term consumption coagulopathy is used to describe D.I.C.
DIC can also lead to hemolytic anemia. It occurs due to fragmentation of red cells as they try to squeeze through the narrowed microvasculature. Schistocytes, the cells characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are quite common in patients with D.I.C (seen in 50%) of the cause.
Like D.I.C, T.T.P too is characterized by widespread thrombosis and similar to D.I.C, the disseminated thrombosis leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. But the point to emphasize is that in TT.P the thrombus is a platelet thrombus i.e. the thrombi is composed mainly of platelets aggregates so quite unlike D.I.C. the level of coagulation factors remain normal.

Robbins' States
""While D.I.C. and thrombotic microangiopathies share features such as microvascular occlusion and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, they are pathogenetically distinct. In T.T.P and HITS (unlike DIC), activation of the coagulation cascade is not of primary importance, and hence results of laboratory tests of coagulation such as PT and PTT are usually normal.""",C
Reason for hepatic involvement in oral contraceptives is ?,Estrogen,Progesterone,Estrogen +Progesterone,Mixed trace elements,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Estrogen Hepatotoxicity with oral contraceptive pills While early formulations of OCPs were associated with frequent serum enzyme elevations, current formulations and hormonal replacement therapy have not been linked to ALT or alkaline phosphatase elevations at rates any higher than occur with placebo. Estrogens in OCPs can cause mild inhibition of bilirubin excretion leading to jaundice in patients with inherited forms of bilirubin metabolism such as the Dubin Johnson syndrome. It can induce a clinically apparent cholestatic liver injury which typically arises during the first few cycles of therapy, and rarely after the six months. It has also been linked to hepatic tumors, both benign and malignant.",A
All of the following are true regarding adverse effects of chlorpropamide except: March 2010,Sensitizes the kidney to ADH action,Less incidence of hypoglycemia,More incidence of weight gain,Disulfiram like reaction may occur,"Ans. B: Less incidence of hypoglycemia Chlorpropamide is a long-acting sulphonylurea. It has more side effects than other sulphonylureas and its use is no longer recommended. Like other sulphonylureas, chlorpropamide acts to increase the secretion of insulin, so it is only effective in patients who have some pancreatic beta cell function. It can cause relatively long episodes of hypoglycemia; this is one reason why shoer-acting sulfonylureas such as gliclazide or tolbutamide are used instead. The risk of hypoglycemia makes this drug a poor choice for the elderly and patients with mild to moderate hepatic and renal impairment. Chlorpropamide and other sulphonylureas encourage weight gain, so they are generally not ored for use in very obese patients. Metformin is considered a better drug for these patients. Sulfonylureas should be avoided in patients with hepatic and renal impairment, patients with porphyria, patients who are breastfeeding, and patients with ketoacidosis. Not indicated for patients more than 65 years of age. It may cause facial flushing after the ingestion of alcohol. It may increase secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which can lead to hyponatremia.",B

A woman is taking oral contraceptives (OCs). Which of the following drugs is unlikely to reduce the effectiveness of the OCs,Ketoconazole,Phenytoin,Phenobarbital,Carbamazepine,"MICROSOMAL ENZYME INDUCTION Many drugs and carcinogens interact with DNA and increase the synthesis of microsomal enzyme protein, especially cytochrome P-450 and UGTs As a result rate of metabolism of inducing drug itself and/or other drugs is increased. Different inducers are relatively selective for ceain cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme families, e.g.: * Anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine), rifampin, glucocoicoids induce CYP3A isoenzymes. * Phenobarbitone also induces CYP2B1 and rifampin also induces CYP2D6. * Isoniazid and chronic alcohol consumption induce CYP2E1. * Polycyclic hydrocarbons like 3-methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene found in cigarette smoke, charcoalbroiled meat, omeprazole and industrial pollutants induce CYP1A isoenzymes. * Other impoant enzyme inducers are: phenylbutazone, griseofulvin, DDT. Consequences of microsomal enzyme induction 1. Decreased intensity and/or duration of action of drugs that are inactivated by metabolism, e.g. failure of contraception with oral contraceptives. 2. Increased intensity of action of drugs that are activated by metabolism. Acute paracetamol toxi-city is due to one of its metabolites--toxicity occurs at lower doses in patients receiving enzyme inducers. 3. Tolerance--if the drug induces its own metabolism (autoinduction), e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin. 4. Some endogenous substrates (steroids, bili rubin) are also metabolized faster. 5. Precipitation of acute intermittent porphyria: enzyme induction increases porphyrin synthesisby derepressing d-aminolevulenic acid synthetase. 6. Intermittent use of an inducer may interfere with adjustment of dose of another drug prescribed on regular basis, e.g. oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemics, antiepileptics, antihypeensives.

Bisphosphonates are used in all of the followingconditions except,Post menopausal osteoporosis,Steroid induced osteoporosis,Hypervitaminosis D,Malignancy associated Hypercalcemia,"Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate. They have a common structure, P-C-P, similar to the structure of the native pyrophosphate P-O-P found in bone hydroxyapatite. Mechanism of Action The bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone. (The bisphosphonates have a strong affinity for bone, targeting especially bone surfaces undergoing remodeling) When osteoclasts first attach to bone in the active resorptive sites, the bisphosphonates are released from that hone. The release of these compounds locally prevents fuher osteoclastic attachment to those resorptive surfaces. The bisphosphonates also may inhibit resorption by inducing apoptosis of osteoclasts and by inhibiting release of interleukins and other compounds involved in bone resorption. The net result of action of these compounds is inhibition of bone osteoclastic resorption. Uses They are used extensively in conditions characterized by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. including - Osteoporosis (postmenopausal osteoporosis, idiopathic and steroid induced osteoporosis) - Paget's disease, - Osteolytic bone metastasis, and - Hypercalcemia of malignancy Recent evidence suggests that second- and third-generation bisphosphonates also may be effective anticancer drugs. (May have some use in prostate cancer) Currently three bisphosphonates are available in India- Etidronate, Pamidronate and Alendronate. ** Other bisphosphonates, not yet available in India are Tiludronate, Risedronate, Zolendronate and lbandronate.",D

"Blockage along the course of the minor salivary duct which causes pooling of saliva behind the obstruction and localized swelling, is known as:",Ranula,Retention mucocele,Mucous extravasation mucocele,Sialolithiasis,"In the retention mucocele, there is a blockage along the course of the minor salivary duct which causes pooling of saliva behind the obstruction and localized swelling. This pooling of saliva causes a  pressure build-up and dilates the duct of the minor salivary gland. This dilated ductal epithelium forms a lining around the saliva and mimics a cyst-like lesion.
Ranula is the clinical term for a mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands. Two varieties of ranula exist: cystic (mucus retention cyst) and pseudocystic (mucus retention phenomenon or mucocele). In the cystic type, there is partial obstruction of the distal end of a sublingual gland duct that results in a small epithelial lined cyst usually less than 1 cm in diameter. However, the pseudocystic type, which is more common, forms as a result of extravasation of mucus into the fibrous connective tissue after a tear in a sublingual gland duct and, as in the case of a mucocele, arises as a result of the escape of mucus into the adjacent connective tissue. The clinical term 'plunging ranula' is used when extravasated mucus dissects through the mylohyoid muscle and along the fascial planes of the neck, producing a swelling evident in the floor of the mouth. 
Key concept:
Ranula is specifically for this mucocele occurring on the floor of the mouth after trauma to components of the sublingual glands.

On physical examination, there is an enlarged, nontender, supraclavicular lymph node and enlargement of the Waldeyer ring of oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue. There is no hepato- splenomegaly. CBC is normal except for findings of mild anemia. A lymph node biopsy specimen shows replacement by a monomorphous population of lymphoid cells that are twice the size of normal lymphocytes, with enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry of the node indicates that most lymphoid cells are CD19+, CD10+, CD3-, CD15-, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase negative (TdT-).

The elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) suggests primary hyperparathyroidism. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a parathyroid adenoma. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, most commonly resulting from renal failure, is excluded when the serum inorganic phosphate level is low because phosphate is retained with chronic renal failure. Hypervitaminosis D can cause hypercalcemia because of increased calcium absorption, but in these cases, the PTH levels are expected to be near the low end of the reference range because of feedback suppression. Serum PTH levels near the high end of the reference range indicate autonomous PTH secretion unregulated by hypercalcemia.

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant drug that acts by generating 6-MP. 6-MP inhibits the formation of ribosyl-5-phosphate and it also inhibits the conversion of IMP to adenine and guanine nucleotides. When given orally the drug is subjected to first pass metabolism by enzyme Xanthine Oxidase which conves it into an inactive metabolite.

True about metastatic calcification -,Serum ca level is normal,Occurs in dead/dying tissue,Occurs in damaged heart valves,Calcification starts in mitochondria,"Calcification

The deposition of mineral salts of calcium is a normal process in the formation of bone and cartilage. Calcium entry into dead or dying cells is usual, owing to the inability of such cells to maintain a steep calcium gradient.

Pathological calcification

Pathological calcification is the abnormal deposition of calcium salts in soft tissue.
It is of two types

A) Metastatic

Metastatic calcification reflects deranged calcium metabolism.
It’s a change associated with an increased calcium concentration in the serum.
In general, almost any disorder that increases the serum calcium level can lead to calcification in locations as the alveolar septa of the lung, renal tubules and blood vessels.
The fundamental abnormality is the pathological entry of the same amount of ionic calcium into the cell organelle, chiefly the mitochondria (it is suggested that mitochondria are the organelles first involved in the pathogenesis of metastatic calcification).

Sites of metastatic calcification

Basement membrane & tubular lamina of kidney
Alveolar wall of lungs (most common site)
The interstitial tissue of gastric mucosa
Systemic arteries
Pulmonary veins
Cornea & conjunctiva
Synovium of the joint
Tendons
These sites are prone to calcification because these tissues loose acid and therefore have the alkaline internal environment. Alkaline pH favours precipitation of calcium salts.

B) Dystrophic calcification

Dystrophic calcification refers to the macroscopic deposition of calcium salts in injured tissues. This type of calcification does not simply reflect an accumulation of calcium derived from the bodies of dead cells but rather represents an extracellular deposition of calcium from the circulation or interstitial fluid. 
Denatured proteins in dead or irreversibly damaged tissue preferentially bind phosphate ions. Phosphate t ions react with calcium ions to form a precipitate or calcium phosphate. Thus necrotic tissue serves as calcium sink.
In many locations such as in a case of tuberculous caseous necrosis in the lung or lymph nodes, calcification has no functional consequences.
Dystrophic calcification may also occur in crucial locations such as in mitral or aortic valves after rheumatic fever. In such instances, calcification leads to impeded blood flow because it produces inflexible valve leaflets and narrowed valve orifice (mitral and aortic stenosis).
Dystrophic calcification in atherosclerotic coronary artery contributes to narrowing of vessels.
Dystrophic calcification also plays a role in diagnostic radiography,

The serum level of creatine kinase is elevated. A biopsy of calf muscle reveals marked variation in size and shape of muscle fibers. There are foci of muscle fiber necrosis, myophagocytosis, regenerating fibers, and fibrosis. Molecular diagnostic assays performed on muscle biopsy from the patient would show alterations in the length of the primary transcript for which of the following muscle-associated proteins?",Creatine kinase,Desmin,Dystrophin,Glycogen phosphorylase,"Dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations of a large gene on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21). This gene codes for dystrophin, a protein localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma. Dystrophin links the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton to the exterior of the cell through a transmembrane complex of proteins and glycoproteins that binds to laminin. Dystrophin-deficient muscle fibers thus lack the normal interaction between the sarcolemma and the extracellular matrix. This disruption may be responsible for the observed increased osmotic fragility of dystrophic muscle, the excessive influx of calcium ions, and the release of soluble muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase into the serum. The other proteins are not altered in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.Diagnosis: Duchenne muscular dystrophy",C

Which of the following abnormalities has this women most likely developed?",Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic alkalosis,Mixed acidosis,Mixed alkalosis,"The laboratory results indicate that the aerial pH, aerial PCO2, and plasma HCO3- concentrations are all low. These changes clearly demonstrate metabolic acidosis, which occurs commonly when a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor is administered. The carbonic anhydrase enzyme attached to the brush border of the tubular epithelial cells normally catalyzes the dissociation of carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase prevents the removal of bicarbonate ions from the tubular fluid, which initially increases urine pH. The result is heavy spillage of bicarbonate in the urine, which is the hallmark of type 2 A (renal tubular acidosis). However, once the plasma levels of bicarbonate have decreased sufficiently, the bicarbonaturia ceases and the plasma HCO3- levels stabilize at a lower than normal level. Consequently, the urine pH falls typically to 4.5-5.0.",A

Normal transferrin is saturated with iron ?,20%,35%,50%,70%,"Ans. is `b' i.e., 35% o In normal individuals, transferrin is about one third saturated with iron, yielding serum iron levels that average 120 g/dl in men and 100 g/dl in women. Serum ferritin o Most of the ferritin is stored is different organs (liver, spleen, bone marrow). o Very small amounts of ferritin normally circulate in the plasma. Since plasma ferritin is derived largely form the storage pool of body iron, its level correlate well with body iron stores. i.e., when there is iron depletion, body store of iron is reduced that inturn leads to decrease in plasma ferritin. Transferrin saturation and iron binding capicity 3 Iron is transpoed in the plasma by transferrin. o Normally transferrin is 33% saturated (77% free) with iron, yield serum iron levels that average 100-120 g/dl. So, if serum transferrin will be 100% saturated the serum iron will be 300 g/dl. that means the total iron binding capacity of transferrin is 300 to 350 g/dl. o When iron store is depleted e.g., in iron dificiency anemia, there is increased synthesis of transferrin that results in increased total iron binding capacity. o When iron store is repleted e.g., anemia of chronic disease, there is decreased synthesis of transferrin that results in decreased total iron binding capacity. Serum transferrin receptors Erythroid precursors have receptors for transferrin by which they recieve iron from transferrin that is utilized for hemoglobin synthesis. o When erythroid precursors mature, these receptors are shed into plasma and can be masured as serum transferrin receptors concentration. o In iron deficiency state, there is increased erythropoisis in bone marrow --> T concentration of erythroid precursor that results in increased total number of transferrin receptor T serum transferrin receptor concentration.",B

"A 32 year old woman presents with complaints of several months of burning substernal chest pain exacerbated by large meals, cigarettes, and caffeine. Her symptoms are worse when she lies on her back, especially when sleeping at night. Antacids often improve her symptoms. This patient is at risk for which of the following conditions?",Cardiac ischemia,Columnar metaplasia of the distal oesophagus,Mallory-Weiss lesion in the esophagus,Squamous cell carcinoma,"This woman likely suffers from reflux esophagitis, a condition in which the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not adequately prevent acidic gastric contents from refluxing back into the distal esophagus. Most commonly, there is a defect in the LES mechanism itself, in addition to secondary causes such as pregnancy (due to increased abdominal pressure) and some medications (anticholinergics, beta-2 agonists, theophylline, nitrates, calcium-channel blockers). Symptoms can mimic cardiac chest pain and must be carefully evaluated. Complications of reflux esophagitis include esophageal strictures, ulcerations, laryngitis, pulmonary aspiration, and Barrett's esophagus (columnar metaplasia of the distal esophagus). Barrett's esophagus is considered a premalignant state, with roughly a 30-fold increase in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus transforms into columnar epithelium similar to gastric epithelium as a result of recurrent reflux of acidic gastric contents. Anginal pain, signaling cardiac ischemia, is generally not burning in nature, and is not relieved by antacids. Mallory-Weiss lesions are actual tears of the epithelia of the proximal stomach or distal esophagus as a result of retching (seen in anorexics and alcoholics). The incidence of pure squamous cell carcinoma is not increased by acid reflux disease. Ref: Wyatt C., Butterwoh IV J.F., Moos P.J., Mackey D.C., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 14.

Dose reduction is required in renal failure with all except:,Amphotericin B,Vancomycin,Doxycycline,Gentamicin,"Ans. C. DoxycyclineDose reduction is needed in case of following conditions:* Drug causing nephrotoxicity as adverse drug reaction* Drug excreted through renal routeAmphotericin B is most nephrotoxic among antifungals. Even liposomal preparations of amphotericin B (c-AMB, LAMB, ABCD, ABLC) are nephrotoxic, though less as compared to conventional Amphotericin B.More than 90% of vancomycin is excreted through glomerular filtration.In case of renal failure, there may be less excretion which leads to toxicity of Vancomycin due to its striking accumulation in body (ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity, red man syndrome). Half-life of vancomycin can increase to 6-10 days in case of anephric patients.Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside. Aminoglycosides are most potent to cause both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Aminoglycosides are excreted almost entirely by glomerular filtration. High concentration of aminoglycosides is found in otic fluid and by virtue of the process of elimination: high concentration is found in urinary tract.Dose modification required in renal failure.* Cockcroft-Gault equationCCr =72xSCr (140-Age)xWeight(kg) CCr = creatinine clearance (expressed in mL/min); SCr = serum creatinine (expressed in mg/dL)Among tetracyclines, minocycline and doxycycline are safe in renal impairment cases.

The mechanism of action of cephalosporin is:,Interferes with cell wall synthesis,Inhibition ol DNA gyrase,Inhibition of protein synthesis,Inhibition of DMA polymerase,"Ans: A (Interferes with cell wall synthesis) Ref: Goodman & Gilmans The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12th ed, 2011. Pg 1479, 1493: Basic and Clinical Pharmacology by Katzung, 2012, 12th ed, Pg 792Explanation:Cephalosporin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis.Its mechanism of action is similar to penicillin as both are beta lactams.Bacterial ceil wall plays a major role in the growth and development of bacteria.Peptidoglycan. a component of bacterial cell wall owing to its cross-linked structure offers strength to the cell wall.Peptidoglycan is composed of N-acetyl- glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid with cross-linking.A five amino acid peptide known as pentapeptide is linked to N-acetylmuramic acid and this peptide terminates as D-alanyl-D- alanine.Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) removes terminal alanine from D-alanyl -D-alanine and forms cross link with the adjacent peptide, thus enhancing cell wall rigidity.Beta lactam antibiotics are structurally similar to D-alanyl -D-alanine, and hence covalently bind to PBP, resulting in inhibition of transpeptidation reaction w hich is essential for the removal of D-alanine from D-alanyl-D- alanine.As peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited by cephalosporins as any other beta lactams, the bacterial cell dies. However cell death is maximum when the cells are actively growing and synthesizing cell wall.",A

Streptococcus pyogenes have not shown resistance to:,Penicillin,Erythromycin,Tetracycline,Cotrimoxazole,"Ans: a (Penicillin) Ref:KDT, 6th ed, p. 696Streptococci (except viridians, group D or enterococci) are highly sensitive to penicillin.Enterococci are usually treated with penicillin/ampicillin + gentamicin combination.Patients allergic or resistant to penicillin should be treated with vancomycin + gentamicin.Penicillins:They are a lactam antibiotics which interfere with synthesis of bacterial cell wall. They inhibit the transpeptidases so that cross linking in the bacterial cell wall does not take place.The transpeptidases and the related proteins constitute the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).Resistance to penicillins and other b-lactams is due to one of four general mechanisms:1) Inactivation of antibiotic by b-lactamase2) Modification of target PBPs3) Impaired penetration of drug to target PBPs4) Efflux.* b-Lactamase production is the most common mechanism of resistance.* Altered target PBPs (penicillin binding proteins) are the basis of methicillin resistance in staphylococci and of penicillin resistance in pneumococci and enterococci.* Resistance due to impaired penetration of antibiotic to target PBPs occurs only in gram-negative species because of their impermeable outer cell wall membrane, which is absent in gram-positive bacteria.Classification1.

Genetic polymorphism include -a)  SNPb)  Microsatellitesc)  Mutationsd)  Translocation e) Mini satellites,abe,bcd,cde,acd,"Genetic polymorphism 

The occurrence of different DNA sequence in at least 1% of population, i.e. presence of more than one genetically distinct types in single population of a species.
In very simple words, genetic polymorphism causes diversity between individuals, e.g. genetic polymorphism might give rise to blue eyes versus brown eyes, or straight hair versus curly hair.
It should be noted that in genetic polymorphism there is variability in DNA sequence; However, the individuals are normal (not diseased); and this differentiate genetic polymorphism from mutation. The, term ""mutation"", as opposed to ""polymorphism"", is generally used to refer to changes in DNA sequence which have been associated with disease (or a risk of disease) and are not present in most individuals of a species (present in less than 0.5-1% of individuals, in contrast to genetic polymorphism).
Two types of genetic polymorphisms are there:


Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) → as the name suggest there is variation in a single nucleotide in every stretch of approximately 1000 base pairs.
Repeat-length Polymorphism → In contrast to SNPs there are short repetitive sequences of variation:


Microsatellites → Repeat size of 2-6 base pairs and less than 1 kilobase.
Minisatellites → 15 to 70 base pairs and 1-3 kilobase.


Most common type of polymorphism is single nucleotide polymorphis (SNP).
These types of base substitutions are frequently encountered during genetic testing and should be differentiated from true mutation that alter protein expression.
The best example of genetic polymorphism is blood groups.",A

True about Pralidoxime ?,It acts by regenerating acetylcholinesterase enzyme,It can be used for all chlorinated compounds,It is not used for war gases,Plasma cholinesterase levels signifies better reflection of enzyme activity than RBC levels,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., It acts by regenerating acetylcholinesterase enzyme Pralidoxime (and other oximes) acts by reactivating cholinesterase enzyme. Oximes are used for poisoning with organophosphate insectide not for chlorinated insectisides (chlorinate hydrocarbons e.g. DDT, lindane, dieldrin). Some of the war gases are organophosphate compounds e.g. dialkylfuorophosphate, for which oximes can be used. RBC cholinesterase levels reflect enzyme activity better than plasma cholinesterase because: i) Plasma cholinesterase can give falsly high activity if there is RBC hemolysis (RBC cholinesterase comes into plasma) ii) In chornic organophosphate exposure, plasma cholinesterase may return to normal but RBC levels remains depressed.",A

A 50-year-old chronic alcoholic presents to the emergency room with 12 hours of severe abdominal pain. The pain radiates to the back and is associated with an urge to vomit. Physical examination discloses exquisite abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies show elevated serum amylase. Which of the following morphologic changes would be expected in the peripancreatic tissue of this patient?,Coagulative necrosis,Caseous necrosis,Fat necrosis,Fibrinoid necrosis,"Fat necrosis. Saponification of fat derived from peripancreatic fat cells exposed to pancreatic enzymes is a typical feature of fat necrosis. Lipase, released from pancreatic acinar cells during an attack of acute pancreatitis, hydrolyzes fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Free fatty acids bind with calcium to form soaps, which is a process known as saponification. Entry of calcium ions into the injured tissue reduces the level of calcium in blood. Hypocalcemia is, therefore, a typical finding in patients who had a recent bout of acute pancreatitis. Patients with acute pancreatitis experience sudden-onset abdominal pain, distention, and vomiting. The other choices are not typically seen in peripancreatic tissue following acute pancreatitis, although liquefactive necrosis (choice E) may be observed.Diagnosis: Acute pancreatitis",C

Ivabradine is indicated in the management of,Congestive hea failure,Cardiomyopathy,Angina pectoris,Irritable bowel syndrome,"Ivabradine This 'pure' hea rate lowering antianginal drug has been introduced recently. mech of action:- The only significant action of ivabradine is blockade of cardiac pacemaker (sino-atrial) cell 'f' channels, which are 'funny' cation channels that open during early pa of slow diastolic (phase 4) depolarization. The resulting inward current (If) determines the slope of phase 4 depolarization. Selective blockade of If current by ivabradine results in hea rate reduction without any other electrophysiological or negative inotropic or negative lucitropic (slowing of myocardial relaxation) effect. Hea rate reduction decreases cardiac O2 demand and prolongation of diastole tends to improve myocardial perfusion (O2 supply). Accordingly, in clinical trials, ivabradine has been found to improve exercise tolerance in stable angina and reduce angina frequency. Indications:- Used in chronic stable angina in patients with sinus rhythm. Ref:- kd tripathi;pg num:-554",C

The 51 patients represented every new case of acute leukemia subjected to cytochemical stains and flow cytometry between July 1987 and February 1989. By cell-surface marker analysis, 29 exhibited lymphocytic lineage, while 21 were myelocytic. One was mixed lineage. The PAS positivity, defined by the presence of blocks or coarse granules in 5% or more of the blasts, was found in 15 of 29 lymphoblastic leukemias and in four of the myeloblastic leukemias. However, PAS-positive lymphoblastic leukemias were negative with the other cytochemical stains: myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, and alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase. The PAS-positive myeloblastic leukemias were positive with at least one other stain. Three cases of myeloblastic leukemia exhibited greater than 10% PAS-positive blasts, with all three being acute monoblastic leukemia. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the PAS stain alone for lymphoblastic leukemia was 52% (15 true positives of 29) and 81% (four false positives), respectively.",B

Hypersensitivity angiitis 

Hypersensitivity vasculitis or hypersensitivity angiitis or leukocytoclastic angiitis is a small vessel vasculitis due to hypersensitivity reaction.
It is usually to a known drug, e.g. cefoperazone, autoantigens or infectious agents.
Immune complexes lodge in the vessel wall, attracting polymorphonuclear leukocytes who in turn release tissue-degrading substances leading to an inflammatory process.
Hypersensitivity angiitis usually presents with skin manifestation, e.g. palpable purpura, but sometimes nerves, kidneys, joints and heart may also be involved.

Diagnostic criteria

At least 3 out of the 5 criteria are required


Age > 16
Use of possible triggering drug in relation to symptoms.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis depends upon finding these noncaseating granulomas in commonly affected sites. In 90% of cases, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (""potato nodes"") or lung involvement is present and can be revealed by chest x-ray or transbronchial biopsy. The eye and skin are the next most commonly affected organs, so that both conjunctival and skin biopsies are clinical possibilities. Noncaseating granulomas may be found in multiple infectious diseases, such as fungal infections, but sarcoidosis is not caused by any known organism. Therefore, before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis can be made, cultures must be taken from affected tissues, and there must be no growth of any organism that may produce granulomas. In patients with sarcoidosis, blood levels of angiotensin-conveing enzyme are increased, and this may also be used as a clinical test.

Which virus is implicated in Burkitts lymphoma?,HTLV,HPV,EBV,HHV8,"Explanation: BURKITT LYMPHOMA There are three clinical types:
1. African (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
2. Sporadic (nonendemic) Burkitt lymphoma.
3. Aggressive lymphomas associated with HIV.
These 3 types are histologically identical. Morphology The tumor exhibits a high mitotic index and contains numerous apoptotic cells,
the nuclear remnants of which are phagocytosed by interspersed benign macrophages.
These phagocytes have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic “starry sky” pattern. Immunophenotype These are tumors of mature B cells.
It express surface IgM, CD 19, CD20, CD 10 and BCL6. a phenotype consistent with a germinal center B-cell origin.
Unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, this does not express anti-apoptotic protein BCL2.
Molecular Pathogenesis All forms of Burkin lymphoma are associated with translocations of the c-MYC gene on chromosome 8.
The translocation partner is usually the IgH locus  light-chain loci.
All endemic tumors are latently infected with EBV. which is also present in about 25% of HIVassociated tumors and 15% to 20% of sporadic cases.
Clinical Features Endemic Burkitt lymphoma often presents as a mass involving the mandible and shows an unusual predilection for involvement of abdominal viscera,
particularly the kidneys, ovaries and adrenal glands. Sporadic Burkitt lymphoma most often appears as a mass involving the ileocecum and peritoneum.

All of the following is true except aEUR',NADPH oxidase acts superoxide ions,Chediak-Higashi syndrome is due to defective phagolysosome,In Brutons agammaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected,Myeloperodixase action is mainly due to OCIaEUR',"In Brutons aganunaglobulinemia opsonisation is not affected [Ref : Harrison 171h/e p. 381; Bobbin's 7""Ve p. 60, 61, 62, 210, 591 During phagocytosis there is rapid respiratory burst which is brought about by rapid burst in the activity of NADPH oxidase. Increased NADPH oxidase activity leads to increased oxidative proesses and there by increased production of superoxide anion (02-) Superoxide is then conveed to hydrogen peroxide (1-1,02) free radical. The 11,0, generated by NADPH oxidase system is not able to kill the bacteria itself However, the azurophilic , granules of the neutrophils contain the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) which in presence of halide such as Cl? conves H202 to hypochlorite (HOCI). Hypochloth'e (HOCI) is a potent antimicrobicidal agent that destroys microbes by halogenation. The H20,- MPO - halide system is the most efficient bactericidal system in neutrophils. Chediak higashi syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder. Chediak higashi syndrome is caused due to mutation in the LYST gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protien known as lysosomal trafficking regulator. This protein plays a role in transpo of materials into lysosomes. Lysosomes contain several enzyme. They use these enzymes to kill various microorganism, break down several toxins. During phagocytosis, lysosomes fuse with phagosome, forming phagolysosome. Once the phagolysosomes are formed, lysosomes secrete enzymes to kill the bacterial. Mutation in the LSYT protein disrupts the size, structure and function of lysosomes. Lysosomes cannot fuse with phagosome to form phagolysosome. Thus this syndrome is a disease with impaired bacteriolysis due to impaired phagolysosome formation. As a result, most people with chediak higashi syndrome have repeated and persistent infections, staing in infancy or early childhood. These infections are life threatening. Besides, the granules of lysosomes, the secretory / storage granules of various other cells are also affected. The other cells involved are ? - Melanosotnes of melanocytes - Dense bodies of platelets - Granules of schwann cells In pigment cells called melanocytes the melanosome become abnormally large so there is reduced production of melanin. Thus people with chediak Higashi syndrome have occulocutaneous albinism i.e the colour (-)f skin, hair and eye is reduced. Abnormality in platelets produce bleeding disorders. Defective granules in schwann cells lead to neurological symptoms e.g. peripheral neuropathy. More on chediak higashi syndrome Most children with chediak Higashi syndrome ultimately reach a stage of the disorder known as accelarated phase (lymphoma like stage). This severe phase of the disease is thought to be triggered by viral infection (E.B.virus). In the accelarated phase, defective white blood cells divide uncontrollably and invade many of the body's organs. The accelarated phase is associated with fever, episodes of abnormal bleeding, overwhelming infections and organ failure. They are usually life threatening and lead to death. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is an X-linked disease that occurs mainly in males. It is caused due to defect in the gene Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Bruton's tyrosine kinase plays a crucial role in B cell maturation as well as mast cell activation. Defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase leads to failure of maturation of B cells. B cells cannot mature beyond pro B cell stage. In the absence of mature B cell, patient lacks lymphoid tissue and fails to develop plasma cells, (the cells that produce antibodies). Thus there is absence of immunoglobulins of all classes in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia. Germinal centres, where B cells proliferate and differentiate are poorly developed, in all lymphoid tissues including the .spleen, tonsils, adenoids, peripheral lymph nodes. Peyer patches in the intestine are small or absent. Clinical features Patients with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia do not manifest any symptoms till 6 months of life (due to the presence-of maternal antibodies). These patients are susceptible to infections with capsulated bacterias because antibody response is vital to kill encapsulated bacterias. Antibodies help in opsonization of encapsulated bacterias such as staphylococcus aureus, 11 ifluenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae. The polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the encapsulated bacteria is a potent virulent agent. It protects the bacteria from phagocytosis. These bacterias can only be phagocytosed when they are opsonised (coated) with specific proteins (opsoni us). Opsonized (coated) bacterias become attractive targets for phagocytes because phagocytes express high affinity receptors for opsonins. The major opsonins present in the body are IgG antibody and C3b complement. In Bruton's agammaglobulinemia antibodies are absent therefore opsonisation is defective.",C

Which of the following drugs can prolong survival in patients with CHF?,Furosemide,Inarnrinone,Losartan,Digoxin,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) continues to be a lethal end stage of cardiovascular diseases caused by hypertension, coronary heart disease, valve deformity, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Current therapy for CHF can maintain function, improve quality of life, and prolong survival. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), and digoxin remain in standards of therapy. Diuretics remains an important component of the symptomatic management of patients with CHF, but severely II patients may require additional agents. One option frequently used in patients who exhibit resistance to loop diuretics is an infusion of low-dose dopamine. Combination diuretics may effectively increase urine output, with the addition of thiazide or spironolactone. Documentation of the clinical benefit of ACE inhibitors represents the most important advance in therapeutics for CHF in the last decade. ACE inhibitors improve left the ventricular function, and survival and unless contraindicated, patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction should receive high dose ACE inhibitor with a diuretic if there is peripheral edema. For patients who cannot take an ACE inhibitor the combination of hydralazine and nitrates may offer some prognostic benefit. Digoxin has been the traditional first drug of choice for CHF, but with protracted controversy about its efficacy and safety.",C

After absorption into the systemic circulation, the prodrug diffuses into the parietal cells of the stomach and accumulates in the acid secretory cancliculi. Here, it is activated by the proton catalyzed formation of a tetracyclic sulfenamide, trapping the drug so that it cannot diffuse back across the canalicular membrane. The activated form then binds covalently with the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines in the H+K+ -ATPase, irreversibly inactivating the pump molecule. Acid secretion resumes only after new pump molecules are synthesized and inserted into the luminal membrane, providing a prolonged (up to 24 to 48 hour) suppression of acid secretion, despite the much shorter plasma half-lives (0.5-2 hour) of the parent compounds. Because they block the final step in acid production, the PPIs are effective in acid suppression regardless of other stimulating factors.""- Goodman and Gilman 12/e p1311.Proton Pump InhibitorsMost potent antisecretory agents, substituted benzimidazoles, also known as the proton pump inhibitorsQ.Covalently bind to the catalytic subunit of the proton pump and negate all types of acid secretionQPPIs provide more complete inhibition of acid secretion than the H2-receptor antagonistsQ.Inhibition of acid secretion is also more prolonged because of the irreversible inhibition of the enzyme caused by the covalent bond to the proton pumpQ.PPIs are more effective during the day, generally prescribed before breakfastQ.PPIs require an acidic environmentQ within the gastric lumen in order to become activated and bind to the proton pump at the secretary canaliculus.Utilization of antacids or H2-receptor antagonists in combination with PPIs could have deleterious effects by promoting an alkaline environment and thereby preventing activation of the PPIQ.Consequently, antacids and H2-receptor antagonists should not be used in combination with PPIsQ.",C

"Glucocoicoids causes all, except :",Muscle wasting,Osteoporosis,Diabetes mellitus,Reduced appetite,"Glucocoicoid excess leads to bone dissolution by decreasing bone formation and increasing bone resorption. This leads to osteoporosis, a loss of bone mass that leads eventually to collapse of veebral bodies and other fractures.Glucocoicoids in excess accelerate the basic electroencephalographic rhythms and produce mental aberrations ranging from increased appetite, insomnia, and euphoria to frank toxic psychoses. Many of the amino acids liberated from catabolized proteins are conveed into glucose in the liver and the resultant hyperglycemia and decreased peripheral utilization of glucose may be sufficient to precipitate insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus, especially in patients genetically predisposed to diabetes. Patients with excess Glucocoicoids are protein-depleted as a result of excess protein catabolism. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are therefore thin and the muscles are poorly developed.

DNA content is more than normal cells. Examples of tissues Myocardium, skeletal muscles, Breast, endometium, liver, kidney. Why do some tissues undergo hyperophy, while others undergo hyperplasia ? o The cells that have limited capacity of proliferation (e.g., myocardial cells & skeletal muscle cells) can not increase their number, So they are not able to undergo hyperplasia. But these cells can increase in size in response to increased demand, So they can undergo hyperophy. o The cells capable of division (hepatocytes, renal tubular epithelial cells, smooth muscles of uterus) have both the propeies, i.e., to increase the number as well as the size. So, tissues containing these cells can undergo hyperophy or hyperplasia or both. o For example, both hyperplasia and hyperophy occur in endometrium of pregnant uterus.",B

Which of the following drug causes does not causes thrombocytopenia: March 2009,Methotrexate,Aspirin,Ticlopidine,Heparin,"Ans. B: Aspirin Thrombocytopenia-inducing medications include Direct myelosu ppressi on - Valproic acid Methotrexate - Carboplatin - Interferon Isotretinoin - H2 blockers and Proton-pump inhibitors have shown increased Thrombocytopenia symptoms, such as red dots near the bottom of the legs. -- Ticlopidine Immunological platelet destruction - Datg binds Fab poion of an antibody. The classic example of this mechanism is the quinidine group of drugs. The Fc poion of the antibody molecule is not involved in the binding process. - Drug binds to Fc, and drug-antibody complex binds and activates platelets. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the classic example of this phenomenon. In HIT, the heparin-antibody-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complex binds to Fc receptors on the surface of the platelet. Since Fc poion of the antibody is bound to the platelets, they are not available to the Fc receptors of the reticulo-endothelial cells, so therefore this system cannot destroy platelets as usual. This may explain why severe thrombocytopenia is not a common feature of HIT. -- Abciximab induced thrombocytopenia. Aspirin inhibits the release of ADP from platelets and their sticking to each other. However, it has no effect on platelet survival time and their adhesion to the damaged vessel wall.",B

Response to iron in iron deficiency anemia is denoted by?,Restoration of enzymes,Reticulocytosis,Increase in iron binding capacity,Increase in hemoglobin,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reticulocytosis Response to iron therapy When specific iron therapy is given, patients often show rapid subjective improvement, with disappearance or marked diminution of fatigue, lassitude, and other non-specific symptoms. This response may occur before any improvment in anemia is observed. The earliest hematological evidence of recovery is increase reticulocytes and their hemoglobin content. The reticulocytes attain a maximal value on the 5th to 10th day after institution of therapy and thereafter gradually return to nonnal. The reticulocyte response may not be detectable in mild iron deficiency anemia. The blood hemoglobin level is the most accurate measure of the degree of anemia in iron deficiency anemia. During the response to therapy, the red cell count may increase temporarily to values above normal, but the hemoglobin value lags behind. The red cell indices may remain abnormal for some time after the normal hemoglobin level is restored. As recovery occurs, a normocytic cell population gradually replaces the microcytic population; and one of the early signs of response to therapy is an increase in RBW from pretreatment level. When treatment is fully effective, hemoglobin reaches normal levels by 2 months after therapy is initiated, regardless of staing values. Of the epithelial lesions in iron deficiency, those affecting the tongue and nails are the most responsive to treatment.",B

Caspases are associated with -,Organogenesis,Hydropic degeneration,Collagen hyalinization,None.,"Organogenesis Apoptosis is a programmed cell death. This programmed death is critical, for the elimination of unwanted or damaged cells from multicellular organism. Apoptosis is responsible for the physiological deletion of cells during the embryonic development and serves as a balance to mitosis in regulating the size of animal tissues. - Apoposis is a common process seen during embryogenesis in all steps such as: Implantation - Organogenesis - Development - Involvement - Metamorphosis The separation of digits during the limb development is a classic example of effect of apoptosis in embryology. The regression of duct system in the course of sexual development of fetus is attributed to this mechanism. Neural tube shows discrete area of programmed cell death at several stages during development. During the development of central nervous system active remodeling occurs during synapse formation. Large number of neurons are produced and some die. Apoptosis plays a role in preserving most effective neurons. In early life apoptosis helps to get rid of inappropriate clones of lymphocytes. Even death of B & T lymphocytes and deletion of autoreactive T cells in thymus is a result of apoptotic mediation. Caspases are crucial mediators of apoptosis - Caspases are required for both the triggering as well as the execution phase of apoptosis. - They are effectors of apoptotic machinery.",A

Which protease inhibitor has boosting effect?,Amprenavir,Tenovir,Nelfinavir,Ritonavir,"Retroviral protease Inhibitors (Pis): An aspaic protease enzyme encoded by HIV is involved in the production of structural proteins and enzymes (including reverse transcriptase) of the virus. The large viral polyprotein is broken into various functional components by this enzyme. This protease acts at a late step in HIV replication, i.e. maturation of the new virus paicles when the RNA genome acquires the core proteins and enzymes. In case of different Pis, 6-18 tablets are to be taken daily, some on empty stomach, but others with meals; and this has to go on for months and years. Patient acceptability and compliance are often low. One of the strategies adopted to reduce the dose of IDV, LPV and SQV is to combine them with a lowand subtherapeutic dose (100 mg) of ritonavir.

All of the following are inhibitors of cell cycle except-,P21,P 27,pl61 NKa4,CDK2,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase family of Ser/Thr protein kinases. This protein kinase is highly similar to the gene products of S. cerevisiae cdc28, and S. pombe cdc2, also known as Cdk1 in humans. It is a catalytic subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex, whose activity is restricted to the G1-S phase of the cell cycle, and is essential for the G1/S transition. This protein associates with and is regulated by the regulatory subunits of the complex including cyclin E or A. Cyclin E binds G1 phase Cdk2, which is required for the transition from G1 to S phase while binding with Cyclin A is required to progress through the S phase. Its activity is also regulated by phosphorylation. Two alternatively spliced variants and multiple transcription initiation sites of this gene have been repoed.

CEA is elevated in all of the following except: March 2007,Alcoholic cirrhosis,Ulcerative colitis,Carcinoma colon,Prostatic carcinoma,"Ans. D: Prostatic carcinoma An elevated level of a tumor marker can indicate cancer; however, there can also be other causes of the elevation. Tumor markers can be produced directly by the tumor or by non-tumor cells as a response to the presence of a tumor. As used in oncology, they are as follows: - Screening for common cancers on a population basis Example: elevated prostate specific antigen suggests prostate cancer. - Monitoring of cancer survivors after treatment Example: elevated AFP in a child previously treated for teratoma suggests relapse with endodermal sinus tumor. - Diagnosis of specific tumor types, paicularly in ceain brain tumors and other instances where biopsy is not feasible. Tumor markers can be classified in two groups: Cancer-specific markers and tissue-specific markers. - Cancer-specific markers: An example of a cancer-specific marker, CEA, or carcinoembryonic antigen, is a blood-borne protein, first noted to be produced by tumors of the gastrointestinal system. Fuher investigation showed that it was produced by the occasional lung and breast cancer case, meaning that an elevated level does not mean a bowel cancer. However, in a patient with a history of a treated bowel cancer, a rising CEA level can be an early sign of bowel cancer return. A sequence of steady low CEA readings can provide much needed reassurance to the post-operative patient. Also, a rising sequence of CEA readings should ale the physician to the need for diagnostic tests such as PET scans. - Tissue-specific markers: Tissue-specific markers are related to specific tissues which have developed cancer. Generally speaking, these substances are not specifically related to the tumor, and may be present at elevated levels when no cancer is present. Examples include PSA, beta-HCG - (Human chorionic gonadotropin), AFP - (Alpha-fetoprotein), AFP-L3 - (a lectin-reactive AFP) and Thyroglobulin. For example, if man has an elevated PSA, a search for prostate cancer will be undeaken. If an individual has an elevated level of beta-HCG, AFP or AFP-L3%, a search for a testicular or liver cancer, respectively, will be made. PSA (Prostate specific antigen) is produced by the normal prostate. It is a protein enzyme called a serine protease that usually acts as an anticoagulant to keep semen liquid. Only small amounts leak into the circulation in normal circumstances. Enlarged prostates leak more substantial amounts, and cancerous prostates also leak substantial amounts. o Beta-hCG: Elevated levels cannot prove the presence of a tumor, and low levels do not rule it out (an exception is in males who do not naturally produce beta-hCG). Neveheless, elevated beta-hCG levels fall after successful treatment (e.g. surgical intervention or chemotherapy) and a recurrence can often be detected by the finding of rising levels.",D
"In an experiment, cell samples are collected from the bone marrow aspirates of patients who were diagnosed with lymphoproliferative disorders. Cytogenetic analyses are performed on these cells, and a subset of the cases is found to have the BCR-ABL fusion gene from the reciprocal translocation t (9;22) (q34;11). The presence of this gene results in increased tyrosine kinase activity. Patients with which of the following conditions are most likely to have this gene?",Acute promyelocytic leukemia,Chronic myelogenous leukemia,Follicular lymphoma,"Hodgkin lymphoma, lymphocyte depletion type","This is the Philadelphia chromosome, or Ph1, which is characteristic of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). This karyotypic abnormality can be found using cytogenetic techniques, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In the few cases that appear negative by karyotyping and by FISH, molecular analysis shows BCR-ABL rearrangements, and the tyrosine kinase activated via this fusion gene is the target of current therapy for CML. This rearrangement is considered a diagnostic criterion for CML. CML is a disease of pluripotent stem cells that affects all lineages, but the granulocytic precursors expand preferentially in the chronic phase. Acute promyelocytic leukemias often have the t (15;17) abnormality. Follicular lymphomas have a t (14;18) karyotypic abnormality involving the BCL2 gene.

"A 10-year-old boy apparently normal at bih had delayed walking and had difficulty in walking. As years passed, weakness increased and now is wheelchair bound. What is your diagnosis",Congenital muscular dystrophy,Becker muscular dystrophy,Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy,"Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are normal at bih. Very early motor milestones are met, but walking is often delayed. The first indications of muscle weakness are clumsiness and inability to keep up with peers. Weakness begins in the pelvic girdle muscles and then extends to the shoulder girdle. Enlargement of the muscles of the lower leg associated with weakness, termed pseudohyperophy, is often present. The mean age of wheelchair dependence is around 9.5 years.Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are caused by loss-of-function mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is typically associated with deletions or frameshift mutations that result in the total absence of dystrophin. In contrast, the mutations in Becker muscular dystrophy typically permit the synthesis of a truncated version of dystrophin, which presumably retains some function. Hence is less severe.Robbins pathology 9e pg: 1242",C

Restrictive Cardiomyopathies (RCMs) - Harrison 17th/1485-86

The hallmark ofthe restrictive cardiomyopathies (RCMs) is abnormal diastolic function ; the ventricular wails are excessively rigid and impede ventricular filling. In late stages systolic function is also impaired.
Myocardial fibrosis- livpertropby. or infiltration due to a variety of causes is responsible. Myocardial involvement with amyloid1 is a common cause of secondary restrictive cardiomyopathy although restriction is also seen in the transplanted heart, in hemochromatosis, glycogen depositiong, endomyocardial fibrosis, sarcoidosis , hypereosinopbillc disease., and scleroderma; following mediastinal irradiation; and in neoplastic infiltration and myocardial fibrosis of diverse causes.
In many of these conditions, particularly those with substantial concomitant endocardial involvement, partial obliteration of the ventricular cavity by fibrous tissue and thrombus contributes to the abnormally increased resistance to ventricular filling.
Thromboembolic complications are frequent in such patients
The inability"" of the ventricles to fill limits cardiac output and raises filling pressures; thus, exercise intolerance and dyspnea are usually prominent. As a result of persistently elevated systemic venous pressure, these patients commonly have dependent edema, ascites, and an enlarged, tender, and often pulsatile liver .

The tumor cells of CLL are small B lymphocytes.
Leukemic cells have the morphological appearance of normal small to medium sized lymphocytes with clumped chromatin, inconspicuous nuclei and a small ring of cytoplasm.
The lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by these tumor cells.
These cells are mixed with variable numbers of larger cells called prolymphocytes.
In many cases, prolymphyocytes gather together focally to form as proliferation centers, so called because they contain relatively large number of mitotic activity.

She now notices that her arm becomes swollen by the end of the day. What is the appropriate name for this fluid accumulation?,Chylothorax,Hydrothorax,Lymphedema,Purulent exudate,"Obstruction of lymphatic flow may occur in a number of clinical settings, but is most common because of surgical removal of lymph nodes or tumor obstruction. For example, the lymphatic system may be obstructed after axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. Prolonged lymphatic obstruction in the patient's shoulder causes edema, progressive dilation of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiectasia), and overgrowth of fibrous tissue. Lymphangiosarcoma has also been described. Chylothorax (choice A) represents an accumulation of lymphedema in the pleural space.

Which of the following is positive in Follicular lymphoma?,Bcl 2,Bcl 6,Bcl 1,Bcl 10,"Follicular lymphoma likely arises from germinal center B cells and is strongly associated with chromosomal translocations involving BCL2. Its hallmark is a (14;18) translocation that juxtaposes the IGH locus on chromosome 14 and the BCL2 locus on chromosome 18. The t(14;18) is seen in up to 90% of follicular lymphomas, and leads to overexpression of BCL2. BCL2 antagonizes apoptosis and promotes the survival of follicular lymphoma cells. Notably, while normal germinal centers contain numerous B cells undergoing apoptosis, follicular lymphoma is characteristically devoid of apoptotic cells. BCL 10 : associated with extra nodal marginal zone lymphoma The t(14;18)(q32;q21) and t(1;14) (p22;q32) translocations cause increased expression of intact MALT1 and BCL-10 protein respectively. This translocation is associated with gastric MALToma. Each of the three translocations has the same net effect, the constitutive activation of NF-kB, a transcription factor that promotes B-cell growth and survival. Antigen dependent activation of NF-kB in normal B and T cells. requires both BCL-10 and MLT, which work together in a pathway downstream of the B- and T-cell antigen receptors. Thus, H. pylori-induced inflammation may trigger NF-kB activation through the MLT/BCL-10 pathway in MALTomas that lack these translocations. Removal of this stimulus may explain why these tumors tend to respond to H. pylori eradication. In contrast, NF-kB is constitutively active in tumors bearing translocations involving MLT or BCL10, and H. pylori treatment is ineffective. BCL 6 : associated with diffuse large b cell lymphoma(DLBCL). DLBCL is most common subtype of non Hodgkin lymphoma globally. BCL 1 : also called cyclin D1 and is associated with Mantle Cell Lymphoma",A

Antibody against tumor cells-,MHC-I,MHC-II,Anti viral,Differentiated antigen,"MHC class I molecules are one of two primary classes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (the other being MHC class II) and are found on the cell surface of all nucleated cells in the bodies of jawed veebrates. They also occur on platelets, but not on red blood cells. Their function is to display peptide fragments of non-self proteins from within the cell to cytotoxic T cells; this will trigger an immediate response from the immune system against a paicular non-self antigen displayed with the help of an MHC class I protein. Because MHC class I molecules present peptides derived from cytosolic proteins, the pathway of MHC class I presentation is often called cytosolic or endogenous pathway. In humans, the HLAs corresponding to MHC class I are HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. Function Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I:peptide complex is then inseed endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular pas of the class I MHC molecule. Thus, the function of the class I MHC is to display intracellular proteins to cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). However, class I MHC can also present peptides generated from exogenous proteins, in a process known as cross-presentation. A normal cell will display peptides from normal cellular protein turnover on its class I MHC, and CTLs will not be activated in response to them due to central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms. When a cell expresses foreign proteins, such as after viral infection, a fraction of the class I MHC will display these peptides on the cell surface. Consequently, CTLs specific for the MHC:peptide complex will recognize and kill presenting cells. Alternatively, class I MHC itself can serve as an inhibitory ligand for natural killer cells (NKs). Reduction in the normal levels of surface class I MHC, a mechanism employed by some viruses and ceain tumors to evade CTL responses, activates NK cell killing. PirB and Visual Plasticity Paired-immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB), an MHCI-binding receptor, is involved in the regulation of visual plasticity. PirB is expressed in the central nervous system and diminishes ocular dominance plasticity in the developmental critical period and adulthood. When the function of PirB was abolished in mutant mice, ocular dominance plasticity became more pronounced at all ages. PirB loss of function mutant mice also exhibited enhanced plasticity after monocular deprivation during the critical period. These results suggest PirB may be involved in modulation of synaptic plasticity in the visual coex.",A

What is the likely diagnosis of the patient?",Environmental enteropathy,Celiac disease,Whipple disease,Pancreatitis,"Celiac disease is caused by sensitivity to gluten in cereal products Clinical manifestations include weight loss, weakness, and diarrhea with pale, bulky, frothy, foul-smelling stools. In children, it is also characterized by growth retardation and general failure to thrive. It is more common in patients with Type I diabetes mellitius. Diagnosis involves documentation of malabsorption, small intestinal biopsy demonstrating blunting of small intestinal villi, the presence of Ig-A endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, and clinical improvement and restoration of normal intestinal morphology on a gluten-free diet. Incidence increases in association withhuman leukocyte antigens (HLAs) HLA-B8 and HLA-DW3. This finding and the presence of antibodies directed against gliadin (a glycoprotein component of gluten) and transglutaminase suggest that both genetic and immune-mediated mechanisms may be involved.

During a routine checkup of a middle aged man's blood sample shows hematocrit of 45% and biconcave red blood cells. Biconcavity of RBCs is a function of which of the following?,Ankyrin,Spectrin,Band protein,Glycophorin- C,"The biconcave shape is normal and is not a defect. Normal red blood cells are deformable biconcave disks. Their shape is determined by the external environment of the cell, the metabolic activity of the cell, the nature of hemoglobin, the membrane skeleton, and age of the cell. The red blood cell's durability and flexibility are due to its submembranous protein network, the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton consists predominantly of four proteins: spectrin, actin, protein 4.1, and ankyrin (also known as syndein). Spectrin is an extrinsic protein located on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. It is long and unusually flexible molecule consisting of two structurally and functionally distinct polypeptide chains. The membrane of the RBC comprises a phospholipid bilayer and an underlying two-dimensional network of spectrin molecules. The composite propeies of the phospholipid bilayer and spectrin network result in the biconcave or discocyte morphology of healthy RBCs and give the membrane its elastic and biorheological propeies.

Both antibody-dependent and independent complement pathway converge on which complement component?,C5,C3,Clq,C8,"Complement is a collective term that describes a system of about 20 proteins, many of which are enzyme precursors. All these are present normally among the plasma proteins in the blood as well as among the proteins that leak out of the capillaries into the tissues.
They are usually inactive i.e. enzyme precursors
They are activated by two pathways
i. Classic pathway
ii. Alternate pathway
Classic pathway - The classical pathway is initiated by an antigen-antibody reaction.
Alternative pathway

Alternative pathway complement activation does not require the interaction of complement with an antigen /antibody complex. Rather a bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) and other general bacterial substances (also immunoglobulin A aggregates) can activate complement.
In both the classical and alternative pathways a key outcome is the conversion of the C3 component of complement into C3a and C3b proteins.
Both the pathways follow different course only up to the activation of C3. Activation or splicing of the C3 is the convergence point of both the pathways, after which both the pathways follow the same course.",B

Active persons are found to be more sensitive to insulin compared to those with sedentary life style. Insulin sensitivity has been found to be inversely related to age with insulin resistance more common in the elderly due to reduced physical activity.In hyperglycemic state, metformin decreases blood glucose by lowering hepatic glucose production and enhancing peripheral glucose uptake. This is attributed to increase in insulin sensitivity and reduction in insulin resistance.Acarbose an u-glucosidase inhibitor by reducing postprandial plasma glucose increases the release of glucoregulatory hormone. GLIM. As a result acarbose increases insulin sensitivity and reduces blood glucose.Easting leads to hypoglycemia which is associated with reduction of insulin secretion and the release of counter regulatory hormones namely epinephrine, glucagon, glucocorticoids etc. Hence the answer to above question is fasting which does not increase insulin sensitivity.",D

Differentiation Differentiation refers to the process by which a less specialized cell (immature) becomes a more specialized (mature) cell type, to perform a specific function. o All specialized cells are derived from stem cells that can give rise to various type of cells. o For example, hematopoietic stem cells from the bone marrow can give rise to red blood cells, or WBCs, or platelets through various stages of development. o This process of development from stem cells to mature cells is differentiation. So, in differentiation cells acquire a type. o For neoplastic cells, differentiation refers to the extent to which neoplastic cells resemble comparabale to normal cells, both morphologically and functionally -3 well differentiated cells resemble to normal cells, while undifferentiated cells do not resemble at all, poorly differentiated cells paially resemble to normal cells. Polarity It means orientation and organization of cells in a tissue, i.e. correct positioning of cells in a tissue. Pleomorphism o Pleomorphism is variation in size and shape. It may occur in cells or / and nuclei. Hyperchromatasia o Nuclei contain an abundance of DNA and are extremely dark staining --> hyperchromatic nuclei. Anaplasia o Anaplasia means lack of differentiation. o It means ""to form backward"", implying a reversion from a high level of differentiation to a lower level. o This does not mean that the differentiation takes place in reverse direction, i.e. from mature specialized cells to unspecialized stem cells. o Rather, Anaplasia arise from stem cells that proliferate without differentiation (maturation). o So, anaplastic cells resemble primitive-appearing unspecialized cells. o Anaplasia is seen in malignant tumors --) Anaplasia is considered a hallmark of malignant transformation. o But, It is not necessory that all malignant tumors are anaplastic (undifferentiated or poorly differentiated) some malignant tumors may be well differentiated, eg follicular carcinoma of thyroid.",A

Primary hyperaldosteronism doesn't lead to ?,Hyperkalemia,Hypernatremia,Hydrogen depletion and metablic alkalosis,Hypeension,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hyperkalemia Clinical manifestations of hvperaldosteronism Excess activation of the mineralocoicoid receptor leads to potassium depletion and increased sodium retention, with the latter causing an expansion of extracellular and plasma volume. Increased ENaC activity also results in hydrogen depletion that can cause metabolic alkalosis. Aldosterone also has direct effects on the vascular system, where it increases cardiac remodeling and decreases compliance. Aldosterone excess may cause direct damage to the myocardium and the kidney glomeruli, in addition to secondary damage due to systemic hypeension. Hypokalemia can be exacerbated by thiazide drug treatment, which leads to increased delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, thereby driving potassium excretion. Severe hypokalemia can be associated with muscle weakness, ove proximal myopathy, or even hypokalemic paralysis. Severe alkalosis contributes to muscle cramps and, in severe cases, can cause tetany.",A

Superficial infections caused by Candida species may be treated with topical applications of clotrimazole, miconazole, econazole, ketoconazole, oxiconazole, ciclopirox olamine, nystatin, or amphotericin B. Chronic generalized mucocutaneous candidiasis is responsive to long-term therapy with oral ketoconazole.Terbinafine# Its mechanism of action: inhibition of fungal squalene epoxidase, blocking ergosterol biosynthesis.# Terbinafine 1% cream or spray is applied twice daily and is effective in tinea corporis, tinea cruris, and tinea pedis. Terbinafine is less active against Candida species and Malassezia furfur, but the cream also can be used in cutaneous candidiasis and tinea versicolor.# Terbinafine, given as one 250-mg tablet daily, is at least as effective for nail onychomycosis as 200 mg daily of itraconazole, and slightly more effective than pulse itraconazole therapy. Duration of treatment varies with the site being treated but typically is 3 months. Although not approved for this use, terbinafine (250 mg daily) also is effective in ringworm elsewhere on the body.# Terbinafine is not recommended in patients with marked azotemia or hepatic failure, because in the latter condition, terbinafine plasma levels are increased by unpredictable amounts. Rifampin decreases and cimetidine increases plasma terbinafine concentrations.# The drug is well tolerated, with a low incidence of gastrointestinal distress, headache, or rash.

Mechanism of action of allopurinol: September 2005,Inhibits the synthesis of uric acid,Inhibits tubular resorption of uric acid,Antinflammatory action,Increases phagocytosis of urate crystals,"Ans. A: Inhibits the synthesis of uric acid Allopurinol is a structural isomer of hypoxanthine (a naturally occurring purine in the body) and is an enzyme inhibitor, inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is responsible for the successive oxidation of hypoxanthine and xanthine resulting in the production of uric acid, the product of human purine metabolism. In addition to blocking uric acid production, inhibition of xanthine oxidase causes an increase in hypoxanthine and xanthine, which are conveed to closely related purine ribotides adenosine and guanosine monophosphates. Increased levels of these ribotides cause feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol therefore decreases both uric acid formation and purine synthesis.",A

A mutation in which of the following genes is most likely present in these individuals?",OB-R,MC4R,OB,POMC,"There are ""obesity"" genes that may play a role in metabolic pathways. About 5% to 8% of obese adults have a mutation in the MC4R gene, and even though there are abundant fat stores and plenty of leptin, the lack of MC4R to drive energy consumption leads to weight gain. Leptin is the product of the ob gene, and mutations reduce leptin levels that signal satiety, but such mutations are rare. Mutations in OB-R encoding the leptin receptor are seen in about 3% of cases of early-onset obesity with hyperphagia in children. POMC is in a catabolic pathway stimulated by leptin, but mutations are rare, and affected individuals typically have childhood-onset with hyperphagia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) is stimulated by the thiazolidinedione drugs and leads to a reduction in free fatty acids, reduction in resistin, and decreased insulin resistance.",B
"A 14 year old boy complains with gingival bleeding, oral ulcers, anemia with hepatomegaly but no lymphadenopathy, total leukocyte count of one lakh cells per mm3 is suffering from:",Acute myeloid leukemia,Chronic monocytic leukemia,Chronic lymphoblastic leukemia,Chronic myeloid leukemia,"Oral and periodontal manifestations of leukemia may include leukemic infiltration, bleeding, oral ulcerations, and infections. The expression of these signs is more common with acute and subacute forms of leukemia than with chronic forms.
Leukemic cells can infiltrate the gingiva and, less frequently, the alveolar bone. Gingival infiltration often results in leukemic gingival enlargement leukemia. Highest incidence is seen in patients with acute monocytic leukemia (66.7%), followed by those with acute myelocytic–monocytic leukemia (18.7%) and acute myelocytic leukemia (3.7%). It should be noted, however, that monocytic leukemia is an extremely rare form of the disease. Leukemic gingival enlargement is not found in edentulous patients or in patients with chronic leukemia, suggesting that it represents the accumulation of immature leukemic blast cells in the gingiva adjacent to tooth surfaces with bacterial plaque.

Bilirubin is the degradation product of -,Albumin,Globulin,Heme,Transferrin,"Bilirubin metabolism 

Bilirubin is the end product of heme degradation.
The heme is derived from -


Senescent erythrocytes by the mononuclear phagocytic system in the spleen, liver and bone marrow (major source).
Turnover of hemoproteins (e.g. cytochrome p.450).


Heme is oxidized to biliverdin by heme oxygenase.
Biliverdin is then reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.
Bilirubin is transported to the liver in bound form with albumin.
There is the carrier-mediated uptake of bilirubin in the liver.
This bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDP glucuronosyl transferase (UGT1A1) to from conjugated bilirubin (bilirubin glucuronides).
Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into bile.
Most of the conjugated bilirubin is deconjugated and degraded to urobilinogen.
The most of the urobilinogen is excreted in the faeces.
Approximately 20% of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed in the ileum and colon and is returned to the liver, and promptly excreted into bile → Enterohepatic circulation.
The small amount that escapes this enterohepatic circulation is excreted in urine.",C

Recurrent tonic-clonic convulsions without recovery of consciousness in between is an emergency; fits have to be controlled as quickly as possible to prevent death and permanent brain damage. (a) Diazepam 10 mg i.v. bolus injection (2 mg/ min) followed by fractional doses every 10 min or slow infusion titrated to control the fits has been the standard treatment. However, it redistributes rapidly so that anticonvulsant effect stas fading after 20 min. Lorazepam is less lipid soluble with slow redistribution: anticonvulsant effect of i.v. dose lasts for 6-12 hours. It is therefore preferred; 0.1 mg/kg (injected at 2 mg/ min) is effective in 75-90% cases. (b) Phenobarbitone (100-200 mg i.m./i.v.) or phenytoin (25-50 mg/min in a running saline i.v. line; not to be mixed with glucose solution because it precipitates. Fosphenytoin is used in its place now; maximum 1000 mg phenytoin equivalent). These drugs act more slowly; may be used alternatively to diazepam/lorazepam or substituted for them after the convulsions have been controlled. (c) Refractory cases may be treated with i.v. midazolam/ propofol/ thiopentone anaesthesia, with or without curarization. (d) General measures, including maintenance of airway (intubation if required), oxygenation, fluid and electrolyte balance, BP, normal cardiac rhythm, euglycaemia and care of the unconscious must be taken.

Hepatic vein thrombosis is associated with myeloproliferative disorders (especially polycythemia vera), pregnancy, the postpaum state, the use of oral contraceptives, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and intra-abdominal cancers, paicularly hepatocellular carcinoma. All of these conditions produce thrombotic tendencies or, in the case of liver cancers, sluggish blood flow. Some cases are caused by mechanical obstruction to blood outflow, as by a massive intrahepatic abscess or parasitic cyst, or by obstruction of the inferior vena cava at the level of the hepatic veins by thrombus or tumor.

False regarding cavernous hemangioma is,More infiltrative than capillary hemangioma,Undergo spontaneous regression,Intravascular thrombosis and dystrophic calcification seen commonly,Associated with VHL disease,"Cavernous hemangiomas are composed of large, dilated vascular channels. Compared with capillary hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas are more infiltrative, frequently involve deep structures, and do not spontaneously regress. On histologic examination, the mass is sharply defined but unencapsulated and is composed of large, cavernous blood-filled vascular spaces, separated by connective tissue stroma. Intravascular thrombosis with associated dystrophic calcification is common. They may be locally destructive, so surgical excision may be required in some cases. More often the tumors are of little clinical significance, but they can be cosmetically troublesome and are vulnerable to traumatic ulceration and bleeding. Moreover, cavernous hemangiomas detected by imaging studies may be difficult to distinguish from their malignant counterpas. Brain hemangiomas also are problematic, as they can cause symptoms related to compression of adjacent tissue or rupture.Cavernous hemangiomas constitute one component of von Hippel-Lindau disease , in which vascular lesions are commonly found in the cerebellum, brain stem, retina, pancreas, and liver.

Which antidepressant is relatively contraindicated in young men secondary to its side effect of priapism?,Seraline,Trazodone,Imipramine,Amitriptyline,"5-HT2 AntagonistsTwo antidepressants are thought to act primarily as antagonists at the 5-HT2 receptors: trazodone and nefazodoneThe most common adverse effects associated with the 5-HT2 antagonists are sedation and gastrointestinal disturbances. Sedative effects, paicularly with trazodone, can be quite pronounced. Thus, the treatment of insomnia is currently the primary application of trazodone. Sexual effects are uncommon with nefazodone or trazodone treatment as a result of the relatively selective serotonergic effects of these drugs on the 5-HT2 receptor rather than on SE. However, trazodone has rarely been associated with inducing priapism.Priapism (an abnormally prolonged erection) is estimated to happen in 1 in every 10,000 patients treated with trazodone.Ref: Harper&;s Biochemistry; 12th edition; Page no: 526",B

ARDS has also been called adult respiratory failure, shock lung, traumatic wet lung, pump lung, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The initial and basic lesion in ARDS is diffuse damage to the alveolar wall. Protein-rich edema fluid then leaks into the alveolar spaces and combines with fibrin and dead cells to produce hyaline membranes that line the alveoli and are the characteristic histologic feature of ARDS. In the acute edematous stage, the lungs are congested (pulmonary congestion) and show pulmonary edema with interstitial inflammation. Collapsed, airless pulmonary parenchyma is called atelectasis and can also be seen in ARDS. These other changes, although present in ARDS, are not pathognomonic. In contrast, angioinvasive infiltrates of pleomorphic lymphoid cells are seen with lymphomatoid granulomatosis, a disease of middle-aged individuals that is characterized by an angiocentric and angioinvasive infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells. Deposits of needle-like crystals from the membranes of eosinophils, called Charcot-Leyden crystals, can be seen in patients with asthma, while infiltrating groups of malignant cells having intercellular bridges characterize squamous cell carcinoma.

An aortic dissection is typically a sudden, life-threatening event with dissection of blood out of the ascending aortic lumen, typically into the chest, without a pulsatile abdominal mass. The risk factors for atherosclerosis and hypertension also underlie aortic dissection. An arteriovenous fistula can produce an audible bruit on auscultation. Classic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) can produce small microaneurysms in small arteries, most often renal and mesenteric. Takayasu arteritis typically involves the aortic arch and branches in children.

Type of inheritance in MELAS -,AD,AR,Mitochondrial,X-linked,"Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes - abbreted to MELAS - is one of the family of mitochondrial cytopathies, which also include MERRF, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. It was first characterized under this name in 1984. A feature of these diseases is that they are caused by defects in the mitochondrial genome which is inherited purely from the female parent. However, it is impoant to know that some of the proteins essential to normal mitochondrial function are produced by the nuclear genome, and are subsequently transpoed to the mitochondria for use. As such, mutations in these proteins can result in mitochondrial disorders, but can be inherited from both male and female parent in the typical fashion. The disease can manifest in both sexes.This condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance and heteroplasmy. This pattern of inheritance applies to genes contained in mitochondrial DNA. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children. In most cases, people with MELAS inherit an altered mitochondrial gene from their mother. Less commonly, the disorder results from a new mutation in a mitochondrial gene and occurs in people with no family history of MELAS.",C
Mechanism of action of quinolones is:,Inhibits DNA gyrase,Inhibits bacterial protein synthesis,Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis,Inhibits intake of folic acid,"Mechanism of action of Fluoroquinolones
The FQs inhibit the enzyme bacterial DNA gyrase (primarily active in gram negative bacteria), which nicks double-stranded DNA, introduces negative supercoils and then reseals the nicked ends. This is necessary to prevent excessive positive supercoiling of the strands when they separate to permit replication or transcription.

Ultrastructural finding in case of paraganglionia ?,Deposition of glycogen,Enlarged mitochondria,Shrunken mitochondria,Dense core granules,"Dense core granules Paragangliomas The paragangliomas have been known historically by a variety of names including glomus tumours, chemodectonza, non chromaffin paraganglionza, glomercytomas, carotid body and tympanic body tumours and receptomas. Essentially these tumours make up a family of neoplasms that develop from the paraganglial tissues which are atually chemoreceptor organs that are distributed throughout the body. These chemoreceptor organs are of neural crest origin and have similar functions and similar histological appearance. Their cells of origin are a pa of the diffuse neuroendocrine system (DNES). Paragangliomas are composed of characteristic cell called 'C' cell. The chief cell is probably the principal component involved and seems to be the actual chemoreceptor of the paraganglia containing acetyl choline, catecholamine and serotonin. Chief cell is of neural crest origin and it contains hormone thus it is neuroendocrine in nature. It renders the paraganglia receptive to hypoxia and pH changes and to fluctuations in blood carbon dioxide concentration. These chief cells migrate with the autonomic ganglion cells. They are in close association with the sympathetic ganglia and Aoa in its main branches. Many head and neck paraganglia and their respective neoplasms are distributed in relation to the vessel and cranial nerves of the primitive branchial arches. Because of this they are also called branchiomeric paraganglioma. Pathology of paraganglioma : Like other neuroendocrine tumour the ultrastructure shows dense core granules (neurosecretory grangules) The tumour cells balls are arranged in distinctive cell balls called Zellaballen (the cell balls are composed of chief cells). These cells are separated by fibrovascular stroma and surrounded by sustentacular cells. Immunohistochemistry of paraganglioma Chief cells are neuroendocrine cells and are thus positive for regular neuroendocrine markers e.g. Chromogranin Synaptophysin Neuron specific enolase Serotonin Neurofilament The chief cells are S-100 protein negative but the sustentacular cells are S-100 positive and are focally positive for glial fibrillary acid protein.

Concentric hyperophy of left ventricle is seen in,Mitral stenosis,Hypeension,Aoic regurgitation,None.,"In pressure overload states (e.g., hypeension or valvular stenosis), new sarcomeres tend to be added parallel to the long axis of the myocytes, adjacent to existing sarcomeres. The growing muscle fiber diameter thus results in concentric hyperophy--the ventricular wall thickness increases without an increase in the size of the chamber. The chronic pressure overload of systemic hypeension causes left ventricular concentric hyperophy, often associated with left atrial dilation due to impaired diastolic filling of the ventricle. Persistently elevated pressure overload can cause ventricular failure with dilation. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no.386,388)",B

Which of the following criteria will be used by the pathologist in determining benignancy versus malignancy in permanent sections?",Mitotic rate,Cell pleomorphism,Cell necrosis,Nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio,"""Fibroids"" of the uterus are among the most common abnormalities seen in uteri. They arise in the myometrium, submucosally, subserosally, and midwall, both singly and several at a time. Sharply circumscribed, they are benign smooth-muscle tumors that are firm, gray-white, and whorled on cut section. Their malignant counterpa, leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, is quite rare in the de novo state and arises even more rarely from an antecedent leiomyoma. Whereas cell pleomorphism, tissue necrosis, and cytologic atypia per se are established criteria in assessing malignancy in tumors generally, they are impoant to the pathologist in uterine fibroids only if mitoses are also present. Regardless of cellularity or atypicality, if 10 or more mitoses are present in 10 separate high-power microscopic fields, the lesion is a leiomyosarcoma. If five or fewer mitoses are present in 10 fields with bland morphology, the leiomyoma will behave in a benign fashion. Problems arise when the mitotic counts range between three and seven per 10 fields with varying degrees of cell and tissue atypicality. These equivocal lesions should be regarded by both pathologist and clinician as ""gray-area"" smooth-muscle tumors of unpredictable biologic behavior. Founately, the gray-area leiomyoma of the uterus is rarely seen. Thus mitoses are the most impoant criteria in assessing malignancy in smooth-muscle tumors of the uterus.

Naloxone is not used during resuscitation of a childwhose mother is on :,>Methadone,>Phenycyclidine,>Amphetamine,>Cocaine,"Metandone ""At the delivery of known opioid dependent women, naloxone should be avoided in resuscitation of the infant because it may precipitate seizures"" Naloxone is used to reverse neonatal respiratory depression due to opioid use during labour. It should not be used in cases where mother is opioid dependent. It can result in withdraw! syndrome. When the mother is on opioids, fetus becomes opioid dependent in-utero and the use of naloxone in respiratory resuscitation may result in severe withdrawal symptoms. According to Goodman Gilman ""In subjects who are dependent on morphine like opioids (methadone is pharmacologically similar to morphine) small subcutaneous doses of naloxone (5 mg) precipitate a moderate to severe withdraw! syndrome that is very similar to that seen after withdraw' of opioids, except that the syndrome appears within minutes after administration and subsides in about 2 hours.""",A

Tumorogenesis in aging is due to,Telomerase reactivation,Telomerase inactivation,Increased apoptosis,Suppression of proto-oncogenes,"Telomerase, also called terminal transferase, is a ribonucleoprotein that adds a species-dependent telomere repeat sequence to the 3' end of telomeres. A telomere is a region of repetitive sequences at each end of a eukaryotic chromosomes in most eukaryotes. Telomeres protect the end of the chromosome from DNA damage or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lacks telomerase, but instead uses retrotransposons to maintain telomeres. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule (e.g., with the sequence ""CCCAAUCCC"" in veebrates) which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres.

Which of the following genetic abnormalities is most often related to the development of this disease?",Confined placental mosaicism,Expanded trinucleotide repeat,Frameshift mutation,Nondisjunction,"Most cases of Tay-Sachs disease are caused by inseion of four nucleotides into the coding region of the gene for the alpha-subunit of the hexosaminidase A gene. This produces a frameshift mutation, resulting in the creation of a premature stop codon downstream from the inseed nucleotides. The disease presents as described in the question, and is more common in Ashkenazi Jews. The carrier rate in this population is 1 in 25. There is presently no effective treatment and survival beyond four years of age is rare. Confined placental mosaicism is caused by a genetic aberration (e.g., a trisomy) occurring in the trophoblast or extraembryonic progenitor cells in the inner cell mass of the embryo. This leads to abnormal placental development and intrauterine growth retardation. Expansion of tandem nucleotide repeats is thought to be etiologically involved in Fragile X syndrome and Huntington disease. Nondisjunction during meiosis is a common cause of trisomy, e.g., trisomy 21, or Down syndrome. Ref: Wyatt C., Kemp W.L., Moos P.J., Burns D.K., Brown T.G. (2008). Chapter 6. Genetic Disorders. In C.

Characteristic feature of hyperophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is:-,Asymmetric septal hyperophy of septum,Increased size of atria,Increased size of ventricle,Normal myofiber arrangement,"Hyperophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common (incidence, 1 in 500), clinically heterogeneous, genetic disorder characterized by myocardial hyperophy, poorly compliant left ventricular myocardium leading to abnormal diastolic filling, and (in about one third of cases) intermittent ventricular outflow obstruction. The essential feature of HCM is massive myocardial hyperophy,usually without ventricular dilation. The classic pattern involves dispropoionate thickening of the ventricularseptum relative to the left ventricle free wall (with a ratio of septum to free wall greater than 3 : 1), termed asymmetric septal hyperophy. In about 10% of cases, the hyperophy is concentric and symmetrical. On longitudinal sectioning, the normally round-to-ovoid left ventricular cavity may be compressed into a ""banana-like"" configuration by bulging of the ventricular septum into the lumen. Although marked hyperophy can involve the entire septum, it is usually most prominent in the subaoic region. The left ventricular outflow tract often exhibits a fibrous endocardial plaque associated with thickening of the anterior mitral leaflet. The most impoant histologic features of HCM myocardium are: (1) massive myocyte hyperophy (2) haphazard disarray of bundles of myocytes, individual myocytes, and contractile elements in sarcomeres within cells (termed myofiber disarray). (3) interstitial and replacement fibrosis Mutations causing HCM are found most commonly in the gene encoding b-myosin heavy chain (b-MHC), followed by the genes coding for cardiac TnT, a-tropomyosin, and myosin-binding protein C (MYBP-C).",A

Mechanism of action of coicosteroids in asthma is: March 2009,Decreases mucosal edema by suppressing inflammatory response,Mast cell stabilization,Causes bronchodilatation,Leukotriene antagonist,"Ans. A: Decreases mucosal edema by suppressing inflammatory response Glucocoicoids are not bronchodilators. They benefit by reducing bronchial hyperreactivity, mucosal edema and by suppressing inflammatory response to antigen antibody reaction or other trigger stimuli. The main adverse effects of inhaled steroids are caused by the deposition of the drug in the upper airways, resulting in dysphonia, oropharyngeal candidiasis, and cough. These effects may be reduced by rinsing the mouth and use of a spacer device. Systemic adverse effects are clinically relevant only at doses more than 600 microgram/day.

Mutation seen in malignant melanoma is,N-MYC,RB gene,CDKN2A,p53,"CDKN2A is a complex locus that encodes three different tumor sup- pressors, p15/INK4b, p16/INK4a, and p14/ARF. Of these, loss of p16/INK4a is clearly implicated in human melanoma, and experimental evidence also suppos a role for loss of p14/ARF. As already mentioned, p16/ INK4a inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), thus reinforcing the ability of the RB tumor suppressor to block cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. By contrast, p14/ARF enhances the activity of the p53 tumor suppressor by inhibiting MDM2, an oncoprotein that stimulates p53 degradation. CDKN2A is mutated in approximately 10% of sporadic melanomas, and these mutations uniformly abolish the production of p16/INK4a and more variably affect p14/ ARF. However, it is suspected that these mutations are the tip of the ""oncogenic iceberg"" with respect to molec- ular lesions affecting the G1 checkpoint. For example, 30% to 70% of melanomas show loss of p16/INK4a expression though varied mechanisms, and other famil- ial and sporadic melanomas have mutations in CDK4",C

Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of pulmonary artery or one of its branches.
Pulmonary embolism is an extremely common and highly lethal condition that is a leading cause of death in all age groups.

Etiology

In more than 95% of instances, venous emboli originating from deep leg vein thrombi above the level of knee i.e. in popliteal, femoral or iliac veins.
Although the most common site of deep vein thrombosis is calf veins, calf veins thrombosis is itself associated with a low risk of embolism, but when the thrombosis progresses proximally to involve the larger veins above the leg then the risk becomes very high.
So,  Most common site of DVT → Calf veins

Most common source of pulmonary embolism → DVT of proximal veins of lower limb i.e., popliteal, femoral or iliac veins.
Pathophysiology of pulmonary embolism

If the size of embolus is large, it may be impacted at the bifurcation of main pulmonary artery → Saddle embolus, or may be passed out into the smaller, branching arterioles.
More commonly, there are multiple emboli, or a large embolus may be fragmented into many smaller emboli which are then impacted in a number of vessels, particularly affecting the lower lobes of lungs.
Rarely, Paradoxical embolism may occur by passage of an embolus from the right side of the heart into the left heart through ASD or VSD. In this way, pulmonary emboli may reach systemic circulation.",C

Alkalinization of urine is done in poisoning with all except ?,Mrophine,Salicylates,Methotrexate,Barbiturates,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Mrophine By manipulation of the pH of glomerular filtrate, a drug can be made to ionize, become less lipid-soluble, remain in the renal tubular fluid, and so be eliminated in urine. Alkanization of urine Acidic drugs are more ionized (lipid insoluble / polar / water soluble) at alkaline pH. So, they cannot be absorbed from tubular lumen, i.e. their excretion by kidney is enhanced by alkanization of urine. Such acidic drugs are Barbiturates and Salicylate. Alkanization of urine is done by infusion of sodium bicarbonate. Urine alkalinization by NaHCO3 enhances the elimination of weak acids, e.g. Salicylates, Phenobarbitone, Chlorpropamide, formic acid and methotrexate. Acidification of urine Basic drugs are more ionized at acidic pH. So, acidification of urine should be done in poisoning of these drugs. Examples of such basic drugs are morphine, amphetamine, dexfenfluramine. Acidification of urine is done by iv infusion of arginine hydrochloride followed by ammonium chloride (NH4C1) by mouth. -- Laurence 9th/e 156",A

A 49-year-old female presents with signs of anemia and states that every morning her urine is dark. Workup reveals that her red blood cells lyse in vitro with acid (positive Ham's test). What is the best diagnosis for this patient?,Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria,Cold-agglutinin autoimmune hemolytic anemia,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal stem cell disorder that is characterized by abnormal red cells, granulocytes, and platelets. The red blood cells (RBCs) are abnormally sensitive to the lytic activity of complement due to a deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) linked proteins, namely decay-accelerating factor (DAF, or CD 55), membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD55), or CD59 (a C8 binding protein). Complement is normally activated by acidotic states, such as occur with exercise or sleep. In patients with PNH, the acidotic condition that develops during sleep (which is usually at night) causes hemolysis of red blood cells and results in red urine in the morning. The erythrocytes of these patients lyse in vitro with acid (Ham's test) or sucrose (sucrose lysis test). Complications of PNH include the development of frequent thromboses, paicularly of the hepatic, poal, or cerebral veins. Since PNH is a clonal stem cell disorder, patients are at an increased risk of developing aplastic anemia or acute leukemia. The autoimmune hemolytic anemias are impoant causes of acute anemia in a wide variety of clinical states and can be separated into two main types: those secondary to ""warm"" antibodies and those reactive at cold temperatures. Warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemias react at 37degC in vitro, are composed of IgG, and do not fix complement. They are found in patients with malignant tumors, especially leukemia-lymphoma; with use of such drugs as a-methyldopa; and in the autoimmune diseases, especially lupus erythematosus. Cold-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia reacts at 4 to 6degC, fixes complement, is of the IgM type, and is classically associated with Mycoplasma pneumonitis (pleuropneumonia-like organisms). These antibodies are termed cold agglutinins and may reach extremely high titers and cause intravascular red cell agglutination. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

False statement regarding Lithium is:,Maximum plasma concentration is avoided due to low therapeutic index,Contraindicated in pregnancy,No individual variation in the rate of excretion,80% reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule,"There is marked individual variation in the rate of lithium excretion. Thus, with the same daily dose, different individuals attain widely different Antimanic Drugs 435 plasma concentrations. However, in an individual the clearance remains fairly constant. Since the margin of safety is narrow, monitoring of serum lithium concentration is essential for optimal therapy. Serum lithium level is measured 12 hours after the last dose to reflect the steadystate concentration; 0.5-0.8 mEq/L is considered optimum for maintenance therapy in bipolar disorder, while 0.8-1.1 mEq/L is required for episodes of mania.

Anti GDla,AIDP,ASMAN,AMAN,Fisher syndrome,"Immunopathological studies suggest that the target of immune attack is different in the subtypes of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). In acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), the attack appears directed against the axolemma and nodes of Ranvier. In acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), the attack appears directed against a component of the Schwann cell. However, the nature of the antigenic targets is still not clear. We prospectively studied 138 Chinese GBS patients and found that IgG anti-GD1a antibodies were closely associated with AMAN but not AIDP. With a cutoff titer of greater than 1:100, 60% of AMAN versus 4% of AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies; with a cutoff titer of greater than 1:1,000, 24% of AMAN patients and none of the AIDP patients had IgG anti-GD1a antibodies. In contrast, low levels of IgG anti-GM1 antibodies (> 1:100) were detected in both the AMAN and the AIDP forms (57% vs 35%, NS). High titers of IgG anti-GM1 (>1:1,000) were more common in the AMAN form (24% vs 8%, NS). Serological evidence of recent Campylobacter infection was detected in 81% of AMAN and 50% of AIDP patients, and anti-ganglioside antibodies were common in both Campylobacter-infected and noninfected patients.

Both fenfluramine and phentermine have been successfully used, alone and in combination, for the treatment of obesity. They apparently reduce appetite by affecting the satiety centers in the hypothalamus. Whereas phentermine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant related to the amphetamines and is believed to act by releasing norepinephrine from CNS neurons, fenfluramine causes lethargy and sedation and acts by augmenting serotonin neurotransmission. For this reason, the drugs may be used together without causing excessive CNS stimulation or depression.",B

There is a darkly pigmented, irregular, 1.2-cm skin lesion on the right shoulder. A chest radiograph shows prominent borders on the left and right sides of the heart. Pericardiocentesis yields bloody fluid. Laboratory findings include a serum troponin I level of 0.3 ng/mL. Which of the following lesions is the most likely cause of these findings?",Calcific aortic stenosis,Coronary atherosclerosis,Epicardial metastases,Mitral valvulitis,"Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion most commonly is caused by either tumor or tuberculosis. The most common neoplasm involving the heart is metastatic cancer because primary cardiac neoplasms are rare. The most common primary sites are nearby-lung, breast, and esophagus. The skin lesion in this patient is likely to be a malignant melanoma, which tends to metastasize widely, including to the heart. Most cardiac metastases involve the epicardium/pericardium. (By convention, even though epicardial surfaces are often involved most severely, the term pericardial effusion is typically used when fluid is present, or pericarditis is used when inflammation is present.) A large effusion can cause tamponade, which interferes with cardiac motion. Calcific aortic stenosis leads to left-sided congestive heart failure, with pulmonary edema as a key finding. Coronary atherosclerosis may lead to myocardial infarction, which can be complicated by ventricular rupture and hemopericardium, but the level of troponin I, in this case, suggests that infarction did not occur. Rheumatic heart disease mainly affects the cardiac valves, but acute rheumatic fever can produce fibrinous pericarditis.

Pathology is wet lung is ?,Diffuse alveolar damage,Surfactant deficiency,Collection of pus,Hemorrhage in lungs,"Ref:Textbook of pathology (Harsh mohan) 6th edition,page no. Adult ARDS/Wet Lung. Adult ARDS is known by various synonyms such as shock-lung syndrome, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acute alveolar injury, traumatic wet lungs and post-traumatic respiratory insufficiency. The condition was first recognised in adults during World War II in survivors of non-thoracic injuries with shock. Adult ARDS also presents clinically by sudden and severe respiratory distress, tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and severe hypoxaemia. The mechanism of acute injury by etiologic agents listed above depends upon the imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines: i) Activated pulmonay macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines such as IL8, IL1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), while macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) helps to sustain inflammation in the alveoli. Number of neutrophils in the alveoli is increased in acute injury. Neutrophils on activation release products which cause active tissue injury e.g. proteases, platelet activating factor, oxidants and leukotrienes. ii) Besides the role of cytokines in acute injury, a few fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-a (TGF-a) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) play a role in repair process by stimulation of proliferation of fibroblast and collagen. In either case, injury to the capillary endothelium leads to increased vascular permeability while injured pneumocytes, especially type 1, undergo necrosis. The net effect of injury to both capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium is interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, congestion, fibrin deposition and formation of hyaline membranes. As a result of coating of the alveoli with hyaline membranes, there is loss of surfactant causing collapse calle 'stiff lung'. There is an attempt at regeneration of alveolar cells by proliferation of type II alveolar cells so as to increase the secretion of surfactant.",A
"A 22-year-old woman presents with painless cervical lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and generalized pruritus. An enlarged cervical lymph node is removed for diagnosis. On cut surface, it shows broads bands of fibrosis. Histologically, the affected lymph node contains a mixture of cells, including lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, and scattered large cells with prominent nucleoli. Which of the following is the most likely condition?",Cat-scratch disease,Hodgkin disease,Reactive non-specific lymphadenitis,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"The history is consistent with Hodgkin disease (HD). Impoant clinical clues include painless lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and generalized pruritus. All forms of lymphoma lead to effacement of the nodal architecture on cut surfaces. In this case, fibrotic bands appear to divide the node into multiple nodules. This finding is suggestive of the nodular sclerosis subtype of HD, which usually affects children and young adults. Fuhermore, the histologic finding of large cells with prominent nucleoli (Reed-Sternberg cells) within a polymorphic cellular background is consistent with HD. Remember that the nodular sclerosis type of HD is characterized by a subtype of Reed-Sternberg cells called lacunar cells. These are similar to classic Reed-Sternberg cells in their large, inclusion-like nucleoli, but appear surrounded by a clear halo (hence the attribute ""lacunar""). Cat-scratch disease is due to a small gram-negative bacillus (Baonella henselae), which is transmitted to humans by a scratch or a bite by a cat. Swelling of lymph nodes develops days after the skin lesion. The history is generally sufficient for diagnosis, but occasionally a lymph node biopsy is performed for confirmation. This reveals characteristic stellate abscesses, which are also seen with tularemia and lymphogranuloma venereum. Reactive non-specific lymphadenitis results in hyperplasia of germinal centers of lymphoid follicles, where maturation of B-cells takes place--follicular hyperplasia. This is probably the most common form of lymphadenopathy in otherwise healthy individuals. However, a careful search of the inciting conditions (dental abscess, skin infection, etc.) must be undeaken before reaching a conclusion of reactive lymphadenitis without histologic analysis. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with effacement of lymph node architecture, and replacement by a population of atypical or frankly anaplastic lymphocytes. The presence of a polymorphic cellular background, and especially the finding of Reed-Sternberg cells, excludes non-Hodgkin lymphomas.",B

A 23-year-old female presented with jaundice and pallor for 2 months. Her peripheral blood smear shows the presence of spherocytes. The most relevant investigation to arrive at a diagnosis is;,Reticulocyte count,Osmotic fragility test,Coombs test,Tests fro PNH,"Ans. c. Coombs test (Ref: Robbins 9/e p643-644; Chandrasoma and Taylor 3/e p401)History of jaundice in a 23-year old female with pallor and spherocytes in peripheral blood points towards the diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA):Onset is very often abrupt and can be dramatic.The hemoglobin level can drop, within days, to as low as 4g/dL; the massive red cell removal will produce jaundice, and often the spleen will be enlarged. When this triad is present, the suspicion of AIHA must be high.The diagnostic test for AIHA is the antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).AIHA is diagnosed by detection of autoantibodies with the direct antiglobulin (direct Coombs') test.IgG is present in warm antibody hemolytic anemia, and C3 (C3b and C3d) in cold antibody disease.Reticulocyte count is increased in both hereditary spherocytosis and AIHA.Osmotic Fragility Test is used to evaluate hemolytic anemia, especially hereditary spherocytosis, and immune hemolytic states.Test for PNH:PNH will present with hemoglobinuria.Blood tests in PNH show changes consistent with intravascular hemolytic anemia:Low hemoglobinRaised LDHRaised reticulocytes (immature red cells released by the bone marrow to replace the destroyed cells)Raised bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin)Decreased levels of haptoglobinThe direct antiglobulin test (DAT, or direct Coombs' test) is negative, as antibodies do not cause the hemolysis in PNH.Warm antibody hemolytic anemiaCold antibody hemolytic anemia* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) at body temperature (37deg C)* These antibodies are called warm antibodies and are nearly IgGQ* Antibodies here bind with antigens (on RBC) better at temperature lower than 37degC* These antibodies are called reactive antibodies and are usually IgM* Rarely IgG antibodies e.g. The Donath Landsteiner antibody of Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria)QCausesCauses1.

What is hyperplasia -,Decrease in cell size,Increase in cell size,Increase in cell number,Decrease in cell number,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increase in cell number Hvperplasia o Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells without increase in size in an organ or tissue (by contrast hyperophy refers to an increase in the size of cells). o Hyperplasia takes place if the cellular population is capable of synthesizing DNA, thus permitting mitotic division i.e., hyperplasia involves cell division (by contrast hyperophy involves cell enlargement without cell division). o Hyperplasia can be physiological or pathological. A. Physiological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased physiological demand e.g (a) Hormonal --> Hyperplasia of endometrium in pregnant uterus, proliferation of the glandular epithelium of female breast at pubey and during pregnancy. (b) Compensatory --> Increase in tissue mass after damage or paial resection, e.g. regeneration of liver after paial hepatectomy. B. Pathological hyperplasia o It occurs when there is increased stimulus under ceain pathologic conditions. o Most forms of pathological hyperplasia are caused by excessive hormonal stimulation or growth factor acting on target cells, e.g., Endometrial hyperplasia due to disturbed estrogen and progesterone balance (with relative excess of estrogen) in menstural cycle. Note : Stimulus for physiologic and pathologic hyperplasia may be the same (e.g., estrogen for endometrial hyperplasia), but in physiologic hyperplasia, the stimulus is due to normal physiologic changes of body e.g., pregnancy, while in pathologic hyperplasia the stimulus is due to ceain pathologic conditions e.g., estrogen secreting ovarian tumor. o Although pathological hyperplasia is abnormal, the process remains controlled --> Hyperplasia regresses if the hormonal stimulation is eliminated. o It is the response to the normal regulatory control mechanisms that distinguishes benign pathological hyperplasia from Cancer, in which the growth control mechanism becomes defective. o However, pathological hyperplasia constitues a feile soil in which cancerous proliferation may eventually arise --> e.g., patients with endometrial hyperplasia are at increase risk of endometrial carcinoma Mechanism of hyperplasia o Hyperplasia is caused by increased production of growth factor or hormones that lead to production of transcription factor that turn on many cellular genes and induce cellular proliferation. o After some type of cell loss, hyperplasia is caused not only by proliferation of cells but also by the development of new cells from stem cells --> e.g., After hepatectomy the hyperplasia is due to proliferation of the remaining hepatocytes, but in chronic hepatitis, intrahepatic stem cells play a major role in hyperplasia as the proliferative capacity of hepatocytes is compromised.",C
Drug possessing highest efficacy to increase plasma HDL is?,Ezetimibe,Nicotinic acid,Gemfibrosil,Rosuvastatin,"Ans. b (Nicotinic acid) (Ref.

The ability of stem cells to cross the barrier of differentiation to transform into a cell of another lineage expressing the molecular characteristics of different cell type with the ability to perform the function of the new cell type is referred as:,De differentiation,Re differentiation,Trans differentiation,Sub differentiation,"Transdifferentiation is defined as:-

The change of a cell or tissue from one differentiated state to another.
The differentiation of a tissue-specific stem cell into another type of cell as for example a bone marrow stem cell differentiating into a neuron.

Dedifferentiation

It is a cellular process commonly believed to be uniquely available to lower life forms such as worms and amphibians in which a partially or terminally differentiated cell reverts to an earlier developmental stage.
Cells in cell culture can lose properties they originally had such as protein expression or change shape. This process is also termed dedifferentiation.
Dedifferentiation can also be observed in some tumour e.g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas which will show more immature areas in an otherwise differentiated liposarcoma.
Regression of a specialized cell or tissue to a simpler, more embryonic, unspecialized form i.e. a reversal of cell development so that differentiation that had occurred previously is lost and the cells become more generalized in structure.

Redifferentiation

It is suggested that the drug acts as a hapten, which binds to plasma proteins. This drug-protein complex is recognized as being foreign to the body and induces the serum sickness. Common signs and symptoms of serum sickness include fever, cutaneous eruptions (morbilliform and/or uicarial), lymphadenopathy, and ahralgias. Erythema multiforme may also appear in severe cases. With respect to cefaclor, the incidence of serum sickness is much higher in infants and children than in adults. Due to the severity of the signs and symptoms in this patient, oral prednisone and diphenhydramine should be administered. The prednisone will treat the ahralgias and the skin rash and the diphenhydramine will allete the uicaria. The use of aspirin in a child with a fever is not indicated due to the risk of Reye syndrome.

C: Ulcerative Colitis The mainstay of drug therapy for mild and moderate ulcerative colitis is sulfasalazine and other aminosalicylic acid (ASA) compounds and coicosteroids Sulfasalazine It is a sulfa drug, a derivative of mesalazine (also called 5-aminosalicylic acid, or 5-ASA) Sulfasalazine is used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It is also indicated for use in rheumatoid ahritis and used in other types of inflammatory ahritis (e.g. psoriatic ahritis) where it has a beneficial affect. It is often well tolerated compared to other DMARDS. It is usually not given to children under 2 years of age. It yields the metabolite sulfapyridine which gives rise to side-effects such as agranulocytosis and hypospermia. The other metabolite of sulfasalazine, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is attributed to the drug's therapeutic effect. Therefore, 5-ASA and other derivatives of 5-ASA, are now usually preferred and given alone (as mesalazine), despite their increased cost, due to their more ourable side-effect profile.

HLA is located on aEUR',Sho arm of chr-6,Long arm of chr-6,Sho arm of chr-3,Long arm of chr-3,"Sho arm of chr- 6 Human leucocyte antigen is so called because it was first discovered on the leucocytes. HLA is also called Major histocompatibility complex. The histocompatibility antigens (human leukocyte antigens - HLA) are cell surface antigens that induce an immune response leading to rejection of allogrufts. The principal physiologic function of the cell surface histocompatibility molecules is to bind peptide fragments of foreign proteins for presentation to antigen specific T cells. The histocompatibility antigens are encoded by a closely linked multiallelic cluster of genes, Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or Human leukocyte antigens complex (HLA complex). - HLA complex of genes is located on the sho arm of chromosome 6. It consists of three separate clusters of genes: HLA Complex [MHC Responses of MHC molecules Class 1 MHC class I molecules bind and process peptide that are derived from proteins synthesized within the cells, e.g. viral protein in viral infected cells and antigen of cancerous cells. These cells (cancerous or virus infected) have a tendency to display unusual, non self antigens on their surface. After binding to MHC-I, these antigens are processed and presented to cytotoxic CD-8 T cells (MHC-I restricted). Cytotoxic CD-8 T cell - MHC I reaction cause -- Graft rejection - Cell mediated cytolysis of viral infected or tumor cells. Class II Class 11 molecules present exogenous antigen (e.g. extracellular microbes, soluble proteins). These antigens are first internalized and undergo proteolytic cleavage in lysosome. Peptide generated .from this proteolytic cleavage are presented by MHC - II to CD4-T cells (MHC-II restricted). Reactions are : - Graft versus host response - Mixed leukocyte reaction Class III ""The MHC class HI region contains many genes that are good candidates for the involvement in autoimmune disease"". Recent data suggest that quantitative and qualitative diversities of the MHC Ill linked C4 among different ethnic groups can be impoant in susceptibility to autoimmune disease like SLE. Note ?

Now it has been replaced by more efficacious newer dopaminergic drugs namely ropinirole and pramipexole.Dopaminergic agonists cause postural hypotension as an adverse effect especially in the beginning of therapy.Bromocriptine being an ergot derivative can cause painful digital vasospasm in a dose dependent manner following chronic use.Among the newer dopaminergic agonists, pramipexole with affinity towards D3 receptors has been found to havre possible neuroprotective action in dopaminergic cell cultures.Dopaminergic agonists have been reported to cause bleeding from peptic ulcer. Hence dopaminergic agonists are contraindicated in active peptic ulcer, psychotic diseases and recent myocardial infarction.",A

"The parents of a male infant report that male children over three generations in the mother's family have been affected by a progressive disorder involving multiple organ systems. These children have had coarse facial features, corneal clouding, joint stiffness, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation, and many died in childhood. At autopsy, some of the children had subendothelial coronary arterial deposits that caused myocardial infarction. Laboratory testing of the infant now shows increased urinary excretion of mucopolysaccharides. Bone marrow biopsy is performed, and the accumulated mucopolysaccharides are found in macrophages (""balloon cells"" filled with minute vacuoles). Which of the following enzyme deficiencies is most likely to be seen in this infant?",Adenosine deaminase,a-l-Iduronidase,Glucocerebrosidase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,"Hunter syndrome, one of the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), results from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme a-l- iduronidase. The glycosaminoglycans that accumulate in MPS include dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. All of the MPS variants are autosomal recessive except for Hunter syndrome, which is X-linked recessive. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), an immunodeficiency state in which multiple recurrent infections occur after birth. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Gaucher disease; in the most common form of the disease, there is no neurologic impairment, and patients have splenomegaly and skeletal disease as a consequence of increased lysosomal glucocerebrosides in cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency leads to von Gierke disease, characterized by hepatomegaly, renomegaly, and impaired gluconeogenesis leading to hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Hexosaminidase A deficiency occurs in Tay-Sachs disease; affected individuals manifest severe neurologic impairment, poor motor development, and blindness beginning in infancy. Lysosomal glucosidase deficiency, seen in Pompe disease, is associated with marked cardiomegaly and heart failure beginning in infancy. Sphingomyelinase deficiency occurs in Niemann-Pick disease type A, characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, lymph-adenopathy, and severe motor and mental impairment.",B

An echocardiogram shows 1.5-cm vegetation on the mitral valve. Which of the following conditions is this patient most likely to develop?",Cerebral arterial mycotic aneurysm,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Myxomatous mitral valve degeneration,Pericardial effusion with tamponade,"She developed bacterial septicemia followed by infective endocarditis of the mitral valve. Thus she has a high risk for developing complications of infective endocarditis. Such valvular vegetations are destructive of the valve. The impaired functioning of the mitral valve (most likely regurgitation) would give rise to left atrial dilation and left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema. Septic emboli from the mitral valve vegetation could reach the systemic circulation and give rise to abscesses. The infection of an arterial wall can weaken the wall, resulting in aneurysm formation and the potential for rupture. Dilated cardiomyopathy may be due to chronic alcoholism, or it may be idiopathic. It may be familial, or it may follow myocarditis, but it is not a direct complication of infective endocarditis. Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve results from a defect in connective tissue, whether well-defined or unknown; the mitral valve leaflets are enlarged, hooded, and redundant. Lesions on the right side of the valve can produce septic emboli that involve the lungs, but vegetations on the left side embolize to the systemic circulation, producing lesions in the spleen, kidneys, or brain. Pulmonary abscesses can occur from right-sided infective endocarditis because septic emboli pour into the pulmonary arterial circulation.",A

Characterized by rapid swelling (edema) of the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa and submucosal tissues. It is very similar to urticaria, but urticaria, commonly known as hives, occurs in the upper dermis
Angioedema is classified as either hereditary or acquired.

a) Acquired angioedema (AAE) can be immunologic, nonimmunologic, or idiopathic.
It is usually caused by allergy and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and urticaria.
It can also occur as a side effect of certain medications, particularly ACE inhibitors.
b) Hereditary angioedema (HAE) exists in three forms, all of which are caused by a genetic mutation inherited in an autosomal dominant form.
i) Types I and II are caused by mutations in the SERPINGl gene, which result in either diminished levels of the C1-esterase inhibitor protein (type I HAE) or dysfunctional forms of the same protein (type II HAE).
ii) Type III HAE has been linked with mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes the coagulation protein factor, XII.

All forms of HAE lead to abnormal activation of the complement system.
The end product of this cascade, bradykinin, is produced in large amounts and is believed to be the predominant mediator leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation that induces typical angioedema ""attacks"".",B

Pituitary adenomas range from small lesions that do not enlarge the gland to expansive tumors that erode the sella turcica and impinge on adjacent cranial structures. Adenomas smaller than 10 mm in diameter are referred to as microadenomas, and larger ones are termed macroadenomas. Microadenomas do not produce symptoms unless they secrete hormones. The mass effects of pituitary macroadenomas include impingement on the optic chiasm, often with bitemporal hemianopsia and loss of central vision, oculomotor palsies when the tumor invades the cavernous sinuses, and severe headaches. Large adenomas may invade the hypothalamus and lead to loss of temperature regulation, hyperphagia, and hormonal syndromes because they interfere with the normal hypothalamic input to the pituitary. Symptoms of acromegaly include characteristic facial changes, goiter, barrel chest, abnormal glucose tolerance, male sexual dysfunction, menstrual disorders in women, degenerative arthritis, peripheral neuropathy, and thickened skin.

All of the following are features of MEN 1 syndrome except: September 2007,Pancreatic tumor,Pituitary tumor,Hyperparathyroidism,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,"Ans. D: Medullary carcinoma of thyroid MEN-1/Wermer syndrome is characterized by abnormalities involving the parathyroid, pancreas and pituitary gland; thus the mnemonic device, the 3P's. Parathyroid-Hyperparathyroidism is present in 80-95% of patients. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most common manifestation: about 25% of patients have evidence of nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. In contrast to sporadic cases of hyperparathyroidism, diffuse hyperplasia or multiple adenomas are more common than solitary adenomas. Pancreas-Pancreatic islet cell tumors occur in 60 to 70% of patients. Tumors are usually multicentric. Multiple adenomas or diffuse islet cell hyperplasia commonly occurs; such tumors may arise from the small bowel rather than the pancreas. About 30% of tumors are malignant and have local or distant metastases. Malignant islet cell tumors due to MEN 1 syndrome often have a more benign course than do sporadically occurring malignant islet cell tumors. About 40% of islet cell tumors originate from a beta cell, secrete insulin (insulinoma), and can cause fasting hypoglycemia. Beta-Cell tumors are more common in patients < 40. About 60% of islet cell tumors originate from nonbeta-cell elements and tend to occur in patients > 40. Non-beta-cell tumors are somewhat more likely to be malignant Pituitary-Pituitary tumors occur in 15 to 42% of MEN 1 patients. From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of pituitary tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause galactorrhea and excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable from sporadically occurring acromegaly. About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, producing Cushing's disease. Most of the remainder are nonfunctional.",D
Which of the following drugs is both antiresoptiveand bone formative?,Strontium ranelate,Calcitonin,Ibadronate,Teriperatide,"Strontium Ranelate Osteoporosis is an abnormal decrease in amount orbone, but whatever left, is of normal quality. It results from bone loss due to age related changes in bone remodelling. In adult bones, remodelling is the principal metabolic skeletal process. - During remodelling the bone is ,first resorbed by osteoclasts and is then replaced by an equal amount of bone tissue due to action of osteoblasts. - This process of bone resorption and formation goes on throughout the adult life, and it serves two purposes. - To repair the microdamage within the skeleton. - To supply calcium. from the skeleton to maintain serum calcium. In young adult the resorbed bone is replaced by an equal amount of new bone tissue. Thus the mass of skeleton remains constant after peak bone mass in achieved in adulthood. However after the age of 35-40 the resorption and formation processes becomes imbalanced and resorption exceeds formation. - Excessive bone loss can be due to an increase in osteoclastic activity and or decrease in osteoblastic activity. Mechanism of action of Strontium Ranelate in the tit of osteoporosis. Strontium Ranelate increases bone mass throughout the skeleton. It appears to be modestly antiresorptive while at the same time not causing much decrease in bone fonnation. - Strontium is incorporated into hydroxyappatite replacing calcium, a feature that might explain some of its .fracture benefit. It is approved in several European countries for the t/ t of osteoporosis. Pharmacological agents used to manage osteoporosis either act by - Decreasing the rate of bone resorption (antiresorptive therapy.) - Promoting bone formation (anabolic therapy). Since bone remodelling is a coupled process, antiresorptive drugs ultimately decrease the rate of bone .formation and therefore do not promote substantial gains in BMD. ""Thus, Strontium renelate is unique because it decreases osteoclastosis as well as promote bone formation."" More on tit of osteoporosis Pharmacological treatment of osteoporosis is generally aimed at restoring bone strength and preventing .fractures. The long standing centrepiece of this approach has been antiresorptive drugs such as: ? - Biphosphonate - Estrogen - Selective estrogen receptor modulator, Raloxifene - Calcitonin Until recently, antiresorptive drugs were the only drugs approved in the United States ,for treating osteoporosis. This situation changed in 2002 when FDA approved Teriparatide (the biologically active PTH fragment). Teriparatide acts by increasing the bone mass - Because teriparatide stimulates bone formation whereas biphosphonates reduce bone resorption, it was predicted that therapy combining the two would enhance the effect on bone marrow density more than treatment with either one alone. - However addition of teriparatide to alendronate provided no additional bebefit for bone mass density. Before the advent of strontium Ranelate there was'nt any drug which combined the two processes i.e., increasing bone formation and at the same time, decreasing bone resorption. Strontium Ranelate has a novel mechanism of action for an osteoporotic drug as it acts on bone resorption to reduce the rate of hone growth but also acts on bone formation promoting the growth of new bone. More on antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis: Biphosphonates Alendronate,Pamidronctte Most effective drugs currently approved for prevention and t/t of osteoporosis. They suppress bone resorption at doses that do not inhibit mineralization. Thiazide diuretics They are not strictly antiresorptive but they reduce urinary Cat` excretion and constrain bone loss in patients with hypercalciurea. Estrogen There is an unambiguous relationship between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis. Post menopausal status or estrogen deficiency at any stage significantly increases patient's risk.for osteoporosis. Selective Estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) These are estrogenic compounds with tissue selective activities. Raloxifene (SERM) acts as an estrogen agonist on bone and liver and is inactive on the uterus. Calcitonin Calcitonin inhibits oteoclastic bone resorption.",A

It may : ? Begins insdiously without acute inflammation (more common). or Follows acute inflammation, when the injurious stimulus is persistent. Chronic inflammation is characterized by A. Mononuclear cell infiltration The macrophages are the major cells involved in chronic inflammation. Macrophages are derived from monocytes i.e., when these cell circulate in the blood, they are known as monocytes and when they come out from the circulation and become pa of the tissue, they are called macrophages. Macrophage accumulation persists in chronic inflammation by following mechanisms. Recruitment of monocyte from the circulation (most common). Local proliferation of the macrophages. Immobilization of macrophages at the site of inflammation. Other cells involved in chronic inflammation are plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells. B. Tissue destruction The products of activated macrophages serve to eliminate injurious agents such as microbes and to initiate the process of repair. These mediators also cause tissue injury because some of these are toxic to host cells, (reactive oxygen species) or extracellular matrix (proteases) and a variety of other substances may contribute to tissue damage in chronic inflammation.

Then what is the difference between formation of normal hemostatic plug and thrombosis ? o When a blood vessel is injured, the body uses platelet and fibrin to form a blood clot as the first step to prevent blood loss --> hemostasis. o If that mechanism causes too much doting, a thrombus is formed i.e., exaggeration of hemostatic process leads to thrombus formation. o In other terms, hemostasis is a self limited process i.e., there is spontaneous resolution of hemostatic plug with subsequent repair of the injury, while thrombosis is not self limited and the thrombotic clot does not undergo resolution spontaneously rather it causes obstruction to blood flow. o Thrombosis may occur without injury (e.g., in hypercoagulable state), while hemostatic plug is formed only after injury. Pathogenesis of thrombosis o Thrombosis is caused by abnormalities in one or more of the following three (Virchow's triad) :? Vascular (endothelial) injury. Abnormal blood flow (stasis or turbulence). Blood hypercoagulability. How do these mechanisms lead to thrombosis? o Endothelial injury with formation of clot has already been explained earlier. o Blood hypercoagulability, as the name suggests, there is increase tendency of clot formation due to alteration in coagulation pathway that predisposes to thrombus. It may occur in many primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired) conditions. o Disturbances in blood flow Stasis Stasis is the major factor in the development of venous thrombus. Turbulence contributes to aerial and cardiac thrombosis. Normal blood flow is laminar such that the platelets flow centrally in the vessel lumen, separated from the endothelium by a slower-moving clear zone of plasma. Stasis and turbulence leads to thrombosis by ? Disruption of laminar flow brings platelets into contact with endothelium. Prevent dilution of activated clotting factors by fresh flowing blood. Retard the inflow of clotting factor inhibitors. Turbulence can cause endothelial injury or dysfunction.",D

Methotrexate resistance is due to :,Depletion of folate,Overproduction of DHFRase,Overproduction of thymidylate kinase,Decreased DHFRase,"Mechanisms of pharmacokinetic and cellular resistance to methotrexate. Metabolism of methotrexate in the liver to paly inactive 7-hydroxymethotrexate reduces plasma concentrations of methotrexate and creates competition for cellular uptake RFC, which also internalizes reduced folates and folic acid, although with low affinity for the latter. Folate receptors mediate low affinity endocytosis of methotrexate. Quantitative or qualitative alterations in RFCs or folate-receptor expression confer transpo-related resistance to methotrexate, as do high levels of exogenous folates competing for cell entry. Intracellularly, methotrexate is metabolized to polyglutamated forms by FPGS, and these are broken down by FPGH. The monoglutamated forms and, to some extent, polyglutamated forms are expelled transpoers ABCC1-ABCC5 and ABCG2. ABCB1 does not transpo anionic drugs such as methotrexate. Polyglutamated forms of methotrexate can inhibit several key enzymes in folate metabolism, such as DHFR and TS, preventing de novo purine biosynthesis by APFase and AICAFase. Enzyme inhibition, folate depletion, and direct or indirect effects on cytokine release signaling pathways (such as those mediated by NFkB and IKK) all create routes which methotrexate could suppress RA.

"Wof are anti diabetic agents that acts by increasing insulin sensitivity, and so should be euglycemics",Phenformin,Pioglitazone,Sitagliptin,Liraglutide,"Thiazolidinedione (PPARg agonist) Pioglitazone:- Only one thiazolidinedione Pioglitazone is currently available. Mech of action:- This class of oral antidiabetic drugs are selective agonists for the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) which is expressed mainly in fat cells, but also in muscle and some other cells. It enhances the transcription of several insulin responsive genes. Glitazones tend to reverse insulin resistance by enhancing GLUT4 expression and translocation. Entry of glucose into muscle and fat is improved. Hepatic gluconeo- genesis is also suppressed. Activation of genes regulating fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis in adipose tissue contributes to the insulin sensitizing action. Lipolysis and plasma fatty acid levels are reduced. Adipocyte turnover and differentiation is accelerated by glitazones. Thus, fatty tissue is a major site of their action. Improved glycaemic control results inlowering of circulating HbA1C and insulin levels in type 2 DM patients. Pioglitazone, in addition, lowers serum triglyceride level and raises HDL level without much change in LDL level, probably because it acts on PPARa as well to induce expression of reverse cholesterol transpoer and some apoproteins.

The stromal component can contain metaplastic components such as cailage and bone. Interestingly, usually only the epithelial component metastasizes. Endolymphatic stromal myosis is a type of endometrial stromal tumor of intermediate malignancy. It appears as small pieces of stroma between myometrial bundles that infiltrate lymph channels. Patients may have pain or bleeding, or may be asymptomatic. Recurrences happen late in the course of the disease (years) in half of patients and metastasis occurs in 15%. There is no epithelial component, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial carcinoma is a malignancy of the epithelial glandular component of the endometrium. Abnormal bleeding is the usual presentation. High estrogen states cause this tissue to proliferate. There is no stromal component of this tumor, so this is an incorrect choice. Endometrial stromal sarcoma is a true sarcoma arising from the endometrial stroma that infiltrates the myometrium and invades vessels. There is no epithelial component. Ref: DeUgae C.M. (2013).

Differential expression of same gene depending on parent of origin is referred to as,Genomic imprinting,Mosaicism,Anticipation,Nonpenetrance,"It has now been established that functional differences exist between the paternal and the maternal copies of some genes. These differences arise from an epigenetic process called genomic imprinting, whereby ceain genes are differentially ""inactivated"" during paternal and maternal gametogenesis. Maternal imprinting refers to transcriptional silencing of the maternal allele, whereas paternal imprinting implies that the paternal allele is inactivated. At the molecular level, imprinting is associated with methylation of the gene promoter, as well as related events such asmodification of DNA-binding histone proteins, the sum total effect of which is to silence the gene.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Carcinoid heart disease",Hyperparathyroidism,Infective endocarditis,Mitral annular calcification,Rheumatic heart disease,"Mitral annular calcification is often an incidental finding on chest radiograph, echocardiography, or at autopsy. Larger accumulations of calcium in the mitral ring can impinge on the conduction system, however, causing arrhythmias or disrupting the endocardium to provide a focus for infective endocarditis and thrombus formation (which can embolize and cause a stroke, as in this patient). Some cases are associated with mitral valve prolapse. Carcinoid heart disease leads to endocardial and valvular collagenous thickening. Hyperparathyroidism can cause metastatic calcification, which usually does not involve the heart, and deposits would not be so focal; this patient does not have hypercalcemia. Infective endocarditis is a destructive process, and healing may lead to fibrosis, but not to nodular calcium deposition. The most common infiltrative cardiomyopathies are hemochromatosis and amyloidosis. Rheumatic heart disease can lead to scarring with some calcium deposition, but the valve leaflets undergo extensive scarring, with shortening and thickening of the chordae tendineae that preclude upward prolapse. Senile calcific stenosis involves the aortic valve; in this case, there is no evidence of stenosis.",D

Not seen in SLE affected kidney?,Lipoid nephrosis,Focal Glomerulonephritis,Diffuse Glomerulonephritis,Membranous Glomerulonephritis,"Renal manifestations in SLE (Lupus nephritis)

 Nephritis is the most serious manifestation of SLE and renal failure is the most common cause of death in SLE.
Findings of SLE nephropathy are called as full house phenomenon.

A. Glomerular diseases

WHO classification lupus nephritis is as follows

1) Class I (minimal or no detectable abnormalities)

It has the best prognosis.

2) Class II (Mesangial lupus GN or mesangial proliferative)

Characterized by mesangial cell proliferation and lack of involvement of glomerular capillary wall. Glomerular mesangial deposits of immunoglobulin and complement are the earliest feature and are found in all types of lupus nephritis.

3) Class III (focal proliferative GN)

There are subendothelial deposits. Granular deposits also occur in mesangium as occur in all forms of lupus nephritis.

4) Class IV (Diffuse proliferative GN)

It is the most common type of lupus nephritis with the worst prognosis. It is characterized by wire loop lesions. There are subendothelial deposits with granular deposits in the mesangium.

5) Class V (Membranous GN)

There is widespread thickening of the capillary wall with subepithelial deposits and granular deposits in the mesangium.

6) Class VI (Sclerosing nephritis)

There is global necrosis of nearly all glomerular capillaries.
Wire loop lesions are seen most commonly in diffuse proliferative (class IV), but may also be seen in class III (focal proliferative) and class V (membranous) GN.

B. Tubulointerstitial disease

AA amyloid chain is found in-,Multiple myeloma,Rheumatoid ahritis,Gout,None.,"The AA (amyloid-associated) fibril is a unique nonimmunoglobulin protein derived from a larger (12-kDa)serum precursor called SAA (serum amyloid-associated) protein that is synthesized in the liver. SAA is synthesized by liver cells under the influence of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 that are produced during inflammation; thus, long-standing inflammation leads to elevated SAA levels, and ultimately the AA form of amyloid deposits. However, increased production of SAA by itself is not sufficient for the deposition of amyloid. Elevation of serum SAA levels is common to inflammatory states but in most instances does not lead to amyloidosis. There are two possible explanations for this. According to one view, SAA normally is degraded to soluble end products by the action of monocyte-derived enzymes. Conceivably, people who develop amyloidosis have an enzyme defect that results in incomplete breakdown of SAA, thus generating insoluble AA molecules. Alternatively, a genetically determined structural abnormality in the SAA molecule itself renders it resistant to degradation by macrophages . Robbins 9 th edition page no. 153",D

Chloroquine is given in high loading dose because of:,High volume of distribution,Poor GIT absorption,High first pass metabolism,All,"Pharmacokinetics :Oral absorption of chloroquine is excellent. About 50% gets bound in the plasma. It has high affinity for melanin and nuclear chromatin: gets tightly bound to these tissue constituents and is concentrated in liver, spleen, kidney, lungs (several hundred-fold), skin, leucocytes and some other tissues. Its selective accumulation in retina is responsible for the ocular toxicity seen with prolonged use. Absorption after i.m. injection is also good. Chloroquine is paly metabolized by liver and slowly excreted in urine. The early plasma tYz varies from 3-10 days. Because of tight tissue binding, small amounts persist in the body with a terminal Ph of 1-2 months. ESSENTIALS OF PHARMACOLOGY page no 822",A

This technique of staining is used to detect,Peripheral blood reticulocytes,Heinz bodies,Coarse basophilic stippling,Globin chain inclusions in sever - thalassemia,"A routine Wright-Giemsa stain of peripheral blood detects coarse basophilic stippling, which is pathognomonic for lead poisoning. In general, basophilic stippling refers to clumps of blue-staining ribosomes, most often seen in anemias with defects in hemoglobin synthesis (e.g., iron deficiency, the thalassemias, lead poisoning). The ribosomal clumps in lead poisoning are large because of the inactivation by lead of ribonuclease, which normally breaks down the ribosomes. In addition, a routine Wright-Giemsa stain specifically identifies Howell-Jolly bodies (nuclear remnants), malarial pigments, marrow reticulocytes (polychromatic cells or shift cells with a bluish-gray discoloration), and intraerythrocytic parasites (malaria, babesiosis).

"On Stopping Alcohol, all the following changes are reversible EXCEPT",Hepatitis,Cirrhosis,Microvesicular fatty change,Macrovesicular fatty change,"Alcoholic steatofibrosis. Alcoholic hepatitis is often accom- panied by prominent activation of sinusoidal stellate cells and poal fibroblasts, giving rise to fibrosis. Fibrosis begins with sclerosis of central veins. Perisinusoidal scar then accumulates in the space of Disse of the centrilobular region, spreading outward, encircling individual or small clusters of hepatocytes in a chicken wire fence pattern (Fig. 18-19). These webs of scar eventually link to poal tracts and then begin to condense into central-poal fibrous septa. With developing nodularity, cirrhosis becomes established. When alcohol use continues without interruption over the long term, the continual subdivision of established nodules by new webs of, perisinusoidal scarring leads to a classic micronodular or Laennec cirrhosis first described for end-stage alcoholic liver disease (Fig. 18-21). Early stages of scarring can regress with cessation of alcohol use, but the faher along toward cirrhosis the liver gets, the more vascular derangements prevent a full restoration of normal.

Which of the following about phenytoin is true,It follows zero order kinetics,Not a hepatic enzyme inducer,It is excreted unchanged in urine,It is not teratogenic,"It follows zero order kinetics [Ref KDT 6th/e p. 403-405J There are three pharmacokinetic characteristic of phenytoin: -- Marked binding to serum protein - Nonlinearity of its elimination kinetics (1t.follows saturation kinetics) - Metabolism by the CY P'S Phenytoin follows saturation kinetics: ? - At their therapeutic concentrations most of the drugs occupy only a small fraction of their metabolizing sites so their metabolic rate increases as the drug concentration increase. - In such cases the metabolic rate of the drug is a constant fraction of the drug present in the body (rather than a constant amount of drug/h) i.e., the drug has a specific half life. This is.first order kinetics. For example If the concentration of the drug is 500 mg at time zero - After metabolism at 1 hr the drug concentration would be -4250mg - After metabolism at 2hr the drug concentration would be 125 mg However - When most of the enzymes are occupied metabolism occurs at a maximal rate i.e., it is saturated and does not change in propoion to the drug concentration i.e., a fixed amount of drug is metabolized per unit time. This is zero order kinetics. For example - Drug concentration at time zero --> 500 mg - After metabolism at 1 hr --> 450 mg - After metabolism at 2 hr --> 400 mg As the drug concentration increases metabolic sites and their metabolism shifts from first order to zero order. The drug whose kinetic changes from first order to zero at therapeutic concentration are said to follow zero? order kinetics saturation kinetics now small increase in drug dose produces marked side effects. - Phenvtoin is one of the few drug whose elimination varies as a function of its concentration i.e., the rate is nonlinear, as the drug concentration increases the kinetics shift to zero order. Phenytoin is hydroxylated extensively in the liver and this process becomes saturated at about doses needed for therapeutic effects. - Thus phenytoin at low doses exhibit. - First order kinetics - As the therapeutic concentration increases - Zero order kinetic develops. - Now a small increment in dose produces dispropoionate rise in steady state plasma concentration. - Thus dose increments should become smaller as the dose increased. Enzyme induction and inhibition We have seen above that the metabolism of phenytoin is saturable i.e., the enzymes metabolizing it gets saturated. - Because its metabolism is saturable, the other drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes can inhibit the metabolism of phenytoin and increase its concentration. Conversely the degradation rate of other drugs that are substrates for these enzymes can be inhibited by phenytoin. One such drug is warfarin - And addition of phenytoin to a patient receiving warfarin can lead to bleeding disorders. Another mechanism for drug interaction in phenytoin:- It arises from phenytoins ability to induce diverse CYPs. -Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic enzymes that metabolize other drugs. - Coadministration of phenytoin and medication metabolized by these enzymes can lead to an increased degradation of such medication. - Of paicular note in this regard are oral contraceptive. - Treatment with phenytoin could enhance the metabolism of oral contraceptives and lead to unplanned pregnancy. Phenytoin is highly bound to proteins (90%) mainly albumin - Small variations in the percentage of phenytoin that is bound dramatically affect the absolute amount of free (active) drug. Therefore increased propoion of free drug are evident in Patients with hypoalbuminemia, uremic patients and neonates. TeratoRenic effects of phenytoin The total plasma level decreases when the percentage that is bound decreases as in uremia or hypoalbuminemia. Phenytoin is metabolized to Arene oxide compound that is responsible for its teratogenic effect (Fetal hydantion syndrome) :- - Hypoplastic phalanges - Cleft palate - Hair lip - Microcephaly",A

Most commonly used cholinesterase regenerator at NM junction is ?,Pralidoxime,Obidxime,Diacetyl monoxime,Edrophonium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Pralidoxime Pralidoxime is most commonly used cholinesterase reactivater. OXIMES Oximes Pralidoxime 2-PAM, obidoxime and diacetyl-monoxime (DAM)] are used in organophosphate poisoning. o Oximes acts by reactivating cholinesterase enzyme. Mechanism of action In organophosphate poisoning esteratic site of cholinesterase is phosphorylated and anionic site is free. Phosphorylated cholinesterase reacts very slowly with water. However, if more reactive OH groups in the form of oximes are provided, reactivation occurs more than a million time faster. Oximes attach to anionic site and provide more reactive OH groups. Oximes are ineffective in Carbamates poisoning. Pralidoxime is contraindicated in carbamates poisoning, because not only it does not reactivate carbamylated enzyme, it has weak anti-chE activity of its own. Remember Obidoxime is more potent than pralidoxime. Pralidoxime and obidoxime are lipid insoluble, while diacetyl-monoxime (DAM) is lipid soluble so it can cross BBB and regenerate AChE in brain. Atropine is used in both organophosphate and carbamate anticholinesterase poisoning.",A

Physical examination shows pallor, diaphoresis, and a murmur of aortic regurgitation. An ECG does not show myocardial infarction. An X-ray film of the chest reveals mediastinal widening. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial endocarditis,Dissecting aneurysm,Pericarditis,Pulmonary thromboembolism,"Aortic dissection reflects hemorrhage between and along the laminar planes of the media, with the formation of a blood-filled channel within the aortic wall. If it begins in the ascending aorta, it may extend backward toward the aortic valve or distally to involve the thoracic and abdominal aorta. More than 90% of dissections occur in men between the ages of 40 and 60 with antecedent hypertension. The second major group of patients, usually younger, has a systemic or localized abnormality of connective tissue that affects the aorta (e.g., Marfan syndrome).

A 57-year-old man is staed on heparin therapy after being diagnosed with a small pulmonary embolism. The anticoagulant effect of this medication would be most appropriately assessed by which of the following laboratory values?,Activated paial thromboplastin time,Bleeding time,Complete blood count,International normalized ratio,"Heparin is often administered to individuals diagnosed with acute embolism or thrombosis by continuous IV infusion at a rate sufficient to raise the activated paial thromboplastin time (APTT) to 1.5-2 times the control value. In other words, the anticoagulant effect of heparin should be continually monitored to ensure that the patient's APTT does not exceed 1.5-2 times the control value. If the control APTT value is exceeded, the risk for internal bleeding can substantially increase. The bleeding time is a measure of platelet function and correlates well with the propensity to bleed. A complete blood count is a measure of all the cell components contained in the blood, e.g., the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Both the international normalized ratio (INR) and prothrombin time (PT) are used to monitor the anticoagulant effect of coumarin anticoagulants, such as warfarin. Coumarin anticoagulants are dosed to raise the PT to 1.5-3.5 times the control value. However, the thromboplastins used to monitor PT values vary among institutions, leading to different control values and subsequently different levels of anticoagulation for a given patient. In other words, there is no absolute consistency for a PT value taken at two different hospitals. Therefore, INR values are commonly used because the INR at one institution will equal that at another.",A
Digoxin acts by inhibiting:,Na K ATPase,Ca channel,K channel,Adenyl cyclase,"Ans: a (Na K ATPase) Ref: Tripathi, 6th ed, p. 499All cardiac glycosides are potent and highly selective inhibitors of the active transport of Na+ and K+ across cell membranes by their reversible binding to the alpha subunit of the. Na+, K+- ATPase the elimination 11 /2 for digoxin is 36 hours in patients with nonnal renal function. Digoxin is excreted by the kidney with a clearance rate that is proportional to the glomerular filtration rate. It is now recommended that digoxin be reserved for patients with heart failure who are in atrial fibrillation, or for patients in sinus rhythm who remain symptomatic despite maximal therapy with ACE inhibitors and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists. Although the drug has no net effect on mortality, it reduces hospitalization and death, from progressive heart failure at the expense of an increase in sudden death.Other than heart failure digitalis is useful in the management of atrial arrhythmias because of its cardioselective parasympathomimetic effects. In atrial flutter and fibrillation, the depressant effect of the drug on atrioventricular conduction will help control an excessively high ventricular rate. Digitalis has also been used in the control of paroxysmal atrial and atrioventricular nodal tachycardia.ToxicityExtracardiacAnorexia, nausea, vomiting are usually first symptoms of toxicity. Other complaints include fatigue, malaise, headache, mental confusion, restlessness, disorientation, psychosis and visual disturbances.CardiacAlmost every type of arrhythmia can be produced by digitalis: pulsus bigeminis, nodal and ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Partial to complete A-V block, severe bradycardia.Atrial extra systoles, AF or atrial flutter have also been noted.Treatmenta) For tachyarrythmias:KC1 infusion 20 m mol /hr IV or give orally in mild cases.b) For ventricular arrythmias: Lidocaine IV repeated as required is the drug of choice.c) For supraventricular arrythmias: Propranolol may be given IV or oral depending on urgencyd) For A-V block and bradycardia: Atropine 0.6-1.2 mg IM may help: otherwise cardiac pacing is recommended.Therapy of toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug.Immunotherapy with purified Fab fragments from bovine antidigoxin antisera (DIGIBIND) provides an effective antidote for lifethreatening digoxin toxicity.Precautions and contraindicationsHypokalaemia:enhances digitalis toxicityby increasing its binding to Na+ K+ATPase elderly, renal or severe hepatic disease Myocardial infarction: sever arrythmias are more likely thyrotoxicosis-reduces responsiveness to digitalis.Myxedema: these patienst eliminate digoxin more slowly, toxicity can appearVentricular tachycardia:digitalis is contraindicated, may precipitate ventricular fibrillationIt is explicitly contraindicated in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation",A

What is the appropriate diagnosis?",Atrial septal defect,"Coarctation of aorta, postductal","Coarctation of aorta, preductal",Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot is defined by four anatomic changes: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. It is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, accounting for 10% of all congenital heart defects. Cyanosis appears shortly after birth or in early infancy due to right-to-left shunting of venous blood from the right ventricle into the dextroposed aorta. The aorta overrides the ventricular septal defect and receives blood from both ventricles. Narrowing of the pulmonary artery impedes the entry of blood into the lung, thereby increasing the pressure in the right ventricle. None of the other choices exhibit this particular constellation of congenital heart defects.Diagnosis: Tetralogy of Fallot",D

This abnormality refers to a characteristic chromosomal translocation that involves the oncogene",bcl-2 erb-B,c-abl,c-myc,erb-B,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is one of the four chronic myeloproliferative disorders, but, unlike myeloid metaplasia or polycythemia vera, CML is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22) in over 90% of cases. This characteristic translocation, which involves the oncogene c-abl on chromosome 9 and the breakpoint cluster region on chromosome 22, results in the formation of a new fusion protein (P210) that is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. In differentiating CML from a leukemoid reaction, several other features are impoant in addition to the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome: lack of alkaline phosphatase in granulocytes, increased basophils and eosinophils in the peripheral blood, and, often, increased platelets in early stages followed by thrombocytopenia in late or blast stages. Other well-known features of CML include marked splenomegaly, leukocyte counts greater than 50,000/uL, and mild anemia. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",B

Heinz bodies are seen in: September 2006,G-6-PD deficiency,Sickle cell disease,Hereditary spherocytosis,PNH,"Ans. A: G-6-PD deficiencyHeinz bodies are inclusions within red blood cells composed of denatured hemoglobin.Heinz bodies are formed by damage to the hemoglobin component molecules, usually through oxidations, or the change of an internal amino acid residue(from an inherited mutation), which causes the damaged molecules to, often degrade and then precipitate, damaging the cell membrane by hydrophobically adsorbing to it thereby increasing cell permeability, leading to premature cell lysis.Damaged cells are attacked by macrophages in the spleen, where the precipitate and damaged membrane are removed, leading to characteristic ""bite cells"". The denaturing process is irreversible and the continual elimination of damaged cells leads to Heinz body anemia.G6PD deficiency brought on by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., primaquine, dapsone, quinidine) also can result in Heinz bodies.",A

Earliest manifestation of megaloblastic anaemia is,Macrocytosis,Hypersegmented neutrophils,Basophilic stippling,Cabot ring,"What Are the Symptoms of Megaloblastic Anemia? shoness of breath. muscle weakness. abnormal paleness of the skin. glossitis (swollen tongue) loss of appetite/weight loss. diarrhea. nausea. fast heabeat MORPHOLOGY Ceain morphologic features are common to all forms of megaloblastic anemia. The bone marrow is markedly hyper- cellular and contains numerous megaloblastic erythroid pro- genitors. Megaloblasts are larger than normal erythroid progenitors (normoblasts) and have delicate, finely reticu- lated nuclear chromatin (indicative of nuclear immaturity) (Fig. 11-11). As megaloblasts differentiate and acquire hemo- globin, the nucleus retains its finely distributed chromatin and fails to undergo the chromatin clumping typical of normo- blasts. The granulocytic precursors also demonstrate nuclear- cytoplasmic asynchrony, yielding giant metamyelocytes. Megakaryocytes may also be abnormally large and have bizarre multilobed nuclei. In the peripheral blood the earliest change is the appear- ance of hypersegmented neutrophils, which appear before the onset of anemia. Normal neutrophils have three or four nuclear lobes, but in megaloblastic anemias they often have five or more. The red cells typically include large, egg- shaped macro-ovalocytes; the mean cell volume often is greater than 110 fL (normal, 82 to 92 fL). Although macro- cytes appear hyperchromic, in reality the mean cell hemoglo- bin concentration is normal. Large, misshapen platelets also may be seen. Morphologic changes in other systems, espe- cially the gastrointestinal tract, also occur, giving rise to some of the clinical manifestations. Refer robbins 9/e pg 422",B

A female has hypopigmented lesion on centre of fore-head. Drug responsible is?,Hydroquinone,Ether metabolite of hydroquinone,Para teiary butyl catechol,Para teiary butyl phenol,"Phenol (Carbolic acid)- It is one of the earliest used antiseptics and still the standard for comparing other germicides. It is a relatively weak agent (static at 0.2%, cidal at > 1%, poor action on bacterial spores). It is a general protoplasmic poison, injuring microbes and tissue cells alike-at higher concentrations causes skin burns and is caustic. It acts by disrupting bacterial membranes and denaturing bacterial proteins. Organic matter diminishes its action slightly while alkalies and soaps do so profoundly (carbolic soaps are not more germicidal than the soap itself). It is now seldom employed as an antiseptic, but being cheap, it is used to disinfect urine, feces, pus, sputum of patients and is sometimes included in antipruritic preparations because of its mild local anesthetic action.

Buerger's Disease is associated with -,Alcoholism,Smoking,Trauma,Cold environment,"Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) 

Thromboangiitis obliterans is a distinctive disease that is characterized by segmental, thrombosing acute and chronic inflammation of medium-sized and small-sized arteries, and sometimes secondarily extending to veins and nerves.
Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs almost exclusively among heavy-cigarette-smoking persons.
It is more common in men but the incidence is increasing in women because of increasing smoking habit in women.
Buerger disease is associated with HLA -5 and HLA-A9.
In thromboangiitis obliterans there is acute and chronic segmental inflammation of vessels with accompanied thrombosis in the lumen.
Typically, the thrombus contains microabscesses with a central focus of neutrophils surrounded by granulomatous inflammation.
Later, the inflammatory process extends into contiguous veins and nerves and in time all three structures (arteries, veins and nerves) become encased in fibrous tissue, a characteristic that is very rare with another form of vasculitis.

Clinical manifestations

Thrombangiitis obliterans affects vessels of upper and lower extremities.
Symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency, i.e. Ischemia of toes, feet and fingers that can lead to ulcer and frank gangrene.
Due to neural involvement, there may be severe pain, even at rest.

Buerger disease Vs atherosclerosis

Buerger disease is almost exclusively associated with smoking. Atherosclerosis is also associated with smoking, but it has other predisposing conditions also, e.g. diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia etc.
Burger disease affects smaller arteries. Atherosclerosis involves larger and medium-sized arteries.
In Atherosclerosis, pain occurs on movement due to vascular insufficiency, while in Buerger disease, pain occurs at rest also due to neural involvement.",B

All of the following are B cell markers except -,CD 10,CD 19,CD 20,CD 34,"Answer is option 4, CD34 CD34 is a transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein, first identified on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Clinically, it is associated with the selection and enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow transplants. Due to these historical and clinical associations, CD34 expression is almost ubiquitously related to hematopoietic cells, and it is a common misconception that CD34-positive (CD34+) cells in nonhematopoietic samples represent hematopoietic contamination. The prevailing school of thought states that multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) do not express CD34.

Type of necrosis occuring in brain?,Coagulative,Liquefactive,Fibrinoid,Caseous,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Liquefactive Coagulative necrosis This is most common type of necrosis. This type of necrosis is most frequently caused by sudden cessation of blood flow (ischemia) in organs such as hea (MI), Kidney (ATN), adrenal gland, and spleen. Note : Brain is the only exception, i.e.,. It is the only solid organ in which ischemia leads to liquifactive necrosis not coagulative necrosis. It is also seen with other types of injury e.g., liver necrosis in viral hepatitis, Coagulative necrosis of skin after burns (Thermal injury). Why there is predominant protein denaturation and no enzymatic digestion ? Hypoxia causes intracellular acidosis (has been explained earlier) .1, pH results in denaturation of proteins which includes not only structural proteins but also enzymes --) So, there is no enzymatic digestion. The necrotic cells retain their cellular outline for several days. Liquefactive necrosis It is the necrotic degradation of tissue that rapidly undergo softening and liquefaction because of the action of hydrolytic enzymes. It occurs after Infection i.e., suppurative inflammation (most common). Ischemic necrosis in brain. Note : Brain lacks any substantial suppoive stroma, so ischemic necrosis in brain is liquifactive unlike other organs where it is coagulative. Mechanism of liquefactive necrosis --> Microbes stimulates accumulation of inflammatory cells and these cells release lysosomal enzymes. Caseous necrosis It is a variant of coagulative necrosis. It is most commonly encountered when cell death is attributable to ceain organisms e.g., mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and fungi (Histoplasma, Coccidioidomycosis). Why is it called caseous necrosis, not coagulative necrosis ? In contrast to coagulative necrosis where tissue architecture is maintained, in caseous necrosis, the tissue architecture is completely obliterated. So, it has been called caseous because of its cheesy white appearance of the area of necrosis.",B

The largest gene expressed in cardiac and smooth muscle is,Dystrophin gene,Semiphorin gene,Tumor suppressor gene,Huntington gene,"DMD, the largest known human gene, provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is located primarily in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in hea (cardiac) muscle. Small amounts of dystrophin are present in nerve cells in the brain. In skeletal and cardiac muscles, dystrophin is pa of a group of proteins (a protein complex) that work together to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax. The dystrophin complex acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The dystrophin complex may also play a role in cell signaling by interacting with proteins that send and receive chemical signals. Little is known about the function of dystrophin in nerve cells. Research suggests that the protein is impoant for the normal structure and function of synapses, which are specialized connections between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.",A

"In the beginning of resuscitation effos, 0.5 mg of epinephrine is administered subcutaneously. Which adrenergic receptors, in which tissues, are responsible for the beneficial effect of epinephrine in this patient?","Alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, alpha-2 receptors in the hea, and beta-1 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle","Alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, alpha-2 receptors at presynaptic nerve terminals, beta-1 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle","Alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, beta-1 receptors in the hea, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle",Alpha-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle and beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle,"Epinephrine is a non selective adrenergic agonist and a valuable resuscitative drug because of its effects at multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. In the treatment of anaphylaxis, epinephrine increases myocardial contractility, accelerates hea rate, causes constriction of vascular smooth muscle, and causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. The principal pharmacologic effects of epinephrine that are beneficial in anaphylaxis are mediated : alpha-1 receptors in vascular smooth muscle, resulting in vasoconstriction, beta-1 receptors in the hea, resulting in increased contractility, and beta-2 receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, resulting in relaxation and relief of bronchoconstriction. (One simple mnemonic for the respective locations of beta1 and beta2 receptors is ""one hea, two lungs."") Beta-2 receptors are also found, however, in vascular smooth muscle (especially in skeletal muscle beds), were, just as in bronchial smooth muscle, they promote relaxation. (Epinephrine dilates skeletal muscle vascular beds to maximize oxygen delivery for the ""fight-or-flight"" response.) The resulting vasodilation in skeletal muscle vascular beds would, by itself, tend to decrease blood pressure, which might tend to worsen the effects of anaphylactic shock, but this effect is mitigated by the intense alpha-1 receptor stimulation, causing vasoconstriction in multiple beds. The principal action of alpha-2 receptors is at the presynaptic nerve terminal, where receptor stimulation reduces the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminal. Epinephrine does stimulate these receptors, but it does not really contribute to the beneficial actions of epinephrine in resuscitation. Alpha-2 receptors are not located in the hea (except at presynaptic nerve terminals), alpha-2 receptors do not have a significant beneficial effect in resuscitation, and beta-1 receptors are not located in bronchial smooth muscle, but are located in the hea. Beta-1 receptors are located in the hea, not in bronchial smooth muscle. The adrenergic receptor that produces bronchial smooth muscle relaxation is beta-2. Alpha-2 receptors are located primarily at presynaptic nerve terminals, and because the beta-2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cause vasodilation, this not a helpful effect of epinephrine in this case. Also Know: Epinephrine is indicated for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions and acute asthma exacerbations. It is considered a first-line agent in the treatment of cardiac arrest (i.e., pulseless ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, asystole, and pulseless electrical activity). Epinephrine also causes bronchodilation and antagonizes the effects of histamine. Epinephrine significantly increases myocardial oxygen consumption and thus can exacerbate ventricular irritability in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Extravasation causes necrosis and sloughing, and requires prompt infiltration of the affected area with phentolamine. Ref: Miller B.A., Clements E.A. (2011). Chapter 24.

All are seen in malignant hypeension except?,Fibrinoid necrosis,Hyaline aeriolosclerosis,Necrotizing glomerulonephritis,Hyperplastic aeriolosclerosis,"Malignant hypeension, defined as blood pressure usually greater than 200/120 mm Hg, is far less common in the United States than so-called ""benign"" hypeension and occurs in only about 5% of persons with elevated blood pressure. It may arise de novo (i.e., without preexisting hypeension), or it may appear suddenly in a person who had mild hypeension. Pathogenesis The basis for this turn for the worse in hypeensive subjects is unclear, but the following sequence is suggested: The initialevent seems to be some form of vascular damage to the kidneys. This most commonly results from long-standing hypeension, with eventual injury to the aeriolar walls. The result is increased permeability of the small vessels to fibrinogen and other plasma proteins, endothelial injury, and platelet deposition. This leads to the appearance of fibrinoidnecrosis of aerioles and small aeries and intravascular thrombosis. Mitogenic factors from platelets (e.g., platelet derived growth factor) and plasma cause intimal hyperplasia of vessels, resulting in the hyperplastic aeriolosclerosistypical of organizing injury of malignant hypeension and of morphologically similar thrombotic microangiopathies (seelater) and fuher narrowing of the lumina.

Telomerase -,RNA polymerase,Causes carcinogenesis,Present in somatic cells,Absent in germ cells,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Causes carcinogenesis o Telomerase is a DNA polymerase (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) which is present in germ cells and is absent from most somatic cells.o Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.o After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state.# Haw does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide furtherCells achieve this through telomer shorteningo Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends.o It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability- to chromosomes.With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers.o Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest.o The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis.o P53 causes activation of CDK inhibitor p21 that inactivate cyclin D-CDK4 complex so that cell can not cross restriction point and can not enter into 'S'phase.o Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division.How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life ???o In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telom erase,o Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer.o it is RNA dependent DMA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of teiomeric sequence.o This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the ceil cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability' of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis offinite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively ????o In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours.o Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells.",B

Ham test is done for -,PNH,Megaloblastic anemia,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,"Diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

Until recently the diagnosis of P.N.H was based on special tests that were based on the principle that P.N.H red cells are susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. These tests are :

HAM Test

Ham's acidified serum test is one of the screening tests for P.N.H. Patient's red cells gets lysed in an acidic pH in the presence of complement.

Sucrose Test

Red cells lyse on the addition of sucrose and complement in the medium.
Addition of sucrose decreases the ionic strength.
But now the diagnosis of P.N.H depends upon analyzing the expression G.P.I—AP on the hematopoietic stem cells using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. The simplest method is to analyze the expression of CD59 on erythrocytes.

Xenobiotics are metabolized to ?,Increase water solubility,Increase lipid solubility,Make them nonpolar,None of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increase water solubility BIOTRANSFORMATION (METABOLISM) Most of the drugs are treated by the body as foreign substances (xenobiotics). Like other foreign substances (xenobiotics), body tries to eliminate drugs by various mechanisms for ridding itself of chemical intruders. Biotransformation means chemical alteration of the drug in the body. Why drug transformation is necessary ? Kidney plays a pivotal role in terminating the activity of drugs. For renal excretion the drug tends to be polar (lipid insoluble/water soluble) so that it can not diffuse back from tubular lumen and can be excreted. But pharmacologically active organic molecules (drugs) tend to be lipophlic (nonpolar) and remains unionized or only paially ionized at physiological pH. Biotransformation is needed to render nonpolar (lipid soluble) compounds polar (water soluble) so that they are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreted. Sites and processes of biotransformation Primary site of drug metabolism is liver, others are - kidney, intestine, lung and plasma. Biotransformation of drugs may lead to :- Active metabolite from an active drug Many drugs are paially conveed to one or more active metabolites. The effects observed are the sumtotal of that due to the parent drug and its active metabolite. Activation of inactive drugs Few drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites. Such a drug is called prodrug.",A

Distension of distant alveoli is seen in -,Irregular emphysema,Paraseptal emphysema,Panacinar emphysema,Centriacinar emphysema,"Ref: Textbook of pathology (Harsh Mohan) 6th edition, page No.481 Morphology of Individual Types of Emphysema CENTRIACINAR (CENTRILOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA. Centriacinar or centrilobular emphysema is one of the common types. It is characterised by initial involvement of respiratory bronchioles i.e. the central or proximal pa of the acinus. This is the type of emphysema that usually coexists with chronic bronchitis and occurs predominantly in smokers and in coal miners' pneumoconiosis. 2. PANACINAR (PANLOBULAR) EMPHYSEMA. Panacinar or panlobular emphysema is the other commontype. In this type, all poions of the acinus are affected but not of the entire lung. Panacinar emphysema is most often associated with a1-antitrypsin deficiency in middle-aged smokers and is the one that produces the most characteristic anatomical changes in the lung in emphysema. PARASEPTAL (DISTAL ACINAR) EMPHYSEMA This type of emphysema involves distal pa of acinus while the proximal pa is normal. Paraseptal or distal acinar emphysema is localised along the pleura and along the perilobular septa. The involvement is seen adjacent to the areas of fibrosis and atelectasis and involves upper pa of lungs more severely than the lower. This form of emphysema is seldom associated with COPD but is the common cause of spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. Grossly, the subpleural poion of the lung shows air-filled cysts, 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter. 4. IRREGULAR (PARA-CICATRICIAL) EMPHYSEMA. This is the most common form of emphysema, seen surrounding scars from any cause. The involvement is irregular as regards the poion of acinus involved as well as within the lung as a whole. During life, irregular emphysema is often asymptomatic and may be only an incidental autopsy finding. MIXED (UNCLASSIFIED) EMPHYSEMA. Quite often, the same lung may show more than one type of emphysema.

Which of the following factors is MOST likely implicated in the pathogenesis of this neoplasm?",Cigarette smoking,Epstein-Barr virus infection,Ionizing radiation,Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene,"The neoplasm described here is known as lymphoepithelioma, an inappropriate designation that emphasizes the histologic features of a lymphocyte-rich squamous cell carcinoma. This tumor, AKA nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is the most frequent childhood malignancy in ceain African regions and one of the most frequent adult tumors in southern China. Epstein-Barr virus genome has been identified in most of these neoplasms. Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for a number of malignant neoplasms, such as lung cancer. In the upper respiratory tract, cigarette smoking is a strong predisposing factor for laryngeal carcinoma, but it has not been linked to the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiation injury is a well-known risk factor for many human neoplasms, such as leukemia and thyroid cancer, but not for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although any cell type is susceptible to neoplastic transformation by radiation, there is a so of hierarchy of vulnerability. The most frequent radiation-induced cancers are leukemias and thyroid carcinoma, followed by breast, lung, and salivary gland tumors. Skin, bone, and the gastrointestinal tract are least vulnerable to radiation carcinogenesis. Overexpression of the bcl-2 gene is found in most B-cell follicular lymphomas. bcl-2 is a member of a large family of genes that regulate apoptosis. bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis, so that its overexpression allows neoplastic lymphocytes to survive for long periods and accumulate progressively in lymph nodes and bone marrow.

Mechanism of action of Aspirin in MI is?,Thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibition,Thromboxane A2 synthesis stimulation,Antagonist of adenosine,Stimulation of PGF2 synthesis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibition o Aspirin acetylates and inhibits the enzyme cycloxygenase (Cox) - inactivating it irreversible. o Because platelets are exposed to aspirin in the poal circulation before it is deacetylated during first pass in the liver and because platelets cannot synthesize fresh enzyme (have no nuclei) TXA2 formation is suppressed at very low doses and till fresh platelets are formed. o Aspirin also inhibits COX and PGI2 synthesis in vessel wall. However, since intima cells can synthesize fresh enzyme, activity returns rapidly. o So at low doses TXA2 formation by platelets is selectively suppressed, whereas higher doses may decrease both TXA2 and PGI2 production.

True regarding prothrombin time measurement?,Platelet rich plasma is required,Activate with kaolin,Should be measured within 2 hours,Immediate refrigeration to preserve coagulation factor viability,"Major screening tests of coagulation 

In all of these tests, blood is collected with a calcium-chelating anticoagulant (usually citrate) and then centrifuged to remove the erythrocytes, leukocyte and platelets.
The remaining platelet-poor plasma (PPP) serves as the substrate for these tests.
Depending upon the test, the phospholipid is added to the PPP to substitute for platelets and an activating agent is added.
The PPP is then recalcified and the time needed for a clot to form is measured.
The sample to be kept at room temperature if it is to be used for prothrombin time, Lupus anticoagulant or factor VII assays and to be kept at 4° C for other assays.
Once blood is drawn for testing, the tests should be completed within a time frame of 30 minutes to 2 hours. 

Measurement of prothrombin time

The PT measures the function of the extrinsic and common coagulation pathway. It is commonly used to monitor oral anticoagulant therapy.
Method:- A source of phospholipid and tissue thromboplastin (rabbit or human brain extract) is added to platelet poor plasma, and Ca2+ is added to initiate coagulation. The time for the appearance of fibrin strands (PT) is measured and is compared with the control.
Normal PT is 11- 13 seconds.

Measurement of Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT or aPTT)

The PTT and APTT are used to measure the function of intrinsic and common coagulation pathway. PTT and APTT are used to monitor heparin therapy.
PTT method:- Phospholipid is added to platelet poor plasma taken from blood that is anticoagulated with citrate. Clotting is then initiated by the addition of Ca2+. The time to the formation of first fibrin strands is PTT.
APTT method:- The APTT is performed in the same manner as PTT except for the addition of an activating agent such as kaolin or ellagic acid before recalcification.
Normal PTT is 28-35 seconds. 
Measurement of thrombin time
It tests the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, i.e., it screens thrombin-fibrinogen reaction.
Method:- Thrombin is added to the patient's platelet poor plasma and the time to fibrin strand formation is measured

All are features of Intravascular hemolysis except -,Thrombocytopenia,Hemosiderinuria,Decreased haptoglobin,Raised indirect bilirubin,"Hemolytic anemia

Hemolytic anemia is anemia due to hemolysis, i.e. the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.
Hemolytic anemia has the following features -


A shortened red cell lifespan, i.e. premature destruction of red cells.
Elevated erythropoietin level and increased erythropoiesis in the marrow and other sites, to compensate for the loss of red cells→  characterized by increased reticulocyte count.
Accumulation of the products of hemoglobin catabolism due to an increased rate of red cell destruction.


Hemolysis may occur either inside the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or within the mononuclear phagocytic system of spleen, liver or bone marrow (extravascular hemolysis).

Intravascular hemolysis 

Due to the destruction of RBC, hemoglobin is released into blood → Hemoglobinemia.
Excess of hemoglobin may be excreted by kidney → hemoglobinuria.
Some of the hemoglobin is reabsorbed in kidney and is converted to hemosiderin which is then excreted → hemosiderinuria.
Free hemoglobin in plasma bound to haptoglobin and this complex is rapidly cleared by mononuclear phagocytic system Decreased haptoglobin.
When haptoglobin is depleted, free hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin → methemoglobinemia.
Excess heme groups are catabolized to bilirubin within the mononuclear phagocytic system → Increased indirect bilirubin and jaundice.
LDH is stored in the blood. During hemolysis this enzyme is released in the blood → Increased serum LDH.",A

Type Ilfamilial lipoprein lipase deficiency) o Lipoprotein lipase is required for the hydrolysis of chylomicrons and VLDL tri glycerides. o Deficiency of LPL results in decrease hydrolysis and elevated levels of plasma chylomicrons. o VLDL may also be increased but chylomicrons predominate. o Clinical manifestations Severe abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis. Lipemia retinalis --> opalescent retinal vessels. Eruptive xanthomas ---> on back, buttocks and extensor surface of legs and arms. Hepatosplenomegaly --> due to uptake of chylomicron by RE cells of liver & spleen. Note - Similar disorder may occur with Apo-C II deficiency, because apo C-II acts as a cofacter for LPL (see previous explanations on lipid transpo). In Apo II deficiency, LPL becomes inactive. 2. Type II A.Tvpe Ha (familial hvpercholesterolemia) o It is due to deficiency of LDL receptors. o There are two sources of increased LDL Decreased clearance of LDL LDL receptors. Increased production LDL from IDL normally 40-60% of IDL is taken up by liver LDL receptors, but in LDL receptor deficiency, clearance of IDL is decreased. So, more IDL is conveed to LDL. o Clinical manifestations Tuberous and tendon xanthoma on hands, wrist, elbows, knees, heels (especially the achilles tendon) or buttocks. Xanthelesma --> Barely elevated deposits of cholesterol over eyelids. Premature atherosclerosis coronary hea diseases. Peripheral vascular disease Corneal arcus B.TypeIlb (familial combined hvperlipidemia) o It is a disorder genetically distinct from the other inherited hyperlipidemias and characterized by the type II or type IV lipoprotein pattern that may change from time to time. o It is due to L LDL receptors and increased secretion of Apo B-100 (major apoprotein of VLDL) -9 So, both LDL and VLDL are increased. o Clinical manifestations There are no xanthomas (as seen with type 11a). Increased risk of CHD. Peripheral vascular disease. 3. Type DI (Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia) o Also known as familial broad - $ disease. o This is due do abnormality in Apo - E. o Apo - E acts as a ligand for LDL receptors and helps in hepatic uptake of chylomiron remnants and VLDL remnants, i.e. IDL (see previous explanations of lipid transpo). o Due to defective uptake, Chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants (IDL) are increased. o Clinical manifestations Tubero-eruptive xanthomas. Palmar xanthomas (xanthomata striata palmas). Premature atherosclerosis --* CHD Peripheral vascular disease Type IV (familial hyperiglyceridemia) o There is elevated levels of VLDL due to increased hepatic production of VLDL and impaired catabolism of VLDL. o It may be due to Apo - V deficiency (Apo - V promotes LPL mediated triglyceride lipolysis). o Premature coronary aery disease may occur but the chances are very-very less than in type II & Type III hyperlipidemias. Type V (Endogenous hvperiglyceridemia) o Pathogenesis may be similar to type IV, but it is more severe and both VLDL and chylomicrons are raised because both these are metabolized by same LPL and competes with each other for metabolism. o Clinical manifestations These are same as in type I familial LPL deficiency, i.e. o Pancreatitis o Lipemia retinalis o Eruptive xanthomas o Hepatosplenomegaly",B

Angiography reveals proximal coronary arterial narrowing with up to 70% stenosis. Which of the following pharmacologic agents ingested in low doses daily is most appropriate for reducing her risk for myocardial infarction?",Acetaminophen,Aspirin,Ibuprofen,Paclitaxel,"Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) inhibits the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism and inhibits platelets that participate in thrombogenesis. When atheromatous plaques have progressed to the point of symptomatic occlusion and subsequent angina, they are likely to be unstable plaques that may rupture, ulcerate, or erode to promote thrombosis. A ""baby"" aspirin-containing 80 mg (325 mg in the ""adult"" tablet) taken once a day may reduce this thrombotic risk, and also prevent the significantly increased risk for hemorrhage that is associated with higher doses. Acetaminophen is primarily analgesic in action. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that has no significant effect upon atheroma progression.

Which drug used for differentiating myasthenia gravis from cholinergic crisis?,Edrophonium,Neostigmine,Atropine,Acetylcholine,"Ans. (A) Edrophonium(Ref: KDT 8th/e p120)Patients with myasthenia gravis may present in the emergency with muscle weakness. This could be because of the aggravation of their primary problem (myasthenic crisis) or due to the overdose of the drugs like neostigmine (cholinergic crisis). The etiology of the two conditions is important to understand because in myasthenic crisis, there is deficiency of acetylcholine whereas in cholinergic crisis, there is excess of acetylcholine.Edrophonium is an inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinestrase and thus, increases the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. The increased availability of ACh causes dramatic improvement in the symptoms of patients with myasthenic crisis.In contrast, the symptoms of patients with cholinergic crisis worsen with edrophonium (because it further increases ACh in cholinergic crisis). The drug, therefore, is useful to clinically differentiate the actual cause of muscle weakness in an emergency situation.The reason for preferring edrophonium over other inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase is its short duration of action. This may be desirable for patients presenting with cholinergic crisis as the worsening in their condition would be only for a short time.",A

Best investigation for diagnosing amyloidosis,Rectal biopsy,Colonscopy,CT scan,Upper GI endoscopy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Rectal biopsy ""The most definitive investigation for Amyloidosis is biopsy"".For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice.An important clinical advance was the recognition that the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are often involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis.Thus, biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary.For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitive diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using an endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample.Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specific diagnosis is often made by studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy there by avoiding an invasive procedure.When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firm diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs.In addition, an advantage to performing biopsy of an involved organ (e.g., kidney heart) is thatit definitively establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid.It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity.The best sites of biopsy are: -Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity)Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity)Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: -Salivary glandsSkinTongueGingivaStomachBone marrow",A

Which of the following diseases characteristically causes fatty change in liver,HBV infection,Wilson's disease,HCV infection,Chronic alocoholism,"Fatty change represents the intracytoplasmaticaccumulation of triglycerides (neutral fats). At the beginning, the hepatocytes present small fat vacuoles (liposomes) around the nucleus(microvesicular fatty change). In this stage, liver cells are filled with multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, the size of the vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving characteristic signet ring appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well-delineated and optically ""empty"" because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty cysts, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular steatosis is the most common form and is typically associated with alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and coicosteroids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye's syndrome are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change.

A class of autonomic drugs used for reversing skeletal muscle relaxation caused by a nondepolarizing blocker is the:,Cholinesterase inhibitors,Parasympatholytics,Muscarinic antagonists,Sympatholytics,"A nondepolarizing skeletal muscle blockade caused by antagonists such as d-tubocurarine is produced when these drugs pharmacologically antagonize acetylcholine and bind N2-nicotinic receptors of the motor end plate. This binding hyperpolarizes the muscle cell membrane. Reversal of a nondepolarizing block requires additional acetylcholine to compete with the neuromuscular blocking agent. Indirect acting cholinergic drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors potentiate acetylcholine levels, resulting in a non selective mechanism of action at cholinergic receptors. It is the nicotinic action of acetylcholine at N2-nicotinic sites that is responsible for reversing a nondepolarizing neuromuscular block. Sympathomimetics and sympatholytics are ineffective in reversing non depolarizing blockade because there are no adrenergic nerves innervating skeletal muscle. (There are a few b2-adrenergic receptors located on skeletal muscle cell membranes. Stimulation of such adrenoceptors may result in skeletal muscle fasciculation, but would not be sufficient to reverse muscle paralysis caused by a nondepolarizing blocker.) Parasympatholytics (also known as muscarinic antagonists) have no effect at the neuromuscular junction because muscarinic receptors are not found at such locations. Ref: Taylor P. (2011). Chapter 10.

"A clinical study involves patients diagnosed with carcinoma whose tumor stage is T4N1M1. The patients' survival rate 5 years from the time of diagnosis is less than 50%, regardless of therapy. Which of the following clinical findings is most likely to be characteristic of this group of patients?",Cachexia,Cardiac murmur,Icterus,Loss of sensation,"Cachexia is a common finding in advanced cancers, and weight loss without dieting in an adult is a ""red flag"" for malignancy. The exact cause for this is unknown, but increases in circulating factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may play a role. Cardiac murmurs may occur in the development of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, a feature of a hypercoagulable state that may occur with advanced malignancies. Icterus is most likely to occur when there is obstruction of the biliary tract by a mass (e.g., as in pancreatic cancer), but metastases are unlikely to cause such an obstruction. Neurologic abnormalities may occur in local tumor growth impinging on nerves, but dull constant pain is the most likely abnormality in malignant neoplasms that invade nerves. Metastases to the spleen are uncommon. Tympany is uncommon in cancer because obstruction by a mass tends to be incomplete and to develop over a long time.

Nitroblue tetrazolium test is used for:,Phagocytosis,Complement,T cell,B cell,"Nitroblue tetrazolium test (NBT) is the original & most widely used test for chronic granulomatous disease. It is negative in chronic granulomatous disease & positive in normal individuals. It is used for detcting the production of reactive oxygen species in the phagocytes. Chronic granulomatous disease is a disorder of phagocytes. Patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have leucocytes that ingest microbes normally but lack the fully functional NADPH oxidase syst required to produce the superoxide anion. In these patients there is no respiratory burst due to lack of one of four NADPH oxidase subunits in neutrophils. Thus, these patients are not able to generate superoxide, H2O2 and OH- ions (free radicals). (Hence they are able to kill the bacterias). Leucocytes from the patients of chronic granulomatous disease fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium di phagocytosis.

No fibrin split products are detected. The reticulocyte concentration is 1.1%. What is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's hematologic abnormalities?",Autoantibodies against RBC membranes,Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains,Inadequate usage of stored iron,Sequestration of RBCs in splenic sinusoids,"The iron concentration and iron-binding capacity are low; however, in contrast to the finding in anemia of iron deficiency, the serum ferritin level is increased. This increase is typical of anemia of chronic disease. In this case, the chronic disease is rheumatoid arthritis. Underlying chronic inflammatory or neoplastic diseases increases the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-g. These cytokines promote the sequestration of iron in storage compartments and depress erythropoietin production. Autoantibody hemolytic anemias occur in several autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but not usually in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as in this case. Normal serum haptoglobin rules out intravascular hemolysis; iron is recycled at a rapid rate. Impaired synthesis of b-globin chains gives rise to b-thalassemia, also characterized by hemolysis. Complement lysis is enhanced in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which results from mutations in the PIGA gene. Patients with this disorder have a history of infections. Sequestration of RBCs in the spleen occur when RBC membranes are abnormal, as in hereditary spherocytosis or sickle cell anemia, or RBCs are coated by antibodies, as in autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

(5) Anti neoplastic alkylating agents as cytophosphamide.ThalassemiaInherited anemias characterized by defects in the synthesis of one or more globin chain subunits of the adult hemoglobin tetramer (Hb A).This leads to deficient hemoglobin accumulation, resulting in hypochromic and microcytic red cells and ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolytic anemia.Signs and symptoms: Thalassemia trait has no signs or symptoms.-- Pallor, Poor growth, Inadequate food intake, Fatigue, Shoness of breath, Splenomegaly, Jaundice, Maxillary hyperplasia, Dental malocclusion, Cholelithiasis, Pathologic fracturesLaboratory: In the presence of normal iron status, Increased levels of Hb A2 (to 4 to 6%) and/or increased Hb F (to 5 to 20%) by quantitative hemoglobin analysis suppos the diagnosis.Unfounately, differentiation between iron deficiency anemia and beta- or alpha-thalassemia trait can be difficult in practice if no reciprocal increases in Hb A2 levels and/or Hb F are present.- The distinction between alpha- and beta-thalassemia depends on the measurement of the minor hemoglobins Hgb A2 and Hgb F.- If these are normal, the diagnosis of alpha-thalassemia is most likely.Hemoglobin electrophoresis:- Elevated Hb A2 levels in beta-thalassemia trait- Elevated Hb A2, elevated Hb F, reduced or absent Hb Al in beta-thalassemia major or intermedia Peripheral blood:- Pronounced microcytosis,- Anisocytosis,- Poikilocytosis,- Hypochromia,- Punctate basophilic stippling,- High percentage of target cells, nucleated RBC,- Reticulocyte count elevatedHematocrit:- 28-40% in alpha-thalassemia trait and beta-thalassemia trait- May fall to less than 10% in beta-thalassemia majorFanconi anemia (FA)It is a genetic disease with an incidence of 1 per 350,000 bihsFA is the result of a genetic defect in a cluster of proteins responsible for DNA repair.As a result, the majority of FA patients develop cancer, most often acute myelogenous leukemia, and 90% develop bone marrow failure by age 40.Clinically, hematological abnormalities are the most serious symptoms in FA.While at bih, blood count is usually normal, macrocytosis/megaloblastic anemia is the first detected abnormality, often within the first decade of life (median age of onset is 7 years).Within the next 10 years, over 50% of patients presenting haematological abnormalities will have developed pancytopenia.Most commonly, a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) precedes a low neutrophil count (neutropenia)",D
What type of RBC seen in chronic renal failure ?-,Microcytic,Macrocytic,Normocytic,None.,"In chronic renal failure there is anaemia of chronic disorders. It is rogly propoional to severity of the uremia.In general anaemia in chronic disorder is normocytic normochromic.The basis of anaemia in renal failure is multifactorial, but the dominant cause is the diminished synthesis of erythropoetin by the damaged kidney which leads to inadequate red cell production. Other contributors are an extracorpuscular defect that reduces red cell lifespan and iron deficiency due to platelet dysfunction and increased bleeding.

Which of the following is required for post-translational modification?,Vitamin B12,Biotin,Beta-carotene,Vitamin C,"Ans. (d) Vitamin CRef: Robbiris pathology 9th ed. 18* As the collagen molecule is produced, it undergoes many changes, termed post-translational modifications.* These modifications take place in the Golgi compartment of the ER.* Collagen, like most proteins that are destined for transport to the extracellular spaces for their function or activity, is produced initially as a larger precursor molecule called procollagen.* Procollagen contains additional peptides at both ends that are unlike collagen. On one end of the molecule, called the amino terminal end, special bonds called disulfide bonds are formed among three procollagen chains and ensure that the chains line up in the proper alignment. This step is called registration. Once registration occurs, the three chains wrap around each other forming a string-like structure.* One of the first modifications to take place is the very critical step of hydroxylation of selected proline and lysine amino acids in the newly synthesized procollagen protein",D

Severe pain which arise after injury to or sectioning of a peripheral sensory nerve is called as:,Temporal arteritis,Neuralgia,Neuritis,Causalgia,"Complex Regional  Pain Syndrome (Causalgia, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome)
Causalgia is a term applied to severe pain which arises after injury to or sectioning of a peripheral sensory nerve. 
Although few reports of this condition exist in the dental literature, cases do occur after the extraction of teeth. It has readily identifiable signs and symptoms and is treatable if recognized early; however, the syndrome may become disabling if unrecognized.
Key Concept:
Causalgia manifests as severe pain after injury or sectioning of a peripheral sensory nerve following a diﬃcult extraction. The other names are complex regional pain syndrome and reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome.

"A 40-year-old woman has experienced chest pain on exertion for the past 2 months. A month ago, she had pneumonia with Streptococcus pneumoniae cultured from her sputum. On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL. The beneficial effect of TZD in this patient is most likely related to which of the following processes?",Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes,Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies,Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes,Increased half-life of circulating plasma insulin,"The clinical features of obesity with angina and glucose intolerance in this patient strongly suggest type 2 diabetes mellitus. This is confirmed by the oral glucose tolerance test (>200 mg/dL at 2 hours), useful in this case because her fasting blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dL and 122 mg/dL did not quite reach the diagnostic criterion of 126 mg/dL. The fundamental abnormality in type 2 diabetes mellitus is insulin resistance. Several adipocyte-derived molecules, such as adiponectin and resistin, have been implicated in the causation of insulin resistance, establishing the link between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) has emerged as a key molecule in the regulation of insulin resistance through its actions on adipocyte hormones. TZDs bind to and activate PPARg in adipocytes, and increase the levels of the insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin and reduce the levels of free fatty acids and resistin, both of which increase insulin resistance. Insulin autoantibodies are seen with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Beta-cell loss and density of insulin receptors are not major factors in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. TZDs do not affect the metabolism of insulin. Glucagon excess worsens diabetes, but TZDs do not affect its secretion. Beta cells do not regenerate, but many antidiabetogenic drugs in type 2 diabetes mellitus are designed to work with the beta cells that are left.",A

Mouth cancer can develop on the lip, the front two-thirds of the tongue, or anywhere inside the mouth. The most common places are the side of the tongue or floor of the mouth. Throat cancer can develop in different areas. The term throat cancer covers the area called the pharynx and the larynx (voicebox). The pharynx is divided into three main pas; the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the hypopharynx. The larynx is in front of the hypopharynx. Cancers of the thyroid, oesophagus (gullet) or wind pipe (trachea), near to the throat, are treated differently. Most head and neck cancers sta in the cells that line the mouth, nose and throat.

Rokitansky protuberances are seen in -,Mucinous carcinoma,Teratoma,Epidermal cystoids adenoma,Papillary carcinoma,"Teratoma

Teratomas are divided into three categories:

(1) Mature (benign)

Most benign teratomas are cystic and are known as dermoid cysts.
These neoplasms are presumably derived from the ectodermal differentiation of totipotential cells.
They are bilateral in 10% to 15% of cases.
Characteristically, they are unilocular cysts containing hair and cheesy sebaceous material. On section, they reveal a thin wall lined by an opaque, grey-white, wrinkled, apparent epidermis.
Generally, in one area of the cyst wall, a solid prominence is seen known as Rokitansky's protuberance where tissue elements such as tooth, bone, cartilage & various other odd tissues are present.
On histologic examination, the cyst wall is composed of stratified squamous epithelium with underlying sebaceous glands, hair shafts, and other skin adnexal structures. In most cases, structures from other germ layers can be identified, such as cartilage, bone, thyroid tissue, and other organoid formations.
Dermoid cysts are sometimes incorporated within the wall of a mucinous cystadenoma.
About 1% of the dermoids undergo malignant transformation of any one of the component elements ( but most commonly, squamous cell carcinoma).

(2) Monodermal or Specialized Teratomas

The rare group of tumors, the most common of which are struma ovarii and carcinoid.
They are always unilateral, although a contralateral teratoma may be present.
Struma ovarii is composed entirely of mature thyroid tissue. Interestingly, these thyroidal neoplasms may hyperfunction, causing hyperthyroidism.
The ovarian carcinoid, which presumably arises from intestinal epithelium in a teratoma, might, in fact, be functioning, particularly in large tumors, producing 5-hydroxytryptamine and the carcinoid syndrome.

(3) Immature Malignant Teratomas

These are rare tumors that differ from benign teratomas in that the component tissue resembles that observed in the fetus or embryo rather than in the adult.
The tumor is found chiefly in prepubertal adolescents and young women.
These grow rapidly and frequently penetrate the capsule with local spread or metastases.
On microscopy, there are varying amounts of immature tissue differentiating toward cartilage, glands, bone, muscle, nerve, and others.
An important risk for the subsequent extraovarian spread is the histologic grade of tumor, which is based on the proportion of tissue containing immature neuroepithelium.",B

Some FD patients also have hyperpigmented skin lesions (cafe-au-lait spots), gonadotropin-independent sexual precocity, and/or other endocrine and nonendocrine manifestations (McCune-Albright syndrome ). MAS results from somatic mutations occurring during early development, resulting in a widespread mosaic of normal and mutant-bearing cells, which predicts that the clinical presentation of each patient is determined by the extent and distribution of abnormal cells. These mutations encode constitutively active forms of G(s)alpha, the ubiquitously expressed G protein alpha-subunit that couples hormone receptors to intracellular cAMP generation.

One of the following feature is true regarding Crohn's disease,Presence of Non-caseating granulomas,Associated with Backwash ileitis,Presence of Pseudopolyps,Associated with Broad based ulcers,"(A) Presence of Non-caseating granulomas[?]Non-caseating Granuloma of Crohn's disease:oMost valuable diagnostic feature of Crohn's disease is the presence of Non-caseating granuloma (a sarcoid or tuberculoid reaction) in the affected tissue of the bowel wall.oGranumlomas develop in all layers of the intestines from the mucosa to serosa (most frequent in sub mucosa).oGranuloma is defined as a collection of epitheloid cells & with or without giant cells.oNoncaseating granulomas are hallmark of Crohn's disease & found in approximately 35% of casesoMay occur in areas of active disease or univolved regions in any layer of the intestinal wall. These may also be seen in mesenteric lymph nodes.oCutaneous granuloma as form nodules are known as metastatic Crohn's disease.oAbsence of granulomas does not preclude a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.oTransmural involvement is characteristic feature of Crohn's diseaseoSkip lesions is characteristic of Crohn's disease & may help in differentiating from ulcerative colitis.Other Options[?]Ulcerative ColitisoGrossly, ulcerative colitis always involves the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous fashion to involve part or all of the colon.oDisease of the entire colon is termed pancolitis, while left-sided disease extends no farther than the transverse colon. Limited distal disease may be referred to descriptively as ulcerative proctitis or ulcerative proctosigmoiditis.oSmall intestine is normal, although mild mucosal inflammation of the distal ileum, termed backwash ileitis, may be present in severe cases of pancolitis.oSkip lesions are not seen (although focal appendiceal or cecal inflammation may occasionally be present in left-sided ulcerative colitis).oGrossly, involved colonic mucosa may be slightly red and granular or have extensive, broad-based ulcers.oThere can be an abrupt transition between diseased and uninvolved colon.oUlcers are aligned along the long axis of the colon but do not typically replicate the serpentine ulcers of Crohn disease. Isolated islands of regenerating mucosa often bulge into the lumen to create pseudopolyps & the tips of these polyps may fuse to create mucosal bridges. Chronic disease may lead to mucosal atrophy with a flat and smooth mucosal surface that lacks normal folds.oUnlike Crohn disease, mural thickening is not present, the serosal surface is normal, and strictures do not occur. However, inflammation and inflammatory mediators can damage the muscularis propria and disturb neuromuscular function leading to colonic dilation and toxic megacolon, which carries a significant risk of perforation,oSubmucosal fibrosis, mucosal atrophy, and distorted mucosal architecture remain as residua of healed disease but histology may also revert to near normal after prolonged remission.oGranulomas are not present in ulcerative colitis.

Direct fibrinolytics are/is:,R4prourokinase,Alfimiprase,rtpA,All,"Ans. b (Alfimeprase). (Ref. Harrison's medicine 16th ed. 690)Alfimeprase is a metalloproteinase that degrades fibrin in a plasmin-independent fashion. It is a novel thrombolytic based on snake venom derived protein. It is a direct fibrinolytic. It is not a plasminogen activator. It is neutralized by alpha-macroglobulin.PHARMACOLOGICAL REPERFUSION# Therapeutic plasminogen activators include streptokinase, urokinase, tPA and non-tPA fibrinolytics like Recombinant prourokinase, staphylokinase, and alfimeprase.- They are fashioned after endogenous tPA or urokinase that convert plasminogen into active plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrinogen and fibrin in to FDPs.- tPA is released from endothelial cells, enters the fibrin clot, and activates plasminogen to plasmin.- Any free plasmin is complexed with a,plasmin inhibitor (a2PI).- Fibrin is degraded to low-molecular-weight fragments, fibrin degradation products (FDPs).# Innovative intravenous pharmacological reperfusion strategies include:- Novel fibrinolytic agents (tenecteplase, reteplase, desmetolplase, plasmin, and microplasmin),- GP Ilb/IIIa antagonists = platelet disaggregating effects (abciximab and tirofiban),- Combination therapies to improve efficacy of clot lysis (fibrinolytics and GP IIb/IIIa agents, and fibrinolytics and direct thrombin inhibitors), increase the time window for clot lysis (fibrinolytics and neuroprotectants), and reduce the frequency of hemorrhagic complications.",B

Hyperophy is -,Increase in cell number,Increase in cell size,Decrease in cell number,Decrease in cell size,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Increase in cell size Hyperophy o Hyperophy refers to an increase in the size of cells without increase in the number, resulting in an increase in the size of tissue. o Hyperophy involves cell enlargement without cell division. o So, hyperophied organ has just larger cells, but no new cells (by contrast, in hyperplasia there is increase in number of new cells without increase in size). o Nuclei in hyperophied cells have a higher DNA content than in normal cells because the cells arrest in the cell cycle without undergoing mitosis. o Myocardium (hea muscle) and skeletal muscle undergo hyperophy. o The most common stimulus for hyperophy is increased workload. Mechanism of hyperophy o The increase in cell size is due to synthesis of more structural proteins. o The genes that are induced during hyperophy include those encoding transcription factors (C-fos, C-jun), growth factors (TGF-(3, TGF- 1, FGF); and vasoactive agents (a-agonists, endothelin-1, angiotensin II). o There may also be a switch of contractile proteins from adult to fetal or neonatal forms, e.g., during myocardial hyperophy, the a-myosin heavy chain is replaced by 13-form of the myosin heavy chain, which leads to decrease myosine ATPase activity and a slower, more energetically economical contraction. o In addition, some genes that are expressed only in embryonic life are re-expressed in hyperophied myocardium, e.g., in the embryonic hea, the gene for Atrial natriuratic peptide (ANP) is expressed in both atrium and ventricle. After bih, ventricular regulation of the gene is down regulated. Myocardial hyperophy is associated with reinduction of ANF gene expression. ANP induces salt excretion by kidney L blood volume & pressure, decrease work load. Why do these changes occur ? o As already explained, the most common stimulus for myocardial hyperophy is increased workload. o All the above morphological changes that occur in hyperophy either increase muscle activity (to handle the increased workload) or decrease the workload to hea.",C

"Fibrinoid necrosis may be observed in all of the following, EXCEPT:",Malignant hypeension,Polyaeritis nodosa,Diabetic glomerulosclerosis,Aschoff's nodule,"Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of connective tissue necrosis seen paicularly in autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatic fever, polyaeritis nodosa, and systemic lupus erythematosus). Collagen and smooth muscle in the media of blood vessels are especially involved. Fibrinoid necrosis of aerioles also occurs in accelerated (malignant) hypeension. Fibrinoid necrosis is characterized by loss of normal structure and replacement by a homogeneous, bright pink-staining necrotic material that resembles fibrin microscopically. Areas of fibrinoid necrosis contain various amounts of immunoglobulins and complement, albumin, breakdown products of collagen, and fibrin. Also Know: Fat Necrosis: Fat necrosis most characteristically occurs in acute pancreatitis when pancreatic enzymes are liberated from the ducts into surrounding tissue. Pancreatic lipase acts on the triglycerides in fat cells, breaking these down into glycerol and fatty acids, which complex with plasma calcium ions to form calcium soaps. Liquefactive Necrosis: Liquefaction of necrotic cells results when lysosomal enzymes released by the necrotic cells cause rapid liquefaction. Lysis of a cell as a result of the action of its own enzymes is autolysis. Liquefactive necrosis is typically seen in the brain following ischemia. Coagulative Necrosis: In this type of necrosis, the necrotic cell retains its cellular outline, often for several days. The cell, devoid of its nucleus, appears as a mass of coagulated, pink-staining, homogeneous cytoplasm. Coagulative necrosis typically occurs in solid organs, such as the kidney, hea (myocardium), and adrenal gland, usually as a result of deficient blood supply and anoxia. It is also seen with other types of injury, eg, coagulative necrosis of liver cells due to viruses or toxic chemicals, and coagulative necrosis of skin in burns. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R.

All these tumours arise from neuroendocrine (Kulchitsky)cells of bronchial mucosa. Formerly, bronchial carcinoids used to be classified as 'bronchial adenomas' but now it isknown that they are locally invasive and have the capacity to metastasise. Bronchial carcinoids tend to occur at ayounger age than bronchogenic carcinoma, often appearing below the age of 40 years, and are not related to cigarettesmoking. CLINICAL FEATURES. Bronchial carcinoids occur at a relatively early age and have equal sex incidence. Most ofthe symptoms in bronchial carcinoids occur as a result of bronchial obstruction such as cough, haemoptysis, atelectasisand secondary infection. About 5-10% of bronchial carcinoids metastasise to the liver and these cases are capable ofproducing carcinoid syndrome",A

B: Post-prandial abdominal pain, weight loss, chronic mesenteric vessel occlusion The 3 aeries supplying the gut are the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric. Unless significant stenoses or actual occlusion of 2 of the 3 vessels is present, efficient collateral circulation between the celiac and superior mesenteric aeries (i.e., the pancreaticoduodenal arcades) and the superior and inferior mesenteric aeries (i.e., the meandering mesenteric aery) ensures that blood flow to the gut generally is adequate. The internal iliac aeries also may be an impoant source of collateral hindgut and midgut perfusion in the presence of inferior mesenteric aerial occlusion. The most common cause of abdominal angina is atherosclerotic vascular disease (chronic process). The occlusive process commonly involves the ostia and a few proximal centimeters of the mesenteric vessels. Abdominal angina is defined as the postprandial pain that occurs in individuals with sufficient mesenteric vascular occlusive disease such that blood flow cannot increase enough to meet visceral demands. Soon, patients associate eating with pain and develop a characteristic fear of food (i.e., sitophobia) or food-avoidance behavior. Repoed weight loss averages 5-6 kg.",B

Secondary thrombocytopenia can also be produced by lupus, viral infections, and drugs. Only when secondary thrombocytopenia has been ruled out, can the diagnosis of ITP be made. Defective platelet aggregation is responsible for thrombasthenia, an autosomal dominant disease that causes prolonged bleeding time but normal numbers of platelets. Hypersplenism causes thrombocytopenia when an enlarged spleen traps normal platelets in the absence of other specific platelet disorders. This type of thrombocytopenia can be cured with splenectomy. Although the thrombocytopenia in ITP often improves with splenectomy, ITP does not cause splenomegaly. Megakaryopoiesis is disturbed in any disorder that causes bone marrow failure, including drug toxicity, leukemia, and infections. In this setting, thrombocytopenia is often pa of a pancytopenia.

All act through GABA receptors except,Benzodiazepine,Barbiturates,Zopiclone,Promethazine.,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Promethazine Gamma Aminobuturic acid (GABA) is the most important inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous system.GABA ergic neurons are widely distributed in the C.N.S. but are virtually absent outside the brain and spinal cord.GABA controls the state of excitability in all brain areas and the balance between excitatory inputs (mostly glutaminergic) and inhibitory GABA ergic activity determines the prevailing level of neuronal activity.If the balance swings in favour of GABA. then sedation, amnesia, muscle relaxation and ataxia appear and nervousness and anxiety are reduced.The mildest reduction of GABA ergic activity elicits arousal, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, exaggerated reactivity.Mechanism of action of Drugs on GABAThe inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA acts on GABA receptors. When GABA binds with GABA receptors the permeability of the GABA receptors for the chloride ion increases allowing more ions into the neurons and decreasing excitability.Benzodiazepenes attach with GABA receptors.The resulting Benzodiazepene GABA receptor complex enhance the effectiveness of GABA by lowering the concentration of GABA required for opening the chloride channel thus enabling GABA ergic circuits to produce a larger inhibitory effect.Simply remember, Benzodiazepenes increase the frequency of channel-opening, thus leading to inhibition.Barbiturates also act on GABA receptors to cause sedation.But in contrast to benzodiazepenes they appear to increase the duration of GABA gate chloride channel opening.Zolpidem is a newer hypnotic that also modify GABA receptors.",D

All of the following statement about penicillin G are true except -,It is actively secreted in tubules,It is never administered orally,It is effective against gram positive as well as gram negative bacteria,It acts by inhibiting cell wall synthesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., It is never administered orally o Here comes the confusing one. o In this question there is confusion between option 'b' and 'c'. o First see option 'b' Penicillin G is degraded by acid. So, most of the time it is given by injection. But oral preparations are also available ""Despite the convenience of oral administration of penicillin G, this route should be used only in infections in which clinical experience has proven its efficacy"". -Goodman & Gilman So, option b is absolutely wrong and is the answer of our question. o Now see option C Penicillin G is a narrow spectrum penicillin, i.e. activity is limited primarily to gram positive bacteria but it has activity against some gram negative organisms also, e.g. meningococci, gonococci (if strains are sensitive), few strains of E.coli. So, option C is paially correct. About other options o Penicillin is primarily excreted by kidney --> 10-20% by glomerular filtration and 80-90% by active tubular secretion --> Active secretion'is inhibited by probenacid which increases blood concentration of penicillin. o Penicillin acts by inhibiting cell wall synthesis. Also know o Penicillin G (benzyl penicillin) has a sho VA. So, it has to be given 6-12 hourly. o Procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin (longest acting) are long acting due to slow release. o Extended (broad) spectrum penicillins (Aminopenicillins, Carboxypenicillins and ureidopenicillins) are active against gram negative organisms as well (in addition to gram positive oraganisms, though their activity against gram positive organisms is less than penicillin G). o Activity of penicillins against gram positive organisms --> Penicillin G (max) > Extendend spectrum penicilins > b- lactamase resistant penicillins (methicillin & others).",B

"An oval lesion is found in the right lobe of the liver in an otherwise asymptomatic 24-year-old female. Surgical resection finds a single welldemarcated lesion that has a prominent, central, stellate white scar. This gross appearance is most consistent with a diagnosis of",Metastatic adenocarcinoma,Focal nodular hyperplasia,Hemangioma,Hepatocellular carcinoma,"Neoplasms of the liver, either benign or malignant, have characteristic microscopic or gross appearances. Benign tumors of the liver include hemangiomas (the most common), focal nodular hyperplasias, nodular regenerative hyperplasias, and adenomas. Hemangiomas are characterized by numerous small endotheliallined spaces filled with blood. The lack of erythrocytes or blood would raise the possibility of the lesion being a lymphangioma, while pleomorphic or atypical endothelial cells would suggest the possibility of an angiosarcoma. Focal nodular hyperplasia, which has a characteristic gross appearance of a central stellate scar within the tumor, microscopically reveals hepatic nodules surrounded by fibrous bands having numerous proliferating bile ducts. This type of tumor is related to bih-control pills, but has no association with malignancy. In contrast, nodular regenerative hyperplasia involves the entire liver and forms multiple spherical nodules. Histologic sections reveal plump hepatocytes surrounded by rims of atrophic cells. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is clinically impoant because it is associated with the subsequent development of poal hypeension. Two types of hepatic adenomas are the liver cell adenoma and the bile duct adenoma. Liver cell adenomas are seen in female patients taking bih-control pills. These adenomas may bleed, but are not associated with malignancy. Histologically, cords of hepatocytes are present, but there is no lobular architecture.

Left-sided heart failure

The major morphological and clinical effects of LVF are due to increased back pressure in the pulmonary circulation and the consequences of diminished peripheral blood pressure and flow,
The extracardiac organs involved commonly are -

1. Lung (most common)
2. Kidney
3. Brain
Lung

The pressure in the pulmonary veins increases and transmitted retrogradely to capillaries and arteries,
This results in pulmonary congestion and pulmonary-oedema → Wet lung.
There is perivascular and interstitial translate, particularly in the interlobular septa → responsible for Kerley's B lines on X-rays.
Edematous fluid accumulates in alveoli.
Iron-containing proteins and hemoglobin leak out from the capillaries and are phagocytosed by macrophages and converted to hemosiderin.
Hemosiderin - containing macrophages in the alveoli (called siderophages, or heart failure cells) denote previous episodes of pulmonary edema.
The clinical manifestations of LVF are primarily due to these changes in lungs —> Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Kidney

Decreased cardiac output causes a reduction in renal perfusion.

The commonest cause of lung abscess -,Tuberculosis,Congenital,Hematogenous,Aspirated oropharyngeal secretion,"​Lung abscess 

The term pulmonary abscess describes a local suppurative process within the lung, characterized by necrosis of lung tissues.

Etiology 

Aspiration is the most common cause, factors that portend an increased risk of aspiration include esophageal dysmotility, seizure disorders, and neurological conditions causing bulbar dysfunction.
As an aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions is the most common cause, organisms most commonly causing lung abscess are those normally found in the oral cavity, i.e., Anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, peptococcus species).

Other organisms are S. aureus, Klebsiella, Nocardia and gram-negative bacteria.
Morphology

Pulmonary abscesses due to aspiration are more common on the right side because of the more vertical direction of the right main bronchus.
Most often abscess is single.
The cardinal histologic change in all abscesses is the suppurative destruction of the lung parenchyma within the central area of cavitation.",D

Commonest type of necrosis is,Fatty,Caseous,Coagulative,Liquifactive,"Ans. c (Coagulative). (Ref. Robbins, Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th/pg.7-13)Caseation necrosis - Tubercular lymph nodesCoagulative necrosis - Myocardial infarction, sarcoidosisLiquefactive necrosis - Brain infarcts and infections (abscess).TYPE OF NECROSISCOMMMENTSCoagulative necrosis- is a form of tissue necrosis in which the component cells are dead but the basic tissue architecture is preserved.- The affected tissues take on a firm texture.- Presumably the injury denatures not only structural proteins but also enzymes and so blocks the proteolysis of the dead cells; as a result, eosinophilic, anucleate cells may persist for days or weeks.- Coagulative necrosis is characteristic of infarcts (areas of ischemic necrosis) in all solid organs except the brain.Liquefactive necrosis- is seen in focal bacterial or, occasionally, fungal infections, because microbes stimulate the accumulation of inflammatory cells and the enzymes of leukocytes digest (""liquefy"") the tissue.- For obscure reasons, hypoxic death of cells within central nervous system often evokes liquefactive necrosis.- If the process was initiated by acute inflammation, the material is frequently creamy yellow and is called pus.Gangrenous necrosis- It is usually applied to a limb, generally the lower leg, that has lost its blood supply and has undergone coagulative necrosis involving multiple tissue layers.- When bacterial infection is superimposed, coagulative necrosis is modified by the liquefactive action of the bacteria and the attracted leukocytes (so-called wet gangrene).Caseous necrosis(term ""caseous"" = cheese-iike)- is encountered most often in foci of tuberculous infection.- On microscopic examination, the necrotic focus appears as a collection of fragmented or lysed cells with an amorphous granular appearance. Unlike coagulative necrosis, the tissue architecture is completely obliterated and cellular outlines cannot be discerned. Caseous necrosis is often enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border; this appearance is characteristic of a focus of inflammation known as a granuloma.Fat necrosis- Refers to focal areas of fat destruction, typically resulting from release of activated pancreatic lipases into the substance of the pancreas and the peritonea! cavity e.g. acute pancreatitis (fat saponification).- On histologic examination, the foci of necrosis contain shadowy outlines of necrotic fat cells with basophilic calcium deposits, surrounded by an inflammatory reaction.",C

Which one of the following is FALSE regarding atropine: March 2013,Used to prevent adhesions in inflammatory conditions of eye,Used in concentration of 1%,Can be given in sinus bradycardia patients,Long acting miotic,"Ans. D i.e. Long acting miotic Atropine in ophthalmology Topical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shoer-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination. Atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial pupillary dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. Atropine is contraindicated in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma.",D

Proton Pump (H+,K+-ATPase) Inhibitors# Omeprazole, esmoprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, and pantoprazole are substituted benzimidazole derivatives that covalently bind and irreversibly inhibit H+,K+-ATPase.# Esmoprazole, the newest member of this drug class, is the S-enantiomer of omeprazole.# These are the most potent acid inhibitory agents available.# Omeprazole and lansoprazole are the PPIs that have been used for the longest time. Both are acid-labile and are administered as enteric-coated granules in a sustained-release capsule that dissolves within the small intestine at a pH of 6. These agents are lipophilic compounds; upon entering the parietal cell, they are protonated and trapped within the acid environment of the tubulovesicular and canalicular system. These agents potently inhibit all phases of gastric acid secretion. Onset of action is rapid, with a maximum acid inhibitory effect between 2 and 6 h after administration and duration of inhibition lasting up to 72-96 h. With repeated daily dosing, progressive acid inhibitory effects are observed, with basal and secretagogue-stimulated acid production being inhibited by >95% after 1 week of therapy# The half-life of PPIs is --18 h; thus, it can take between 2 and 5 days for gastric acid secretion to return to normal levels once these drugs have been discontinued.# PPIs may interfere with absorption of drugs such as ketoconazole, ampicillin, iron, and digoxin. Hepatic cytochrome P450 can be inhibited by the earlier PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole). Rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esmoprazole do not appear to interact significantly with drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Caution should be taken when using warfarin, diazepam, atazanavir, and phenytoin concomitantly with PPIs. Long-term acid suppression, especially with PPIs, has been associated with a higher incidence of community-acquired pneumonia.# Tenatoprazole is a PPI containing an imidazopyridine ring instead of a benzimidazole ring, which promotes irreversible proton pump inhibition. This agent has a longer half-life than the other PPIs and may be beneficial for inhibiting nocturnal acid secretion, which has significant relevance in GERD. A second new class of agents is the potassium- competitive acid pump antagonists (P-CABs). These compounds inhibit gastric acid secretion via potassium competitive binding of the H+,K+-ATPase.",A

Gingival biopsy is used for diagnosis of ?,Scurvy,Sarcoidosis,Amyloidosis,SLE,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Amyloidosis Biopsy of gingiva (gingival biopsy) is used in the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. Diagnosis of amvloidosis The most definitive investigation for amyloidosis is biopsy. The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made by detecting the characteristic amyloid protein in a biopsy specimen of involved tissue. For many years rectal biopsy was the first procedure of choice. However, the capillaries in the subcutaneous fat are aften involved in patients with systemic amyloidosis and can often provide sufficient tissues for the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Therefore, a needle aspiration biopsy of fat just under the skin of the belly (fat pad aspiration) offers a simple and less invasive method to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and biopsy of the organ with the most severe clinical involvement is often unnecessary. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a final diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. The best sites of biopsy are abdominal fat pad (90% sensitivity) and rectal mucosa (70-80% sensitivity). Other sites are salivary glands, gingiva, skin, tongue, bone marrow, stomach.",C

The name of tumor is usually based on the cell, e.g. smooth muscle cell tumor → leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, skeletal muscle cell tumor rhabdomyosarcoma.

Benign tumors

In general, benign tumors are designed by attaching the suffix - oma, e.g tumor of fibroblasts → fibroma, tumor of cartilagenous cells → chondroma.

Malignant tumors

Malignant tumors arising in mesenchymal cell origin are usually called sarcoma, e.g. fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma.
Malignant tumors of epithelial cell origin are called carcinoma.


Carcinoma may be further classified → one with glandular growth pattern, i.e. adenocarcinoma and the other one producing recognizable squamous cells of epithelium, i.e. squamous cell carcinoma.

Germ layers and tumor

The great majority of the neoplasm is composed of cells representative of a single germ layer.
Teratomas, in contrast, are made up of a variety of parenchymal cell types representative of more than one germ layer, usually all three.
They arise from totipotent cells and so are principally encountered in the gonads. These totipotent cells differentiate along various germ lines, that can be identified as skin, fat, muscle, tooth structure, hair or any other tissue of the body. An example is a dermoid cyst of the ovary is a benign teratoma (note mature teratoma is benign, while immature teratoma is malignant).
Note - There are some exceptions to above general rules, i.e. malignant neoplasms with the suffix - oma → Melanomas, seminoma, hepatoma (hepatocellular Ca), mesotheloma, lymphoma.",D
"A patient presented with fever, night sweats and weight loss. Clinical examination revealed painless lymphadenopathy. Microscopy shows Reed Sternberg cells. Most likely condition is: March 2012",HIV,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Secondary TB,"Ans: C i.e. Hodgkins lymphoma Conditions and presentations In the United states, the typical patients with AIDS presents with fever, weight loss, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, multiple oppounistic infections, neurologic disease, and, in many cases, secondary neoplasms. Biopsy specimens from enlarged lymph nodes in the early stages of HIV infection reveal a marked follicular hyperplasia Patients of CLL are often asymptomatic at diagnosis. When symptoms appear, they are nonspecific and include easy fatiguability, weight loss, and anorexia. Generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in 5060% of symptomatic patients. Proliferation centres (on microscopy) are pathognomic for CLL/ Small lymphocytic lymphoma. Smudge cells may be seen Hodgkins lymphoma most commonly presents as painless lymphadenopathy. Patients with disseminated disease (stage III-IV) or the mixed cellularity or lymphocyte depletion subtypes are more likely to have constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Identification of Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants is essential for the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma Systemic symptoms in localized secondary TB, often appear early in the course and include malaise, anorexia, weight loss, and fever. Commonly the fever is low grade and remittent (appearing late each afternoon and then subsiding), and night sweats occur. Regional lymph nodes are less prominently involved early in secondary disease than they are in primary disease. Histologically, sites of active involvement are marked by a characteristic granulomatous inflammatory reaction that forms both caseating and non-caseating tubercles.",C
"A 48-year-old man has noticed increasing abdominal girth and a yellowish color to his skin over the past 5 months. On physical examination, he has scleral icterus and generalized jaundice.

The prothrombin time is 18 seconds, and the partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. The blood ammonia level is 105 mmol/L. What is the most likely cause of these findings?",Acute HAV infection,Alcoholic liver disease,Choledocholithiasis,Metastatic adenocarcinoma,"The elevated transaminase levels, some loss of liver function with abnormal prothrombin time, and cholestasis are not specific for a given type of liver injury. An AST level that is higher than the ALT level is characteristic, however, of liver cell injury associated with chronic alcoholism. In this patient, the disease is decompensating, as evidenced by the elevated blood ammonia level. HAV is typically a mild disease without a preponderance of direct bilirubin. Choledocholithiasis results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but without the high ammonia level that is evidence of liver failure. Metastases are unlikely to obstruct all biliary tract drainage or lead to liver failure severe enough to cause elevations of blood ammonia. Primary biliary cirrhosis is rare, particularly in men, and the alkaline phosphatase level would be much higher.",B

Laboratory studies reveal the following: decreased hemoglobin (with microcytic hypochromic red cell indices), normal platelet count, markedly prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and paial thromboplastin time (PTT), and unmeasurable thrombin time (TT). Platelet aggregation studies reveal a normal platelet response to ristocetin, but with other substances (including collagen, ADP, and epinephrine), this patient's platelets exhibit a primary wave defect. Based on these findings, this patient most likely has",Afibrinogenemia,Bernard-Soulier syndrome,Glanzmann's thrombasthenia,Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,"Platelet aggregation refers to platelets binding to other platelets. One mechanism for this involves fibrinogen, which can act as a molecular bridge between adjacent platelets by binding to GpIIb and GpIIIa receptors on the surface of platelets. Abnormalities of platelet aggregation (aggregation defects or primary wave defects) include Glanzmann's thrombasthenia and afibrinogenemia. Patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia have a deficiency of GpIIb-IIIa and defective platelet aggregation. Patients with low or no fibrinogen levels characteristically have prolonged PT, PTT, and TT values: in fact, they are so prolonged they are unmeasurable. In contrast to platelet aggregation, platelet secretion refers to the secretion of the contents of two types of granules within the platelet cytoplasm. a granules contain fibrinogen, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor, while dense bodies contain ADP, ionized calcium, histamine, epinephrine, and serotonin. Decreased platelet secretion (activation defects) is seen with deficiencies of these granules; these diseases are called storage pool defects. They can involve either a granules (gray platelet syndrome) or dense bodies (Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or TAR). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder that is characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (small platelets), and immunodeficiency consisting of decreased levels of IgM and progressive loss of T cell function.These patients have recurrent infections with bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

MIC-2 is a marker of -,Ewing 's sarcoma,Osteosarcoma,Dermatofibrous protruberans,Alveolar cell sarcoma,"Ewing's sarcoma or Ewing sarcoma (/'ju:ING/) is a malignant small, round, blue cell tumor. It is a rare disease in which cancer cells are found in the bone or in soft tissue. The most common areas in which it occurs are the pelvis, the femur, the humerus, the ribs and clavicle (collar bone). Since a common genetic locus is responsible for a large percentage of Ewing's sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, these are sometimes grouped together in a category known as the Ewing family of tumors. The diseases are, however, considered to be different: peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumours are generally not associated with bones, while Ewing sarcomas are most commonly related to bone. Ewing's sarcoma occurs most frequently in teenagers and young adults, with a male/female ratio of 1.6 Although usually classified as a bone tumour, Ewing's sarcoma can have characteristics of both mesodermal and ectodermal origin, making it difficult to classify. James Ewing (1866-1943) first described the tumour, establishing that the disease was separate from lymphoma and other types of cancer known at that time.CD99 antigen (Cluster of differentiation 99), also known as MIC2 or single-chain type-1 glycoprotein, is a heavily O-glycosylated transmembrane protein that is encoded by the CD99 gene in humans.

Which of the following can be given as a single weight-based intravenous bolus over 10 seconds?,Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),Tenecteplase (TNK),Reteplase (rPA),Any of the above,".Tenecteplase is an enzyme used as a thrombolytic drug. Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line. Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary cells). Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (cDNA) for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296-299 in the protease domain. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively conves thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. pharmacokinetics: Distribution: approximates plasma volume Metabolism: Primarily hepatic Half-life elimination: Biphasic: Initial: 20-24 minutes; Terminal: 90-130 minutes Excretion: Clearance: Plasma: 99-119 mL/minute Ref Robbins 9/e pg 234",B

Which among the following is the MOST effective antitubercular drug against slow multiplying intracellular mycobacteria?,Rifampicin,Isoniazid,Pyrazinamide,Ethambutol,"Rifampicin is bactericidal for mycobacteria, it can penetrate into most tissues and phagocytic cells. It has the capacity to kill intracellular organisms and those sequestered in abscesses and lung cavities. Rifampicin acts by binding to the beta subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and thereby inhibiting RNA synthesis. It is well absorbed after oral administration and is excreted mainly through the liver into bile. It then undergoes enterohepatic recirculation, with the bulk excreted as a deacylated metabolite in feces and a small amount excreted in the urine. Indications: Along with other antituberculous drugs, it is used against mycobacterial infections Used to eliminate meningococcal carriage As prophylaxis in contacts of children with Haemophilus influenzae type b disease To eradicate staphylococcal carriage In serious staphylococcal infections such as osteomyelitis and prosthetic valve endocarditis Ref: Deck D.H., Winston L.G.

"A 72-year-old man has had increasing difficulty with urination for the past 10 years. He now has to get up several times each night because of a feeling of urgency, but each time the urine volume is not great. He has difficulty starting and stopping urination. On physical examination, the prostate is enlarged to twice its normal size but is not tender to palpation. One year ago, his serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 6 ng/mL, and it is still at that level when retested. Which of the following drugs is most likely to be effective in the treatment of this man?",Estrogen (hormone),Finasteride (5a-reductase inhibitor),Mitoxantrone (chemotherapy agent),Nitrofurantoin (antibiotic),"The clinical features are typical of nodular prostatic hyperplasia causing a slight elevation of the PSA level. A PSA level that remains unchanged for 1 year, as in this case, is less likely to be found with prostate cancer. Finasteride is a 5a-reductase inhibitor that decreases the formation of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that binds to androgen receptors in prostatic stromal and epithelial cells, driving proliferation with prostate gland enlargement. However, a1-adrenergic blockers that diminish smooth muscle tone are somewhat more effective in treating nodular hyperplasia. Estrogen therapy has been used as antihormonal therapy in prostate cancer. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapy agent that, when given with prednisone, has been shown to be effective in treating advanced prostate cancers.

Carbamazepine in elderly causes:,Hypernatremia,Hyponatremia,Hyperkalemia,Hypokalemia,"Carbamazepine Chemically related to imipramine, it was introduced in the 1960s for trigeminal neuralgia; is now a first line antiepileptic drug. Carbamazepine modifies maximal electroshock seizures as well as raises threshold to PTZ and electroshock convulsions. It also inhibits kindling. Though its action on Na+ channels (prolongation of inactivated state) is similar to phenytoin, the profile of action on neuronal systems in brain is different. Carbamazepine exes a lithium-like therapeutic effect in mania and bipolar mood disorder. It also has antidiuretic action, probably by enhancing ADH action on renal tubules. Adverse effects Carbamazepine produces dose-related neurotoxicity-sedation, dizziness, veigo, diplopia and ataxia. Vomiting, diarrhoea, worsening of seizures are also seen with higher doses. Acute intoxication causes coma, convulsions and cardiovascular collapse. Hypersensitivity reactions are rashes, photosensitivity, hepatitis, lupus like syndrome, rarely agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia. Some degree of leucopenia due to hypersensitivity is more common. Water retention and hyponatremia can occur in the elderly because it enhances ADH action. Increased incidence of minor foetal malformations has been repoed. Its combination with valproate doubles teratogenic frequency. Ref: K D Tripathi 8th edition",B
Wilson disease is due to accumulation of:September 2005,Copper,Iron,Zinc,Nickel,"Ans. A: CopperIn Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis.Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension.On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms.About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia.About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body).Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease:Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea.They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination.Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule.Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.Hea: cardiomyopathy and arrythmiasHormones: hypoparathyroidism, infeility and habitual aboion.",A

Type of immunologic injury in AIHA (Auto immune hemolytic anemia),Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,"Ans. b (Type II) (Ref. Robbin's pathology 8th ed., Table no. 5-1; p. 121)Hypersensitivity Type IAnaphylactic and atopic - antigen cross-links IgE on presensitized mast cells and basophils, triggering release of vasoactive amines (i.e., histamine). Reaction develops rapidly after antigen exposure due to preformed antibody. E.g. include anaphylaxis, asthma, hives, local wheal and flare.First and Fast (anaphylaxis)Type I, II and Ml are all antibody mediated.Type IIAntibody mediated - IgM, IgG bind to antigen on ""enemy"" cell, leading to lysis (by complement) or phagocytosis.E.g. include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Rh disease (erythroblastosis fetalis), Goodpasture's syndrome, rheumatic fever,Graves' disease, bullous pemphigoid, myasthenia gravis, ITP.Cy-2-toxicAntibody and complement lead to membrane attack complex (MAC).Type IIIImmune complex - antigen-antibody complexes activate complement, which attracts neurophils; neurophils release lysosomal enzymes.Examples include PAN, immune complex GN/PSGN, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis. Serum sickness - an immune complex disease (type III) in which antibodies to the foreign proteins are produced (takes 5 days).Immune complex form and are deposited in membranes where they fix complement (leads to tissue damage). More common than Arthus reaction. Arthus reaction - a local subacute antibody-mediated hypersensitivity (type Ml) reaction.

"A patient with microcytic hypochromic anemia, Hb-9%, serum iron is 20 p./d1, ferritin level 800 mg/ml, transferrin percentage saturation is 64. What is possible diagnosis aEUR'",Atransferrinemia,Iron deficiency anemia,DMT 1 mutation,Hemochromatosis,"Atransferinemia Derangment in serum iron indices mentioned in the question : ? Microcytic hypochromic anemia Low serum iron - Normal (50-170 ,ug/dI) High serum. ferritin Normal (30-400 ng/ml) High serum transferrin Normal (30-50%) Let's look at the options first Iron deficiency anemia Can be easily ruled out as serum ferritin is low in Iron deficiency anemia. Hemochromatosis Hemochromato.sis is characterized by increased serum iron level. So, we are left with two options - Atransferinemia and DMT1 mutation These are classified in genetic forms of iron deficiency anemia. - Here is a brief discussion on genetic, forms of iron deficiency anemia. Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia -Iron deficiency anemia is an acquired disease. It is generally associated with low cost diet and bleeding. - Recent advances in iron metabolism led to the recognition of new entices of iron deficiency anemia in nonbleeding and ""high cost diet"" nourished individuals. These are known as genetic ,fonns of iron deficiency anemia. - Apparently rare these genetic .forms of iron deficiency anemia should be recognized by hematologists as they are refractory to classical oral or intravenous iron administration. These includes - Mutations in gene encoding DMT1 - Mutations in gene encoding glutaredoxin 5. - Hypotransferrinemia or Atransferriemia - Deficiency of ceruloplasmin - IRIDA (Iron Recractory, Iron Deficiency Anemia) Genetic forms of Iron deficiency anemia DMT1 Mutation Atransferrinemia Glutaredoxin 5 Aceruloplasminemia Age at diagnosis At bih Late onset Midlife Laic onset Anemia Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microcytic hypochromic Microctic hypochromic Serum iron High Low High Low Transferrin saturation High High or non measurable High Low Serum ferritin Low or normal fen-itin High High High ,o Ringed sideroblasts No No Yes No Liver iron overload Yes Yes Yes Yes Brain damage No No No Yes Hepcidin levels Low et Not y measured Not yet measured Not yet measured Coming back to the question The serum iron indices of the patient match those of Atransferrinemia i.e., low serum iron increased serum ferritn, increased transferring saturation. DMT1 can be ruled out as it has low ferritin level and high iron level. Atransferrinemia Transferrin is an iron carrying protein that transmits iron to the erythroblasts. Atransferrinemia or hypotransferrinemia results in reduced delivery of iron to erythroblasts and development of iron deficient anemia. This leads to massive but .futile iron absorption. The increased iron that is absorbed is not carried to the erythroid cell, instead. it is deposited elsewhere outside of erythroblasts. Iron is deposited in the visceral organs rather than in the bone marrow. DMT Lmutation DMT1 is a tran.smembrane protein involved in dietary nonheme iron uptake at the brush border of duodenal enterocytes and also plays crucial role in iron utilization at the endosomal membrane of the erythroid precursors. In DMT1 mutation the iron absorption in the duodenum continues because the absorption of heme iron is not affected. The mutation primarily affects iron utilization and not absorption. Iron utilization in erythroid precursors is disturbed leading to severe iron deficiency anemia.",A

Which of the following condition has increased risk ofmalignancy-,Metaplasia,Dysplasia,Hyperplasia,Inflammation,"Metaplasia is the reversible replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type. The change from one type of cell to another may be pa of a normal maturation process, or caused by some so of abnormal stimulus. In simplistic terms, it is as if the original cells are not robust enough to withstand their environment, so they transform into another cell type better suited to their environment. If the stimulus causing metaplasia is removed or ceases, tissues return to their normal pattern of differentiation. Metaplasia is not synonymous with dysplasia, and is not considered to be an actual cancer. It is also contrasted with heteroplasia, which is the spontaneous abnormal growth of cytologic and histologic elements. Today, metaplastic changes are usually considered to be an early phase of carcinogenesis, specifically for those with a history of cancers or who are known to be susceptible to carcinogenic changes. Metaplastic change is often viewed as a premalignant condition that requires immediate intervention, either surgical or medical, because metaplasia is associated with cancer.",A

Burkitts lymphoma is caused by -,EBV,HPV,HSV,RSV,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., EBV Burkitts lymphomao Burkitt's lymphoma is a B-cell lymphoma arising from germinal center B-cells. As this a tumor of mature B-cells it expresses IgM, CD19, CD20, CD10 and BCL 6 a phenotype consistent with a B-cell origin. However, unlike other tumors of germinal center origin, Burkitt lymphoma almost always fails to express the anti-apoptotie protein BCL-2.o All forms of Burkitt lymphoma are associated with translocations of c-Myc gene on chromosome 8. The usual translocation is t (8:14). Other less common translocations are t (2 : 8) and t (8 : 22).o Most of the patients in United States with Burkitt's lymphoma present with peripheral lymphadenopathy or an intra abdominal mass. The disease is typically rapidly progressive and has a propensity to metastasize to CNS.o Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in Burkitt's Lymphoma. Burkitt's Lymphoma was one of the first cancers shown to be curable by chemotherapy.Morphologyo A high mitotic index is typical, as is apoptotic tumor cell death, accounting for the presence of numerous tissue macrophages writh ingested nuclear debris. These benign macrophages are diffusely distributed among the tumor cells and have abundant clear cytoplasm, creating a characteristic ""starry sky"" pattern.o ""Starry sky"" pattern may also be seen in lymphoblastic lymphoma (acute lymphoblastic leukemia/ lymphoma: ALL), but it is more characteristic of Burkitts lymphoma.",A
Karyotyping is useful in diagnosis of-,Autosomal recessive disorders,X-linked recessive disorders,Chromosomal abnormalities,Biochemical abnormalities,"A karyotype is a photographic representation of a stained metaphase spread in which the chromosomes are arranged in order of decreasing length.A variety of techniques for staining chromosomes have been developed. With the widely used Giemsa stain (G banding) technique, each chromosome set can be seen to possess a distinctive pattern of alternating light and dark bands of variable widths . The use of banding techniques allows identification of each chromosome, and can detect and localize structural abnormalities. Karyotype analy- sis of chromosomes by G banding remains the classic approach for identifying changes at the chromosomal level; however, as might be expected, the resolution with this technique is fairly low. In order to identify subchromo- somal alterations, both focused analysis of chromosomal regions by FISH and global genomic approaches such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) have become popular. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) FISH utilizes DNA probes that recognize sequences spe- cific to chromosomal regions of greater than 100 kilobases in size, which defines the limit of resolution with this tech- nique for identifying chromosomal changes. Such probes are labeled with fluorescent dyes and applied to metaphase spreads or interphase nuclei. The probe hybridizes to its complementary sequence on the chromosome and thus labels the specific chromosomal region that can then be visualized under a fluorescence microscope. The ability of FISH to circumvent the need for dividing cells is invaluable when a rapid diagnosis is warranted (e.g., in a critically ill infant suspected of having an underlying genetic disorder). Such analysis can be performed on prenatal samples (e.g., cells obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy, or umbilical cord blood), peripheral blood lymphocytes, and even archival tissue sections. FISH has been used for detection of numeric abnormalities of chromosomes (aneuploidy) (Fig. 6-37, A); for the demonstration of subtle microdeletions (Fig. 6-37, B) or complex transloca- tions not detectable by routine karyotyping; for analysis of gene amplification (e.g., NMYC amplification in neuroblastomas); and for mapping newly isolated genes of interest to their chromosomal loci. Array-Based Genomic Hybridization It is obvious from the preceding discussion that FISH requires previous knowledge of the one or few specific chromosomal regions suspected of being altered in the test sample. However, chromosomal abnormalities may also be detected without previous knowledge of what these aber- rations may be, using a global strategy known as array- based CGH. Here the test DNA and a reference (normal) DNA are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes (most commonly, Cy5 and Cy3, which fluoresce red and green, respectively). The differentially labeled samples are then hybridized to an array of segments of genomic DNA ""spotted"" on a solid matrix, usually a glass slide (Fig. 6-38, A). These segments of DNA are representations of the human genome at regularly spaced intervals, and cover all 22 autosomes and the sex chromosome (Fig. 6-38, A). Amplifications and deletions in the test sample produce an increase or decrease in signal relative to the normal DNA that can be detected down to a 10-kilobase (kb) resolution (Fig. 6-38, B). Newer generations of microarrays using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (see fuher on) provide even higher resolution (with more than 1 million SNPs from the human genome on a single microarray!) and are currently being used to uncover copy number abnor- malities in a variety of diseases, from cancer to autism.

Studies suggest that alcohol induces mitochondrial damage, resulting in the release of mitochondrial AST, which, besides being the predominant form of AST in hepatocytes, has a significantly longer half-life than do extramitochondrial AST and ALT. This frequently results in the disproportionate elevation of AST over ALT, yielding an AST/ALT quotient, also called the DeRitis ratio, of 3-4:1 in alcohol-induced liver disease",A

Why is it so, lets see :-Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During fertilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mothers egg.All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmittedfrom an affectedfather to his children.Clinical Syndromes of Mitochondrial DiseasesDisorderPrimary FeaturesAdditional FeaturesChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)o External ophthalmoplegiao Bilateral ptosiso Mild proximal myopathyKearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS)o PEO onset before age 20 yearso Pigmentaiy retinopathyo One of the following CSF protein greater than 1 g/L, cerebellar ataxia, heart blocko Bilateral deafnesso Myopathyo Dysphagiao Diabetes mellituso Hypoparathyroidismo DementiaPearson syndromeo Sideroblastic anemia of childhoodo Panytopeniao Exocrine pancreatic failureo Renal tubular defectsInfantile myopathy and lactic acidosis (fetal and non-fataJ forms)o Hypotonia in the first year of lifeo Feeding and respiratory difficultieso Fatal form may be associated with a cardiomyopathy and/or the Toni-Fanconi-Debre syndromeLeigh syndroms (LS)o Subacute relapsing encephalopathyo Cerebellar and brain-stem signso Infantile onseto Basal ganglia lucencieso Maternal history of neurologic disease of Leigh syndromsNeurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP)o Late-childhood or adult-onset peripheral neuropathyo Ataxiao Pigmentary retinopathyo Basal ganglia lucencieso Abnormal eiectroretinogramo Sensorimotor neuropathyMitochondria] encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)o Stroke-like episodes before age 40 yearso Seizures and/or dementiao Ragged-red fibers and/or lactic acidosiso Diabetes mellituso Cardiomyopathy (initially hypertrophic: later dilated)o Bilateral deafnesso Pigmentary retinopathyo Cerebellar ataxiaMyoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF)o Myoclonuso Seizureso Cerebellar ataxiao Myopathyo Dementiao Optic atrophyo Bilateral deafnesso Peripheral neuropathyo Spasticityo Multiple lipomataLeber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)o Subacute painless bilateral visual failureo Males: females- 4:1o Median age of onset 24 yearso Dystoniao Cardiac pre-excitation syndromes",A

Which of the following is true about ataxia telangiectasia?,It is associated with normal immune function,Serum levels of IgA are increased,It is an autosomal recessive disease,There is absence of amphicytes in different organs,"Ataxia telangiectasia Presence of immunosuppression Unable to walk properly (Ataxia)aabnormal gait Dilated touosity affecting blood vessels Increase in the risk of development of cancers Autosomal recessive condition Defect in DNA repair genes (more prone for malignancies) Deficiency of IgA & IgG2 antibodies Presence of amphicytes (nucleus is very big, 2.5times bigger than normal) The immunologic defects are of variable severity and may affect both B and T cells. The most prominent humoral immune abnormalities are defective production of isotype switched antibodies, mainly IgA and IgG2. The T cell defects, which are usually less pronounced, are associated with thymic hypoplasia. Patients experience upper and lower respiratory tract bacterial infections, multiple autoimmune phenomena, and increasingly frequent cancers with advancing age.The gene responsible for this disorder is located on chromosome 11 and encodes a protein called ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) that is related structurally tophosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase, but is a protein kinase.The ATM protein is a sensor of DNA damage (doublestrand breaks) and it activates p53 by phosphorylation, which in turn can activate cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis in cells with damaged DNA. ATM has also been shown to contribute to the stability of DNA double-strand break complexes during V(D)J recombination. Because of these abnormalities in DNA repair, the generation of antigen receptors may be abnormal. In addition, defective DNA repair may lead to abnormalities in the DNA recombination events that are involved in antibody iso-type switching.",C

Raised serum level of lipoprotein-a is a predictor of -,Cirrhosis of liver,Rheumatic ahritis,Atherosclerosis,Cervical cancer,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Atherosclerosis Lipoprotein - (a) o Lp (a) is a lipoprotein similar to LDL in lipid and protein composition, but it contains an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a). o Elevated level of Lp (a) is associated with increased risk of atherosclerosis. o How does Lp (a) increase the risk of atherosclerosis ? In atherosclerosis, there is hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis due to associated inflammation (remind you-atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory condition). So there is consistent doposition of fibrin. Lp (a) has close homology to plasminogen and it competes with plosminogen for binding on the surface of endothelium. This result in reduced generation of plasmin from plasminogen --> Inhibition of endogenous fibrinolytic system. This enhances fuher fibrin deposition. In addition, Lp (a) is accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions. So, Lp (a) causes impaired cell surface fibrinolysis and progressive atherosclerosis.",C

Impoant difference between leuprolide and ganirelix is that ganirelix,Can be given orally,Immediately reduces gonadotropin secretion,Must be given in a pulsatile fashion,Initially stimulates release of LH and FSH,"Superactive / long-acting GnRH agonists Many analogues of GnRH, e.g. Goserelin, Leuprolide,Nafarelin, Triptorelin, have longer action (t 1/2 2-6 hours) because of high affinity for GnRH receptor and resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis. Because physiological release of GnRH is in pulses, whereas these agonists act continuously; they only initially increase Gn secretion. After 1-2 weeks they cause desensitization and down regulation of GnRH receptors ->inhibition of FSH and LH secretion -> suppression of gonadal function. GnRH antagonists:- Some more extensively substituted GnRH analogues act as GnRH receptor antagonists. They inhibit Gn secretion without causing initial stimulation. The early GnRH antagonists(Leuprolide, gosereline etc.)had the limitation of producing reactions due to histamine release. Later agents like ganirelix and cetrorelix have low histamine releasing potential and are being clinically used. Ref :- kd tripathi; pg num:-242,243",B

TGF-β is involved in all of the process of angiogenesis except:,Stimulates  fibroblast migration and proliferation,Formation of the vascular lumen,Increases the synthesis of collagen,Decreases the degradation of ECM,"TGF-β stimulates fibroblast migration and proliferation, increases the synthesis of collagen and fibronectin, and decreases the degradation of ECM by inhibiting metalloproteinases. TGF-β is involved not only in scar formation after injury but also in the development of fibrosis in lung, liver, and kidneys that follows chronic inflammation.TGF-β also has anti-inflammatory effects that serve to limit and terminate inflammatory responses. It does this by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation and the activity of other leukocytes.
VEGFs, mainly VEGF-A, stimulates both migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, thus initiating the process of capillary sprouting in angiogenesis. It promotes vasodilation by stimulating the production of NO and contributes to the formation of the vascular lumen.

Essential for tumor metastasis is?,Angiogenesis,Tumorogenesis,Apoptosis,Inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Angiogenesis * Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a part of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells.According to Harrison ""Cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis"".Angiogenesis in tumoursTumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels. Which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour.Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 1- 2 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels.Angiogenesis of tumour imparts two benefitsGrowth of tumourBy supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells.Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells.Distant metastasisWithout access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites.Tumour associated angiogenic factors * Tumours secrete certain factors which induce neovascularizationTwo most important are -Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF)Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF)Steps in the spread of cancer -Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesisThe first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cellsNormal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i.e. E cadherin.Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin.Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis.Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interactionLoosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin.Degradation of ECMTumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i.e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase.Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in certain cancers.These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved.Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen:-Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role.Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells.Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have properties of tumour cell chemotaxis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer.After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels.Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus.Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cellsTumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed.",A
For which one of the following tumours Gastrin is a biochemical marker-,Medullary carcinoma of thyroid,Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour,Pheochromocytoma,Gastrointestinal stromal tumor,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as ""islet cell tumors"", or ""pancreatic endocrine tumors"" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas. PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed ""islet cell carcinoma"". PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arises in the exocrine pancreas. Only 1 or 2% of clinically significant pancreas neoplasms are PanNETs.In the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, gastrin is produced at excessive levels, often by a gastrinoma (gastrin-producing tumor, mostly benign) of the duodenum or the pancreas. To investigate for hypergastrinemia (high blood levels of gastrin), a ""pentagastrin test"" can be performed. In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria (low stomach acidity). This results in an elevated gastrin level in an attempt to compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on gastrin secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration is elevated in viually all individuals with mucolipidosis type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria. This finding facilitates the diagnosis of patients with this neurogenetic disorder. Additionally, elevated gastrin levels may be present in chronic gastritis resulting from H pylori infection.",B

There is a direct relationship between the degree of troponin elevation and mortality.# However, minor troponin elevations have been reported and can be caused by congestive heart failure, myocarditis, or pulmonary embolism, or they may be false-positive readings. Thus, in patients with an unclear history, small troponin elevations may not be diagnostic of an ACS.In the first 6 hours, ECG is the gold standard. Cardiac troponin I rises after 4 hours and is*for 7-10 days; more specific than other protein markers. CK-MB is predominantly found in myocardium but can also be released from skeletal muscle.Useful in diagnosing reinfarction following acute Ml because levels return to normal after 48 hours. ECG changes can include ST elevation (STEMl, acute transmural infarct), ST depression (subendocardial infarct), and pathologic Q waves (evolving or old transmural infarct).Appearance of infarcted myocardiumCardiac enzymes TimeGrossHistologicTroponin 1 peaks first (4 h): remains elevated CK-MB peaks within 24 h: remains elevated1 hourNo gross changesIntracellular edema evidentLDH peaks later (about 2 days): remains elevated AST also rises and falls predictably in myocardial infarction, but, may indicate6-12 hours Wavy myocardial fibres,liver damage instead.12-24 hoursPale, cyanotic, edematousvacuolar degeneration, contraction band necrosisDefinition of abbreviations: AST, asparate aminotransferase; CK-MB, creatine kinase MB fraction; LDH, lactate24-48 hoursWell-demarcated, soft, paleMeutrophlic infiltrate, increased cytoplasmic eosinphilia, and coagulation necrosis become evidentdehydrogenase3-10 daysInfarct becomes soft, yellow, surrounded by hyperemic rimMonocytic infiltrate predominates at 72 hrs 2 weeksInfarct area is surrounded by granulation tissue that is gradually replaced by scar tissue. Creatine phosphokinase (CK) rises within 4-8 h and generally returns to normal by 48-72 h.# drawback :lack of specificity for STEMI, as CK may be elevated with muscle disease/trauma/ IM injection.# The MB isoenzyme of CK has the advantage over total CK that it is not present in significant concentrations in extracardiac tissue and therefore is considerably more specific. However, cardiac surgery, myocarditis, and electrical cardioversion often result in elevated serum levels of the MB isoenzyme.# A ratio (relative index) of CKMB mass:CK activity >2.5 suggests but is not diagnostic of a myocardial source.",B

The disease has three major features: (1) multiple neural tumors anywhere on or in the body (2) numerous pigmented cutaneous lesions (cafe au lait spots); and (3) pigmented iris hamaomas (Lisch nodules). Electron micrographic studies show that the tumors are the result of the proliferation of fibroblasts or Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves, possibly due to ras inactivation. There is no treatment, except for surgical resection of symptomatic tumors. Ependymoma can occur wherever ependymal cells are found. They are more common in children, and most often originate in the fouh ventricle. They are the most common intramedullary glioma of the spinal cord. Huntington disease, an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by severe degeneration of the caudate nucleus along with degenerative changes in the putamen and coex. In addition to chorea, these patients frequently suffer from athetoid movements, progressive dementia, and behavioral disorders. Marfan syndrome is due to a defect in the gene for fibrillin.

What is the likely inheritance pattern of this disease?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,X linked recessive,X linked dominant,"This child is suffering from Hemophilia which is an X linked recessive disorder. It leads to affected males and carrier females. Features of X linked recessive traits: Sons of women who are carriers have 50% chance of inheriting the disease, 50% daughters will also be carriers. All daughters of affected men are asymptomatic carriers, but sons of these men do not have the trait and cannot transmit it to their children. Examples of X linked recessive disorders are: Fragile X syndrome, Hemophilia A, B, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, G6PD deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease.

There are few characteristic microscopic features of chronic bronchitis, so it is mainly defined clinically by the presence of a persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis does not lead to diffuse pulmonary fibrosis. Granulomatous disease is more typical of sarcoidosis or mycobacterial infection. Lymphangitic metastases may fill lymphatic spaces and produce a reticulonodular pattern on a chest radiograph, but patients tend not to live long with such advanced cancer. Increased eosinophils are characteristic of bronchial asthma, which is an episodic disease unlikely to cause cor pulmonale.",D
The tumor suppressor gene p53 induces cell arrest at:,G2-M phase,S-G2 phase,G1-S phase,G0 phase,"p53 gene (TP53): Located on the short arm (p) of chromosome 17, p53 gene (also termed TP53 because of molecular weight of 53 KD for the protein) like pRB is inhibitory to cell cycle. However, p53 is normally present in very small amounts and accumulates only after DNA damage. 
The two major functions of p53 in the normal cell cycle are as under: 

In blocking mitotic activity: p53 inhibits the cyclins and CDKs and prevents the cell to enter G1 phase transiently. This breathing time in the cell cycle is utilised by the cell to repair the DNA damage. 
In promoting apoptosis: Normally, p53 acts together with another anti-oncogene, RB gene, and identifies the genes that have damaged DNA which cannot be repaired by inbuilt system. p53 directs such cells to apoptosis by activating apoptosis-inducing BAX gene, and thus bringing the defective cells to an end by apoptosis. This process operates in the cell cycle at G1 and G2 phases before the cell enters the S or M phase.

Because of these significant roles in cell cycle, p53 is called as 'protector of the genome’.

D: Anticapsular antibody is protective C neoformans reproduces by budding and forms round yeast like cells that are 3-6 um in diameter. Within the host and in ceain culture media, a large polysaccharide capsule surrounds each cell. C neoformans forms smooth, convex, yellow or tan colonies on solid media at 20-37degC (68-98.6degF). This fungus is identified based on its microscopic appearance, biochemical test results, and ability to grow at 37degC (98.6degF); most nonpathogenic Cryptococcus strains do not grow at this temperature. In addition, C. neoformans does not assimilate lactose and nitrates or produce pseudomycelia on cornmeal or rice-Tween agar. Most infections with C. neoformans consist of a lung infection.However, fungal meningitis, especially as a secondary infection for AIDS patients, is often caused by C. neoformans making it a paicularly dangerous fungus. Infections with this fungus are rare in those with fully functioning immune systems Blood and CSF should be cultured for fungi and submitted for cryptococcal antigen testing whenever CNS infection is suspected.

Ursodiol reduces the size of common bile duct gallstones by wof mechanisms,Decreasing the synthesis of bile,Increasing the cholesterol content in bile,Chelating Ca 2+ out of the stone,Slowly dissolving cholesterol from the stone,"GALLSTONE DISSOLVING DRUGS Cholesterol (CH) remains dissolved in bile with the help of bile salts (salts of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid conjugated with glycine and taurine) because bile salts are highly amphiphilic. A high CH : bile salt ratio ours crystallization of CH in bile; these crystals act as nidi for stone formation. Chenodeoxycholic acid (Chenodiol) and Ursodeoxycholic acid (Ursodiol) decrease CH content of bile, enabling solubilization of CH from stone surface. Ursodiol:- It is a hydroxy epimer of chenodiol, is more effective and needs to be used at lower doses. Complete dissolution of CH stones has been achieved in upto 50% cases. It is also much better tolerated. Calcification of some gall stones may be induced. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-671",D

A classic example of missense mutation -,Sickle cell disease,Thalassemia,Sideroblas,Hemochromatosis,"In sickle cell anemia there is missense type of point mutation.
Mutations

A mutation is a permanent change in the DNA.
Mutations that affect germ cells (sperm or ovum) are transmitted to progeny and may give rise to Inherited disease.
Mutations that affect somatic cells are not transmitted to progeny but are important in the genesis of cancers and congenital malformations.
Mutations may be classified into three categories –

1. Gene mutations

The vast majority of mutations associated with the hereditary disease are gene mutations.
These may of different types depending on whether it involves complete gene or single base -

(a) Point mutation

A single nucleotide base is substituted by a different base.
When a pyrimidine base is substituted by other pyrimidine base or a purine base is substituted by other purine → Transition.
When a purine is substituted by a pyrimidine or vice-versa → Transversion.
This may alter the code in a triplet of bases, i.e. in codon and leads to the replacement of one aminoacid by another in the gene product.
Because these mutations alter the meaning of the genetic code, they are often termed missense mutation.
An example is a sickle mutation in which CTC codon in beta-chain of hemoglobin that codes for glutamic acid are changed to CAC codon that codes for valine.
Another type of point mutation is a nonsense mutation in which a point mutation may change an amino acid codon to a stop codon.
Example is beta-thalassemia in which CAG codon in p-chain of hemoglobin that code for Glutamine is changed to stop codon UAG Acer point mutation.

b. Deletion and insertions

Deletion or insertion of one or two bases lead to alteracations in the reading frame of the DNA

Strand → frameshift mutation.

If the number of base pairs involved is three or a multiple of three frameshift does not occur (Because codon is triplet), instead an abnormal protein missing one or more amino acids is synthesized.

c. Trinucleotide repeat mutation

Normally a codon is triplet i.e., trinucleotide.
In this type of mutation a codon, i.e., trinucleotide sequence undergoes amplification and the Same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain,
For example in fragile X-syndrome, CGG codon is repeated 250-4000 times, ie. There are 250- 4000 tandem repeats of CGG

2. Chromosome mutation
The result from the rearrangement of genetic material that gives rise to visible structural changes in the Chromosome.

Which of the following pathogenic mechanisms is most likely to produce these findings?",Antigen-antibody complex-mediated injury,Antibody-mediated injury to basement membrane,Formation of mycolic acid as a result of tubercular infection,Generation of prostaglandins by basophil recruitment,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis has acute symptoms that occur soon after exposure to an antigen, often actinomycetes or fungi (molds) growing in contaminated HVAC systems (air conditioner or ventilation ducts). The symptoms improve when the patient leaves the environment where the antigen is located. The pulmonary pathologic changes are usually minimal, with interstitial mononuclear infiltrates. It is mainly a type III hypersensitivity reaction, but with more chronic exposure to the antigen, there may be a component of type IV hypersensitivity with granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. Attachment of antibody to basement membrane occurs in Goodpasture syndrome. Mycolic acid is a component of the cell wall of mycobacteria, and infections with these organisms are chronic, not episodic. Prostaglandins are produced by the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism during acute inflammation, and they mediate pain and vasodilation. Histamine release is characteristic of a type I hypersensitivity reaction that more typically occurs in allergic disease. A toxic injury is more typical of inhalation of a toxic gas, such as sulfur dioxide (so-called silo filler's disease).",A
All are effective against Tinea versicolor except:,Fluconaozole,Clotrimazole,Ketoconazole,Griseofulvin,"IMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES These are presently the most extensively used antifungal drugs. Four imidazoles are entirely topical, while ketoconazole is used both orally and topically. Two triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for systemic mycosis because of greater efficacy, longer half life fewer side effects and drug interactions. The imidazoles and triazoles have broadspectrum antifungal activity covering dermatophytes, Candida, other fungi involved in deep mycosis (except mucor), Nocardia, some grampositive and anaerobic bacteria, e.g. Staph. aureus, Strep. faecalis, Bac. fragilis and Leishmania. The mechanism of action of imidazoles and triazoles is the same. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme &;lanosterol l4--demethylase&; and thus impair ergosterol synthesis leading to a cascade of membrane abnormalities in the fungus. HETEROCYCLIC BENZOFURAN: Griseofulvin: It was one of the early antibiotics extracted from Penicillium griseofulvum. However, because of lack of antibacterial activity, little attention was paid to it: clinical utility in dermatophytosis was demonstrated only around 1960. Griseofulvin is active against most dermatophytes, including Epidermophyton, Trichophyton, Microsporum, etc., but not against Candida and other fungi causing deep mycosis. Bacteria are also insensitive. Dermatophytes actively concentrate it: this feature probably accounts for its selective toxicity. Resistance can be induced in vitro and this is associated with loss of concentrating ability. However, emergence of resistance during clinical use is rare.

The best stimulator of Vasopressin includes,Decreased K+,Increased K+,Hypotonicity,Hypertonicity,"(D) Hypertonicity > Main stimulus for secretion of vasopressin is increased osmolality of plasma.> Reduced volume of extracellular fluid also has this effect, but is a less sensitive mechanism.> Serum osmolarity/osmolality is affected by vasopressin due to its role in keeping proper electrolytic balance in the blood stream.> mproper balance can lead to dehydration, alkalosis, acidosis or other life-threatening changes. The hormone ADH is partly responsible for this process by controlling the amount of water the body retains from the kidney when filtering the blood stream.# Vasopressin has three main effects:> Increasing the water permeability of distal convoluted tubule & collecting duct cells in the kidney, thus allowing water reabsorption & excretion of more concentrated urine, i.e., antidiuresis. This occurs through increased transcription and insertion of water channels (Aquaporin-2) into the apical membrane of distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct epithelial cells. Aquaporins allow water to move down their osmotic gradient and out of the nephron, increasing the amount of water re-absorbed from the filtrate (forming urine) back into the bloodstream. This effect is mediated by V2 receptors. Vasopressin also increases the concentration of calcium in the collecting duct cells, by episodic release from intracellular stores. Vasopressin, acting through cAMP, also increases transcription of the aquaporin-2 gene, thus increasing the total number of aquaporin-2 molecules in collecting duct cells.> Increasing permeability of the inner medullary portion of the collecting duct to urea by regulating the cell surface expression of urea transporters, which facilitates its reabsorption into the medullary interstitium as it travels down the concentration gradient created by removing water from the connecting tubule, cortical collecting duct, and outer medullary collecting duct.> Acute increase of sodium absorption across the ascending loop of Henle. This adds to the countercurrent multiplication which aids in proper water reabsorption later in the distal tubule and collecting duct.# Drug Stimulators of Vasopressin secretion: Vincristine, cyclophosphamide, tricyclic antidepressants, nicotine, epinephrine, and high doses of morphine. Lithium, which inhibits the renal effects of vasopressin, also enhances vasopressin secretion. Inhibitors of vasopressin secretion: Ethanol, phenytoin, low doses of morphine, glucocorticoids, fluphenazine, haloperidol, promethazine, oxilorphan, and butorphanol. Carbamazepine has a renal action to produce antidiuresis in patients with central diabetes insipidus but actually inhibits vasopressin secretion by a central action.",D

Crystallization and storage of insulin requires ?,Mn++,Zn++,Cu++,Ca++,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Zn++ Zinc ions are essential for the formation of hexameric insulin and hormone crystallization. Following the synthesis of proinsulin, zinc promotes the formation of proinsulin hexamers and increases its solubility before conversion to insulin. Proinsulin binds 30 zinc ions, of which 2 to 4 are coordinated within the molecule. These zinc ions appear to be impoant for the solubility of proinsulin hexamers. With the removal of C-peptide from each proinsulin monomers, the resulting insulin increases its coordination of zinc to up to six ions per hexamer, which decreases its solubility and increases its crystallization within the secretory vesicle. The insulin, stored as crystalline hexamer, is resistant from proteolytic attack within the vesicle. Upon release of insulin into the bloodsteam, zinc is also released and the insulin becomes soluble in the blood.",B

"In gram-negative septicemia, early findings before shock sets in is -","↑ Cardiac output,↑ Total peripheral resistance","↑ Cardiac output, ↓ Total peripheral resistance","↓Cardiac output, ↑ Total peripheral resistance","↓ Cardiac output, ↓ Total peripheral resistance","Cardiac output and total peripheral resistance in septic shock

The decrease in peripheral resistance is the hallmark of early (hyperdynamic) stage of septic shock, this feature distinguishes it from other types of shock, e.g., hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock.
Decreased peripheral resistance leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output thus the cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite shock.
Decreased peripheral resistance and increased CO leads to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissues.
But, still, the tissues lack O2 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen.
So, increased blood flow and cardiac output are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis.
As sepsis progresses, hypodynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased Cardiac output and vasoconstriction (↑ peripheral resistance).",B

"In a study of patients with non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma, a nuclear gene is found to be actively transcribed to mRNA and is transported into the cell cytoplasm. A protein is translated from this mRNA, with up-regulation of BCL2. In a control group without lymphoma, translation of the mRNA does not occur. How is the silencing of this active gene's mRNA most likely to occur?",Absence of tRNA,Binding to miRNA,Methylation of DNA,Mutation of mRNA,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded by about 5% of the human genome. miRNAs do not encode for proteins, but bind and inactivate or cleave mRNA, preventing translation of proteins by mRNA. This effectively silences gene expression without affecting the gene directly. There is abundant transfer RNA (tRNA) present in the cytoplasm that is not a rate-limiting step to translation. DNA methylation, particularly at CG dinucleotides, is a way of suppressing gene expression directly, as is seen with genomic imprinting. Mutations that occur in genes in DNA may result in reduced mRNA production or abnormal protein production, but mRNA itself is not mutated. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for proteins that are mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathways",B

Zonal hepatic necrosis is associated with: March 2010,Diclofenac sodium,Acetaminophen,Indomethacin,Piroxicam,"Ans. B: Acetaminophen Patterns of liver injuries A. Zonal Necrosis This is the most common type of drug induced liver cell necrosis where the injury is largely confined to a paicular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure. Causes include: Carbon tetrachloride Paracetamol Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is usually well tolerated in prescribed dose but overdose is the most common cause of drug induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl- p-benzoquinone imine NAPQI, or NABQI) which is produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In overdose large amount of NAPQI is generated which overwhelm the detoxification process and lead to damage to liver cells. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. B. Hepatitis In this pattern hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug induced hepatitis. Viral hepatitis type picture is the commonest, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. Causes include: Halothane, isoniazid, phenytoin In the focal or non specific hepatitis scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltrate. Causes include: Aspirin Chronic hepatitis type is very similar to autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically as well as histologically. Causes include: Methyldopa, diclofenac C. Cholestasis Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and clinical picture is predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland without any parenchymal inflammation. In rare occasions it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts (Vanishing duct syndrome). Causes include: Bland: Oral contraceptive pills, anabolic steroid, androgens Inflammatory: Allopurinol, co-amoxiclav, carbamazepine Ductal: Chlorpromazine, flucloxacillin D. Steatosis Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation which leads to either small droplet (microvesicular) or large droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis where phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g. Tay-Sachs disease). Causes include: Microvesicular: Aspirin (Reye's syndrome), ketoprofen, tetracycline Macrovesicular: Acetamenophen, methotrexate Phospholipidosis: Amiodarone, total parenteral nutrition E. Granuloma Drug induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity.

Which one of the following diseases causes fatty change in liver?,Chronic alcoholism,Wilson's disease,Hepatitis C virus infection,Hepatitis B virus infection,"Fatty liver is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides and other fats in the liver cells. Chronic alcoholism is an impoant cause of fatty liver. Alcoholic fatty liver occur because alcohol alter normal lipid metabolism. Patients presentation depend on the degree of lipid infiltration. Common signs and symptoms include right upper quadrant pain, ascites, edema, jaundice and fever. Laboratory investigations show increased yGGT, seum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase. Histology shows large droplet fatty change in the liver. Diagnosis: Typical clinical features especially in patients with chronic alcoholism, diabetes or obesity suggest fatty liver.

In the stage of Grey hepatization -,WBC's fill the alveoli,RBC's fill the alveoli,Organisms fill the alveoli,Accumulation of fibrin,"Pathological changes of bacterial pneumonia 
A. Lobar pneumonia

Large confluent area of the lung or entire lobes is consolidated.
The lower lobes are affected most commonly.
There are four stages of the inflammatory response (Laennec's stages) -

1. Stage of congestion (initial phase)

The affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested.
Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid.
There are dilatation and congestion of alveolar capillaries.
There are few neutrophils and numerous bacteria in the alveolar fluid.

2. Stage of red hepatization (early consolidation)

The term hepatization refers to the liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section.
The affected lobe is red and firm.
The edema fluid of preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin.
There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils with extravasation of red cells.

3. Stage of gray hepatization (late consolidation)

The affected lobe is grayish brown, firm and dry.
The fibrin strand are dense and more numerous.
There is progressive disintigration of red cells and neutrophils.
The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate.
The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms.

4. Resolution

The previously solid and fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action.
Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion.
There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with areation.

B. Bronchopneumonia

Patchy areas of red or grey consolidation, more often multilobar and frequently bilateral and basal (lower zones) because of tendency of secretions to gravitate into lower lobes.
There is suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly neutrophils, filling bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces.
Alveolar septa thicken due to congested capillaries and leucocytic infiltration.",D
"Normal female, whose father was color blind married a normal man.

"Which of the following is known as the ""guardian of the genome""?",p53,Mdm2,pl4,ATM,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., p53 p53 is a tumour suppressor gene.At the time of DNA injury following irradiation, its level increases and it acts to cause cell cycle arrest (GTS)This arrest in cell cycle allows sufficient time for the repair of the D.N.A., and if the D.N.A repair cannot occur successfully, it directs the cell for apoptosisMechanism of p53When DNA damage occurs, p53 level is increased and it also becomes activated.- p53 assists in DNA repair by two mechanisms It acts through p 21 to cause cell cycle arrest, at G/S check point This allows time for D.N.A repairMeanwhile it causes D.N.A. repair through GADD 45If successful D.N.A. repair cannot occur through the above 2 mechanisms, the cell is directed by p53 to undergo apoptosis through BAX geneThus- p53 has the ability to control apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In response to DNA damage it is phosphorylated by genes that sense the damage and are involved in D.N.A. repair. p53 assists in DNA repair by causing G1 arrest and inducing DNA repair genes. A cell with damaged DNA that cannot be repaired is directed by p53 to undergo apoptosis. In view of these activities p53 has been right fully called ""guardian of the genome"".With homozygous loss of p53, DNA damage undergoes unrepaired mutation, becomes fixed in dividing cells and the cells turns on to a one way street leading to malignant transformation.So p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against the formation of cancer. So p53 acts as a molecular policeman that prevents propagation of genetically damaged cells.Also see Q no 75 of Nov 2004.",A

McCallum patches/plaques are usually seen in which chamber of the hea?,Left atrium,Right atrium,Left ventricle,Right ventricle,"During acute RF, diffuse inflammation and Aschoff bodies may be found in any of the three layers of the hea, resulting in pericarditis, myocarditis, or endocarditis (pancarditis). Inflammation of the endocardium and the left-sided valves typically results in fibrinoid necrosis within the cusps or tendinous cords. Overlying these necrotic foci and along the lines of closure are small (1 to 2 mm) vegetations, called verrucae. Thus, RHD is one of the forms of vegetative valve disease, each of which exhibit their own characteristic morphologic features. Subendocardial lesions, perhaps exacerbated by regurgitant jets (Mitral regurgation), can induce irregular thickenings called MacCallum plaques, usually in the left atrium. The cardinal anatomic changes of the mitral valve in chronic RHD are leaflet thickening, commissural fusion and shoening, and thickening and fusion of the tendinous cords. In chronic disease the mitral valve is viually always involved. The mitral valve is affected in isolation in roughly two thirds of RHD, and along with the aoic valve in another 25% of cases.",A

Which of the following is a better predictor of vagal tone,Basal heart rate,Ejection fraction,Stroke volume,LVET,"In the given options, all are influenced by sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Right vagus mainly innervates SA node, right atrium and left vagus innervates left atrium, AV node, a bundle of His. But vagal innervation of the ventricle is sparse. Hence, vagal stimulation strongly inhibits heart rate (strong - negative chronotropic effect) and poorly affects the force of contraction (weak - negative inotropic effect). Moreover, vagus dominates sympathetic nerve in controlling SA node activity at rest. Therefore, basal heart rate mainly depends on the vagal tone. Ejection fraction, stroke volume, LVET (Left Ventricular Ejection Time) are mainly influenced by sympathetic stimulation as the vagus has a weaker inotropic effect.",A

"A new drug is found to be highly lipid soluble. It is metabolized at a slower rate of 10% per hour. On intravenous injection, it produces general anaesthesia that lasts only for 15 min. This short duration of anaesthesia is due to:",Metabolism of the drug in liver,High plasma protein binding of the drug,Excretion of drug by kidney,Redistribution,"- Highly lipid soluble drugs get initially distributed to organs with high blood flow (Brain, heart, kidney etc). Later to less vascular tissues (muscle, fat). The plasma concentration falls and the drug is withdrawn from these sites. If the site of action was in one of the highly perfused organs, redistribution results in termination of drug action. Greater the lipid solubility of the drug, faster is its redistribution.

One of the following disorders is due to maternal disomy of chromosome 15 -,Prader Willi syndrome,Angelman syndrome,Hydatidiform mole,Klinefelter's syndrome,"Ans. is `b' i.e., Angleman syndrome o Don't get confused by previous explanations, where I have explained the deletion of paternal chromosome 15 in Prader Willi Syndrome. o To understand this question, one should know genomic imprinting as well as uniparental disomy. Genomic imprinting o A person inherits two copies of their genes one_ form their mother and one from their father Usually both copies of each gene are active or ""turned on"" in cells.. o In some cases however only one of the two copies is turned on. o Which copy is active depends on the parent of origin. Some genes are normally active only when they are inherited from a person's father. Others are active only when inherited from a person's mother. o This phenomenon is known as genomic imprinting. In genes that undergo genomic imprinting, the parent of origin is often marked or ""stamped"" on the gene during the formation of egg and sperm cells. This stamping process called methylation is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to ceain segments of DNA. These molecules identify which copy of a gene was inherited from the mother and which was inherited from father. The gene that are imprinted or stamped are ""silent""i.e.,they do not remain functional. Uniparental disomy (UDP) o Normally a person inherits one copy of each chromosome pair from biological mother and the other copy of the chromosome pair from biological father. Uniparental disomy occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no copies from the other parent. o UDP can occur as random event during the formation of egg or sperm cells or may happen in early fetal development. Example of Genomic imprinting and UDP The classical examples are Prader -Willi syndrome and Angleman syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome o Approximately 70% of affected individuals have a small deletion on long arm ofparenteral chromosome 15,i.e. paternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of paternal gene due to deletion.. Paternal gene Silenced (Paternal genomic imprinting) Maternal gene Only functional alle present o The remaining 30% of patients have maternal uniparenteral disomy for chromosome 15. That is they have two otherwise normal copies of maternal chromosome 15 and no paternal 15. o Thus Prader Willi syndrome ( in both above situations) results from the absence of paternal contribution to this region of chrmosome 15, whether by paternal deletion ( paternal genomic imprinting) or maternal UPD. Angleman syndrome o Most of the affected individuals have deletion on maternal chrmosome 15,i.e. maternal genomic imprinting. There is silencing of maternal gene due to deletion. Maternal gene Silenced (Maternal genomic imprinting) Paternal gene Only functional allel present o The remaining patients have paternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, i.e., they have two otherwise normal copies of paternal chromosome 15 and no maternal 15. o Thus Angleman syndrome results from the absence of maternal contribution to this region of chromossome 15, whether by maternal deletion ( maternal genomicimprinting) or paternal UDP.

The condition is characterised by a triad of features-- micronodular pigment cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation. On the basis of the last two features, the disease has also come to be termed as 'bronze diabetes'. Males predominate and manifest earlier since women have physiologic iron loss delaying the effects of excessive accumulation of iron. Haemochromatosis exists in 2 main forms: 1.Idiopathic (primary, genetic) haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of excessive accumulation of iron. 2.Secondary (acquired) haemochromatosis is gross iron overload with tissue injury arising secondary to other diseases such as thalassaemia, sideroblastic anaemias, alcoholic cirrhosis or multiple transfusions.

Wilson disease is due to accumulation of: September 2005,Copper,Iron,Zinc,Nickel,"Ans. A: Copper In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and poal hypeension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of pa of the body). Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease: Eyes: Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.

A patient is diagnosed with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Which of the following would be the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?,Erythropoietin,Famotidine,Fluorouracil,Omeprazole,"The patient in this question was diagnosed with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. One of the most impoant initial measures in the treatment of this condition is to control the acid hypersecretion. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and lansoprazole, are given at a dose of 40-120 mg/day, and titrated to achieve a basal acid output of In standard doses, proton pump inhibitors inhibit 90-98% of 24-hour acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors undergo rapid first-pass and systemic hepatic metabolism and have negligible renal clearance. Also know: Erythropoietin is a glycoprotein, normally produced in the kidneys, that stimulates stem cells to differentiate into rubriblasts, increases the rate of mitosis, increases the release of reticulocytes from the bone marrow and increases hemoglobin (Hgb) formation. EPO is indicated for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, zidovudine therapy, chemotherapy, and for reduction of allogeneic blood transfusions in surgery patients. Famotidine is an H2-antagonist that decreases gastric acid secretion by competitively and reversibly inhibiting histamine receptors on parietal cells. Although famotidine could potentially be used in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a proton pump inhibitor is a more appropriate treatment measure. Fluorouracil or 5-FU, is an example of an antimetabolite that blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. This results in interference with DNA synthesis, and to a lesser extent, RNA synthesis. 5-FU is indicated for the palliative management of colon rectum, breast, stomach and pancreatic carcinoma.

What type of RBC seen in chronic renal failure? -,Microcytic,Macrocytic,Normocytic,None.,"By definition, anemia refers to an absolute reduction of the total number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs). For practical purposes, anemia is considered when one or more of the following are decreased: hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell (RBC) count. This condition is a laboratory finding that signifies the presence of illness or disease; anemia should not be considered a diagnosis. Anemia usually is grouped into three etiologic categories: decreased RBC production, increased RBC destruction, and blood loss. Anemia of chronic illness and anemia of chronic kidney disease(CKD) both fall under the category of decreased RBC production. When the classification of anemia is based on the morphology of the RBCs, both anemia of chronic illness and chronic kidney disease usually fall under the classification of normochromic, normocytic anemia Ref Robbins 9/e pg 428",C

The inheritance pattern of Familial hypercholesterolemia is,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,"Mutations involving single genes follow one of three patterns of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Familial hypercholesterolemia Huntington disease Marfan syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Hereditary spherocytosis Neurofibromatosis, type 1 Adult polycystic kidney disease Familial Hypercholesterolemia Familial hypercholesterolemia is among the most common mendelian disorders; the frequency of the heterozygous condition is 1 in 500 in the general population. It is caused by a mutation in the LDLR gene that encodes the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the form in which 70% of total plasma cholesterol is transpoed. A brief review of the synthesis and transpo of cholesterol follows. Normal Cholesterol Metabolism. Cholesterol may be derived from the diet or from endogenous synthesis. Dietary triglycerides and cholesterol are incorporated into chylomicrons in the intestinal mucosa, which drain by way of the gut lymphatics into the blood. These chylomicrons are hydrolyzed by an endothelial lipoprotein lipase in the capillaries of muscle and fat. The chylomicron remnants, rich in cholesterol, are then delivered to the liver. Some of the cholesterol enters the metabolic pool (to be described), and some is excreted as free cholesterol or bile acids into the biliary tract. The endogenous synthesis of cholesterol and LDL begins in the liver (Fig. 6-2). The first step in the synthesis of LDL is the secretion of triglyceride-rich very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the liver into the blood. In the capillaries of adipose tissue and muscle, the VLDL paicle undergoes lipolysis and is conveed to intermediate- density lipoprotein (IDL). In comparison with VLDL, the content of triglyceride is reduced and that of cholesteryl esters enriched in intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), but IDL retains on its surface two of the three VLDL- associated apolipoproteins B-100 and E. Fuher metabo- lism of IDL occurs along two pathways: Most of the IDL paicles are directly taken up by the liver through the LDL receptor described later; others are conveed to cholesterol- rich LDL by a fuher loss of triglycerides and apolipopro- tein E. In the liver cells, IDL is recycled to generate VLDL. Two thirds of the resultant LDL paicles are metabo- lized by the LDL receptor pathway, and the rest is metabo- lized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipo- proteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transpo of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely impoant role in LDL metabolism. The first step in the receptor-mediated transpo of LDL involves binding to the cell surface receptor, followed by endocy- totic internalization inside so-called ""clathrin-coated pits"" (Fig. 6-3). Within the cell, the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomes, and the LDL molecule is enzymatically degraded, resulting ultimately in the release of free cholesterol into the cytoplasm. The cholesterol not only is used by the cell for membrane synthesis but also takes pa in intracel- lular cholesterol homeostasis by a sophisticated system of feed- back control: * It suppresses cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthetic pathway. * It stimulates the formation of cholesterol esters for storage of excess cholesterol. * It downregulates the synthesis of cell surface LDL recep- tors, thus protecting cells from excessive accumulation of cholesterol. The transpo of LDL by the scavenger receptors, alluded to earlier, seems to take place in cells of the mononuclear- phagocyte system and possibly in other cells as well. Monocytes and macrophages have receptors for chemically modified (e.g., acetylated or oxidized) LDLs. The amount catabolized by this ""scavenger receptor"" pathway is directly related to the plasma cholesterol level. (Robbins Basic Pathology,9th edition,pg no. 219)",B

The Fenton reaction leads to free radical generation when -,Radiant energy is absorbed by water,Hydrogen peroxide is formed by myeloperoxidase,Ferrous ions are conveed to ferric ions,Nitric oxide is conveed to peroxynitrite anion,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ferrous ions are conveed to ferric ions o Free radicals are generated through Fenton's reaction. o In this reaction iron is conveed from its ferrous to ferric form and a free radical is generated. i.e. (H202+Fe2+ --> Fe3++ OH++ OH-) o Note :- H202 can also react with copper instead of iron to produce free radicals. Free radicals o Free radicals are chemical species that have a single unpaired electron in the outer orbit. o Most of these are paially reduced reactive oxygen forms that are produced as an unavoidable byproduct of mitochondrial respiration --> also known as reactive oxygen species. o The most impoant are hydrogen peroxide (11202), Superoxide anion (02) and hydroxyl radical (OH). o Free radicals are highly reactive species and toxic --> they can damage the cell membrane and nucleic acids. o Free radicals initiate autocatalytic reactions, whereby molecules with which they react are themselves conveed into free radicals to propagate the chain of damage. o Free radicals are produced in several ways : ? I. Ionizing radiations (UV rays, X-rays) can hydrolyze water into hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) free radicals. Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals, e.g., CC14 can generate CC13. The reduction - oxidation reaction during normal metabolic process. During normal respiration, molecular oxygen is sequentially reduced by addition of electron to generate water. In this process small amount of H202, 02- and OH- are produced. o H202 generated, can interact with 02 to generate OH through the Haber-weiss reaction. H202+ 02 --> OH- + OH + 02 Rapid burst of superoxide (02) occur in activated neutrophils during inflammation with the help ofNADPH oxidase. Some intracellular oxidases, e.g., xanthine oxidase generate superoxide radicals. Transition metal such as iron and copper donate or accept free electrons and catalyze free radical formation (see above fenton reaction). Nitric oxide (NO) generated in endothelium, macrophages and neurons can also act as free radical. o Free radicals cause cell injury by ? I.

Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern in the pedigree given below-,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,"It is an X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance.
The features which suggest the X-linked dominant pattern of inheritance are-
A single abnormal X chromosome is sufficient to express the disease.
All of the female offspring’s of a diseased male XY will receive the abnormal X chromosome and express the disease, whereas none of the male offspring to the diseased father will have the disease (as sons don't receive X chromosome from their father).
A diseased mother can transmit the abnormal X chromosome to both daughter and sons equally.

Important facts 

If a female is transmitting the disease to all offspring’s (both males and females) and a male is not transmitting the disease to any child, it is mitochondrial inheritance.
If a male is transmitting the disease only to daughters (all daughters) and not to the sons whereas female transmit the disease to half daughters and half of the sons, it is X-linked dominant.
If only males are affected in a pedigree, it is likely to be an X-linked recessive disease (females act as carriers; only transmit the disease and themselves remain unaffected).
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to half of the offspring’s, it is an autosomal dominant disorder.
If there is no sex-predilection and affected individuals transmit the disease to one-fourth of the offspring’s, it is likely to be an autosomal recessive disorder.",D

Chloroquine is used in the treatment of :,DLE,Pemphigus,Psoriasis,Nummular eczema,"chloroquine is a rapidly acting erythrocytic schizontocide against all species of plasmodia; controls most clinical attacks in 1-2 days with disappearance of parasites from peripheral blood in 1-3 days. The mechanism of action of chloroquine is not completely known. It is actively concentrated by sensitive intraerythrocytic plasmodia: higher concentration is found in infected RBCs. By accumulating in the acidic vesicles of the parasite and because of its weakly basic nature, it raises the vesicular pH and thereby interferes with degradation of haemoglobin by parasitic lysosomes. Polymerization of toxic haeme to nontoxic parasite pigment hemozoin is inhibited by formation of chloroquine-heme complex. Heme itself or its complex with chloroquine then damages the plasmodial membranes. Clumping of pigment and changes in parasite membranes follow. Other related antimalarials like quinine, mefloquine, lumefantrine appear to act in an analogous manner.

The clinical manifestations of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation are all except:,Microthrombi,Sheehan  postpartum  pituitary  necrosis,Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome,Brain edema,"In DIC, microthrombi are most often found in the arterioles and capillaries of the kidneys, adrenals, brain, and heart, but no organ is spared. The glomeruli contain small fibrin thrombi. These may be associated with only a subtle, reactive swelling of the endothelial cells or varying degrees of focal glomerulitis.
The microvascular occlusions give rise to small infarcts in the renal cortex. In severe cases, the ischemia can destroy the entire cortex and cause bilateral renal cortical necrosis. Involvement of the adrenal glands can produce the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome.
Microinfarcts also are commonly encountered in the brain and are often surrounded by microscopic or gross foci of hemorrhage. These can give rise to bizarre neurologic signs. Similar changes are seen in the heart and often in the anterior pituitary.
DIC may contribute to the development of Sheehan postpartum pituitary necrosis.

"A three year old child is brought to the emergency depament having just ingested a large overdose of an antihistaminic drug. This drug is a weak base capable of entering most tissues including the brain. On physical examination the hea rate is 100/ minute, blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg and the respiratory rate is 20/ minute. In this case of poisoning:","Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NH4Cl, an acidifying agent","Urinary excretion would be accelerated by administration of NaHCO 3, an alkalinizing agent",More of the drug would be ionized at blood pH than at stomach pH,Absorption of the drug would be faster from the stomach than from the small intestine.,"This question can be solved by the knowledge that basic drugs are ionized in the acidic medium and vice-a-versa. This antihistaminic drug is a weak base and will be highly ionized in the acidic urine. As ionized drugs cannot be reabsorbed in the nephron, urinary acidifying agents like NH4Cl will accelerate the excretion of this agent. On the other hand, NaHCO3 will decrease its excretion by increasing the unionized form. Blood pH is slightly alkaline (7.4) whereas gastric pH is highly acidic. Basic drugs are ionized more in the acidic pH, therefore option (c) is false. Only unionized molecules can cross the membranes, therefore more drug will be absorbed by the small intestine (alkaline pH).",A

Hemochromatosis is a defect in metabolism of -,Iron,Copper,Magnesium,Calcium,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Iron o Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as the liver and pancreas.Hemochromatosiso Hemochromatosis is characterized by the excessive accumulation of body iron, most of which is deposited in parenchymal organs such as liver and pancreas.o The total body content of the iron is tightly regulated, as the daily losses are matched by gastrointestinal absorption. In hereditary hemochromatosis, regulation of intestinal absorption of dietary iron is lost, leading to net iron accumulation of 0.5 to 1.0 gm year.o It may be recalled that the total body iron pool ranges from 2-6 gm in normal adults; about 0.5 gm is stored in the liver 98% of which is hepatocytes. In hemochromatosis the iron accumulation may exceed 50 gm, over one third of which accumulates in the liver.o The iron accumulation is life long, the rate of net iron accumulation is 0.5 to 1.0 gm/year. The disease manifests itself typically after 20 gm of storage iron have accumulated. The disease first mainfests itself in the fifth to sixth decades of life.o Excessive iron is directly toxic to host tissueso The clinical features of hemochromatosis are characterized principally by deposition of excess iron in the following organs in decreasing order of severity.Liver (95%)o Usually the first organ to be affected,o Hepatomegaly seen in most of the cases,o Micronodular cirrhosis is characteristico Hepatocellular carcinoma develops in 30% patientsSkin (90%)o Excessive skin pigmentation (Bronzing of the skin)o Skin pigmentation results partially due to hemosiderin deposition and mainly due to melanin depositiono Usually diffuse or generalized, but more pronounced on the face, neck and extensor aspects of lower forearmsPancreas (65%)o Leads to diabetes mellitusJoints (25-50%)o Arthropathyo PolyarthritisCardiaco Congestive heart failureo Anyhthmiao Cardiomyopathy (Restrictive)Hypogonadismo These changes are primarily the result of decreased production of gonadotropins due to impairment of hypothalamic-pituitary' function by iron deposition however, primary' testicular dysfunction may be seen in some cases",A

"Negri bodies are characteristic of: September 2008, March 2013",Tetanus,Rabies,Polio,AIDS,"Ans. B: Rabies Since first described by Negri in 1903, the presence of the Negri bodies are practically pathognomic for rabies and are an impoant diagnostic finding. Negri bodies are discrete, intracytoplasmic, deeply eosinophilic inclusions that measure several microns in diameter. In about 75% of cases of rabies these can be seen on hematoxylin and eosin stained sections. They occur in neurons of the brain stem, paicularly those in the hippocampus, and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Ultrastructural studies have shown that Negri body consists of a mass of nucleocapsids surrounded by viral paicles budding from intracytoplasmic membranes. Those bodies can be seen in axons, and it is in this way that virus spreads from the central nervous system to many organs of the body. Because Negri bodies are usually seen in intact neurons, they are found away from the inflammatory, nonspecific lesions. Rabies viral antigens can be demonstrated in infected cells by means of fluorescent antibody technique. Antigens can be shown to be present in cells in the absence of Negri bodies, and hence this technique is much more sensitive than the search of sections of brain for the pathognomonic cytoplasmic inclusions.",B

"Two siblings with osteogenesis imperfect, but their parents are normal. Mechanism of inheritance is -",Anticipation,Genomic imprinting,Germ line mosaicism,New mutation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Germ line mosaicism o In some autosomal dominant disorders (e.g. osteogenesis imperfecta) phenotypically normal parents have more than one affected child. This clearly violates the law of inheritance. Studies indicate that gonadal (germ line) mosaicism may be responsible for such unusual inheritance. Germline mosaicism o Germline mosacism results from a mutation that occurs postzygotically during early embryonic development. In these a poion of the egg or sperm cells of a parent carries the mutation. o Because the mutation affects only cells destined to form the gonads the gametes carry the mutation but somatic cells of the individual are completely normal. o A phenotypically normal parent who has germ line mosaicism can transmit the disease causing mutation to the offspring through the mutant gamete. o Because the progenitor cells of the gamete carry the mutation there is a definite possibility that more than one child of such a parent would be affected. o Obviously, the likelihood of such an occurrence depends on the propoion of germ cells carrying the mutation.",C

Blockade of nerve conduction by a local anaesthetic is characterized by:,Greater potential to block a resting nerve as compared to a stimulated nerve,Need to cross the cell membrane to produce the block,Large myelinated fibers are blocked before the unmyelinated fibers,Cause consistent change of resting membrane potential,"Local anesthetics cross the neuronal membrane in un-ionized state and become ionized again in the neuron to block sodium channels. Due to this reason, sodium bicarbonate increases the rapidity of onset of action (LA are weak bases and in an alkaline medium easily cross the membrane).
Un-myelinated and weakly myelinated fibres are blocked first and then the myelinated ones.
These do not affect the resting membrane potential rather inhibit the depolarization.
Resting nerves are less sensitive to block by LA than the stimulated nerves.",B

Antithyroid drugs are the t/t of choice ; radioactive iodine is clearly contraindicated in pregnancy. Historically, propylthiouracil has been preferred over methimazole because transplacental spread was though to be lower, however, it has been proved that propylthiouracial and methimazole cross the placenta equally. As clearance of these drugs is very slow in the fetus, they tend to accumulate with the risk of fetal hypothyroidism and goitrogenesis. Current datas suggest that either may be used safely in the pregnant patients. The antithyroid drug dose should be minimal in order to keep the serum free thyroxine index in the upper half of the normal range. As pregnancy progresses, graves disease often improves and it is not uncommon for patients either to be on very low doses or off antithyroid drugs completely by the end of pregnancy. Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice in nursing women since very small amounts of the drug appear in the breast milk, and do not appear to affect thyroid function in the suckling baby.

Allopurinol is metabolized by the same enzyme to alloxanthine which is a long acting inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. These are indicated as drug of choice for chronic gout in the inter-critical period (between two acute attacks) and also with anticancer drugs (to decrease secondary hyperuricemia). 6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine are metabolized by xanthine oxidase; therefore dose of these drugs should be decreased when given with allopurinol. Allopurinol is also used as an adjuvant to sodium stibogluconate in the treatment of kala azar. It is contra-indicated in acute gout because uric acid has inhibitory effect on release of cytokines and allopurinol may aggravate the inflammation by reducing uric acid. Most frequent adverse effect with xanthine oxidase inhibitors is precipitation of acute attack of gout. There is strong association between HLA-B*5801 and allopurinol hypersensitivity Combined use of allopurinol and ampicillin causes a drug rash in 20% of patients. * Allopurinol requires dose adjustment in renal failure whereas febuxostat can be administered without dose adjustment.

All are affected in Graft-Versus host reaction ?,Skin,GLT,Liver,Lung,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Lung Graft versus host disease o Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. o Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. o Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. o When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. o In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between HIA matched donor and recipient. o Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. o Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. o Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. o Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. o Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. o Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections.

Pulmonary and renal involvement can be life-threatening. C-ANCAs (antibodies mainly directed against neutrophil proteinase 3) are found in more than 90% of cases. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a hyperplastic medial disorder, usually involving renal and carotid arteries; on angiography, it appears as a ""string of beads"" caused by thickened fibromuscular ridges adjacent to less involved areas of the arterial wall. Granuloma pyogenicum is an inflammatory response that can produce a nodular mass, often on the gingiva or the skin. Kaposi sarcoma can produce plaque-like to nodular masses that are composed of irregular vascular spaces lined by atypical-appearing endothelial cells; skin involvement is most common, but visceral organ involvement can occur. Polyarteritis nodosa most often involves small muscular arteries, and sometimes veins.

In contrast, schwannomas generally appear as extremely cellular spindle cell neoplasms, sometimes with metaplastic elements of bone, cailage, and skeletal muscle. Medulloblastomas occur exclusively in the cerebellum and microscopically are highly cellular with uniform nuclei, scant cytoplasm, and, in about one-third of cases, rosette formation centered by neurofibrillary material. Oligodendrogliomas, which are marked by foci of calcification in 70% of cases, commonly show a pattern of uniform cellularity and are composed of round cells with small dark nuclei, clear cytoplasm, and a clearly defined cell membrane. Ependymomas are distinguished by ependymal rosettes, which are ductlike structures with a central lumen around which columnar tumor cells are arranged in a concentric fashion.

Plasma half life of insulin is:March 2013,1 minute,10 minutes,1 hour,2 hours,"Ans. B i.e. 10 minutesDegradation of insulinOnce an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell.The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney.The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation.Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of insulin-degrading enzyme.An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the pancreatic beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin half-life - 4-6 minutes)",B
cause of oedema in Glomenulonephritis is :,Increased hydrostatic pressure.,Sodium and water retention.,Lymphatic obstruction.,Reduced plasma oncotic pressure.,"The nephrotic oedema is classically more severe and marked and is present in the subcutaneous tissues as well as in the visceral organs. The affected organ is enlarged and heavy with tense capsule.
Microscopically, the oedema fluid separates the connective tissue fibres of subcutaneous tissues. Depending upon the protein content, the oedema fluid may appear homogenous, pale, eosinophilic or may be deeply eosinophilic and granular.
Oedema in glomerulonephritis. Oedema occurs in conditions with diffuse glomerular disease such as in acute diffuse glomerulonephritis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (nephritic oedema). In contrast to nephrotic oedema, nephritic oedema is not due to hypoproteinaemia but is due to excessive reabsorption of sodium and water in the renal tubules via renin-angiotensin-aldosterone mechanism. The protein content of oedema fluid in glomerulonephritis is quite low (less than 0.5 g / dl).
The nephritic oedema is usually mild as compared to nephrotic oedema and begins in the loose tissue such as on the face around eyes, ankles and genitalia. Oedema in these conditions is usually not affected by gravity (unlike cardiac oedema).",B
All of the following statements about hormone replacement therapy (H) are true except ?,It increases the risk of coronary aery disease,It increases bone mineral density,It increases the risk of breast cancer,It increases the risk of endometrial cancer.,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., It increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of MI (coronary aery disease). The increased risk is attributed to progestin component. o H restore Ca++ balance, fuher bone loss is prevented and the excess fracture risk is nullified. o There is a higher incidence of breast cancer. o Risk for endometrial carcinoma is not increased as protective effect of progestin nullify the carcinogenic effect of estrogen. o There is increased risk for gall stone and migraine. o There is a small protective effective of H on colorectal cancer. Note :? o Usually in H combination of estrogen and progestin is given (combined H), except in hysterectimized women where estrogen alone is given. o With estrogen alone there is increased risk of endometrial cancer and decrease risk of coronary aery disease (as estrogen increases HDL and decreases LDL and triglyceride level). o So for H with estrogen alone the answer of this question will change. In that case it will be option 'a' i.e., increased risk of coronary aery disease.",D

"In Von willebrand disease, there is -",Factor VII deficiency,Factor VIII C deficiency,Factor X deficiency,Defects in vWF,"Von willebrand disease is the most common hereditary coagulation disorder due to qualitative or quantitative defect in vWF. von Willebrand Disease von Willebrand disease is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disorder. It usually presents as spontaneous bleed- ing from mucous membranes, excessive bleeding from wounds, and menorrhagia. It is underrecognized, as the diagnosis requires sophisticated tests and the clinical manifestations often are quite mild. Actually, this disease is surprisingly prevalent, paicularly in persons of European descent. It is estimated that approximately 1% of people in the United States have von Willebrand disease, making it the most common inher- ited bleeding disorder. People with von Willebrand disease have compound defects in platelet function and coagulation, but in most cases only the platelet defect produces clinical findings. The exceptions are rare patients with homozygous von Willebrand disease, in whom there is a concomitant defi- ciency of factor VIII severe enough to produce features resembling those of hemophilia (described later on). The classic and most common variant of von Willebrand disease (type I) is an autosomal dominant disorder in which the quantity of circulating vWF is reduced. There is also a measur- able but clinically insignificant decrease in factor VIII levels. The other, less common varieties of von Willebrand disease are caused by mutations that produce both qualita- tive and quantitative defects in vWF. Type II is divided into several subtypes characterized by the selective loss of high- molecular-weight multimers of vWF. Because these large mul- timers are the most active form, there is a functional deficiency of vWF. In type IIA, the high-molecular-weight multimers are not synthesized, leading to a true deficiency. In type IIB, abnormal ""hyperfunctional"" high-molecular- weight multimers are synthesized that are rapidly removed from the circulation. These high-molecular-weight multiA mers cause spontaneous platelet aggregation (a situation reminiscent of the very-high-molecular-weight multimer aggregates seen in TTP); indeed, some people with type IIB von Willebrand disease have mild chronic thrombocytope- nia, presumably due to platelet consumption.

Which of the following helps in differentiation of follicular carcinoma from follicular adenoma of thyroid gland?,Hurthle cell change,Lining of tall columnar and cuboidal cells,Vascular invasion,Increased mitoses,"Robbins clearly write…. ‘Microscopically, most follicular carcinomas are composed of fairly uniform cells forming small follicles. Follicular carcinomas may be grossly infiltrative or minimally invasive. The latter are sharply demarcated lesions that may be impossible to distinguish from follicular adenomas on gross examination. This distinction requires extensive histologic sampling of the tumor-capsule-thyroid interface, to exclude capsular and/or vascular invasion. Extensive invasion of adjacent thyroid parenchyma makes the diagnosis of carcinoma obvious in some cases’.
Ideal answer for a question for diagnosis of follicular cancer is capsular invasion (better than even vascular invasion) but in the given options, vascular invasion is the answer of choice.
Follicular Carcinoma: brushing up key points

It is the 2nd most common form of thyroid cancer

Lamotrigine has common side effects of:,Rash,Irritability,Nephrotoxicity,Behavioral disturbances,"Lamotrigine A new anticonvulsant having carbamazepine-like action profile: modifies maximal electroshock and decreases electrically evoked as well as photic after-discharge duration. Prolongation of Na+ channel inactivation and suppression of high frequency firing has been demonstrated. In addition, it may directly block voltage sensitive Na+ channels, thus stabilizing the presynaptic membrane and preventing release of excitatory neurotransmitters, mainly glutamate and aspaate. This may account for its broader-spectrum of antiseizure efficacy. However, it does not antagonize PTZ seizures or block NMDA type of glutamate receptors Lamotrigine is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic. Initially found useful as add-on therapy in refractory cases of paial seizures and GTCS, it has now been shown effective as monotherapy as well. Absence and myoclonic or akinetic epilepsy cases have also been successfully treated. Reduction in seizure frequency or complete control is obtained as frequently as with carbamazepine. Lamotrigine is well absorbed orally and metabolized completely in liver. Its t half is 24 hr, but is reduced to -16 hr in patients receiving phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone. On the contrary valproate inhibits glucuronidation of lamotrigine and doubles its blood level, but valproate levels are lowered by lamotrigine. Reduce the dose of lamotrigine to half in patients taking valproate. However, metabolism of other anticonvulsants and oral contraceptives is not altered. Side effects are sleepiness, dizziness, diplopia, ataxia and vomiting. In some comparative trials lamotrigine has been found to be better tolerated than carbamazepine or phenytoin.

Which of the following chelating agent is the degradation product of Penicillin?,EDTA,Dimercaprol,Penicillamine,Desferioxamine,"Penicillamine- It is obtained as a degradation product of penicillin. It was found to have a strong copper chelating propey and was used in 1956 for Wilson's disease. It selectively chelates Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn. The d-isomer is used therapeutically because the 1-isomer and the racemate produce optic neuritis and are more toxic. It is adequately absorbed after oral administration, little metabolized in the body and excreted in urine and feces. Uses 1. Wilson's disease (Hepatolenticular degeneration): This is due to a genetic deficiency of ceruloplasmin, a protein which normally binds and disposes of Cu from the body. In its absence, the plasma concentration of free Cu is high which gets deposited in the liver, substantia nigra, basal ganglia of brain, and causes local degeneration. Life long therapy is needed to prevent progression of the disease. Dose: 0.5-1 g daily in divided doses 1 hour before or 2 hour after meals to avoid chelation of dietary metals. 2. Copper/mercury poisoning: 1-1.5 g/day is given for a few days. It is the drug of choice for Cu poisoning and alternative drug to dimercaprol/ succimer for Hg poisoning. 3. Chronic lead poisoning: It may be used as an adjuvant to CaNa2EDTA, but succimer is preferred. 4. Cystinuria and cystine stones: It promotes the excretion of cysteine and prevents its precipitation in the urinary tract because penicillamine- cysteine complex is more soluble than dicysteine (cystine). 5. Scleroderma: Penicillamine benefits by increasing soluble collagen. It was used as a disease-modifying drug in rheumatoid ahritis but has been replaced now by safer drugs Adverse effects Sho-term administration (as metal chelator) of penicillamine does not cause much problem. Various cutaneous reactions, itching and febrile episodes may occur. However, long-term use produces pronounced toxicity. Dermatological, renal, hematological and collagen reaction saw.

NK receptor antagonist that prevents vomiting ?,Bosutran,Gramisetron,Ondansetran,Aprepitant,"Ans. is d i.e., Aprepitant Aprepitant Aprepitant is an antiemetic substance that belongs to a class of drugs called substance P antagonists. The compound mediates its effect by blocking the neurokinim 1 (NK1) receptor. Ceain regions of brain have high expression of NK1 receptors. Substance P acts on these receptors and is responsible for chemotheraphy induced nausea and vomiting. Aprepitant acts as a substance P antagonist on NK1 receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for Serotonin 5-HT3, dopamine or coicosteroid receptors. Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier. Aprepitant is used for chemotherapy induced nausea & vomiting (CINV), and post- operative nausea & vomiting (PONY). After absorption aprepitant is bound extensively to plasma proteins (>95%); it is metabolized avidly, primarily by hepatic CYP 3A4 and is excreted in the stools.

Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2.5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2.5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",C

Letrozole belongs to which group?,SERM,SERD,LHRH analogues,Aromatse inhibitors,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Aromatase inhibitors Aromatase inhibitorso Aromatase inhibitors are drugs which inhibit the enzyme Aromatase.o Aromatase is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone (androgens) to estrogens.o This conversion of androgens to estrogens occur in several tissues including ovary, adrenal cortex, peripheral tissues.o Inhibition of Aromatase leads to decrease in estrogen level.o Aromatase inhibitors prevent the conversion of androgens to estrogens only in postmenopausal women, not in premenopausal women.o In premenopausal women, as the level of estrogens decrease it activates the pituitary hypothalamic axis. Activation of pituitary hypothalamic axis leads to increased secretion of pituitary gonadotropins. The pituitary gonadotropins inturn increase the secretion of estrogens. Thus the estrogen level returns back to their normal level.o On the other hand aromatase inhibitors effectively decrease the secretion of estrogen in postmenopausal women.o In postmenopausal women, the production of estrogen from androgens occurs, only in extraovarian sites such as peripheral tissues where the conversion of androgens to estrogens is blocked by aromatase inhibitors.Use of aromatase inhibitorso Aromatase inhibitors are used in the t/t of Hormone receptor positive breast carcinomas in postmenopausal women. They are not effective in premenopausal women.How are Aromatase inhibitors useful in Breast carcinomas ?o In breast carcinomas, estrogen delivers growth signals to the hormone receptors. The hormone receptors upon receiving the growth signals, cause the proliferation of tumor cells,o After the inhibition by aromatase inhibitors, estrogen level decreases, this leads to lesser delivery of growth signals and in turn lesser proliferation of tumor cells.Aromatase inhibitors are of two types :o Type I (steroidal) aromatase inhibitor - They cause irreversible inhibition of aromatase, e.g. Exmestane. formestane.o Type II (non-steroidal) aromatase inhibitor - They cause reversible inhibition of aromatase e.g. Anastrazole, Letrozole, vorozale.o Above classification is based on chemical structure (steroidal or non-steroidal ) and type of inhibition (reversible or irreversible). Based on the evolution the aromatase inibitors are:First generation - AminoglotethimideSecond generation - Steroidal type I(Example, formestane), non-steroidal type II (Anastrazole, Letrozole, Vorozole, fadrozole)o Side effects - Hot flushes, nausea, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, thinning of hair and Joint Pain (Arthralgia) and increased risk of fracture.o There is no endometrial proliferation (no risk of endometrial carcinoma), no risk of venous thromboembolism and no deterioration of lipid profile.Remembero Anastrozole and letrozole are nonsteroidol compound, while exemestane is steroidol.o Exemestane also has weak androgenic activity',o Anastrozole is more potent than letrozole.o First generation aromatase inhibitors - Aminoglutethimide.o Second generation aromatase inhibitors - Letrozole, anastrozole, fadrozole and exemestone.",D

"A 70 year old woman dies in a nursing home after a hea attack. The time of onset of her clinical symptomatology and the cause of death are unceain; fuhermore, the possibility of neglect is being considered. Therefore, an autopsy investigation is arranged. The forensic pathologist discovers acute thrombosis involving the posterior descending branch of the right coronary aery with resultant myocardial infarction (MI) in the posterior third of the interventricular septum. Histologically, there is coagulation necrosis with associated abundant neutrophilic infiltration. Histiocytes and lymphocytes are scanty. Which of the following is the approximate period between the onset of pain (ie, beginning of ischemic injury) and death?",1 hour,12 hours,2 days,5 days,"Following irreversible ischemic injury, the hea (and any other organ) displays an orderly sequence of events that progresses from necrosis of parenchymal cells to inflammatory reaction, granulation tissue, and scar healing. Although ischemic injury manifests with pain almost immediately following vascular occlusion, histologic evidence of necrosis lags behind the clinical symptoms. At 1 hour after ischemia, there is no morphologic change indicative of necrosis. The first signs of necrosis appear 12 hours after irreversible ischemia: myocytes appear intensely eosinophilic and wavy, but there is no inflammatory reaction yet. Acute inflammatory cells (neutrophils) infiltrate the infarcted area beginning 1 day and peaking at approximately 2-3 days after injury. This acute inflammatory response paially overlaps with the subsequent influx of lymphocytes and histiocytes. Reabsorption of necrotic myofibers by histiocytes, as well as proliferation of small blood vessels, marks early formation of granulation tissue at around 5 days.

"A 30-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug abuse is admitted to a hospital for rapidly progressive malaise, fever, and chills. On physical examination, subungual splinter hemorrhages and a systolic murmur are detected. Blood cultures are positive for Staphylococcus aureus. She died of myocardial infarction on her third hospital day. Which of the following was the underlying condition leading to the patient's demise?",Acute infective endocarditis,Carcinoid hea disease,Libman-Sacks endocarditis,Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis,"Infective endocarditis leads to formation of bulky and friable vegetations on the valvular leaflets. The vegetations are composed of fibrin, neutrophils, and colonies of bacteria that cause erosion of underlying cardiac structures. Fragments of infected vegetations may detach and cause pulmonary or systemic septic embolism. Splinter hemorrhages in the nail bed and petechiae in skin and mucosae are also due to microscopic septic emboli. In this case, myocardial infarction was probably due to a septic embolus in the coronary circulation. If infective endocarditis is due to a virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers), a tumultuous clinical course ensues, associated with high moality. With less virulent organisms, such as Streptococci viridans, Subacute infective endocarditis is the resultant clinical picture. Subacute endocarditis arises in patients with previously malformed or damaged valves and is associated with a slower course and a better prognosis. Also Know: Carcinoid hea disease is caused by serotonin-producing carcinoids in the liver or lungs. Fibrosis of the endocardium ensues, affecting the right hea in the case of hepatic carcinoids and the left hea for pulmonary carcinoids. Thickening and rigidity of valvular leaflets are characteristic gross findings. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is a non-infective form of endocarditis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The vegetations are small and regularly aligned along the valvular margins. Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis was previously known as marantic endocarditis, being associated with debilitating conditions such as disseminated neoplasms. Increased coagulability is probably the underlying pathogenesis. The lesions are small vegetations similar to Libman-Sacks endocarditis.

Chronic granulomatous disease results from inherited defects in the genes encoding components of phagocyte oxidase, which generates superoxide (O2* -). The most common variants are an X-linked defect in one of the membrane-bound components (gp91phox) and autosomal recessive defects in the genes encoding two of the cytoplasmic components (p47phox and p67phox). The name of this disease comes from the macrophage-rich chronic inflammatory reaction that tries to control the infection when the initial neutrophil defence is inadequate.

For this reason, orchiectomy is equally as effective as moderate-dose DES.# In the event that orchiectomy is not accepted by the patient, testicular androgen suppression can also be effected by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists such as leuprolide and goserelin. These agents cause tonic stimulation of the LHRH receptor, with the loss of its normal pulsatile activation resulting in its desensitization and decreased output of LH by the anterior pituitary. Therefore, as primary hormonal manipulation in prostate cancer one can choose orchiectomy or leuprolide, not both.# The addition of actual antagonists of androgens acting at the androgen receptor, including flutamide or bicalutamide, is of uncertain additional benefit in extending overall response duration, but it clearly prevents the activation of androgen receptors by adrenal androgens, and the combined use of orchiectomy or leuprolide plus flutamide is referred to as ""total androgen blockade.""",A

Stage of congestion (initial phase)o The affected lobe is enlarged, heavy, dark red and congested,o Cut surface exudes blood-stained frothy fluid,o There is dilatation and congestion of alveolar capillaries,o There are few neutrophils and numerous bacteria in the alveolar fluid.2. Stage of red hepatization (early consolidation)o The term hepatization refers to liver-like consistency of the affected lobe on cut section,o The affected lobe is red and firm.o The edema fluid of preceding stage is replaced by strands of fibrin,o There is marked cellular exudate of neutrophils with extravasation of red cells.3. Stage of gray hepatization (late consolidation)o The affected lobe is grayish brown, firm and dry.o The fibrin strand are dense and more numerous.o There is progressive disintigration of red cells and neutrophils,o The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate,o The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms.4. Resolutiono The previously solid and fibrinous constituent is liquefied by enzymatic action.o Granular and fragmented strands of fibrin in the alveolar spaces are seen due to progressive enzymatic digestion.o There is progressive removal of fluid content as well as cellular exudate from the air spaces, resulting in restoration of normal lung parenchyma with areation.B.Bronchopneumoniao Patchy areas of red or grey consolidation, more often multilobar and frequently bilateral and basal (lower zones) because of tendency of secretions to gravitate into lower lobes,o There is suppurative exudate, consisting chiefly neutrophils, filling bronchi, bronchioles and adjacent alveolar spaces.o Alveolar septa thicken due to congested capillaries and leucocytic infiltration.",D

Recurrence is common in pleomorphic adenoma because of:,Metastasis,Incomplete capsule,Highly aggressive nature,All of the above,"Pleomorphic Adenoma:
Local enucleation should be avoided  because the entire tumor may not be removed or the capsule may be violated, resulting in seeding of  the tumor bed. With adequate surgery the prognosis is excellent, with a cure rate of more than 95%. The risk of recurrence appears to be lower for tumors of the minor glands. Conservative enucleation of parotid tumors often results in recurrence, with management of these cases made difficult as a result of multifocal seeding of the primary tumor bed. In such cases, multiple recurrences are not unusual and may necessitate adjuvant radiation therapy. Tumors with a predominantly myxoid appearance are more susceptible to recur than those with other microscopic patterns.
Key Concept:
One of the characteristic is the microscopic presentation of tumour outside the Incomplete Capsule. So, the recurrence of pleomorphic adenoma is due to Incomplete Capsule.

Most common type of emphysema is: March 2013,Centriacinar,Panacinar,Paraseptal,Irregular,"Ans. A i.e. Centriacinar Emphysema It is COPD. It is defined pathologically as an abnormal permanent enlargement of air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, accompanied by the destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis. It frequently occurs in association with chronic bronchitis. Patients have been classified as having COPD with either emphysema or chronic bronchitis predominance. The 3 described morphological types of emphysema are centriacinar, panacinar, and paraseptal. Centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs. - Panacinar emphysema destroys the entire alveolus uniformly and is predominant in the lower half of the lungs. Panacinar emphysema generally is observed in patients with homozygous alfal antitrypsin deficiency. In people who smoke, focal panacinar emphysema at the lung bases may accompany centriacinar emphysema. - Paraseptal emphysema, also known as distal acinar emphysema, preferentially involves the distal airway structures, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs. The process is localized around the septae of the lungs or pleura. Although airflow frequently is preserved, the apical bullae may lead to spontaneous pneumothorax. Giant bullae occasionally cause severe compression of adjacent lung tissue.",A

Metabolite of progesterone in urine,Pregnenolone,17 hydroxypregnenolone,Pregnanediol,Pregnanetriol,Metabolites of progesterone may be classified into 3 groups based on degree of reduction. Pregnanediones: the C4-5 double bond is reduced producing 2 pregnanediones and allopregnanediones Pregnanolones: the keto group at C3 is reduced producing a hydroxyl groups in alpha and beta orientation. Urinary pregnanolones exit in alpha orientation Pregnanediols: keto group at c20 is reduced and compounds with c20 hydroxyl groups in alpha orientation are quantitatively more impoant. Hence urinary measurement of pregnanediols can be used as an index of endogenous production of progesterone and also its concentration correlates well with many clinical conditions Ref: Katzung 12 th ed.,C

Mesalamine is used in:,Ulcerative colitis,Diabetes,Erectile dysfunction,Tinea corporis,"Ref: Katzung 11th p.I087Explanation:Mesalamine is an aminosalicylate used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseasesDrugs that contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) have been used successfully for decades in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. 5- ASA differs from salicylic acid only by the addition of an amino group at the 5 (meta) position.Aminosalicylates are believed to work topically (not systemically) in areas of diseased gastrointestinal mucosa. Up to 80% of unformulated, aqueous 5-ASA is absorbed from the small intestine and does not reach the distal small bowel or colon in appreciable quantities.To overcome the rapid absorption of 5-ASA from the proximal small intestine, a number of formulations have been designed to deliver 5- ASA to various distal segments of the small bowel or the colon. These include sulfasalazine, olsalazine, balsalazide, and various forms of mesalamine.Pentasa is a mesalamine formulation that contains timed-release microgranules that release 5-ASA throughout the small intestineAsacol has 5-ASA coated in a pH-sensitive resin that dissolves at pH 7 (the pH of the distal ileum and proximal colon).Lialda also uses a pH-dependent resin that encases a multimatrix core.On dissolution of the pH-sensitive resin in the colon, water slowly penetrates its hydrophilic and lipophilic core. leading to slow release of mesalamine throughout the colon.",A
Phenobarbitone is used in -,Organophosphate poisoning,Carbamate poisoning,Neonatal jaundice,Phenol poisoning,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Neonatal jaundice Phenobarbitone* Phenobarbitone is a long acting barbiturate.* Barbiturates induce several hepatic microsomal enzymes and increase the rate of metabolism of other drugs.* This property of phenobarbitone can be used as an adjuvant in treatment of neonatal jaundice.* In cases of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, phenobarbitone induces liver microsomal enzymes, which convert it into conjugated bilirubin and is excreted in urine. Thus it can be used in cases of neonatal jaundice.Other Uses of Phenobarbitone* Phenobarbitone is one of the cheapest and least toxic antiepileptics.* It has broad spectrum efficacy in generalized tonic - clonic (GTC), simple partial (SP) and complex partial (CP) seizures.* However, it has become less popular than carbamazepine, phenytoin or valproate.* Status epilepticus: Phenobarbitone may be injected im or i.v but response is slow to develop.* It is not effective in absence seizures.",C

For clinical staging of prostate cancer,The TNM system is considered an international standard. HARSH MOHAN Textbook of pathology 6th edition pg no 720 Gleason score ranges from 2 to 10Q. Gleason score and grading system a. Gleason score is the most commonly used histological grading system for 1 to 5 prostate cancer. b. (The two most predominant histological pattern of the prostate cancer are assigned a Gleason grade ranging from 1-5.) c. The primary grade is assigned to the pattern of cancer that is most commonly observed in the histological slides of the specimen. d. The secondary grade is assigned to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen. e. Gleason score is the sum of the two grades. Thus it is also known as Gleason sum"". f. If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and secondary grades are repoed as the same grade. g. As Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, Gleason score thus ranges from 2 to 10. h. i. The Gleason score is used to help evaluate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer. Together with other parameters, the Gleason score is incorporated into a strategy of prostate cancer staging which predicts & prognosis and helps guide therapy. j. A point of impoance is that the primary Gleason grade is most impoant with respect to placing patients in prognostic groups. For example in patients with a Gleason score 7, a Gleason 4+3 is a more aggressive cancer than a Gleason 3+4. Ref: Smith's Urology 16/ep375",A

Onion bulb appearance on nerve biopsy is seen in -,Amyloid neuropathy,Diabetic neuropathy,CIDP,Leprous neuritis,"chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) has been used to identify patients with a chronically progressive or relapsing symmetric sensorimotor disorder with cytoalbuminologic dissociation and interstitial and perivascular endoneurial infiltration by lymphocytes and macrophages. It can be considered the chronic equivalent of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, the most common form of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Signs and symptoms CIDP typically stas insidiously and evolves slowly, in either a slowly progressive or a relapsing manner, with paial or complete recovery between recurrences; periods of worsening and improvement usually last weeks or months. Most expes consider the necessary duration of symptoms to be greater than 8 weeks for the diagnosis of CIDP to be made. Symptoms repoed include the following: Preceding infection (infrequent) Initial limb weakness, both proximal and distal Sensory symptoms (eg, tingling and numbness of hands and feet) Motor symptoms (usually predominant) In about 16% of patients, a relatively acute or subacute onset of symptoms In children, usually a more precipitous onset of symptoms Symptoms of autonomic system dysfunction (eg, ohostatic dizziness) Peinent physical findings are limited to the nervous system, except when the condition is associated with other diseases. Such findings may include the following. Signs of cranial nerve (CN) involvement (eg, facial muscle paralysis or diplopia) Gait abnormalities Motor deficits (eg, symmetric weakness of both proximal and distal muscles in upper and lower extremities) Diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes Sensory deficits (typically in stocking-glove distribution) Impaired coordination Diagnosis Laboratory studies that may be helpful include the following: Cerebrospinal fluid analysis: Elevated protein levels are common (80% of patients); 10% of patients also have mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased gamma globulin Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA) level, biochemistry profile, and serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis (to exclude associated systemic disorders) In ceain instances, genetic testing Other tests and procedures that may be warranted are as follows: MRI of the spine with gadolinium enhancement Electromyography (EMG) is a critical test to determine whether the disorder is truly a peripheral neuropathy and whether the neuropathy is demyelinating Peripheral (sural) nerve biopsy (see the image below): This is considered when the diagnosis is not completely clear, when other causes cannot be excluded, or when profound axonal involvement is observed on EMG; biopsy was once commonly recommended for most patients before immunosuppressive therapy, but current guidelines no longer recommend it Electron micrograph of the peripheral nerve of a patient with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.

Exchange with H+ by Na+ /H+ exchanger located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cells. The PT cells secrete H+ with the help of carbonic anhvdrase. H+ ion exchanges with Na+ present in tubular fluid through Na+-H+ exchanger (antiporter) and forms H2CO3 by combining with HCO3-. This H2CO3 is broken into H2O + CO2 by brush border carbonic anhydrase; both CO2 and H2O diffuse inside the cell and recombine to form H2CO3 with the help of intracellular carbonic anhydrase. This H2CO3 is the source of H+. The dissociated HCO3- in the cell is transported to cortical E.C.F. by basolateral membrane Na+-HCO3- symporter resulting in net reabsorption of NaHCO3.Carbonic anvdrase inhibitors (acetazoiamide) act predominantly in PCTand inhibit NaHCQ3 reabsorption.4. The disroportionately large HCO3-, acetate, PO4-3, passive driving forces for Cl- to diffuse through the paracellular pathway, particularly in the later PT. This takes Na+ and H2O along to maintain electrical neutrality and isotonicity; reabsorption in PT is isotonic.o Osmotic diuretics (mannitol) are solutes which are not absorbed in proximal tubule and therefore retain water:Site 11 Ascending limb of loop of Henleo The thick ascending limb can be distinguished into two distinct portion.1. Medullary portion lined by cuboidal cells.2. Cortical portion lined by flattened cells.o Both portions are relatively impermeable to water but absorb salt actively and thus dilute tubular fluid,o In the medullary portion a distinct luminal membrane carrier transports ions in ratio of Na+-K+-2Cl-. The sodium enters the cell is pumped to ECF by Na+ K+ ATPase at the basolateral membrane,o This Na+ -K+--2Cl= symport is inhibited by loop diuretics (eg-Furosemide)o In addition, a Na+-Cl- symporter moves Cl- down its electrochemical gradient into ECF and carries Na+ along.Site III - cortical diluting segment of loop of Henle and early DTo This segment is also impermeable to H2O and continues to absorb salt through Na+-Cl- symporter.o Thiazide diuretics act at this site.Site IV - late distal tubule and collecting ducto In late DT and CD, Na+ is actively reabsorbed; the cation-anion balance being maintained partly by passive Cl- diffusion and partly by secretion of K+ and H+.o Absorption of Na+ at this site occurs through a specific amiloride sensitive Na+ channel and is controlled to a large extent by aldosterone.o K+- sparing diuretics act at this site.o Collecting tubule is the most important site of K+ secretion by the kidney and the site at which virtually all diuretic induced changes in K+ balance occur - as K+ secretion occurs in exchange of Na+, higher the Na+ load in CD higher will be K+ excretion in urine - Diuretics which act on PCT (maximum absortion of Na+ occurs at PCT) like acetazolamide will cause maximum kaliuresis (K+ excretion in urine),o The principal cells are the major sites of Na+, K+, and water transport, and intercalated cells are the primary sites of H+ secretion.o The collecting tubule is also the site at which the final urine concentration is determined. ADH (vasopressin) controls the permeability of this segment to water by regulating the insertion of preformed wrater channels (aquaporin-2, AQP2) into the apical membrane via a G protein - coupled cAMP - mediated process.o ADH also stimulates the insertion of urea transporter UT1 molecules into the apical membranes of medullary collecting tubule cells. Urea concentration in the medulla plays an important role maintaining the high osmolarity of the medulla and in the concentration of urine.",A

Apoptotic gene which is also associated with autophagy is,p53,BAX,BCL-2,BID,"In autophagy, senescent organelles or denatured proteins are targeted for lysosome-driven degradation by encircling them with a double membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and marked by LC3 proteins (microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3). Gene associated with autophagy: ATG-3. Marker of autophagy: LC-3. Protein responsible for autophagy: BECLIN-1. Beclin -1 when it forms a complex with BCL-2 which inhibit apoptosis, the complex inhibits the autophagy process. Inhibition of autophagy might lead to malignancy. Exposure of cells to radiation or chemotherapeutic agents induces apoptosis by a mechanism that is initiated by DNA damage (genotoxic stress) and that involves the tumor-suppressor gene TP53. p53 protein accumulates in cells when DNA is damaged, and it arrests the cell cycle (at the G1 phase) to allow time for repair. However, if the damage is too great to be repaired successfully, p53 triggers apoptosis. When TP53 is mutated or absent (as it is in many cancers), cells with damaged DNA fail to undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and instead survive. In such cells, the DNA damage may result in mutations of various types that lead to neoplastic transformation. Thus, p53 serves as a critical ""life or death"" switch following genotoxic stress. Among the proteins whose production is stimulated by p53 are several pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family, notably BAX, BAK and some BH3-only proteins.",C

Cell mediated immune response is which type of hypersensitivity-,I,II,III,IV,"Type 4 or delayed hypersensitivity reaction is tissue injury by T cell mediated immune response without formation of antibodies (contrary to type 1,2 and 3) but is instead a slow and prolonged response.Harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), described next, is an illustrative model of T cell-mediated inflammation and tissue injury. The same reactions are the underlying basis for several diseases. Contact dermatitis is an example of tissue injury resulting from T cell-mediated inflammation. It is evoked by contact with pentadecylcatechol (also known as urushiol, the active component of poison ivy and poison oak, which probably becomes antigenic by binding to a host protein). On reexposure of a previously exposed person to the plants, sensitized TH1 CD4+ cells accumulate in the dermis and migrate toward the antigen within the epidermis. Here they release cytokines that damage kera- tinocytes, causing separation of these cells and formation of an intraepidermal vesicle, and inflammation manifested as a vesicular dermatitis. It has long been thought that several systemic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and mul- tiple sclerosis, are caused by TH1 and TH17 reactions against self antigens, and Crohn disease may be caused by uncon- trolled reactions involving the same T cells but directed against intestinal bacteria. T cell-mediated inflammation also plays a role in the rejection of transplants, described later in the chapter. Ref Robbins 9/e pg 118",D

"Olcegepant, mechanism of action is:",5HT1d/1b agonist,Inhibits the release of vasodilating peptides,CGRP antagonist,Decreases the excessive firing of vasoconstrictor nerve fibers,"Ans. C. CGRP antagonistRef: Katzung's Basic and Clinical Pharmacology 13th/ed, p308Explanation# Calcitonin family of peptides includes:# Calcitonin# Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)# Adrenomedullin# Amylin# CGRP# Widely distributed: Largely in the C-cells of the thyroid gland, also found in CNS (central nervous system), PNS (peripheral nervous system), CVS (cardiovascular system), RS (respiratory system) and GIT (gastrointestinal tract).# CGRP-containing neuronal fibers are more abundant around arteries than around veins and in atria than in ventricles.# This peptide has vasodilatory property, in fact CGRP is the most potent vasodilator yet discovered.# When injected in systemic circulation, it causes hypotension and tachycardia.# When injected into CNS, it causes hypertension and suppression of feeding.# Release of CGRP from trigeminal nerves plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Selective serotonin agonist (triptans) normalizes CGRP levels.# CGRP antagonists though have not yet received FDA approval have shown promising results in trials for migraine. Antagonists developed are:- Olcegepant- Telcagepant# Note the name olcegepant: Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist.# These drugs are non-peptide antagonist.# Two primary hypotheses to explain the actions of antimigraine drugs are:# First, The triptans, ergot alkaloids, and antidepressants may activate 5-HT1D/1B receptors on presynaptic trigeminal nerve endings, thereby inhibiting the release of vasodilating peptides, (option b) and antiseizure agents may suppress excessive firing of these nerve endings (option d).# Second, the vasoconstrictor actions of direct 5-HT agonists (the triptans and ergot) may prevent vasodilation and stretching of the pain endings. It is possible that both mechanisms contribute in the case of some drugs.# Option a: Triptans (sumatriptan is 5 HT agonist).# Option b: CGRP itself is vasodilating peptide and olcegepant is CGRP antagonist. The triptans, ergot alkaloids, and antidepressants act by inhibiting the release of vasodilating peptides.# Option d: Antiseizure drugs like valproic acid and topiramate are useful in treatment of migraine, they reduce the excessive firing by trigeminal neurons.",C

A 23-year-old female presented with jaundice and pallor for 2 months. Her peripheral blood smear shows the presence of spherocytes. The most relevant investigation to arrive at a diagnosis is:,Tests for PNH,Osmotic fragility test,Coombs test,Reticulocyte count,"The presence of spherocytes can be seen in the following conditions:

Hereditary spherocytosis
Autoimmune hemlolytic anemia
G6PD deficiency
Infections
Burns
Hemolytic disease of new born
PNH is not a cause for the presence of spherocytes; so, no test for this condition is required.
Osmotic fragility is increased with spherocytes. So, it does not add anything to our existing information about the disease causing spherocyte formation.
Reticulocyte count is expected to be elevated in the setting of haemolytic anemia (suggested by jaundice and pallor).

Coombs test is done for detection of the antibodies formed against the normal antigens present on the surface of cells like platelets and red blood cells. So, it is going to be positive in autoimmune hemolytic anemia whereas negative in hereditary spherocytosis. Thus, a differentiation between these conditions can be done.",C

This birth defect shows which of the following patterns of inheritance?,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,Multifactorial,X-linked dominant,"The inheritance of a number of birth defects is multifactorial. Most normal human traits are inherited neither as dominant nor as recessive mendelian attributes, but rather in a more complex manner. For example, multifactorial inheritance determines intelligence, height, skin color, body habitus, and even emotional disposition. Similarly, most of the common chronic disorders of adults represent multifactorial genetic diseases and are well known to ""run in families."" Such maladies include diabetes, atherosclerosis, and many forms of cancer and arthritis, and hypertension. The inheritance of a number of birth defects is also multifactorial (e.g., cleft lip and palate, pyloric stenosis, hypospadias, and congenital heart disease). The concept of multifactorial inheritance is based on the notion that multiple genes interact with various environmental factors to produce disease in an individual patient. Such inheritance leads to familial aggregation that does not obey simple mendelian rules (see choices A, B, D, and E). As a consequence, the inheritance of polygenic diseases is studied by the methods of population genetics, rather than by the analysis of individual family pedigrees.Diagnosis: Hypospadias, multifactorial inheritance",C

An experiment studies early atheroma development. Lipid streaks on arterial walls are examined microscopically and biochemically to determine their cellular and chemical constituents and the factors promoting their formation. Early lesions show increased attachment of monocytes to the endothelium. The monocytes migrate subendothelially and become macrophages; these macrophages transform themselves into foam cells. Which of the following substances is most likely to be responsible for the transformation of macrophages?,C-reactive protein,Homocysteine,Lp(a),Oxidized LDL,"Oxidized LDL can be taken up by a special ""scavenger"" pathway in macrophages; it also promotes monocyte chemotaxis and adherence. Macrophages taking up the lipid become foam cells that begin to form the fatty streak. Smoking, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension all promote free radical formation, and free radicals increase the degradation of LDL to its oxidized form. About one-third of LDL is degraded to the oxidized form; a higher LDL level increases the amount of oxidized LDL available for uptake into macrophages. C-reactive protein is a marker for inflammation, which can increase with more active atheroma and thrombus formation and predicts a greater likelihood of acute coronary syndromes. Increased homocysteine levels promote atherogenesis through endothelial dysfunction. Lp(a), an altered form of LDL that contains the apo B-100 portion of LDL linked to apo A, promotes lipid accumulation and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Platelet-derived growth factor promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation. VLDL is formed in the liver and transformed in adipose tissue and muscle to LDL.",D

Ethambutol inhibits mycobacterial arabinosyl transferases, which are encoded by the embCAB operon. Arabinosyl transferases are involved in the polymerization reaction of arabinoglycan, an essential component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Resistance to ethambutol is due to mutations resulting in overexpression of emb gene products or within the embB structural gene. Hypersensitivity to ethambutol is rare. The most common serious adverse event is retrobulbar neuritis, resulting in loss of visual acuity and red-green color blindness. This dose-related adverse effect is more likely to occur at dosages of 25 mg/kg/d continued for several months. At 15 mg/kg/d or less, visual disturbances are very rare. Periodic visual acuity testing is desirable if the 25 mg/kg/d dosage is used.

Cause of ITP is -,Vasculitis,Antibody to vascular epithelium,Antibody to platelets,Antibody to clotting factors,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura 

There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies.

Pathogenesis

Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class.
The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.
The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets.

Pathology

The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic.
The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in the spleen, the spleen size remains normal. 
On histological examination, there is congestion of the sinusoids and hyperactivity and enlargement of the splenic follicles manifested by the formation of prominent germinal centres. Sometimes scattered megakaryocytes are found within the sinuses and sinusoidal walls. This represents a very mild form of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These splenic findings are not sufficiently distinctive to be considered diagnostic.

Bone Marrow

Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes.
These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction.
The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure.
A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.",C

True statement regarding Rifampicin is,Acts by inhibiting mycolic acid synthesis,Dose adjustment is needed in renal failure,Gets concentrated intracellularly mainly in neutrophils,Increased metabolism of cyclosporine when given concomitantly,"Ans) d (Increased metabolism......) Ref KDT 6th ed p74l. KatzungRifampin inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of mycobacteria and other microorganisms by forming a stable drug-enzyme complex, leading to suppression of initiation of chain formation (but not chain elongation) in RNA synthesis. More specifically, the b subunit of this complex enzyme is the site of action of the drug, although rifampin binds only to the holoenzyme. Nuclear RNA polymerases from a variety of eukaryotic cells do not bind rifampin, and RNA synthesis is correspondingly unaffected in eukaryotic cells. High concentrations of rifamycin antibiotics can inhibit RNA synthesis in mammalian mitochondria, viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, and reverse transcriptases. Rifampin is bactericidal for both intracellular and extracellular microorganisms.A primary action of isoniazid is to inhibit the biosynthesis acids, branched lipids that are attached to a unique polysaccharide, arabino galactan, to form part of the mycobacterial cell wall.* Adjustment of dosageof rifampicin is not necessary in patients with impaired renal function.* It readily penetrates most tissues and into phagocytic cells. So they get concentrated mainly in lymphocytes and macrophages and not in neutrophils It can kill organisms that are poorly accessible to many other drugs, such as intracellular organisms and those that are sequestrated in abscesses and lung cavities.* Rifampicin, anticonvulsants including phenobarbitone, glucocorticoids induce CYP3 A soenzymes. Cyclosporine is metabolised in liver by CYP3A4 and excreted in bile. As rifampicin is an inducer of CYP3 A4, it lowers the blood levels of cyclosporine when given concomitantly",D
A 52 year old woman presents to her physician for a check-up. She is recovering from a wrist fracture after a fall. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry of the hip had shown her to have osteoporosis. She became menopausal at age 50 and did not begin hormone replacement therapy because of a strong family history of breast cancer. She now fears a future hip fracture and would like to begin a bone loss prevention regime.Which of the following pharmaceutical agents is most appropriate for this patient?,Calcitonin nasal spray,Oral conjugated estrogen,Raloxifene,Tamoxifen,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that helps prevent osteoporosis by lessening bone resorption and reducing bone turnover. It lowers risk for veebral fractures by 40% to 50%. It is a bone-preserving alternative for women who prefer to avoid estrogen. Raloxifene does not cause breast pain and may lessen the risk for breast cancer in menopausal women. There is also a orable effect on LDL and cholesterol. Calcitonin nasal spray is an osteoclastic bone resorption inhibitor that modestly increases bone mineral density and reduces the incidence of veebral fracture. Although it is an estrogen alternative for bone preservation, its impact on hip fracture is not known. It is also lacks the anti-breast cancer propeies of raloxifene. Oral conjugated estrogen and transdermal estradiolare not the best choices, as this patient wants to avoid estrogen because of a strong family history of breast cancer. The route of administration of estrogen has been shown to have similar effects on bone preservation, even though the transdermal dosage is generally half that of the oral dosage. Breast cancer risk, however, is slightly increased with the unopposed higher dosage oral estrogen replacement. Tamoxifen , while indicated in the long-term care of breast cancer patients, is not alone useful for treatment or prevention of osteoporosis. Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogen agent that competes with estrogen for binding sites. Ref: Shoback D. (2013). Chapter 58. Osteoporosis & Glucocoicoid-Induced Osteoporosis. In J.B. Imboden, D.B.

"A 23-year-old woman has had altered consciousness and slurred speech for the past 24 hours. A head CT scan shows a right temporal hemorrhagic infarction. Cerebral angiography shows a distal right middle cerebral arterial occlusion. Within the past 3 years, she has had an episode of pulmonary embolism. A pregnancy 18 months ago ended in miscarriage. Laboratory studies show a false-positive serologic test for syphilis, normal prothrombin time (PT), elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and normal platelet count. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?",Antiphospholipid antibody,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Factor V mutation,Hypercholesterolemia,"These findings are characteristic of a hypercoagulable state. The patient has antibodies that react with cardiolipin, a phospholipid antigen used for the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. These so-called antiphospholipid antibodies are directed against phospholipid-protein complexes such as b2 -glycoprotein I and thrombin and are sometimes called lupus anticoagulant because they are present in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune states. Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have recurrent arterial and venous thrombosis and repeated miscarriages. In vitro, these antibodies inhibit coagulation by interfering with the assembly of phospholipid complexes, and a ""mixing study"" with normal serum will not correct the PTT (which primarily measures factors II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, and XII and fibrinogen in the ""intrinsic pathway"" of in vitro coagulation). In vivo, the antibodies induce a hypercoagulable state by unknown mechanisms. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is an acute consumptive coagulopathy characterized by elevated PT and PTT, and decreased platelet count. The PT and PTT are normal in patients with factor V (Leiden) mutation. Hypercholesterolemia promotes atherosclerosis over many years, and the risk of arterial thrombosis increases.

"When stem cells transforms to form cells characteristic of other tissues, the process is called as -",De-differentiation,Re-differentiation,Trans-differentiation,Sub-differentiation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Trans-differentiation Transdifferentiation o Transdifferentiation takes place when a non-stem cell transform into a different type of cell, or when an already differentiated stem cell creates cells outside its already estabilished differentiation. o Remember very impoant fact that it is the non-stem cell or already differentiated stem cell (i.e. mature cell) that is transformed into other type of cell. It is not stem cell that is transforming. o Transdifferentiation is a type of metaplasia. o Then, what is the difference between transdifferentiation and metaplasia. In Transdifferentiation only differentiated stem cell is transformed into other cell type, while in metaplasia any of the two, either stem cell or differentiated cell can transform into other cell type. So, all transdifferentiation processes are metaplasia, but not all metaplasia are transdifferentiation. o Most likely question has been wrongly framed here, there should be non-stem cell instead of stem cell in the question.

Which of the following is true of biguanides: September 2011,Cause little or no hypoglycemia,Stimulates pancreatic beta cells,Completely metabolized,Promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis,"Ans. A: Cause little or no hypoglycemia Metformin does not lower blood sugar in normal subjects By itself, it does not produce hypoglycemia in diabetics. However it potentiates the hypoglycemic action of insulin and sulfonylureas Biguanide Examples of biguanides: - Metformin - widely used in treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 - Phenformin - withdrawn from the market in most countries due to toxic effects - Buformin - withdrawn from the market due to toxic effects - Proguanil - an antimalarial drug Biguanides do not affect the output of insulin, unlike other hypoglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas and meglitinides. Therefore, not only are they effective in Type 2 diabetics but they can also be effective in Type 1 patients in conce with insulin therapy. The mechanism of action of biguanides is not fully understood. However, in hyperinsulinemia, biguanides can lower fasting levels of insulin in plasma. Their therapeutic uses derive from their tendency to reduce gluconeogenesis in the liver, and, as a result, reduce the level of glucose in the blood. Biguanides also tend to make the cells of the body more willing to absorb glucose already present in the blood stream, and there again reducing the level of glucose in the plasma. The most common side effect is diarrhea and dyspepsia, occurring in up to 30% of patients. The most impoant and serious side effect is lactic acidosis, therefore metformin is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. Renal functions should be assessed before staing metformin.

These unique lymphomas are characterized by rapid cell growth and spread into the circulation, where they produce elevated total white counts reflected by circulating lymphoma cells. As T cells they have characteristics of rosette formation with sheep blood cells. T cells also have subtypes and subsets, which can be delineated by monoclonal antibodies as CD4 helper and CD8 suppressor (cellular differentiation) T cell surface antigens. The tumor cells also express IL-2 receptor. Fc receptors occur on B cells and macrophages. Class II HLA antigens can be found on macrophages, Langerhans cells, and dendritic reticulum cells.

In some cases, the tumors are malignant, in others, benign. Benign or malignant tumors of nonendocrine tissues occur as components of some of these tumor syndromes. MEN syndromes are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders.A tumor suppressor gene, or antioncogene, is a gene that protects a cell from one step on the path to cancer. When this gene mutates to cause a loss or reduction in its function, the cell can progress to cancer, usually in combination with other genetic changes. The loss of these genes may be even more impoant than proto-oncogene/oncogene activation for the formation of many kinds of human cancer cells.",C

Entecavir: Entecavir is a guanosine analogue that is highly potent against HBV and has weak/paial activity against HIV. It is typically not preferred for use against HIV as it can induce HIV Resistance. When Entecavir is used to treat HBV in patients with HBV/HIV coinfection who are not on A, the drug may select for the M184V mutation that confers HIV resistance to 3TC and FTC. Therefore, Entecavir should only be used in HBV/HIV coinfected patient in addition to (and should not replace components of) fully suppressive A.

Mechanism of action of paclitaxel is:,Topoisomerase inhibition,Increases the polymerization of tubulin,Inhibits protein synthesis,Alkylation of DNA,"Paclitaxel It is a complex diterpin taxane obtained from bark of the Western yew tree, which exes cytotoxic action by a novel mechanism. It enhances polymerization of tubulin: a mechanism opposite to that of vinca alkaloids. The microtubules are stabilized and their depolymerization is prevented. This stability results in inhibition of normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic functions. Abnormal arrays or &;bundles&; of microtubules are produced throughout the cell cycle. Cytotoxic action of paclitaxel emphasizes the impoance of tubulin-microtubule dynamic equilibrium. The approved indications of paclitaxel are metastatic ovarian and breast carcinoma after failure of first line chemotherapy and relapse cases.

Which of the following is the most likely disease process causing his pulmonary disease?",Atherosclerosis,Pneumonitis,Sarcoidosis,Thromboembolism,"Over half of persons with chronic pulmonary thromboembolism with pulmonary hypertension do not have a history of recurrent pulmonary embolism. Rather than one large life-threatening embolus, chronic thromboembolism occurs from multiple smaller emboli that reduce the pulmonary vascular bed and increase pulmonary pressures, leading to cor pulmonale. Recanalization of thrombi leads to narrow channels causing the bruits. Antiphospholipid antibodies pose a risk for thrombosis. The risk factors for systemic arterial atherosclerosis are not operative in the pulmonary arterial tree, and pulmonary atherosclerosis is a consequence of pulmonary hypertension, not a cause of it. Pneumonitis with parenchymal inflammation reduces ventilation more than perfusion. Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that mainly affects the pulmonary parenchyma.

Drug of choice for treatment of infection caused by methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is:,Macrolides,Third generation cephalosporins,Carbapenems,Glycopeptides,"GLYCOPEPTIDE ANTIBIOTICS Vancomycin It is a glycopeptide antibiotic discovered in 1956 as a penicillin substitute which has assumed special significance due to efficacy against MRSA Strep. viridans, Enterococcus and Cl. difficile. It is bactericidal to gram-positive cocci, Neisseria, Clostridia and diphtheroids. However, in hospitals where it has been extensively used for surgical prophylaxis, etc., vancomycin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have emerged. These nosocomial bacteria are resistant to methicillin and most other antibiotics as well. Teicoplanin It is a newer glycopeptide antibiotic which in fact is a mixture of 6 similar compounds. It is active against gram-positive bacteria only; mechanism of action and spectrum of activity is similar to vancomycin. Notable features are: * It is more active than vancomycin against enterococci, and equally active against MRSA. * Some VRE but not VRSA are susceptible to teicoplanin.

"According to signal transductions mechanism, GABA B is which type of receptor?",Ligand gated receptor,Nuclear receptor,G protein coupled receptor,Enzymatic receptor,"Five basic mechanisms of transmembrane signaling are well understood. Each uses a different strategy to circumvent the barrier posed by the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. These strategies use: a lipid-soluble ligand that crosses the membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor. a transmembrane receptor protein whose intracellular enzymatic activity is allosterically regulated by a ligand that binds to a site on the protein's extracellular domain. a transmembrane receptor that binds and stimulates a protein tyrosine kinase. a ligand gated transmembrane ion channel that can be induced to open or close by the binding of a ligand. a transmembrane receptor protein that stimulates a GTP-binding signal transducer protein (G protein), which in turn modulates production of an intracellular second messenger. Known transmembrane signaling mechanisms:1: A lipid-soluble chemical signal crosses the plasma membrane and acts on an intracellular receptor (which may be an enzyme or a regulator of gene transcription); 2: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein, thereby activating an enzymatic activity of its cytoplasmic domain; 3: the signal binds to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor bound to a separate protein tyrosine kinase, which it activates; 4: the signal binds to and directly regulates the opening of an ion channel; 5: the signal binds to a cell-s urface receptor linked to an effector enzyme by a G protein.

Progenitor hematopoietic stem cells originate in which of the following?,Bone marrow,Thymus,Lymph node,Spleen,"Key Concept:
By birth, marrow throughout the skeleton is hematopoietically active and hepatic hematopoiesis dwindles to a trickle, persisting only in widely scattered foci that become inactive soon after birth.
Haematopoietic Organs
In the human embryo, the yolk sac is the main site of haematopoiesis in the first few weeks of gestation. By about 3rd month, however, the liver and spleen are the main sites of blood cells formation and continue to do so until about 2 weeks after birth. Haematopoiesis commences in the bone marrow by 4th and 5th month and becomes fully active by 7th and 8th month, so that at birth practically all the bones contain active marrow. During normal childhood and adult life, therefore, the marrow is the only source of new blood cells. However, during childhood, there is progressive fatty replacement throughout the long bones, so that by adult life the hematopoietic marrow is confined to the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull, sacrum and pelvis) and proximal ends of femur, tibia and humerus. Even in these hematopoietic areas, about 50% of the marrow consists of fat. Non-hematopoietic marrow in the adult is, however, capable of reverting to active hematopoiesis in certain pathologic conditions. The spleen and liver can also resume their fetal hematopoietic role in certain pathologic conditions and is called extramedullary hematopoiesis.",A

Aschoff bodies in the myocardium are the hallmark of carditis associated with,Infective endocarditis,Rheumatic fever,Rheumatoid ahritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,"Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by discrete inflammatory foci within a variety of tissues. The myocardial inflammatory lesions--called Aschoff bodies--are pathognomonic for rheumatic fever these are collections of lymphocytes (primarily T cells), scattered plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cells occasionally punctuating zones of fibrinoid necrosis. The Anitschkow cells have abundant cytoplasm and central nuclei with chromatin condensed to form a slender, wavy ribbon (so-called caterpillar cells). During acute rheumatic fever, Aschoff bodies can be found in any of the three layers of the hea--pericardium, myocardium, or endocardium (including valves). Hence, rheumatic fever is said to cause pancarditis. (Robbins Basic pathology,9th edition.pg no.391)",B

Which of the following is (are) Heredofamilial amyloidosis -,Alzheimer's disease,Multiple myeloma,Familial mediterranean fever,RA,"A variety of familial forms of amyloidosis have been described; most are rare and occur in limited geographic areas. The best-characterized is an autosomal recessive condition called familial Mediterranean fever. This is a febrile disorder characterized by attacks of fever accompanied by inflammation of serosal surfaces, including peritoneum, pleura, and synol membrane. This disorder is encountered largely in persons of Armenian, Sephardic Jewish, and Arabic origins. It is associated with widespread tissue involvement indistinguishable from reactive systemic amyloidosis. The amyloid fibril proteins are made up of AA proteins, suggesting that this form of amyloidosis is related to the recurrent bouts of inflammation that characterize this disease. The gene for familial Mediterranean fever is called pyrin and encodes a protein that is a component of the inflammasome (Chapter 2).

Demyelination is the major feature of Multiple Sclerosis. Which of the following cells forms myelin in the central nervous system?,Astrocytes,Ependymal cells,Microglia,OIigodendrocytes,"The myelin sheath is formed by oligodendrocytes in CNS and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The gaps formed between myelin sheath cells along the axons are called nodes of Ranvier. Since the lipid structure of myelin serves as a good insulator, the myelin sheaths increase the rate of propagation and efficacy of transmission of the impulse along the axon. The electrical impulse jumps from one node to the next at the rate as fast as 120 m/s. This rapid type of conduction is called saltatory conduction. Demyelination can occur early in life as consequence of congenital metabolic disorders. Demyelination later in life can be repaired with glia, which explains the frequent exacerbations and remissions in MS. It is believed that in MS, multiple mechanisms of immune injury of myelin coexist: cytokine-mediated injury of oligodendrocytes and myelin, digestion of surface myelin antigens by macrophages, complement-mediated injury, and direct injury by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. This type of injury causes the loss of saltatory conduction in nerve fibers. The exposed axon is susceptible to fuher injury, resulting in irreversible axonal damage. Glial cells do not carry action potentials, but they have many impoant functions. There are several types of glial cells: astrocytes, which transpo nutrients to neurons, hold neurons in place, digest pas of dead neurons, and regulate the composition of extracellular space, and microglia, which possess phagocytic function, clean up debris, and protect the brain from microorganisms.Ependymal cells form the epithelial lining of the ventricle.

Heterozygous state, i.e., sickle cell trait. 2. Homozygous state, i.e., sickle cell anemia. o The most impoant factor for sickling is the amount of HbS in the cell. o In sickle cell trait (heterozygous state), only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, this is insufficient to produce sickling manifestations. o In homozygous state, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS, therefore they undergo sickling.",A
Which is not a 2nd generation antihistaminic ?,Loraudine,Acrivastatine,Cyclizine,None of the above,"Cyclizine Histamine is a naturally occuring amine. It is found in most body tissues but is predominantly secreted by mast cells. Histamine acts as a local hormone (autacoid) i.e. it acts within the immediate vicinity of its release. It main physiological effects are on: Blood vessels ? - Aerioles are dilated - Capillary permeability is increased Smooth muscles -- Cause contraction of the smooth muscles G.I.T. -- Increase gastric acid secretion Histamine acts through two receptors - H1 --> mediates edema and vascular effects of Histamine - H2 --> mediates effect on gastic secretion. Hi receptor antagonists : T- hey are classified in two types (i) First generation antihistamines (ii) Second generation antihistamines The term antihistamine is unsatisfactory for the first generation or older generation antihistamine because besides blocking histamine receptors, they also show considerable blocking activity against - muscarinins receptors - serotonin receptors - a adrenergic receptors They also enter the brain readily and cause sedation. Because of their non-specificity and their highly sedative action, they have a great tendency to cause serious adverse effect. Because of these disadvantages, second generation antihistamines were developed which are more selective for H1 receptor and largely free of antimuscarinic and antiadrenergic activity. The newer second generation antihistamines penetrate the blood-brain barrier poorly and are largely devoid of sedative effects.",C

Most common site of abscess formation due to amoeba is: September 2005,Lungs,Liver,Kidney,Brain,"Ans. B: Liver Amebic liver abscess is the most frequent extraintestinal manifestation of Entamoeba histolytica infection. This infection is caused by the protozoa E histolytica, which ascends the poal venous system. Amebic liver abscess is an impoant cause of space-occupying lesions of the liver, mainly in developing countries E histolytica exists in 2 forms. The cyst stage is the infective form, and the trophozoite stage causes invasive disease. People who chronically carry E histolytica shed cysts in their feces; these cysts are transmitted primarily by food and water contamination. Cysts are resistant to gastric acid, but the wall is broken down by trypsin in the small intestine. Trophozoites are released and colonize the cecum. To initiate symptomatic infection, E histolytica trophozoites present in the lumen must adhere to the underlying mucosa and penetrate the mucosal layer. Liver involvement occurs following invasion of E histolytica into mesenteric venules. Amebae then enter the poal circulation and travel to the liver where they typically form large abscesses. The abscess contains acellular proteinaceous debris, which is thought to be a consequence of induced apoptosis and is surrounded by a rim of amebic trophozoites invading the tissue. The right lobe of the liver is more commonly affected than the left lobe. This has been attributed to the fact that the right lobe poal laminar blood flow is supplied predominantly by the superior mesenteric vein, whereas the left lobe poal blood flow is supplied by the splenic vein.",B

Amyloid deposits in liver are initially seen in: March 2009,Space of disse,Hepatic parenchyma,Intrahepatic ducts,Poal tract,"Ans. A: Space of disse Kidney-Histologically, the mesangium and capillary basement membrane of glomeruli are the most frequent renal sites of amyloid deposition, followed by involvement of aeriolar and aerial walls and peritubular interstitial tissues. As the extent of the amyloid deposition increases, the glomerular capillary tufts become obliterated and replaced by functionless spherical masses of amyloid material Liver- Microscopically, amyloid is initially deposited in the spaces (of Disse) between the hepatocytes and vascular sinusoids. As more amyloid accumulates, it compresses the hepatic cords and sinusoids. The hepatic cords undergo nutritional and pressure atrophy and become displaced or replaced by bands and nodules of amyloid. Spleen-Amyloidosis of the spleen has two different anatomical patterns. Most commonly, the amyloid deposition is limited to the splenic follicles, resulting in the gross appearance of a moderately enlarged spleen dotted with gray nodules (so called ""sago"" spleen). Alternatively, the amyloid deposits may spare the follicles and mainly infiltrate the red pulp sinuses, producing a large, firm spleen mottled with waxy discolorations (""lardaceous"" spleen).",A

"During heterosexual intercourse, seminal fluid containing HIV contacts vaginal squamous mucosa. Cells capture virions and transport the virus via lymphatics to regional lymph nodes. Within the germinal centers of these lymph nodes, the virions infect CD4+ lymphocytes and proliferate, causing CD4+ cell lysis with release of more virions, which are taken up on the surface of cells having Fc receptors, allowing continued infection by HIV of more CD4+ cells passing through the nodes. Which of the following types of cells is most likely to capture HIV on its surface via Fc receptors?",B lymphocyte,CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocyte,Follicular dendritic cell,Natural Killer cell,"Dendritic cells are a form of antigen-presenting cell. Dendritic cells in epithelia are known as Langerhans cells, and those within germinal centers are called follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. They have cell surface Fc receptors that capture antibody-coated HIV virions through the Fc portion of the antibody. These virions attached to the FDCs can infect passing CD4+ lymphocytes. Dendritic cells elaborate type I interferons that up-regulate antiviral proteins in neighboring cells. B cells are a component of humoral immunity, and antibody to HIV does not serve a protective function, but allows serologic detection of infection. CD8+ cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that lack the receptor necessary for infection by HIV. Because they survive selectively, the CD4+:CD8+ ratio is reversed so that it is typically less than 1 with advanced HIV infection. Innate lymphoid cells resemble NK cells, but shape further lymphoid reactions. Langhans giant cells are ""committees"" of activated macrophages that are part of a granulomatous response. Macrophages are a type of antigen- presenting cell that can become infected by HIV without destruction. Mast cells have surface-bound IgE, which can be cross-linked by antigens (allergens) to cause degranulation and release of vasoactive amines, such as histamine, as part of anaphylaxis with type I hypersensitivity.",C

A 52-year-old woman has long-standing rheumatoid ahritis (RA) and is being treated with coicosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Which of the following cardiac complications may arise in this clinical setting?,Constrictive pericarditis,Restrictive cardiomyopathy,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Hyperophic cardiomyopathy,"Long-standing inflammatory conditions such as RA are associated with deposition of a form of amyloid known as AA (amyloid-associated protein), which may involve kidneys, hea, liver, skeletal muscle, and skin, for example. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium results in decreased compliance and impaired diastolic filling, i.e., restrictive cardiomyopathy. The myocardium has a rigid and waxy texture. This form of amyloid, as well as any other biochemical form, can be visualized on tissue section by staining with Congo red, which acquires a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Note:Constrictive pericarditis is due to any pathologic process that results in fibrous thickening of the pericardium, with resultant impaired compliance. Clinically, therefore, this condition manifests with a picture similar to restrictive cardiomyopathy because of impaired diastolic filling. Constrictive pericarditis is usually caused by previous episodes of acute pericarditis, especially hemorrhagic, suppurative, and caseous pericarditis.Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by massive ventricular dilatation and may be caused by genetic alterations, myocarditis, toxic insults (alcohol), metabolic disorders (hemochromatosis), etc. Most cases are idiopathic. The main pathophysiologic alteration is impaired contractility. Most cases of hyperophic cardiomyopathy are familial and due to mutations in one of the genes encoding proteins of the sarcomeres, most frequently b-myosin heavy chain. This form of cardiomyopathy leads to asymmetric hyperophy of the left ventricle, with prominent thickening of the interventricular septum. In this case, too, impairment of ventricular compliance is the basic mechanism leading to reduced diastolic filling and hea failure. Ref: Stevenson L.W., Loscalzo J. (2012). Chapter 238.

The plasma membrane of the apoptotic cell remains intact, but the membrane is altered in such a way that the cell and its fragments become avid targets for phagocytes. The dead cell and its fragments are rapidly cleared before cellular contents have leaked out, so apoptotic cell death does not elicit an inflammatory reaction in the host.

The condition may have an acute onset due to isolated exposure or may be chronic due to repeated low-dose exposure. ETIOPATHOGENESIS. A list of impoant organic (biologic) dusts which may be inhaled to produce hypersensitivity pneumonitis is already given in. The immunologic mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity pneumonitis from any of these causes appear to be either type III immune-complex disease or type IV delayedhypersensitivity reaction. 1. Farmers' lung is the classic example resulting from exposure to thermophilic actinomycetes generated by humid and warm mouldy hay. 2. Bagassosis occurs in individuals engaged in manufacture of paper and cardboard from sugarcane bagasse. Spores of thermophilic actinomycetes grow rapidly in mouldy sugarcane bagasse which are inhaled. 3. Byssinosis is an occupational lung disease occurring in workers exposed to fibres of cotton, flex and hemp for a number of years. The role of immunologic mechanisms in byssinosis is not as clear as in exposure to other organic dusts. 4. Bird-breeders' (Bird-fanciers') lung occurs in pigeon breeders, parrot breeders, chicken farmers and bird-fanciers who are exposed to bird-droppings and danders from their feathers. 5. Mushroom-workers' lung is found in mushroom cultivators exposed to mushroom compost dust. 6.

Quantitative analysis of which of the following was most likely used as an indicator of fetal lung maturity?",Absorbance at 450 nm,Alpha-fetoprotein,Creatinine,Lecithin,"Immaturity of the lungs poses one of the most common and immediate threats to the viability of the low birth weight infant because the lining cells of the fetal alveoli do not differentiate until late pregnancy. Alveoli are maintained in the expanded state, in part, by the presence of pulmonary surfactant. This material, which is produced by type II pneumocytes, is a complex mixture of several phospholipids, 75% phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) and 10% phosphatidylglycerol. The concentration of lecithin increases rapidly at the beginning of the third trimester and, thereafter, rises rapidly to reach a peak near term. Maturity of the fetal lung can be assessed by measuring pulmonary surfactant released into the amniotic fluid.

Loading dose of a drug depends upon,Volume of distribution,Clearance,Half life,bioavailability,"(a)Volume of distributionRef: Lippincott, 6th ed., pg. 21 and Katzung, 13th ed., pg. 50-51Sometimes rapid achievement of desired plasma concentrations of drugs is needed to produce the prompt response (e.g. in serious infections or arrhythmias). When the time to reach steady state is long, as it is for drugs with long half-lives and having high volume of distribution (Vd) due to their tissue affinities, it may be desirable to administer a large dose (loading dose) to achieve the desired plasma levels rapidly. The volume ot distribution is the proportionality factor that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the concentration in the plasma (Cp).LOADING DOSE= Vd X Desired steady state plasma concentrationLoading dose can be given as single dose or multiple doses over a short time. E.g. in case of treatment of AF by digoxin (longer acting drug with high Vd), loading dose is must to saturate the tissues and to achieve desired plasma concentration rapidly (otherwise it would take about a week for digoxin to achieve the steady state plasma concentration). Loading dose of Chloroquine is also required to treat the malaria.On the other hand, maintenance dose is dependent of the clearance (Cl) as we have to maintain the steady state concentration in view of the volume of the plasma cleared of drug per unit time. Hence, equation for maintenance dose isMAINTENANCE DOSE= Cl X Desired steady state plasma concentration",A

The bacterial drug resistance in tuberculosis results from:,Transduction,Transformation,Plasmid mediated,Mutation,"Drug resistance: It refers to unresponsiveness of a microorganism to an AMA, and is akin to the phenomenon of tolerance seen in higher organisms. Resistance may be developed by mutation or gene transfer. Mutation: It is a stable and heritable genetic change that occurs spontaneously and randomly among microorganisms. It is not induced by the AMA. Any sensitive population of a microbe contains a few mutant cells which require higher concentration of the AMA for inhibition. These are selectively preserved and get a chance to proliferate when the sensitive cells are eliminated by the AMA. Thus, in time it would appear that a sensitive strain has been replaced by a resistant one, e.g. when a single antitubercular drug is used. Mutation and resistance may be: (i ) Single step.- A single gene mutation may confer high degree of resistance; emerges rapidly, e.g. enterococci to streptomycin, E. coli and Staphylococci to rifampin. (ii ) Multistep.* A number of gene modifications are involved, sensitivity decreases gradually in a stepwise manner. Resistance to erythromycin, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol is developed by many organisms in this manner. Sometimes mutational acquisition of resistance is accompanied by decrease in virulence, e.g. ceain rifampin resistant staphylococci and low grade penicillin-resistant gonococci have decreased virulence",D

A specimen from a lung biopsy reveals occasional plexiform lesions within pulmonary aerioles. This abnormality is most characteristic of,Churg-Strauss syndrome,Adult respiratory distress syndrome,Wegener's granulomatosis,Pulmonary hypeension,") Pulmonary vascular sclerosis refers to the vascular changes associated with pulmonary hypeension. Elevation of the mean pulmonary aerial pressure is the result of endothelial dysfunction and vascular changes. The vascular changes vary with the size of the vessel. The main aeries have atheromas that are similar to systemic atherosclerosis, but are not as severe. Medium-sized aeries show intimal thickening and neomuscularization. Smaller aeries and aerioles show intimal thickening, medial hyperophy, and reduplication of the internal and external elastic membranes. A distinctive aeriolar change, a plexiform lesion, consists of intraluminal angiomatous tufts that form webs. This pattern is thought to be diagnostic of primary hypeension The changes of pulmonary vascular sclerosis may be primary or secondary. Primary pulmonary vascular sclerosis almost always occurs in young women, who develop fatigue, syncope (with exercise), dyspnea on exeion (DOE), and chest pain. Secondary sclerosis may occur at any age, and symptoms depend on the underlying cause.

The defect is a genetic mutation in CFTR gene, acronym for coding protein for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator located on chromosome 7. It is quite common in the whites (1 per 2000 livebihs). The clinical manifestations may appear at bih or later in adolescence and peain to multiple organs and systems such as pancreatic insufficiency, intestinal obstruction, steatorrhoea, malnutrition, hepatic cirrhosis,azoospermiaand respiratory complications",D
Osteomalcia is adverse effect of:,Primidone,Phenytoin,Carbamazepine,Valproic acid,"Phenytoin produces osteomalacia, hypocalcaemia- due to altered metabolism of vitamin D and inhibition of intestinal absorption of calcium. Phenytoin also reduces target tissue sensitivity to vitamin D. Osteomalacia is the softening of the bones caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium. The impairment of bone metabolism causes inadequate bone mineralization. REF KD TRIPATHI 8TH ED.",B
NSAIDS cause gastric ulcer because ?,They inhibit COX - 2 enzyme,They inhibit mucus production,They increase HCI production,They delay gastric emptying,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., They inhibit mucus production Prostaglandins function as natural ulcer protectives by enhancing gastric mucus and HCO3- production, as well as by improving mucosal circulation and health. The ulcerogenic action of NSAIDs may be due to loss of this protective influence. PGE analogues are cytoprotective at low doses and inhibit gastric acid secretion at higher doses. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin secretion and thus antagonizes its cytoprotective effect. Misoprostol is used in NSAIDs induced ulcers.",B

True about meningiomas-,More common in men,50% are malignant,95% cure rate following treatment,Arise from arachnoid layer,"Meningiomas are predominantly benign tumors that arise from arachnoid meningothelial cells. They usually occur in adults and are often attached to the dura. Meningiomas may be found along any of the external surfaces of the brain as well as within the ventricular system, where they arise from the stromal arachnoid cells of the choroid plexus.They usually come to attention because of vague nonlocalizing symptoms, or with focal findings referable to compression of the adjacent brain. Most meningiomas are easily separable from the underlying brain. Meningiomas (WHO grade I/IV) grow as well-defined dura-based masses that may compress the brain but do notinvade it. Among the varied histologic patterns are syncytial, named for whorled clusters of cells without visible cell membranes that sit in tight groups; fibroblastic, with elongated cells and abundant collagen deposition between them; transitional, which shares features of the syncytial and fibroblastic types; psammomatous, with numerous psammoma bodies ; and secretary, with gland-like PAS-positive eosinophilic secretions known as pseudopsammoma bodies. Atypical meningiomas (WHO grade II/IV) are recognized by the presence of ceain histologic features (prominent nucleoli, increased cellularity, pattern-less growth), and often have a higher mitotic rate. These tumors demonstrate more aggressive local growth and a higher rate of recurrence; they may require therapy in addition to surgery. Anaplastic (malignant) meningiomas (WHO grade III/IV) are highly aggressive tumors that may resemble a high-grade sarcoma or carcinoma, although there usually is some histologic evidence of a meningothelial cell origin.",C

Reactivation of pulmonary tuberculosis always occur at: March 2011,Lower pa of upper lobe,Upper pa of lower lobe,Lower pa of lower lobe,Apex of the upper lobe,"Ans. D: Apex of the upper lobeSecondary pulmonary tuberculosis classically involves the apex of the upper lobes of one or both the lungsSecondary tuberculosisIt is usually due to the reactivation of old lesions or gradual progression of primary tuberculosis into chronic form.The characteristics of secondary tuberculosis include extensive tissue damages due to immunologic reactions of the host to tubercle bacilli and their products.Primary vs Secondary TuberculosisWhen a host has first contact with tubercle bacilli:- An acute exudative lesion develops and rapidly spreads to the lymphatics and regional lymph nodes.- The exudative lesion in tissue often heals rapidly.- The lymph node undergoes caseation, which usually calcifies.- The tuberculin test becomes positive.If the primary lesion could not contained rapidly, the appearance of hypersensitivity to tuberculin provokes a dramatic change in the host's response to the organisms.The nonspecific inflammatory response evoked on first exposure to tubercle bacilli becomes granulomatous, evoking the formation of tubercles.The tubercle comprises an organized aggregation of enlarged macrophages that, because they resemble epithelial cells, are referred to as epithelioid cells.A peripheral collar of fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes surrounds the granuloma.Frequently the central region of epithelioid cells undergoes a characteristic caseous necrosis to produce a ""soft"" tubercle, the most characteristic hallmark of tuberculosis.When the antigen load at the initial infection site and regional lymph node is large, caseation necrosis may develop and lesions may later calcify.These calcified lesions of the primary site are referred to as the Ghon complex.After the development of hypersensitivity, the infection becomes quiescent and asymptomatic in the majority of patients (about 90%).In some, however, especially the very young and adults who are immunocompromised or who have other predisposing illnesses, the primary infection may evolve into clinical disease.The progression may be local at the site of the primary lesion, or it may be at one or more distant sites where bacilli have arrived during the early hematogenous spread.In a small number of persons whose initial tuberculous infection subsidies, secondary disease occurs in spite of acquired cellular immunity.In this phase of the disease, lesions are usually localized in the apices of the lungs (remember that tubercle bacilli require oxygen for growth).In about 5% of patients, apical pulmonary tuberculosis manifests itself within 2 years of the primary infection.Because of the acquired cellular immunity, bacilli are more promptly phagocytized and destroyed by the activated macrophages.As a result, in secondary tuberculosis, lesions remain localized and dissemination of organisms the lymphatic vessels is usually prevented.Hypersensitivity promotes a more rapid caseation and fibrotic walling-off of the focus.Histologically the reaction is characteristic of tubercle formation, manifested by a local accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages.T lymphocytes and their chemotactic lymphokines play a major role in the development of tuberculous granuloma.These differences between primary infection and post-primary or reactivation are attributed to (1) resistance and (2) hypersensitivity induced by the first infection of the host with tubercle bacilli.",D

The decrease in plasma osmotic pressure is the cause of edema in?,CHF,DVT,Nephrotic syndrome,None.,"• Following conditions can cause edema :-
1) The increased hydrostatic pressure of capillaries : It causes an increase in outward driving force. It may be due to impaired venous return e.g. in CHF or DVT.
2) Decreased plasma osmotic pressure of capillaries: It causes decreases in inward driving force. It results from Hypoproteinemia.
When total plasma protein is below 5 gm/dl (normal 6-8gm/dl) or albumin is below 2.5 gm/dl (normal 3.5-5 gm/dl) edema takes place.
Conditions causing hypoproteinemia are a nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis, protein-losing enteropathy, and PEM.
3) Defective removal of interstitial fluid by lymphatics: It is due to lymphatic obstruction, which may be inflammatory, neoplastic, post-surgical and post-irradiation. 
4) Increased vascular permeability: It occurs in acute and chronic inflammation, and during angiogenesis (new vessels are leaky).
5) Sodium (salt) and water retention: It causes expansion of plasma volume (hydrostatic pressure) and dilution of plasma proteins (↓ osmotic pressure).
The conditions responsible for this type of edema are ARF, acute glomerulonephritis, renal hypoperfusion, and increase renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) activity.",C

True about post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,Linear deposition,Diffuse involvement,Tram track appearance,Global sclerosis,"Robbins 9/e Pg 911 Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis This is a prototypical glomerular disease of immune complex etiology, which is decreasing in frequency in the United States but continues to be a fairly common disorder worldwide. It usually appears 1 to 4 weeks after a strepto- coccal infection of the pharynx or skin (impetigo). Skin infections are commonly associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis occurs most frequently in children 6 to 10 years of age, but children and adults of any age can also be affectedOGY The classic histologic picture is one of enlarged, hypercellular glomeruli (Fig. 20-9). The hypercellularity is caused by (1) infiltration by leukocytes, both neutrophils and monocytes; (2) proliferation of endothelial and mesangial cells; and (3) in severe cases by crescent formation. The proliferation and leu- kocyte infiltration are typically global and diffuse, that is, involv- ing all lobules of all glomeruli. There is also swelling of endothelial cells, and the combination of proliferation, swelling, and leuko- cyte infiltration obliterates the capillary lumens. r",B

Antihistamine and andidepressant Antihistamine and antidepressants have significant sedative effect. But - They can also be used as sedatives. According to Katzung 11th/e p. 521 After major depression, anxiety disorders represent the most common application of antidepressants. A number of SSRIs and SNRIs have been approved for all the major anxiety disorders. About Antihistaminic agent Katzung says p (271) and 409.

Drug which is NOT contra-indicated in pregnancy: March 2011,Propyl-thiouracil,Radioactive Iodine,Valproate,Warfarin,"Ans. A: Propyl-thiouracil Thioamide drugs (methyl and propyl thiouracil, methimazole and carbimazole) can also be used during pregnancy (the lowest possible dose should be used) The foetal thyroid is extremely susceptible to radiation and may be quickly destroyed. Propylthiouracil/ PTU/ 6-n-Propylthiouracil It is a thioamide drug used to treat hypehyroidism (including Graves' disease) by decreasing the amount of thyroid hormone produced by the thyroid gland. Its notable side effects include a risk of agranulocytosis. PTU inhibits the enzyme thyroperoxidase, which normally acts in thyroid hormone synthesis by oxidizing the anion iodide (I-) to iodine (10), facilitating iodine's addition to tyrosine residues on the hormone precursor thyroglobulin. This is one of the essential steps in the formation of thyroxine (T4). PTU does not inhibit the action of the sodium-dependent iodide transpoer located on follicular cells' basolateral membranes. Inhibition of this step requires competitive inhibitors, such as perchlorate and thiocyanate. PTU also acts by inhibiting the enzyme 5'-deiodinase (tetraiodothyronine 5' deiodinase), which conves T4 to the active form T3. (This is in contrast to methimazole, which shares propylthiouracil's central mechanism, but not its peripheral one) Administration is oral, with peak serum concentrations occurring in one hour, and actively concentrated to the thyroid gland. The drug is approximately 70% protein-bound and significantly ionized at normal physiologic pH, while the antithyroid agent methimazole is substantially less protein bound. However both are equally transferred across the placenta. Less than 10% of the drug is excreted unchanged, with the remaining fraction undergoing extensive hepatic metabolism glucuronidation. One side effect is agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia A more life threatening side effect is sudden, severe, fulminant hepatic failure occurs in up to 1 in 10,000 people taking propylthiouracil. PTU is preferred over methimazole only in the first trimester of pregnancy and in woman who may become pregnant. In the second and third trimester, methimazole is preferred.",A

It is true that sarcoma - a) Are malignant tumours of mesenchyme origin  b) Usualy spread by vascular invasion  c) Metastasise frequently to regional lymph node  d) Are only loosely invasive,ab,bc,cd,ac,"Pathways of metastasis 

Distant metastasis of cancers may occur through one of three pathways.

1.  Direct seeding of body cavities or surface

It occurs when a malignant neoplasm penetrates into a natural open field.
Most common cavity involved is peritoneal cavity, but other cavities may also be involved, e.g., pleural, pericardial, joint space, subarachnoid.
Such seeding is particularly characteristic of carcinomas arising in the ovaries.
Sometimes mucus secreting tumor of appendix (or less commonly ovary) fill the peritoneal cavity with a gelatinous neoplastic mass referred to as pseudomyxoma peritonei.

2.  Lymphatic spread

This is the most common method of metastasis for carcinomas.
Sarcoma may also use this route.
As tumors do not have lymphatics, this type of spread takes place through the lymphatic vessels located at the tumor margins.
The pattern of lymph node involvement follows the natural routes of lymphatic drainage.
The first node in a regional lymphatics that receives lymph flow from the primary tumor is called sentinel lymphnode.
Some times local lymph nodes may be bypassed because of venous lymphatic anastomosis skip metastasis.

3.  Hematogenous spread

It is typical of sarcomas but is also seen in carcinomas.
Veins are more commonly involved than arteries because veins have thinner walls that can be penetrated readily, in contrast arteries have thicker walls.
With venous invasion, the tumor cells in blood follow the venous flow draining the site of neoplasm.
So, liver and lung are the most frequent organs involved in hematogenous spread because all portal area drainage flows to the liver and all caval blood flows to the lung.
Arterial spread may occur when tumor cells pass through the pulmonary capillary beds or pulmonary A-V shunts or when pulmonary metastasis give rise to additional tumor emboli.",A
Which drug inhibits Na+-K+ ATPase pump -,Digitalis,Amiodarone,Varapamil,Hydralazine,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Digitalis o Following figure will help you to understand the mechanism of action of digoxin.o There are two important pumps in myocytes:i) 3Na+/l Ca+2 exchanger# This pump transports Ca+2 in exchange of Na+.# When Na+ concentration inside the myocyte is high, Na+/Ca+2 exchanger cause efflux of Na+ out of the myocytes and in exchange it causes influx of Ca+2 inside the myocytes.# NaVCa+2 exchanger does not require ATP to function, ions move along their concentration gradient.ii) NaVK+ ATPase# This pump causes efflux of Na+ in exchange of influx of K+.o Digitalis inhibits Na+K+ ATPase. Therefore, efflux of Na+ by Na+ K+ ATPase is inhibited. This results in increased concentration of Na+ inside the myocytes.o Increased Na+ concentration causes increased efflux of Na+ by Na+/Ca+2 exchanger with an increased influx of Ca+2 inside of myocytes.o Thus, intracellular concentration of Ca+2 is increased which results in increased force of cardiac contractiono It is worth noting that Na+ efflux is affected in two ways:i) Na+ efflux is dcreased by Na+/K+ ATPase (due to inhibition of Na+K+ ATPase by digoxin).ii) Na+ efflux is increased by Ca+2/Na+ exchanger (due to increased intracellular Na+ as a result of decreased Na+ efflux by Na+/K+ ATPase)",A

A study of aging shows that senescent cells have accumulated damage from toxic byproducts of metabolism. There is increased intracellular lipofuscin deposition. Prolonged ingestion of which of the following substances is most likely to counteract this aging mechanism?,Antioxidants,Analgesics,Antimicrobials,Antineoplastic agents,"Antioxidants may counteract the effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that may accumulate acutely and chronically within cells as a consequence of environmental insults and pathologic processes. Certainly, health food stores promote this concept with sales of products such as vitamin E. However, cellular damage is multifactorial, and proving that one compound has a significant effect is difficult. Analgesics ameliorate the perception of pain from cellular damage, but they do not prevent or diminish cell damage; they only mask it. Antimicrobials may help the body's own immune defenses against infectious agents and shorten and/or diminish tissue damage. However, long-term use of antimicrobials is discouraged because it may alter the body's own useful microbial flora, and it can promote development of drug-resistant strains that pose a serious health risk for the general population. (As Mr. Spock noted, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."") Antineoplastic agents are given for malignancies and rarely have benefit for cancer prevention. Glucocorticoids provide short-term improvement in well-being, but when used for longer periods, they have deleterious effects.",A

The antimicrobial agent which inhibits the ergosterol biosynthesis is:,Ketoconazole,Amphotericin B,5-Flucytosine,Griseofulvin,"IMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES: These are presently the most extensively used antifungal drugs. Four irnidazoles are entirely topical, while ketoconazole is used both orally and topically. Two triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for systemic mycosis because of greater efficacy, longer tlh, fewer side effects and drug interactions. The imidazoles and triazoles have broadspectrum antifungal activity covering dermatophytes, Candida, other fungi involved in deep mycosis (except mucor), Nocardia, some grampositive and anaerobic bacteria, e.g. Staph. aureus, Strep. faecal is, Bac. fragilis and Leishmania. The mechanism of action of irnidazoles and triazoles is the same. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme &;lanosterol l4--demethylase&; and thus impair ergosterol synthesis leading to a cascade of membrane abnormalities in the fungus. The lower host toxicity of triazoles compared to irnidazoles has correlated with their lower affinity for mammalian CYP450 enzymes and lesser propensity to inhibit mammalian sterol synthesis. However, because they are active against ceain bacteria as well (which do not have ergosterol), other mechanisms of action also appear to be involved. Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis. However, therapeutic concentrations are attained in the skin and vaginal fluid. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:761,762",A

All are true of benzodiazepines except:,Benzodiazepam is used in treatment of status epilepticus,Benzodiazepam is used in the long term treatment of psychic disorders,Clonazepam is used in the treatment of petitmal epilepsy,None of the above,"Benzodiazepines are effective for the treatment of anxiety symptoms secondary to panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, performance anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and extreme anxiety associated with phobias, such as fear of flying. ​
The benzodiazepines are also useful in treating anxiety related to depression and schizophrenia. 
Clonazepam is occasionally used as adjunctive therapy for certain types of seizures, whereas lorazepam and diazepam are the drugs of choice in terminating status epilepticus. Due to cross-tolerance, chlordiazepoxide, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, and oxazepam are useful in the acute treatment of alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal-related seizures.​
One area of concern regarding the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety is the potential for habituation, dependence, and abuse. Patients with certain personality disorders or a history of drug or alcohol abuse are particularly susceptible. However, the risk of dependence must be balanced with the need for treatment, since benzodiazepines are effective in both short- and long-term treatment of patients with sustained or recurring bouts of anxiety. Further, premature discontinuation of benzodiazepines, in the absence of other pharmacological treatment, results in a high rate of relapse. Withdrawal of benzodiazepines after chronic treatment, particularly those with short duration of action, can include increased anxiety and seizures. For this reason, it is important that discontinuation be earned out in a gradual manner.
Benzodiazepines cause many adverse effects. including sedation, mild memory impairments. decreased alertness, and slowed reaction time (which may lead to accidents). Memory problems can include visual-spatial deficits, but will manifest clinically in a variety of ways, including difficulty in word-finding. Occasionally, paradoxical reactions can occur with benzodiazepines such as an increase
in anxiety, sometimes reaching panic attack proportions. Other pathological reactions can include irritability, aggression, or behavioral disinhibition. Amnesic reactions (i.e., loss of memory for particular periods) can also occur. Benzodiazepines should not be used in pregnant women; there have been rare reports of craniofacial defects. In addition, benzodiazepines taken prior to delivery may result in sedated, under-responsive newborns and prolonged withdrawal reactions. In the elderly, benzodiazepines increase the risk of falls and must be used cautiously. These drugs are safer than classical sedative-hypnotics in overdosage and typically are fatal only if combined with other CNS depressants.

What is the half-life of p53 protein in normal cells?,20 minutes,60 minutes,12 hours,1 day,"In non stressed, healthy cells, p53 has a sho half-life (20 minutes), because of its association with MDM2, a protein that targets it for destruction. When the cell is stressed, for example by an assault on its DNA, p53 undergoes post-transcriptional modifications that release it from MDM2 and increase its half-life. Unshackled from MDM2, p53 also becomes activated as a transcription factor. Ref: Robbins 8th edition Chapter 7.",A

An important step in activation of naive CD4 +T cells and initiation of cell-mediated immune response is played by Interleukin-,2,1,3,4,"Activation of CD4 +T cells:

Naive CD4 +T cells cells recognize peptides displayed by dendritic cells and secrete IL-2, which functions as an autocrine growth factor to stimulate proliferation of the antigen-responsive T cells.
The subsequent differentiation of antigen-stimulated T cells to TH1 or TH17 cells is driven by the cytokines produced by APCs at the time of T-cell activation.
In some situations, the APCs (dendritic cells and macrophages) produce 1L-12, which induces the differentiation of CD4 +T cells to the TH1 subset. IFN-γ produced by these effector cells promotes further TH1 development, thus amplifying the reaction.
If the APCs produce inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and a close relative of IL-12 called IL-23, these stimulate differentiation of T cells to the TH17 subset.",A

Maximum FDA recommended dose is 4gm/day* Peak plasma concentration: 30-60 minutes* Half-life: 2 hours* Metabolism of acetaminophen in liver by:# Hepatic conjugation with glucuronic acid (~60%),# Sulfuric acid (~35%),# Cysteine (~3%);# CYP mediated N-hydroxylation to form NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine)* Note: NAPQI is one of the highly reactive intermediate metabolite of acetaminophen metabolism. This usually reacts with sulfhydryl groups is GSH - rendered harmless.* In hepatotoxicity condition GSH level depleted.SIDE EFFECTS* The most serious acute adverse effect of over dosage of acetaminophen is a potentially fatal hepatic necrosis.* Due to hepatotoxicity there is saturation of glucuronide and sulfate conjugation and increasing amounts undergo CYP-mediated N-hydroxylation to form excess of NAPQI (it accumulates due to depletion of GSH).* The highly reactive NAPQI causes enzymatic dysfunction, produces oxidative stress and apoptosis.* In adults hepatotoxicity may occur after ingestion of single dose of 10-15g. Doses of 20-25g is potentially fatal.TREATMENT OF ACETAMINOPHEN TOXICITY:* Activated charcoal within 4 hours of ingestion decreases absorption by 50-90%* N-acetylcysteine: antidote of choice for acetaminophen toxicity.

"A 58-year-old woman had a mitral valve replacement, and was placed on anticoagulants and prophylactic antibiotics following her surgery. Five days after her surgery, she developed a sharply demarcated, erythematous rash on her left thigh. Two days after the rash appeared, large hemorrhagic bullae began to form in the area of the rash. Which of the following medications most likely caused the patient's rash?",Aspirin,Cefazolin,Heparin,Warfarin,"Warfarin is a coumarin anticoagulant used for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with cardiac valve replacement and atrial fibrillation, as well as the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Warfarin may cause necrosis of the skin (typically on the breasts, thighs, and buttocks) generally between the third and tenth days of therapy. The lesions are initially sharply demarcated, erythematous, and purpuric. They may resolve or progress to large, irregular, hemorrhagic bullae that can eventually lead to necrosis. The mechanism for this reaction is related to warfarin's ability to deplete protein C, which can lead to a state of hypercoagulability and thrombosis in the cutaneous microvasculature. Aspirin is commonly used for its antiplatelet effect; however, it would not be indicated for anticoagulation of a patient with a recent cardiac valve replacement. Fuhermore, aspirin is not associated with the development of this type of skin necrosis. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic commonly used as a perioperative prophylactic agent. If the patient was allergic to this antibiotic, an erythematous rash might have appeared. However, the rash would not lead to the appearance of large, hemorrhagic bullae. Heparin is an intravenous anticoagulant indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with cardiac valve replacement and atrial fibrillation. It is also indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and for treatment of some coagulopathies. Although heparin is associated with the development of thrombocytopenia, it is not associated with skin necrosis.",D

What is not associated with DIC -,Thrombocytopenia,Increased PT,Hyperfibrinogenemia,Increased FDP,"Plasma fibrinogen levels are reduced due to consumption in microvascular coagulation by which intravascular clotting occurs. Reference to earlier comments on normal blood coagulation (Chapter 3) may be helpful at this point. It suffices here to recall that clotting can be initiated by either the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by the release of tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin); or the intrinsic pathway, which involves the activation of factor XII by surface contact, collagen, or other negatively charged substances. Both pathways lead to the generation of throm- bin. Clotting normally is limited by the rapid clearance of activated clotting factors by the macrophages and the liver, endogenous anticoagulants (e.g., protein C), and the con- comitant activation of fibrinolysis. DIC usually is triggered by either (1) the release of tissue factor or thromboplastic substances into the circulation or (2) widespread endothelial cell damage (Fig. 11-28). Throm- boplastic substances can be released into the circulation from a variety of sources--for example, the placenta in obstetric complications or ceain types of cancer cells, paicularly those of acute promyelocytic leukemia and adenocarcino- mas. Cancer cells can also provoke coagulation in other ways, such as by releasing proteolytic enzymes and by expressing tissue factor. In gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis (impoant causes of DIC), endotoxins or exotoxins stimu- late the release of tissue factor from monocytes. Activated monocytes also release IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor, both of which stimulate the expression of tissue factor on endo- thelial cells and simultaneously decrease the expression of thrombomodulin. The latter, you may recall, activates protein C, an anticoagulant (Chapter 3). The net result of these alterations is the enhanced generation of thrombin and the blunting of inhibitory pathways that limit coagulation. Severe endothelial cell injury can initiate DIC by causing the release of tissue factor and by exposing subendothelial col- lagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF). However, even subtle forms of endothelial damage can unleash procoagulant activity by stimulating the increased expression of tissue factor on endothelial cell surfaces. Widespread endothelial injury can be produced by the deposition of antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., in systemic lupus erythematosus), by tem- perature extremes (e.g., after heat stroke or burn injury), or by infections (e.g., due to meningococci or rickettsiae). As discussed in Chapter 3, endothelial injury is an impoant consequence of endotoxemia, and, not surprisingly, DIC is a frequent complication of gram-negative sepsis. Disorders associated with DIC are listed in Table 11-12. Of these, DIC is most often associated with sepsis, obstetric complications, malignancy, and major trauma (especially trauma to the brain). The initiating events in these conditions are multiple and often interrelated. For example, in obstetric conditions, tissue factor derived from the placenta, retained dead fetus, or amniotic fluid enters the circulation; however, shock, hypoxia, and acidosis often coexist and can lead to widespread endothelial injury. Trauma to the brain releases fat and phospholipids, which act as contact factors and thereby activate the intrinsic arm of the coagulation cascade. Whatever the pathogenetic mechanism, DIC has two con- sequences. First, there is widespread fibrin deposition within the microcirculation. The associated obstruction leads to ischemia in the more severely affected or vulnerable organs and hemolysis as red cells are traumatized while passing through vessels narrowed by fibrin thrombi (micro- angiopathic hemolytic anemia). Second, a bleeding diathesis results from the depletion of platelets and clotting factors and the secondary release of plasminogen activators. Plasmin cleaves not only fibrin (fibrinolysis) but also factors V and VIII, thereby reducing their concentration fuher. In addition, fibrinolysis creates fibrin degradation products. These inhibit platelet aggregation, have antithrombin activity, and impair fibrin polymerization, all of which contribute to the hemostatic failure (Fig. 11-28).

Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a very common lesion, and a frequent source of palpable lumps in the breast, which may require fuher evaluation through either excisional biopsy (as in this case), Tru-cut needle biopsy (producing a thin core about 1 cm long), or needle aspiration (producing fluid or cells for cytology). Also know: While a diagnosis of breast cancer should obviously be confirmed microscopically before telling the clinician, invasive breast cancer can be suspected when there is a hard, white, nodular area of the breast that has irregular (but often reasonably well-defined - in contrast to the fibrotic areas of fibrocystic disease) boundaries. The changes of pregnancy cannot be reliably picked up on gross examination of the breast. Fibroadenoma , like breast cancer, tends to produce a well-defined mass lesion, but it typically has smooth borders and may have a slightly gray and slightly mucoid (e.g., shiny or oily appearing) surface on cross-section.

DOC for lithium induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Spiranolactone,Furosemide,Amiloride,None of the above,"AMILORIDE Mechanism of action:- The luminal membrane of late DT and CD cells expresses a distinct 'renal epithelial' or 'amiloride sensitive' Na+ channel through which Na+ enters the cell down its electrochemical gradient which is generated by Na+K+ ATPase operating at the basolateral membrane. This Na+ entry paially depolarizes the luminal membrane creating a -15 mV transepithelial potential difference which promotes secretion of K+ into the lumen through K+ channels. Though there is no direct coupling between Na+ and K+ channels, more the delivery of Na+ to the distal nephron--greater is its entry through the Na+ channel--luminal membrane is depolarized to a greater extent--driving force for K+ secretion is augmented. As such, all diuretics acting proximally (loop diuretics, thiazides, CAse inhibitors) promote K+ secretion. Amiloride and triamterene block the luminal Na+ channels and indirectly inhibit K+ excretion( Pottasium sparing diuretic). side effects:- Nausea, diarrhoea and headache. Uses:- Amiloride blocks entry of Li+ through Na+ channels in the CD cells and mitigates diabetes insipidus induced by lithium. Given as an aerosol it affords symptomatic improvement in cystic fibrosis by increasing fluidity of respiratory secretions. Ref:- kd tripathi; pg num:-589,590",C

Digitalis acts in atrial fibrillation by ?,Increasing AV node refractoriness,Decreasing atrial contractility,Inhibiting Na+ K+ ATPase pump,Inhibiting Na+ H+ ATPase pump,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Increase in A.V. node refractoriness Digitalis in arrhvthma o Digitalis is the drug of choice for controlling ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation (AF) with hea failure. o Digitalis reduces the ventricular rate in AF by decreasing the number of impulses that are able to pass down the A-V node and bundle of His 1. It increases effective refractory period-ERP (Le refractoriness) of A-V node by direct, vagomimetic and antiadrenergic action - the minimum interval between consecutive impulses that can successfully traverse the conducting tissue is increased. 2. A degree of A-V block is naturally established in AF. Because of the relatively long ERP of A-V node, many atrial impulses impinge on it while it is still refractory; others falling early in the relative refractory period get extinguished by decremental conduction - These concealed impulses leave upper margin ofA-V node refractory for a fuher period. Thus, any influence which increases atrial rate in AF (e.g. digitalis), by itself reduces ventricular rate. o Inhibition of Na+ K+ ATPase is responsible for inotropic action of digitalis, not for antiarrhythmic action. o Digitalis has two impoant pharmacological actions - I. Increased contractility of hea by inhibiting Na+ ATPase This action is beneficial in cardiac failure. 2. Increased refractoriness of SA node and AV node .1 automaticity and conduction This action is beneficial in arrhythmia.",A

True about salivary gland tumour is:,MEC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,ACC shows perineural spread and requires wide resection,MEC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,ACC is well-encapsulated and does not require surgical excision,"Treatment and Prognosis 
The treatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma is predicated by the location, histopathologic grade, and clinical stage of the tumor. Early-stage tumors of the parotid often can be treated by subtotal parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Advanced tumors may necessitate total removal of the parotid gland, with sacrifice of the facial nerve. Submandibular gland tumors are treated by assured surgical excision. For low-grade neoplasms, only a modest margin of surrounding normal tissue may need to be removed, but high-grade or tumors warrant wider resection, similar to that required for squamous cell carcinomas. If there is underlying bone destruction, then the involved bone must be excised. 
 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a relentless tumor that is prone to local recurrence and eventual distant metastasis. Surgical resection is usually the treatment of choice. Adjuvant radiation therapy may slightly improve patient survival in some cases, although recent SEER data suggest that radiation therapy does little to improve prognosis overall. Because metastasis to regional lymph nodes is uncommon (6% to 10% of cases), neck dissection usually is not indicated.

All known effects of cyclic AMP in eukaryotic cells results from ?,Activation of the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase,Activation of synthetase,Activation of protein kinase,Phosphorylation of G protein,"Ans. 'c' i.e., Activation of protein kinase o Cyclic AMP exes most of its effects by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinases. These kinases are composed of a cAMP-binding regulatory (R) dimer and two catalytic (C) chains. When cAMP binds to the R dimer, active C chains are released to diffuse through the cytoplasm and nucleus, where they transfer phosphate from ATP to appropriate substrate proteins, often enzymes. The specificity of cAMP's regulatory effects resides in the distinct protein substrates of the kinases that are expressed in different cells. For example, liver is rich in phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, enzymes whose reciprocal regulation by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation gov erns carbohydrate storage and release.",C

Spongiform degeneration of cerebral coex occurs in -,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,Fatal familial insomnia,Cerebral toxoplasmosis,"Spongiform Encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) Spongiform encephalopathy, also called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or mad-cow disease, though included under the group of viral encephalitis but is caused by accumulation of prion proteins. Prion proteins are a modified form of normal structural proteins present in the mammalian CNS and are peculiar in two respects: they lack nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and they can be transmitted as an infectious proteina- ceous paicles (Dr Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1997 for his discovery on prion proteins). Majority of cases occur sporadically though familial predisposition with autosomal dominant inheritance has also been repoed in 5-15% cases. Other methods of transmission are by iatrogenic route (e.g. by tissue transplantation from an infected individual) and by human consumption of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)-infected beef, also called as mad-cow disease. Clinically, CJD is characterised by rapidly progressive dementia with prominent association of myoclonus. CJD is invariably fatal with mean survival of about 7 months after diagnosis.Grossly, the changes are too rapid to become noticeable but brain atrophy may be seen in long-standing cases. Microscopically, the hallmark is spongiform change i.e. there are small round vacuoles in the neuronal cells. These changes are predominantly seen in the coex and other grey matter areas. Spongiform changes result in neuronal loss and glial cell proliferation but significantly without any inflammation or white matter involvement.

The classical clinical evidence for diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma is the triad of gross haematuria, flank plain and palpable abdominal mass. The most common presenting abnormality is haematuria that occurs in about 60% of cases. By the time the tumour is detected, it has spread to distant sites haematogenous route to the lungs, brain and bone, and locally to the liver and perirenal lymph nodes. Systemic symptoms of fatiguability, weight loss, cachexia and intermittent fever unassociated with evidence of infection are found in many cases at presentation. A number of paraneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormone production by the renal cell carcinoma have been described.

Which of the following lesions best explains these findings?",Chronic subdural hematoma,Frontal lobe abscess,Glioblastoma with edema,Hydrocephalus ex vacuo,"The papilledema and the herniation are a consequence of brain swelling, typically the vasogenic form of edema from blood-brain barrier disruption adjacent to the neoplasm. A large aggressive neoplasm, such as glioblastoma, may produce a mass effect via enlargement from rapid growth, hemorrhage, and surrounding edema. The mass effect with herniation of the medial temporal lobe results in a third cranial nerve palsy as the nerve is compressed. A chronic subdural hemorrhage accumulates slowly enough that herniation may not occur. An abscess may cause a mass effect with some associated brain swelling, but this patient is afebrile. There is no pressure effect with hydrocephalus ex vacuo, which is a consequence of cerebral atrophy. An infarct is not likely to produce pronounced associated brain swelling, and a mass effect in the occipital lobe is unlikely to affect the third nerve.

Glycogen is viually absent from the hepatocytes in biopsy specimen. Mitochondrias are large pleomorphic and have decreased matricial density on electron microscopy. The kidney changes include swelling and fatty degeneration of proximal tubules. Astrocyte edema and loss of neuron in the brain. Reyes syndrome It is an acute self limiting metabolic insult of diverse etiology resulting in generalised nzitochondrial dysfunction due to inhibition of fatty acid )8 oxidation. Salicylates or viral infection can precipitate this metabolic impairment. The pathogenesis is thought to be damage to mitochondria caused by salicylate metabolite or some other toxin or chemical in the setting of viral infection. The reasons for mitochondria' dysfunction are unknown. No toxic factor has yet been conclusively identified but studies have suggested an etiological link among Reye's syndrome. The activities of hepatic mitachondrial enzymes including ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase are reduced often to less than half their normal values. Mitochondria' dysfunction leads to elevated sho chain fatty acids and hyperanzmonenzia as well as directly to cerebral edema. It is prudent to avoid the use of aspirin as an antipyretic in pediatric patients with influenza or varicella. Clinical manifestations:- Classic Reyes syndrome exihibits a stereotypic biphasic course. It usually occurs in a previously healthy child. A prodromal febrile illness, an upper respiratory tract infection or chicken pox is followed by an interval in which the child has seemingly recovered. The abrupt onsent of protracted vomiting then occurs usually within 5-7 days after the onset of viral illness. Delirium, combative behaviour and stupor may occur simultaneously within a few hours after the onset of vomiting. Neurological symptoms may rapidly progress to seizures, coma and death; focal neurological signs are absent. Laboratory features:- There is explosive release from liver and muscle of enzymes such as aminotransferases, creatine kinase and lactic dehydrogenase. The activity of the mitochondrial enzyme serum glutamate dehydrogenase is greatly increased. Serum Ammonia level is increased. The prothrombin time is mild to moderately increased.",D

The tuberculin test is associated with all of the following except:,Indicates the cell mediated immunity against the bacteria,Likely to be positive in prior exposure to mycobacteria,Can distinguish between infection and disease,May be false negative in immunosuppression,"Tuberculin test/ Mantoux test: The PPD test determines if someone has developed an immune response to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The standard recommended tuberculin test is the Mantoux test, which is administered by injecting a 0.1 mL of liquid containing 5 TU (tuberculin units) PPD (purified protein derivative) into the top layers of skin of the forearm. Doctors should read skin tests 48-72 hours after the injection. The basis of the reading of the skin test is the presence or absence and the amount of induration (localized swelling). A negative test does not always mean that a person is free of tuberculosis. A person who received a BCG vaccine against tuberculosis may also have a positive skin reaction to the TB test. A positive tuberculin skin test result signifies cell-mediated hypersensitivity to tubercular antigens, but does not differentiate between infection and disease. False-negative reactions (or skin test anergy) may be produced by ceain viral infections, sarcoidosis, malnutrition, Hodgkin lymphoma, immunosuppression, and (notably) overwhelming active tuberculous disease.

Commonest carcinoma of the with multifocal origin is,Schirrhous carcinoma,Adenocystic carcinoma,Lobular carcinoma,Ductal carcinoma,"Refer Robbins page no 1057 DCIS can be divided into two major architectural subtypes, comedo and noncomedo (Fig. 23-17). Some cases of DCIS have a single growth pattern, but most are comprised of a mixture of patterns. Nuclear grade and necrosis are better predictors of local recurrence and progression to invasion than architectural type. Comedo DCIS may occasionally produce vague nodularity, but more often it is detected on mammography as clustered or linear and branching areas of calcification (Fig. 23-17A). It is defined by two features: (1) tumor cells with pleomorphic, high- grade nuclei and (2) areas of central necrosis (Fig. 23-17B). Noncomedo DCIS lacks either high-grade nuclei or central necrosis. Several patterns may be seen. Cribriform DCIS may have rounded (cookie cutter-like) spaces (Fig. 23-17C) within the ducts, or a solid DCIS pattern. Micropapillary DCIS pro- duces bulbous protrusions without a fibrovascular core, often arranged in complex intraductal patterns (Fig. 23-17D). In other cases, DCIS produces true papillae with fibrovascular cores that lack a myoepithelial cell layer.

Reid index is useful in -,Glomerulonephritis,Chronic bronchitis,Cirrhosis,MI,"Reid index is used to assess the increase in the size of the submucous gland in chronic bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis 

Chronic bronchitis is defined as a persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years, in the absence of any other identifiable cause.
It is strongly associated with smoking.
Morphological changes in chronic bronchitis
The earliest feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus in the larger airways, associated with hypertrophy of submucosal gland of trachea and bronchi.
Although the numbers of glands increase slightly, the major increase is in the size of mucous glands.
This increase can be assessed by Reid index which is the ratio of between the thickness of the submucosal glands to that of the bronchial wall. The Reid index (normal 0.4) is increased in chronic bronchitis.
Later, small airways (small bronchi and bronchioles) are also involved and show goblet cell hyperplasia, and intraluminal and peribronchial fibrosis.
In most severe cases, there may be obliteration of lumen due to fibrosis → Bronchiolitis obliterans.

It arises from meningothelial cells and histologically consists of whorls of elongated cells with scattered psammoma bodies. The benign behavior of this tumor is apparent from its ""pushing"" pattern of growth. The tumor tends to expand downward, compressing the brain, but without invading it. For this reason, this tumor can be easily removed at surgery. An aeriovenous malformation is a vascular aggregate of aeries, veins, and vessels with intermediate characteristics. These lesions are usually intracerebral and manifest with hemorrhage or seizures. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most frequent malignant intracerebral tumor. It arises from neoplastic transformation of astrocytes within the white matter.

"A 20-year-old woman and her twin sister both experience increasing diplopia. Their conditions develop within 3 years of each other. On physical examination, they have exophthalmos and weak extraocular muscle movement. The thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged but painless in each sister, and there is no lymphadenopathy in either woman. Which of the following serum laboratory findings is most likely to be reported in these sisters?",Decreased free thyroxine level,Decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone level,High titer thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies,Increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone level,"Exophthalmos is a feature seen in about 40% of individuals with Graves' disease. The hyperfunctioning thyroid gland leads to an increased T4 level, with positive feedback from the pituitary to decrease thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion. There is about 50% concordance of Graves' disease among identical twins. The autoimmune character of this disorder is evidenced by an association with HLA-DR3 and by the presence of an autoantibody against TSH receptor that activates T4 secretion. An increased thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) level would increase the TSH level and increase the T4 , but feedback typically occurs at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus, and abnormal increases in TRH are uncommon. Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies can be seen in Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves' disease, but the highest titers occur in Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Osteogenesis imperfect defect in,Collagen type I,Elastin,Collagen type IV,basement membrane,"harshmohan textbook of pathology 7th edition. *osteogenesis imperfecta is an autosomal dominant or recessive disorder of synthesizing type1 collagen that constitutes 90 to 95 % bone matrix Osteogenesis Imperfecta Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as ""brittle bone disease,"" is actually a group of genetic disorders caused by defec- tive synthesis of type I collagen. Because type I collagen is a major component of extracellular matrix in other pas of the body, there are also numerous extraskeletal manifesta- tions (affecting skin, joints, teeth, and eyes, for example). The mutations underlying OI characteristically involve the coding sequences for a1 or a2 chains of type I collagen. Because collagen synthesis and extracellular expo require formation of a complete and intact triple helix, any primary defect in a collagen chain tends to disrupt the entire structure and results in its premature degradation (an example of a dominant negative mutation) (Chapter 6). As a consequence, most defects manifest as autosomal domi- nant disorders and may be associated with severe malformations. There is, however, a broad spectrum of severity, and mutations that result in qualitatively normal collagen but at only reduced levels generally have milder manifestations. The fundamental abnormality in all forms of OI is too little bone, resulting in extreme skeletal fragility. Four major sub- types are recognized. The type II variant is uniformly fatal in utero or immediately postpaum as a consequence of multiple fractures that occur before bih. By contrast, patients with type I OI have a normal lifespan, with only a modestly increased proclivity for fractures during child- hood (decreasing in frequency after pubey). The classic finding of blue sclerae in type I OI is attributable to decreased scleral collagen content; this deficit causes a relative trans- parency that allows the underlying choroid to be seen. Hearing loss can be related to conduction defects in the middle and inner ear bones, and small misshapen teeth are a result of dentin deficiency. Ref Robbins 9/e p767",A

Bone biopsy reveals a mosaic pattern of bone spicules with prominent osteoid seams. Which of the following neoplasms occurs at an increased frequency in patients with this disorder?",Astrocytoma,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Meningioma,Osteosarcoma,"The phrase ""mosaic pattern"" of newly formed woven bone is a specific tip-off for Paget's disease of bone, and is not seen in other bone conditions. The clinical and radiologic presentation are typical; an increased hat size may also be a clue. In its early stages, Paget's disease is characterised by osteolysis, producing patchwork areas of bone resorption with bizarre, large osteoclasts. In the middle stage of the disease, secondary osteoblastic activity compensates with new bone formation, producing the mosaic pattern. In late Paget's, the bones are dense and osteosclerotic. Paget's disease is suspected to be related to prior viral infection, but the cause remains mysterious. Complications include myelophthisic anemia, high output cardiac failure, pain secondary to nerve compression, deformities secondary to skeletal changes, and in about 1% of patients, osteosarcoma or other sarcoma, typically involving the jaw, pelvis, or femur. An increased incidence of astrocytomas is associated with tuberous sclerosis.Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually a disease of young adults, although older patients may have the lymphocyte-depleted form.Meningiomas are mostly benign tumors that affect adults, especially females.

Pink puffers are associated with?,Emphysema,Chronic bronchitis,Pneumonia,Bronchiectasis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Emphysema * A ""pink puffer"" is a person where emphysema is the primary underlying pathology. In emphysema, not only there is less surface area for gas exchange, there is also less vascular bed for gas exchange. The body then has to compensate by hyperventilation (the ""puffer""). Their arterial blood gases (ABGs) actually are relatively normal because of this compensatory hyperventilation. They actually have less hypoxemia (compared to blue bloaters) and appear to have a ""pink"" complexion and hence ""pink puffer"". Some of the pink appearance may also be due to the work (use of neck and chest muscles) these folks put into just drawing a breath.* A ""blue bloater"" is a person where the primary underlying lung pathology is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is caused by excessive mucus production with airway obstruction resulting from hyperplasia of mucus- producing glands, goblet cell metaplasia, and chronic inflammation around bronchi. Unlike emphysema, the pulmonary capillary bed is undamaged. Instead, the body responds to the increased obstruction by decreasing ventilation and increasing cardiac output. There is a dreadful ventilation to perfusion mismatch leading to hypoxemia and polycythemia. In addition, they also have increased carbon dioxide retention (hypercapnia). Because of increasing obstruction, their residual lung volume gradually increases (the ""bloating"" part). They are hypoxemic/cyanotic because they actually have worse hypoxemia than pink puffers and this manifests as bluish lips and faces--the ""blue"" part.",A

Which of the following drugs lack vasodilatory properties that is effective in angina?,Metoprolol,Verapamil,Isosorbide dinitrate,Nifedipine,"Metoprolol: It is the prototype of cardioselective (β1) blocker; nearly 50 times higher dose is needed to block isoprenaline induced vasodilation. Some measure of inverse agonistic activity on β1 receptors has also been demonstrated. It is less likely to worsen asthma, but is not entirely safe. It may be preferred in diabetics receiving insulin or oral hypoglycaemics. Patients who complain of cold hands and feet while on propranolol, do better on metoprolol.
First pass metabolism of metoprolol is less marked than propranolol, but 90% or more is ultimately hydroxylated by CYP2D6 before excretion. There are 'extensive' and 'poor' hydroxylators of metoprolol (CYP2D6 alleles); the latter may require a lower dose.
Side effects of metoprolol are milder. It is generally given orally for hypertension, angina and CHF, but i.v. injection (5-15 mg) has been used in myocardial infarction provided bradycardia is absent.
Key concept:
Beta-blockers do not cause vasodilation.

True about G protein coupled receptors is:,G proteins bind to hormones on the cell surface,"All the three subunits alpha, beta and gamma should bind to each other for G proteins to act",G proteins act as inhibitory and excitatory because of difference in alpha subunit,G protein is bound to GTP in resting state,"Ans. (C) G proteins act as inhibitory and excitatory because of difference in alpha subunit(Ref: KDT 8th/e p54)* G proteins are so-called because they bind the guanine nucleotides GDP and GTP. They are heterotrimers (i.e., made of three different subunits)* The three subunits are: Ga, Gb and Gg.* In the inactive state G protein has GDP bound to its Ga subunit.* When a hormone or other ligand binds to the associated receptor (GPCR), the GDP is exchanged for GTP.* GTP activates Ga causing it to dissociate from GbGg (which remain linked as a dimer).* Activated Ga in turn activates an effector molecule like adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to the ""second messenger"" cyclic AMP).* Gs, Gi and Gq are different types of G-proteins due to different a-subunits.* Gs and Gq are stimulatory whereas Gi is inhibitory G-protein.",C

Leukotriene antagonists is: March 2009,Nicordanil,Zileuton,Sodium chromoglycate,Montelukast,"Ans. D: Montelukast Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used for the maintenance treatment of asthma and to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. It is usually administered orally. Montelukast is a CysLT1 antagonist; that is it blocks the action of leukotriene D4 (and secondary ligands LTC4 and LTE4) on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene, and results in less inflammation. Because of its method of operation, it is not useful for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. Again because of its very specific focus of operation, it does not interact with other allergy medications such as theophylline. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is zafirlukast. Zileuton, an asthma drug, blocks leukotriene synthesis by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme of the eicosanoid synthesis pathway",D

Viral cytotoxicity is either direct or indirect (immunologically mediated). Viruses may injure cells directly by subverting cellular enzymes and depleting the cell's nutrients, thereby disrupting the normal homeostatic mechanisms. Some viruses also encode proteins that induce apoptosis once daughter virions are mature. Viruses may also injure cells indirectly through activation of the immune system. Both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system protect against the harmful effects of viral infections by eliminating infected cells. In brief, the presentation of viral proteins to the immune system in the context of a self major histocompatibility complex on the cell surface immunizes the body against the invader and elicits both killer cells and antiviral antibodies. These arms of the immune system eliminate virus-infected cells by inducing apoptosis or by lysing the virally infected target cell with complement.

"During a routine breast self-examination, a 35-year-old female is concerned because her breasts feel ""lumpy."" She consults you as her primary care physician. After performing an examination, you reassure her that no masses are present and that the ""lumpiness"" is due to fibrocystic changes. Considering this clinical opinion, a pathologic finding that is consistent with the nonproliferative form of fibrocystic change is",A blue-domed cyst,A radial scar,Atypical hyperplasia,Papillomatosis,"Fibrocystic change of the breast is one of the most common features seen in the female breast. It is most likely associated with an endocrine imbalance that causes an abnormality of the normal monthly cyclic events within the breast. These fibrocystic changes are subdivided into nonproliferative and proliferative changes. Nonproliferative changes include fibrosis of the stroma and cystic dilation of the terminal ducts, which when large may form blue-domed cysts. A common feature of the ducts in nonproliferative changes is apocrine metaplasia, which refers to epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with apical snouts. Proliferative changes include epithelial hyperplasia of the ducts. This hyperplastic epithelium may form papillary structures (papillomatosis when pronounced), or may be quite abnormal (atypical hyperplasia). Two benign, but clinically impoant, forms of proliferative fibrocystic change include sclerosing adenosis and radial scar. Both of these may be mistaken histologically for infiltrating ductal carcinoma, but the presence of myoepithelial cells is a helpful sign that points to the benign nature of the proliferation. Sclerosing adenosis is a disease of the terminal lobules that is typically seen in patients 35 to 45 years old. It produces a firm mass, most often located in the upper outer quadrant. Microscopically there is florid proliferation of small ductal structures in a fibrous stroma, which on low power is stellate in appearance and somewhat maintains the normal lobular architecture. A radial scar refers to ductal proliferation around a central fibrotic area. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition",A

True regarding bupropion is: September 2009,Dopamine reuptake stimulator,It is an antianxiety drug,No precipitation of seizures,Nicotinic receptor antagonist,"Ans. D: Nicotinic receptor antagonist Bupropion/amfebutamone is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. It acts as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), as well as alpha3 beta4-nicotinic receptor antagonist. Bupropion belongs to the chemical class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants cathinone and diethylpropion, and to phenethylamines in general. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own but it is paicularly popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Since it does not inhibit serotonin reuptake at all (or very insignificantly), bupropion does not cause weight gain or sexual dysfunction like the SSRI group of antidepressants.

What is the histological appearance of brain in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -,Neuronophagia,Spongiform change in brain,Microabscesses,Demyelination,"(Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) Spongiform encephalopathy, also called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) or mad-cow disease, though included under the group of viral encephalitis but is caused by accumulation of prion proteins. Prion proteins are a modified form of normal structural proteins present in the mammalian CNS and are peculiar in two respects: they lack nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and they can be transmitted as an infectious proteina- ceous paicles (Dr Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1997 for his discovery on prion proteins). Majority of cases occur sporadically though familial predisposition with autosomal dominant inheritance has also been repoed in 5-15% cases. Other methods of transmission are by iatrogenic route (e.g. by tissue transplantation from an infected individual) and by human consumption of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)-infected beef, also called as mad-cow disease. Clinically, CJD is characterised by rapidly progressive dementia with prominent association of myoclonus. CJD is invariably fatal with mean survival of about 7 months after diagnosis. Grossly, the changes are too rapid to become noticeable but brain atrophy may be seen in long-standing cases. Microscopically, the hallmark is spongiform change i.e. there are small round vacuoles in the neuronal cells. These changes are predominantly seen in the coex and other grey matter areas. Spongiform changes result in neuronal loss and glial cell proliferation but significantly without any inflammation or white matter involvement.

True Statement about silicosis -a) Produces pleural plaqueb) Associated with tuberculosisc) Lower lobe infiltrationd) Hilar adenopathy,c,d,bd,ac,"Silicosis

Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide (silica).
Currently, it is the most prevalent occupational disease in the world.
Silicosis is a slowly progressive disease, usually presenting after decades of exposure as slowly progressive nodular fibrosing pneumoconiosis.
Silica occurs in both crystalline and amorphous forms but crystalline forms are much more fibrogenic. The crystalline form are quartz, crystobalite.
Silicosis is characterized in its early stages by nodules in the upper zones of the lung. As the disease progresses these nodules may coalesce into hard collagenous scars.
Fibrotic lesions occur in the hilar lymph node and pleura. Sometimes thin sheets of calcification occur in the lymph nodes and are seen radiographically as egg shell calcification i.e. (calcium surrounding a zone lacking calcification.
It the disease continues to progress, expansion and coalescence of lesions produce progressive massive fibrosis.
Histologically the lesions of silicosis consists of concentric layers of hyalinized collagen surrounded by a dense capsule of more condensed collagen.
Examination of the nodules by polarized microscopy reveals the birefringent silica particles.
Silicosis is associated with an increased susceptibility to TB. It is postulated that silicosis results in depression of cell mediated immunity and the crystalline silica may inhibit the ability of pulmonary macrophages to kill phagocytosed mycobacteria.

Only males are manifesting disease.
Females are acting as carriers → sisters sons had suffered from the disease.


Both these are features of X-linked recessive disorders.

X-linked disorders

Except for a few conditions, all X-linked disorders are X-linked recessive.
A male has only one X-chromosome, the male with an affected gene on X-chromosome will always manifest the disease.
On the other hand, the female has 2 X-chromosomes, the heterozygous female will be a carrier because of the expression of a normal allele on the other X-chromosome.
Note → Female with Turner syndrome (only one 'X' chromosome) can manifest X-linked recessive disorders.
50% boys of the carrier mother will be affected.
All daughters of an affected father will become a carrier, i.e. affected father will transmit the defective X chromosome to all the daughters.
Father will not transmit the disease to son as boys do not inherit X-chromosome from father.

Which of the following is an antiapoptotic gene?,BAX,BAD,BCL-X,BIM,"Apoptosis results from the activation of enzymes called caspases (so named because they are cysteine proteases that cleave proteins after aspaic residues). The activation of caspases depends on a finely tuned balance between production of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Two distinct pathways converge on caspase activation: the mitochondrial pathway and the death receptor pathway pro-apoptotic members of the family called Bax and Bak, which dimerize, inse into the mito- chondrial membrane, and form channels through which cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins escape into the cytosol. These sensors also inhibit the anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (see fuher on), enhancing the leakage of mitochondrial proteins. Cytochrome c, together with some cofactors, activates caspase-9. Other proteins that leak out of mitochondria block the activities of caspase antagonists that function as physiologic inhibitors of apop- tosis. The net result is the activation of the caspase cascade, ultimately leading to nuclear fragmentation. Conversely, if cells are exposed to growth factors and other survival signals, they synthesize anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the two main ones of which are Bcl-2 itself and Bcl-xL. These proteins antagonize Bax and Bak, and thus limit the escape of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins. Cells deprived of growth factors not only activate the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak but also show reduced levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, thus fuher tilting the balance toward death. ref Robbins 9/e p19",C

The major opsonins are IgG antibodies, the C3b breakdown product of complement , and ceain plasma lectin , notably mannose-binding lectin, all of which are recognized by specific receptors on leukocytes. Three major Opsonins IgG Opsonin (The Fc Fragment of immunoglobulin G) C3b Opsonin is the fragment generated by activation of complement pathway Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins in the plasma which bind to bacterial cell wall. Opsonisation with Opsonins: Opsonins are specific proteins in the serum that enhance the process of phagocytosis by coating the surface of target bacteria or microorganisms. This process is called opsonisation (meaning preparing for eating). Opsonins establish a bond between bacteria and the cell membrane of phagocytic cell. If the surface of the target is prepared (opsonized) by plasma proteins, phagocytosis is made easier, though some targets can be taken up without this coating. The efficiency of phagocytosis is greatly enhanced when microbes are opsonized by these proteins Phagocytes such as Neutrophils express high affinity receptors for opsonin protein. Neutrophils have membrane receptors for IgG and C3b. These are three major types of Opsonins: IgG antibody C3b fragment of Complement Non-specific opsonins This is the most impoant opsonin IgG antibody works like a ligand. The Fab pa of the globulin binds to the surface of the microorganism while the Fc poion sticks out and fits into the membrane receptors of the phagocyte Benign Fragment of C3, C3b is set free when complement is activated Like IgG, C3b has a tail end that fits into a receptor on the surfaces of phagocytic cells Several proteins have opsonic propeies Lectins (Mannose-Binding Lectins) are carbohydrates binding proteins in the plasma which bind to bacterial cell wall C-reactive protein Hageman Factor Serum amyloid A Ref: Robbins 9th edition Pgno: 78",C
"If both the parents are carriers of the beta-thalassemia gene, the chance of having a child with thalassemia major in each pregnancy is",25%,50%,75%,100%,"Normally, the majority of adult hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of four protein chains, two a and two b globin chains arranged into a heterotetramer. In thalassemia, patients have defects in either the a or b globin chain, causing production of abnormal red blood cells (In sickle-cell disease, the mutation is specific to b globin). The thalassemias are classified according to which chain of the hemoglobin molecule is affected. In a-thalassemias, production of the a globin chain is affected, while in b-thalassemia, production of the b globin chain is affected. The b globin chains are encoded by a single gene on chromosome 11; a globin chains are encoded by two closely linked genes on chromosome 16 Thus, in a normal person with two copies of each chromosome, two loci encode the b chain, and four loci encode the a chain.Thalassemias are genetic disorders inherited from a person's parents.

"All of the following are true regarding vasodilation in acute inflammation, except:",Caused by release of histamine,First affects capillaries and followed by opening of aerioles,"Vasodilation leads to extravasation of fluid from microvasculature, leading to edema",Vasodilation occurs notably due to the action of histamine on vascular smooth muscle,"Transient vasoconstriction of aerioles at the site of injury is the earliest vascular response in acute inflammation. This process is mediated by both neurogenic and chemical mediator systems and usually resolves within seconds to minutes. Followed by, Vasodilation first involves the aerioles and then leads to the opening of new capillary beds in the area. There is increased permeability of the microvasculature, with the outpouring of protein-rich fluid into the extravascular tissues. Engorgement of small vessels with slowly moving red cells, results in stasis. Vasodilation is induced by the action of several mediators, notably histamine, on vascular smooth muscle.

"In treatment of osteosarcoma, all of the following are used EXCEPT:",High dose methotrexate,Cyclophosphamide,Vincristine,Doxorubicin,"Methotrexate (Mtx): It is one of the oldest and highly efficacious antineoplastic drugs; inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFRase)-blocking the conversion of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) to tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) which is an essential coenzyme required for one carbon transfer reactions in de novo purine synthesis and amino acid interconversions. The inhibition is pseudoirreversible because Mtx has 50,000 times higher affinity for the enzyme than the normal substrate. Methotrexate is apparently curative in choriocarcinoma: 15-30 mg/ day for 5 days orally or 2G-40 mg/m2 BSA i.m. or i.v. twice weekly. It is highly effective in maintaining remission in children with acute leukaemias, but not good for inducing remission: 2.5-15 mg/day. It is also useful in other malignancies, rheumatoid ahritis, psoriasis and as immunosuppressant.The use of folinic acid rescue has permitted much higher doses of Mtx and has enlarged its scope to many difficult-to-treat neoplasms.

Therapeutic index of a drug signifies: September 2005,Dose which produces maximum effect,Safety margin,Efficacy,Maximum response that can be elicited by a drug,"Ans. B: Safety Margin The therapeutic index/therapeutic ratio is a comparison of the amount of a therapeutic agent that causes the therapeutic effect to the amount that causes death. It signifies safety margin. Quantitatively, it is the ratio given by the lethal dose divided by the therapeutic dose. A therapeutic index is the lethal dose of a drug for 50% of the population (LD50) divided by the minimum effective dose for 50% of the population (ED50). A high therapeutic index is preferable to a low one: this corresponds to a situation in which one would have to take a much higher dose of a drug to reach the lethal threshold than the dose taken to elicit the therapeutic effect Generally, a drug or other therapeutic agent with a narrow therapeutic range (i.e. with little difference between lethal and therapeutic doses) may have its dosage adjusted according to measurements of the actual blood levels achieved in the person taking it.",B

Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of: September 2009,Hereditary spherocytosis,Sickle cell anemia,Thalassemia,Iron deficiency anemia,"Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosis The normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility. Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq/L). Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",A

Which of the following factor is essential for tumor metastasis?,Angiogenesis,Tumorigenesis,Apoptosis,Inhibition of Tyrosine kinase activity,"A critical element in the growth of primary tumors and formation of metastatic sites is the angiogenic switch: the ability of the tumor to promote the formation of new capillaries from preexisting host vessels. Stimuli for tumor angiogenesis include hypoxemia, inflammation, and genetic lesions in oncogenes or tumor suppressors that alter tumor cell gene expression. Angiogenesis consists of several steps, including the stimulation of endothelial cells (ECs) by growth factors, the degradation of the ECM by proteases, proliferation of ECs and migration into the tumor, and the eventual formation of new capillary tubes.

Which of the following conditions is most likely to be present?",Uteroplacental insufficiency,Congenital Treponema pallidum infection,Galactosemia,Preeclampsia,"The findings are typical for fetal growth restriction in later term, owing to relative sparing of the fetal brain. The findings suggest uteroplacental insufficiency from an intrinsic placental abnormality. One cause is a cytogenetic abnormality in the developing embryo that occurs just in the trophoblast, and only placenta is affected. Congenital syphilis occurs in the third trimester, when spirochetes can cross the placenta; there is typically placental and fetal hydrops. Inborn errors of metabolism such as galactosemia usually manifest after birth because maternal metabolism clears any intermediate products of fetal enzyme deficiencies. Preeclampsia is marked by maternal hypertension. An Rh incompatibility leads to fetal and placental hydrops. Trisomy 21 is more frequent with advancing maternal age, but in this case no fetal anomalies were noted.",A

If both parents are sickle cell anemia patients then the likelyhood of off springs having the disease is,10%,25%,50%,100%,"Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is a group of blood disorders typically inherited from a person's parents. The most common type is known as sickle-cell anaemia (SCA). It results in an abnormality in the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin (hemoglobin S) found in red blood cells. This leads to a rigid, sickle-like shape under ceain circumstances. Problems in sickle cell disease typically begin around 5 to 6 months of age. A number of health problems may develop, such as attacks of pain (""sickle-cell crisis""), anemia, swelling in the hands and feet, bacterial infections, and stroke. Long term pain may develop as people get older. The average life expectancy in the developed world is 40 to 60 years. Sickle-cell disease occurs when a person inherits two abnormal copies of the haemoglobin gene, one from each parent. This gene occurs in chromosome 11. Several subtypes exist, depending on the exact mutation in each haemoglobin gene.] An attack can be set off by temperature changes, stress, dehydration, and high altitude. A person with a single abnormal copy does not usually have symptoms and is said to have sickle-cell trait. Such people are also referred to as carriers. Diagnosis is by a blood test and some countries test all babies at bih for the disease. Diagnosis is also possible during pregnancy. Refer robbins 9/e p413",D

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome) is a life-threatening disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease usually follows recovery from an influenza-like upper respiratory tract infection and is characterized by a motor neuropathy that leads to an ascending paralysis that begins with weakness in the distal extremities and rapidly involves proximal muscles. Sensory changes are usually minimal. The disease is thought to result from immune-mediated segmental demyelination. In rare patients, instead of an acute course, Guillain-Barre syndrome takes a chronic course with remissions and relapses.

Immune complex Hypersensitivity reaction is- rpt,Type-I,Type-II,Type-III,Type-IV,"Robbins basic pathology 9th edition page no 115 Type 3 hypersensitivity includes immune complex diseases. Antigen antibody(immune) complexes that are formed in circulation may deposit in blood vessels leads to complement activation and acute inflammation. Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes that are formed in the circulation may deposit in blood vessels, leading to complement activation and acute inflammation. The antigens in these com- plexes may be exogenous antigens, such as microbial pro- teins, or endogenous antigens, such as nucleoproteins. The mere formation of immune complexes does not equate with hypersensitivity disease; small amounts of antigen- antibody complexes may be produced during normal immune responses and are usually phagocytosed and destroyed. It is only when these complexes are produced in large amounts, persist, and are deposited in tissues that they are pathogenic. Pathogenic immune complexes may form in the circulation and subsequently deposit in blood vessels, or the complexes may form at sites where antigen has been planted (in situ immune complexes). Immune complex-mediated injury is systemic when complexes are formed in the circulation and are deposited in several organs, or it may be localized to paicular organs (e.g., kidneys, joints, or skin) if the complexes are formed and deposited in a specific site. The mechanism of tissue injury is the same regardless of the pattern of distribution; however, the sequence of events and the conditions leading to the formation of systemic and local immune complexes are different and are considered separately in the following descriptions.

"True about telomeres:
(A) Made up of repeated sequence of TTAGGG
(B) Telomerase shortens it
(C) it is shortened in cancer cells,
(D) It is responsible for cell ageing",AD,AB,BC,CA,"""At birth, human telomeres are 15- to 20-kb pairs long and are composed of tandem repeats of a sixnucleotide
sequence (TTAGGG) that associates with specialized telomere-binding proteins to form a Tloop
structure that protects the ends of chromosomes from being mistakenly recognized as damaged. The
loss of telomeric repeats with each cell division cycle causes gradual telomere shortening, leading to
growth arrest (called senescence) when one or more critically short telomeres trigger a p53-regulated
DNA-damage checkpoint response""- 

How dividing cells can count their divisions is under intensive investigation. One likely mechanism is
that with each cell division, there is incomplete replication of chromosome ends (telomere shortening),
which ultimately results in cell cycle arrest. Telomeres are short repeated sequences of DNA (TTAGGG) present at the linear ends of chromosomes that are important for ensuring the complete replication of chromosome ends and protecting chromosomal termini from fusion and degradation.
When soma tic cells replicate, a small section ofthe telomere is not duplicated, and telomeres become progressively shortened.
As the telomeres become shorter, the ends of chromosomes cannot be protected and are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The lengths of the telomeres are normally maintained by nucleotide addition mediated by an enzyme called telomerase. 
Telomerase is a specialized RNA-protein complex that uses its own RNA as a template for adding nucleotides to the ends of
chromosomes The activity of telomerase is repressed by regulatory proteins, which restrict telomere elongation, thus providing a length sensing mechanism. Telomerase activity is expressed in germ cells and is present at low levels in stem cells, but it is usually absent in most somatic tissues. Therefore, as cells age, their telomeres become shorter, and they exit the cell cycle, resulting in an inability to generate new cells to replace damaged ones. Conversely, in immortal cancer cells, telomerase is reactivated, and telomeres are not shortened, 
suggesting that telomere elongation might be an important—possibly essential—step in tumor formation.
Despite such alluring observations, however, the relationship of telomerase activity and telomeric length
to aging and cancer still needs to be fully established
Germ cells and stem cells both contain active telomerase, but only the germ cells have sufficient levels of the enzyme to stabilize telomere length completely. Telomerase activation in cancer cells inactivates
the teleomericclock that limits the proliferative capacity of normal somatic cells.",A

"A deficiency of which one of the listed enzymes is most likely to be associated with the formation of multiple pale yellow, hard, round stones within the gallbladder?",1-a-hydroxylase,7-a-hydroxylase,11-hydroxylase,17-hydroxylase,"Gallstones, which affect 10 to 20% of the adult population in developed countries, are divided into two main types. Cholesterol stones are pale yellow, hard, round, radiographically translucent stones that are most often multiple. Their formation is related to multiple factors including female sex hormones (such as with oral contraceptives), obesity, rapid weight reduction, and hyperlipidemic states. Their prevalence approaches 75% in some Native American populations. 7-a-hydroxylase is an enzyme involved in conveing cholesterol to bile acids. Decreased functioning of this enzyme, such as with a congenital deficiency or inhibition by clofibrate, causes excess secretion of cholesterol and an increased incidence of cholesterol gallstones. The other main type of gallstones are pigment stones, which are brown or black in color and composed of bilirubin calcium salts. They are found more commonly in Asian populations and are related to chronic hemolytic states, diseases of the small intestines, and bacterial infections of the biliary tree. In contrast to 7-a-hydroxylase and bile acid synthesis, 1-a-hydroxylase is involved in vitamin D synthesis, while 11-hydroxylase, 17-hydroxylase, and 21- hydroxylase are all enzymes found in the adrenal coex.

ENaC is inhibited by normally functioning CFTR; hence, in cystic fibrosis, ENaC activity increases, markedly augmenting sodium uptake across the apical membrane (especially in respiratory and gastrointestinal system).Normal CFTR gene productDef ective (mutated) CFTR gene product in cystic fibrosis||1.

Augmented sodium uptake across apical membrane Clinical features of CFo Functions of CFTR are tissue specific, i.e. its functions signify whether the epithelium is secretory (secrete Cl"" into lumen) or absorptive (reabsorb Cl- from lumen),o Therefore clinical features are tissue specific:1. Respiratory tracto Respiratory epithelium is secretory, i.e. there is active secretion of Cl-,o CFTR mutation in cystic fibrosis results in loss or reduction of chloride secretion in lumen.o Active luminal sodium absorption is also increased (due to loss of inhibition of ENaC activity)o Both these decreased Cl- secretion and increased Na+ absorption from lumen) lead to increased passive water reabsorption (As you all know diffusion of water occurs from high osmolar to low osmolar concentration area),o This results in accumulation of dehydraded hyperconcentrated viscid secretion in respiratory lumen and defective mucociliary clearance - obstruction and recurrent respiratory tract infection; and bronchiectasis.2. Intestineo Similar to respiratory epithelium, intestinal epithelium is secretory and in CF there is defective Cl- secretion and enhanced Na+ absorption from lumen - Increased passive reabsorption of water from lumen,o This results in accumulation of dehydrated desciated intraluminal contents - obstruction of small and large intestine.3. Pancreaso The absence of CFTR Cl- channel in the apical membrane of pancreatic ductal epithelium limits the function of an apical membrane Cl- -HCHO3 exchanger to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ (by a passive process) into the duct.o The failure to secrete bicarbonate and Na+ leads to retention of enzyme in the pancreas and ultimately destruction of all pancreatic tissues due to pancreatitis.4. Hepatobiliary systemo Similar to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, defective biliar Cl- and water secretion causes thickened biliary secretions - biliary cirrhosis, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis.5. Sweat glandso In contrast to respiratory and intestinal epithelium, sweat gland duct epithelium is absorptive, i.e. function of normal CFTR in the sweat gland ducts is to reabsorb Cl- ions and Na+ from lumen,o Therefore, in the sweat ducts, loss of CFTR function leads to decreased reabsorption of NaCl - Hypertonic sweat with increased Na+ and Cl- in sweat.",B

Dietary sources are-liver, meat, egg, soybean, vegetables and whole grain . Absorption and fate: All three forms of the vitamin are well absorbed from the intestine. They are oxidized in the body and excreted as pyridoxic acid. little is stored. Physiological role and actions: Pyridoxine and pyridoxamine are readily oxidized to pyridoxal, which is then phosphorylated to pyridoxal phosphate. Isoniazid reacts with pyridoxal to form a hydrazone, and thus inhibits generation of pyridoxal phosphate. Isoniazid also combines with pyridoxal phosphate to interfere with its coenzyme function. Due to formation of hydrazones, the renal excretion of pyridoxine compounds is increased. Thus, isoniazid therapy produces a pyridoxine deficiency state.",A

Reduced membrane stability leads to spontaneous loss of membrane fragments during exposure to shear stresses in the circulation. The loss of membrane relative to cytoplasm forces the cells to assume the smallest possible diameter for a given volume --> Cells become microspherocytes. Because of their spheroidal shape and reduced membrane plasticity, red cells become less deformable and are trapped in to spleen as they are unable to pass through the interendothelial fenestrations of the venous sinusoids.

FK-506 is a,>It is a macrolide antibiotic,>Immunoglobulin antibody,>Non depolarising muscle relaxant,>Opioid analgesic,"It is a macrolide antibiotic FK-506 is commonly known as Tacrolimus. Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic produced by streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus acts as imnmunosuppressant by acting against calcineurin. The other calcineurin inhibitor is cyclosporine. Calcineurin inhibitors Calcineurin inhibitors are perhaps the most effective immuno-suppressive drugs in routine use. Role of calcineurin Calcineurin acts as a intracellular signal transductor. Once the T cell receptors are activated, signals are sent to the nucleus through the calcineurin, for the transcription of cytokine genes. This leads to production of IL-2 along with other interleukins. Interleukin-2 and other cytokines leads to the proliferation of cellular and humoral immunity. Calcineurin inhibitors, inhibitins the calcineurin. Mechanism of action of cyclosporin Cyclosporin enters the target cells and binds to a cytoplasmic protein called cyclophilin --> the complex then binds to and inactivates calcineurin -- decreased production of IL-2 --)decreased immune response. Tacrolimus The mechanism of action is almost similar to cyclosporine. The slight difference is that it binds to different cycoplasnzic protein which is FKBP, but the subsequent steps are same i.e. inhibition of calcineurin --4 decreased production of IL-2 -1 decreased immune response. More on Tacrolimus It is 10 times more potent than cyclosporine. Because of more potent action it is also suitable for suppressing acute rejection that has set in. It is paiculary valuable in liver transplantation because its absorption is not dependent on bile. It has the same toxicity profile as cyclosporine.",A

A diabetic patient develops cellulitis due to staphy-lococcus aureus that was found to be methicillin resistant on the antibiotic sensitivity testing.All of the following antibiotics will be appropriate EXCEPT:,Vancomycin,Imipenem,Teicoplanin,Linezolid,"lmipenem: It is an extremely potent and broad-spectrum Beta-lactam antibiotic whose range of activity includes grampositive cocci, Enterobacteriaceae, Ps. aeruginosa, Listeria as well as anaerobes like Bact. fragilis and Cl. difficile. It is resistant to most Beta-lactamases; inhibits penicillinase producing staphylococci and some MRSA. A limiting feature of imipenem is its rapid hydrolysis by the enzyme dehydropeptidase I located on the brush border of renal tubular cells. An innovative solution to this problem is its combination with cilastatin, a reversible inhibitor of dehydropeptidase I, which has matched pharmacokinetics with imipenem (Half life of both is 1 hr) and protects it.Imipenem has propensity to induce seizures at higher doses and in predisposed patients. Diarrhoea, vomiting and skin rashes are the other side effects. Vancomycin: It is a glycopeptide antibiotic discovered in 1956 as a penicillin substitute which has assumed special significance due to efficacy against MRSA Strep. viridans, Enterococcus and Cl. difficile. It is bactericidal to gram-positive cocci, Neisseria, Clostridia and diphtheroids. However, in hospitals where it has been extensively used for surgical prophylaxis, etc., vancomycin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) have emerged. These nosocomial bacteria are resistant to methicillin and most other antibiotics as well. Linezolid: This is the first member of a new class of svnthetic AMAs &;Oxazolidinones&; which has become available for the treatment of resistant Gram positive coccal (aerobic and anaerobic) and bacillary infections. It is active against MRSA and some VRSA, VRE, penicillin-resistant Strep. pyogenes, Strep. viridans and Strep. pneumoniae, M.tuberculosis, Corynebacterium, Listeria, Clostridia and Bact. Fragilis. It is primarily bacteriostatic,but can exe cidal action against some streptococci, pneumococci and B. fragilis. Gram negative bacteria are not affected. Teicoplanin: It is a newer glycopeptide antibiotic which in fact is a mixture of 6 similar compounds. It is active against gram-positive bacteria only; mechanism of action and spectrum of activity is similar to vancomycin. Notable features are: * It is more active than vancomycin against enterococci, and equally active against MRSA. * Some VRE but not VRSA are susceptible to teicoplanin. * It can be injected i.m. as well; is excreted by kidney; dose needs to be reduced in renal insufficiency; has a very long tth (3--4 days). * Toxicity is less than vancomycin; adverse effects are rashes, fever, granulocytopenia and rarely hearing loss.

Neoadjuvant therapy aims to reduce the size or extent of the cancer before using radical treatment intervention, thus making procedures easier and more likely to succeed, and reducing the consequences of a more extensive treatment technique that would be required if the tumor wasn't reduced in size or extent.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Ca EsophagusCombination chemotherapy is preferred over single agent due to better response ratesSINGLE-AGENT CHEMOTHERAPY - ObsoleteBleomycin,5-fluorouracil (5-FU)Cisplatin. andMitomycinCarboplatinTaxanes and Other New AgentsOxaliplatinCapecitabineVindesine and vinorelbinePaclitaxelDocetaxelEtoposideCOMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPYCisplatin and 5-FU - Most widely usedEpirubicin/Cisplatin/5-FUPaclita.xel/Cisplatin/5-FUDocetaxel/Cisplatin/5-FUIrinotecan Plus 5-FUOxaliplatin/Capecitabine vs. Cisplatin/5-FUNON-CISPLATIN/5-FU-BASED REGIMENSBleomycin & doxorubicinTaxanes and irinotecan.Docetaxel & irinotecanDocetaxel and vinorelbineIrinotecan & mitomycin",A
Phagocytic cells in brain -,Oligodendrocytes,Macrophages,Microglia,Astrocytes,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., MicrogliaMicroglia are the major phagocytic cells in the brain.Phagocvtosis Phagocytosis and release of enzymes by neutrophils and macrophages are responsible for eliminating injurious agents.o Phagocytosis involves the following three steps.1. Recognition and attachmentPhagocytosis of microbes and dead cells is initiated by recognition of paicles by receptors expressed on leukocyte surface.These receptors are Mannose receptors and scavenger receptors.These receptors bind a variety of microbes.2. EnglulfmentBinding of a paicle to phagocytic leukocyte receptors initiates the process of active phagocytosis of the paicles.During engulment, extension of the cytoplasm, i.e., pseudopods flow around the paicle to be engulfed. Eventually, this results in complete enclosure of the paicle within a phagosome created by the plasma membrane.Membrane of this phagocytic vacuole (Phagosome) fuses with the membrane of lysosome to form phagolysosome resulting in discharge of lysosomal granule's content into phagosome.During this process neutrophils and macrophages become progressively degranulated.Phagocytosis is dependent on polymerization of actin (similar to chemotoxis that is also dependent on polymerisation of actin).3. Killing and degradationKillingMicrobial killing is accomplished largely by oxygen-depending mechanism, i.e., due to generation of reactive oxygen species.The generation of reactive oxygen species is due to rapid activation on an oxidase - NADPH oxidase. Reactive oxygen species cause membrane damage, cytoskeletal damage and DNA damage.Bacterial killing can also occur by oxygen-independent mechanisms, through action of substances in leukocyte granules -3 Bacterial permeability increasign protein (BPI), lysozyme, lactoferrin, major basic protein and defensin.DegradationAfter killing, acid hydrolases, which are normally stored in lysosomes, degrade the microbes within phagolysosome.",C
Best time to give Rh anti-D prophylaxis is:,12 weeks of pregnancy,28 weeks of pregnancy,36 weeks of pregnancy,After delivery,"Ans. (B) 28 weeks of pregnancy(Ref: Williams Obstetrics 24th/e p312)Anti-D immune globulin is given prophylactically to all Rh D-negative, unsensitized women at approximately 28 weeks, and a second dose is given after delivery if the infant is Rh D-positive Following delivery, anti-D immune globulin should be given within 72 hours.If immune globulin is inadvertently not administered following delivery, it should be given as soon as the omission is recognized, because there may be some protection up to 28 days postpartum.Anti-D immune globulin is also administered after pregnancy-related events that could result in fetomaternal hemorrhage.",B

"For therapeutic effect in manic depressive illness, steady-state serum lithium concentration should be maintained between",0.2-0.4 mEq/L,0.5-0.8 mEq/L,1.0-1.3 mEq/L,1.5-2.5 mEq/L,"The margin of safety is narrow for lithium. monitoring of serum lithium concentration is essential for optimising therapy. Serum lithium level is measured 12 hours after the last dose to reflect the steady-state concentration; 0.5-0.8 mEq/L is considered optimum for main- tenance therapy in bipolar disorder, while 0.8-1.1 mEq/L is required for episodes of acute mania. Toxicity symptoms occur frequently when serum levels exceed 1.5 mEq/L. Ref:- kd tripathi;pg num:-449",B
Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction differs from type 2 hypersensitivity reaction being?,Type 1 reaction is Ig E mediated,Type 1 reaction is compliment mediated,Type 1 reaction is involves opsonization,All of the above,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Type 1 reaction is IgE mediated * Currently the most commonly used classification system of hypersensitivity is that of Gell and Coombs classification that divides the hypersensitivity into the following 4 types -1. Type I reactions (immediate hypersensitivity) - Involve immunoglobulin 'E' (IgE) mediated release of Histamine and other mediators from mast cells and basophils.2. Type II reactions (Antibody mediated) - Involve immunoglobulin G or Immunoglobulin M bound to cell surface antigen, with subsequent complement fixation.3. Type III reactions (Immune complex mediated) - involve circulating antigen-antibody complexes that deposit in postcapillary venules, with subsequent complement fixation.4. Type IV reactions (delayed hypersensitity, cell mediated) - Mediated by T cells.",A
