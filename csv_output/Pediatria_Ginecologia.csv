Drug of choice in chronically hypeensive pregnant women requiring long term antihypeensive therapy: September 2007,Nifedipine,Metaprolol,Methyldopa,Hydralazine,"Ans. C: Methyldopa Methyldopa is a drug of first choice for control of mild to moderate hypeension in pregnancy and is the most widely prescribed antihypeensive for this indication. During long term use in pregnancy, methyldopa does not alter maternal cardiac output or blood flow to the uterus or kidneys, and for all these reasons it is generally considered the agent of choice for chronic blood pressure control in pregnancy. Because the safety record of labetalol in pregnancy is not as well established as that of methyldopa, labetalol should probably be considered a second-line agent for pregnant women with chronic hypeension requiring long term drug therapy",C

A 40 weeks pregnant developed postpaum hemorrhage due to uterine atony. Which of the following drug can be given to this patient to stop the bleeding?,Oxytocin,Methergine,Progesterone,Prostaglandins,"Ergot alkaloids markedly increase the motor activity of the uterus. Although their capacity to induce sustained uterine tetany precludes their use in the induction or facilitation of labor, they are used to prevent or treat postpaum hemorrhage in normotensive women. In this setting, the preferred ergot alkaloids are ergonovine or its methyl analog methylergonovine (methergine). They are administered intramuscularly or intravenously, exhibit rapid onsets of action, and their effects persist for 45 minutes to 3 hours depending on the route of administration.

Kwashiorkor is diagnosed in growth-retarded children along with –,Edema and mental changes,Hypopigmentation and anemia,Edema and hypopigmentation,hepatomegaly and anemia,"Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a spectrum of conditions ranging from mild undernutrition of extreme forms of malnutrition, i.e. Marasmus and Kwashiorkor.
Most of the child suffer from mild to moderate nutritional deficit and extreme forms (marasmus and kwashiorkor) account only for a small proportion of cases of malnutrition.

Mild to moderate malnutrition

If the dietary intake is deficient for a short period, the body adapts its metabolism to compensate for the deficit to some extent.
 Moderately malnourished children appear slower and less energetic.
Growth lag is more pronounced in weight than the length.
Head circumference is not reduced significantly.

Marasmus

Marasmus is characterized by gross wasting of muscles and subcutaneous tissues resulting in emaciation, marked stunting and no oedema.

"A 2-month-old boy is evaluated for failure to thrive. As the pediatrician examined the child, she witnesses a seizure. Physical examination is remarkable for hepatomegaly, a finding later confirmed by CT scan, which also reveals renomegaly. Serum chemistries demonstrate severe hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and ketosis. Which of the following diseases best accounts for this presentation?",Gaucher's disease,McArdle's disease,Niemann-Pick disease,Von Gierke's disease,"Von Gierke's disease is a glycogen storage disease caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. It typically presents with neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and ketosis. Failure to thrive is common in early life; convulsions may occur due to profound hypoglycemia. The glycogen accumulation in von Gierke's disease occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys, accounting for the enlargement of these organs. Gout may develop later because of the derangement of glucose metabolism. Even if you do not remember all of the details of the presentation of these genetic diseases, you should be able to narrow the choices: Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease are lipid storage diseases, and would not be expected to produce hypoglycemia. The other diseases are glycogen storage diseases, but McArdle's and Pompe's disease affect muscle rather than liver and would not be expected to produce profound hypoglycemia, since the liver is the major source for blood glucose.",D

"In early pregnancy, doubling time of beta HCG is-",24 hours,48 hours,96 hours,2 weeks,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 48 hours * Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): Glycoprotein, with biological activity very similar to luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which act via the plasma membrane LH-hCG receptor. It is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts.* This hormone is structurally related to three other glycoprotein hormones: LH, FSH, and TSH. The amino acid sequence of the a- subunits of all four glycoproteins is identical.* hCG is detectable in plasma of pregnant women as early as day 22 of menstrual cycle by RRA (radioreceptor assay) or day 25th of menstrual cycle by RIA (radioimmunoassay).* hCG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Blood levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at about 8-10 weeks of gestation.* From 10 to 12 weeks the level begins to decline to reach the nadir at 20 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the rest of pregnancy.* It completely disappears from circulation 2 weeks postpartum.* The best-known biological function of the hCG is the rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum, that is, continued progesterone production.",B

A 3 year old Child who has diurnal enuresis and soiling of clothes. Treatment required,Urethroplasty,Behaviour modification,Put catheter for 7 days,Circumcision at 10 years,"• In children with overactive bladder, urge incontinence, and dysfunctional voiding,
voiding at predetermined times aids in retraining the child to exercise voluntary bladder control.
• Behavioral modification has remained the mainstay of treatment for daytime wetting.
These measures focus on relearning and training the normal responses from the bladder and urethra.
• Bladder irritants such as caffeine should be eliminated from the diet.
• The child voids on waking, and subsequently at least every 2 h, during waking hours. As urgency improves, the interval between voids can be extended.
In children with infrequent voiding, in whom an elevated PVR volume is encountered, double voiding will both increase functional bladder capacity and decrease the risk of infection.",B

It is common in both the young and the elderly. ASD is found in approximately 6% of children with congenital hea disease who survive beyond the first year of life. After bicuspid aoic valve, it is the most common form of congenital hea disease among adults. ASDs have a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1. The mode of transmission is best explained in most instances on a multifactorial basis, in which the risk would be approximately 2.5% for first-degree relatives of a single affected family member In a child with Large ASD the filling of the two ventricles remains constant throughout the respiration cycle.

a) Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow at tricuspid right ventricular or pulmonary valve level.
b) A pathway by which systemic venous blood enters the systemic circulation via a patent foramen ovale or ASD or VSD.

The degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of obstruction to pulmonary blood flow : -


Mild obstruction → Cyanosis is precipitaed by stress, but may be absent at rest.
Severe obstruction → Pulmonary blood flow is dependent on patency of the ductus arteriosus. When the ductus closes (10-21 days), the neonate experience profound hypoxemia, cyanosis and shock.

2) Cyanotic CBD with increased pulmonary blood flow.

This group of lesions is not associated with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow.
Cyanosis caused by any of the following mechanisms.



Abnormal ventricular-arterial connection (e.g., Transposition of great vessels) → In this, aorta arises from rt ventricle, So that systemic venous blood returning to the right atrium is pumped directly back to the body, and oxygenated blood returning from lung is pumped back into the lungs.
Total mixing of systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood (e.g., total anomalous pulmonary venous return, truncus arteriosus, a common atrium or ventricle) → Deoxygenated systemic venous blood and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood mix completely in the heart and, as a result, oxygen saturation is equal in the pulmonary artery and aorta. lf pulmonary blood flow is not obstructed, these infants have a combination of Cyanosis and heart failure. In Contrast, if pulmonary stenosis is present, these infants have cyanosis alone.",C

Placenta previa true are:,Incidence increases by two fold after LSCS,More common in primipara,Most common in developed countries,1 per 1000 pregnancies,"Chances of placenta previa are increased in case of history of prior cesarean section—
“The probability of placenta previa is four times greater in patients with prior cesareans than in patients without uterine scars.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 333, 334
Therefore, option a is correct (partly though) because the option says two-fold increase
As far as - other options are concerned:
Option ‘b’ i.e. it is more common in primipara is absolutely wrong as - placenta previa is more common in multipara.
Option ‘c’ It is more common in developed countries.
Now that is incorrect because -
“Increased family planning acceptance with limitation and spacing of birth, lowers the incidence of placenta previa.”
Dutta obs 6/e, p 243
Which clearly means it is less common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Option ‘d’ - Incidence is 1 per 1000 pregnancies:
According to Dutta Obs 6/e, p 243
“Incidence of placenta previa ranges from 0.5 to 1% among hospital deliveries.”
“According to 2003 birth certificate data in the US, placenta previa complicated almost 1 in 300 deliveries”
Williams Obs 23/e, p 770

A primigravida at 37 week of gestation reported to labour room with central placenta previa with heavy bleeding per vaginum. The fetal heart rate was normal at the time of examination. The best management option of her is:,Expectant management,Cesarean section,Induction and vaginal delivery,Induction and forceps delivery,"The patient in the question:

Has gestational age = 37 weeks i.e. fetus has attained maturity so immediate termination of pregnancy is recommended.
Has central placenta previa Type IV i.e. vaginal delivery is contraindicated, cesarean section has to be done.
Patient is having heavy bleeding.

“In patients with heavy bleeding an efficient management plan including life support measures and immediate operative intervention is the only way to avoid a maternal death.”
It further says – on p 339
“Patients with placenta previa and severe bleeding should be delivered by cesarean section irrespective of the type of placenta previa.”
So, from the above discussion, it is very much clear that in this patient, immediate cesarean section is the best resort.

The ductus venosus is a branch of the umbilical vein (not umbilical aery). The single umbilical vein enters the fetus and divides ductus venosus and poal sinus. The ductus venosus is the main branch of the vein which traverses the liver and enters the IVC directly. The IVC also receives less oxygenated blood from lower body and thus the oxygen content of the blood delivered to the hea from IVC is less than that leaving the placenta through the umbilical vein.

The primary defect which leads to sickle cell anemia is –,An abnormality in porphyrin part of hemoglobin,Replacement of glutamate by valine in β–chain of HbA,A nonsence mutation in the β chain of HbA,Substitution of valine by glutamate in the a–chain of HbA,"Sickle cell anemia                                                             

Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, i.e. the type of disease characterized by the production of defective hemoglobin.

Normal hemoglobin

The hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein.
Each subunit is composed of a protein part, i.e, globin and a nonprotein part, i.e. heme, i.e. Each hemoglobin molecule contain four heme units and two pairs of a similar protein, globin.
The heme part of the globular protein is same in all types of hemoglobin.
The protein part vary in different hemoglobin -


Adult hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A) consists of two identical α-chains and two identical δ-chains.
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical γ chains.
Minor hemoglobin (HbA,) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical δ chains.


Normally adult blood contains about 96% of HbA (α2 β2) 3-3.5% HbA2(α2 δ2), and small amount of fetal hemoglobin HbF (α2 γ2).

Defect in sickle cell anemia 

Sickle cell anemia results from a mutation in β-globin gene.
It is caused by a point mutation at the sixth position of the β-globin chain leading to a substation of a valine residue for a glutamic acid residue. resulting in sickle hemoglobin (HbS).
Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder.
If an individual is homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS.
In heterozygotes, only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, the remainder being normal hemoglobins.",B

"In long protocol IVF, GnRH agonist is staed on",Day 1 of previous cycle,Day 21 of previous cycle,Day 1 of IVF cycle,Day 21 of IVF cycle,"Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist ProtocolsIn the long protocol, a GnRH agonist is staed in the luteal phase (day 21) of the previous cycle. This diminishes the GnRH agonists flare effect and suppresses endogenous FSH and dominant follicle selection to promote synchronous follicular growth. After 10 to 14 days of GnRH agonist administration, a pelvic ultrasound and estradiol level are used to confirm suppression and gonadotropin stimulation begins. The GnRH agonist is continued (the dose may be halved or unchanged) throughout the cycle until the hCG trigger.The long protocol provides for better oocyte yields and pregnancy rates in normal responders when compared with shoer protocols that use later administration or early cessation of agonists. GnRH microdose flare protocols have been developed that may improve oocyte yield in poor responders. Microdose flare regimens involve pretreatment with 14 to 21 days of combination oral contraceptives.Four days following the cessation of the oral contraceptive pills, a microdose (leuprolide 25 mg) of agonist is added in the early follicular phase to take advantage of the agonist flare effect. Gonadotropin stimulation is initiated 1 to 2 days later while continuing the agonist.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",B

The Anti D binds to antigen sites on the fetal red cells so that these cells do not mount an immune response, provided the baby is Rh negative and direct coombs test done on baby is negative. If mother's IUT is positive or fetus has positive direct coombs test, it means mother is already immunised. In such cases their is no point in giving anti D. Dose : * Ideally amount of Anti D should be calculated according to the volume of fetomaternal bleed by doing a Kleihauer test. Generally : - Gestational age < 12 weeks - dose is 5Oug - Beyond 12 weeks - dose is 300ug Antepaum prophylaxis : At 28 weeks gestation in a Rh negative patient : Indirect coombs test is done and if antibodies are not detected i.e. patient is unimmunized, Anti D 300ug is given as antepaum prophylaxis.

The advantages of hysterectomy in molar pregnancy are:,Chance of choriocarcinoma becomes nil,Follow up is not required,Enlarged ovaries can be removed during operation,Chance of pulmonary embolisation is minimal,"Hysterectomy when performed in molar pregnancy significantly decreases the chances of developing choriocarcinoma (by 5 fold times) but does not make it nil and hence follow up is required (so both options a and b are incorrect)

This is supported by following lines from Dutta-
“It should be remembered that following hysterectomy, persistent GTD is observed in 3–5% cases. As such, it does not eliminate the necessity of follow up.The enlarged ovaries (theca lutein cysts) found during operation should be left undisturbed as they will regress following removal of mole. But, if complication arises, like torsion, rupture or infarction, they should be removed.”
Dutta 7/e, p 195
Thus from above lines it is also clear that ovaries even if they are enlarged should not be removed during hysterectomy for h mole.
As far as pulmonary embolisation in concerned -acute pulmonary insufficiency due to pulmonary embolization of trophoblastic cells, is a complication seen with suction evaculation and not hysterectomy.",D

Gastroesophagial reflux disease (GERD) in infants o Gastroesophagial reflux refers to the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus or orpharynx. o GERD is one of the most frequent problems among infants. o Reflux in infants usually develops when they are between two to four weeks old. Within 6-9 months, the acid reflux stas subsiding and it resolves in most of the cases. Clinical features o Post-prandial regurgitation is the most common and probably the earliest syptom of GERD. However, the presence of postprandial regurgitation does not suggest pathological nature of reflux process as regurgitation is also seen in normal infants. (optiopn b is not correct) o Pathological reflux or GERD is said to be present when frequency and/or duration of reflux episodes results in troublesome symptoms and complications (esophagitis or pulmonary). Symptoms of GERD are failure to thrive, poor weight gain, feeding refusal, recurrent vomiting, generalized irritability, respiratory symptoms and arching/bradycardia. Treatment o Conservative measures may be adequate to treat uncomplicated, mild GERD in infants, however, when therapy is necessary for 2 weeks or longer, proton-pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice in children. Remember Most common and earliest symptom of GERD in infant --> Regurgitation. For diagnosing pathological GERD regurgitation alone is not enough as there is physiological reflux (regurgitation)in normal infants. Regurgitation plus one or more troublesome symptoms (Respiratory symptoms, failure to thrive, poor weight gain, etc) are required to indicate pathological GERD.",A

Another technique involves histological immunostaining to identify the p57KIP2 nuclear protein. Because the gene that expresses p57KIP2 is paternally imprinted, only maternally donated genes are expressed. Because complete moles contain only paternal genetic material, they cannot express this gene; do not produce p57KIP2; and thus, do not pick up this immunostain. In contrast, this nuclear protein is strongly expressed in paial moles and in non-molar pregnancies with hydropic change. As a result, the combined use of ploidy analysis and p57KIP2 immunostaining can be used to differentiate: (1) a complete mole (diploid/p57KIP2-negative), (2) a paial mole (triploid/p57KIP2-positive), and spontaneous aboion with hydropic placental degeneration (diploid/p57KIP2-positive).Reference: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition, chapter 20; Gestational trophoblastic diseases",C

For lactating mothers, contraceptive should be chosen in such a way that in addition to providing effective contraception, they do not adversely affect the success of lactation or the health of the infant. Barriers have a high failure rate of 4–14% and not reliable for long-term control.
As estrogens decrease the quality and quantity of milk, COC pills are absolutely contraindicated in lactating mothers.
Lactation Amenorrhea Method (LAM)
• Excessive secretion of prolactin, which controls lactation, inhibits the pituitary. Prolactin inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) but has no effect on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, it partially inhibits ovarian respons to both of these gonadotropins. As a result, while the prolactin level remains high, the ovary produces little estrogen and no progesterone. Hence, ovulation and menstruation are affected.
• LAM is effective only till 6 months postpartum. Beyond this, it is not a reliable method.
• Even for the 6 months, it is effective only if there is exclusive breastfeeding.
• It any time in the first 6 months the menses starts, then it cannot be used as birth control.

Prelabour pains are mediated through,Tit-T12,T2-L3,S1-S3,L3-L4,"T11-T12 Pain pathways during labour The pain of labour arises from - Contraction of myometrium, against the resistance of cervix and perineum - Progressive dilatation of the cervix and lower uterine segment - Stretching and compression of pelvic and perineal structures Pain during the, first stage of labour is mostly visceral pain resulting from uterine contractions and cervical dilatation. It is usually confined to the T11-T12 dermatomes during the latent phase but eventually involves the TIO-LI dermatomes as the labour enters the the active phase. The visceral afferent fibres responsible for labour pain travel with sympathetic nerve.fibres.first to the uterine and cervical plexes then through the hypogastric and aoic plexes before entering the spinal cord with the T10-L1 nerve roots. The onset of perineal pain at the end of fist stage signals the beginning of the fetal descent and the second stage of labour. Stretching and compression of pelvic and perineal structures intensify the pain. Sensory innervations of the perineum is provided by the pudendal nerve (S2-S4) so pain during the second stage of labour involves the T10-S4 dermatosomes.",A

If any cyst persists for longer than 2 months, the possibility of neoplastic cyst must be kept in mind and patient should be investigated. ""In premenopausal patient, a period of observation is reasonable, provided mass is not clinically suspicious (that is mobile, cystic, unilateral and of regular contour). Generally an interval of 2 months is allowed for observation. The size of the lesion is of impoance. If a complex cystic mass .> 8 -- 10 cm in diameter, the probability of lesion being neoplastic is high."" Patients whose lesions are suggestive of malignancy (i.e. predominatly solid, relatively fixed or irregularly shaped) should undergo laparotomy, as should postmenopausal patients with complex adnexal masses of any size. In postmenopausal women with unilocular cysts measuring 8 to 10 cms or less and having normal serial CA 125 levels, expectant management is acceptable.",D

"A patient presents with LVH. and pulmonary complications. ECG, shows left axis deviation. Most likely diagnosis is –",TOF,Tricuspid atresia,TAPVC,VSD,"Congenital absence of tricuspid valve is called tricuspid atresia.
Haemodynamics :

The inflow portion of R.V. is hypoplastic
The systemic venous blood coming to R.A. exits by way of a patent foramen ovale or an ASD.
A VSD provides communication between L.V. and outflow portion of R.V.
The L.V. thus maintains both the systemic and pulmonary circulation.
The saturation of blood in the pulmonary artery and aorta is identical —> Because unoxygenated blood from right atrium mixes with oxygenated blood into left atrium.
The pulmonary blood flow is dependent on size of VSD —› Smaller the VSD, less the pulmoanry blood flow. Clinical features :


Child is cyanotic from birth
Anoxic spells and squatting may be present.

The commonest cause of intestinal obstruction in children between 3 months to 6 years of age,Intussusception,Meckel's diverticulum,Intestinal polyp,Nonspecific cause,"Ans. a (Intussusception) (Ref. Nelson paediatrics, p. 1569)INTUSSUSCEPTION# Intussusception occurs when a portion of the alimentary tract is telescoped into an adjacent segment. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction between 3 mo and 5 yr of age.# Sixty percent of patients are younger than 1 yr, and 80% of the cases occur before 24 mo: it is rare in neonates.# The incidence varies from 1 to 4/1,000 live births.# The male:female ratio is 4:1. A few intussusceptions reduce spontaneously, but if left untreated, most will lead to intestinal infarction, perforation, peritonitis, and death.Etiology and Epidemiology# The cause of most intussusceptions is unknown.# The seasonal incidence has peaks in spring and autumn.# Correlation with prior or concurrent respiratory adenovirus (type C) infection has been noted, and the condition may complicate otitis media, gastroenteritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura.# The risk of intussusceptions in infants <1 yr of age after receiving a no longer available tetravalent rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine within 2 wk of immunization was increased.# Lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is another related risk factor. Prominent mounds of lymph tissue lead to mucosal prolapse of the ileum into the colon, thus causing an intussusception.# In 2-8% of patients, recognizable lead points for the intussusception are found, such as a Meckel diverticulum, intestinal polyp, neurofibroma, intestinal duplication, hemangioma, or malignant conditions such as lymphoma. Intussusception can complicate mucosal hemorrhage, as in Henoch-Schonlein purpura or hemophilia.# Cystic fibrosis is another risk factor.# Postoperative intussusception is ileoileal and usually occurs within 5 days of an abdominal operation.# Lead points are more common in children >2 yr of age.Pathology# Intussusceptions are most often ileocolic, less commonly cecocolic, and rarely exclusively ileal.Clinical manifestations# Spasmodic intermittent abdominal pain;# ""Red currant"" jelly stools# Palpable lump.# Dance sign, n ""Empty RIF"" signDiagnosis# Ultrasound is investigation of choice.# Ba enema is now 2nd line investigation# USG signs:- ""Doughnut or target"" appearance in transverse images.- ""Sandwich or hamburger"" sign in longitudinal images- Pseudokidney sign# Ba emema signs:- ""Claw""sign- ""Coiled-spring"" signRx# Hydrostatic reduction# Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radiation exposure than traditional contrast hydrostatic techniques.# The success rate of radiologic hydrostatic reduction under fluoroscopic or ultrasonic guidance is =50% if symptoms are present longer than 48 hr and 70-90% if reduction is done in the 1st 48 hr.# If manual operative reduction is impossible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusceptions is necessary with end-to-end anastomosis.# Corticosteroids may reduce the frequency of recurrent intussusception.",A

The cause of 'postpartum blues' is:,Decreased estrogen,Decreased progesterone,Increased prolactin,Decreased estrogen and progesterone,"Puerperal Blues/3 Days Blues/Baby Blues

It is transient state of mental illness observed 4–5 days after delivery in nearly 50% of postpartum women.
Postpartum blues occurs at the height of hormonal changes. 
Patients present with depression, anxiety, fearfulness, insomnia, helplessness and negative feelings towards infant.
It may last from a few days to 2–3 weeks.
Generally self limited, 20% of women may develop depression in the first postpartum year.

Treatment: Reassurance and psychological support of family members.
Post-partum Depression

It is observed in 10-20% of mothers.
It is more gradual in onset over the first 4-6 months following delivery or abortion.
Changes in hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis may be a cause.
Manifested by loss of energy and appetite, insomnia, social withdrawal, irritability and even suicidal attitude.
Risk of recurrence 50-100% in subsequent pregnancies.

Treatment: Should be started early. Fluoxetine or paroxetine is effective and has fewer side effects. According to kaplan, the cause of postpartum blues is :

Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is:,Barrier method,Combined OCP,Lactational amenorrhoea,Progesterone only pill,"lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone; while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below given table). Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2.0 0.5 IUD 0.8 0.6 POP 'mini pill' 8.0 0.5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0.1 Barrier method 14 3.0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast. feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho * Has no side effects period (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces GnRH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i.e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",C

Edema in nephrotic syndrome is due to,Sodium & water retention,Increased venous pressure,Hypoalbuminemia,Hyperlipidemia,"NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:- Characterised by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemua and edema, hyperlipidemia is often associated. Some patients show hematuria and hypeension. Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes. Immunofluorescence studies shows deposits of occassional mesangial IgM. Lab findings- urine examination shows heavy proteinuria. Hyaline and granular casts are present. Serum albumin is low. Hypercholesterolemia impa a milky appearance to plasma. Blood urea and creatinine values within normal range. Blood levels if IgG low and IgM elevated. Low serum calcium level.

Most sensitive indicator of intravascular volume depletion in infant aEUR',Stroke volume,Hea rate,Cardiac output,lood pressure,"Hea Rate ""A significant misconception is that shock occurs only with low B.P.(hypotension). Through various compensatory mechanisms hypotension is often a late .finding. Tachycardia, with or without tachyapnea may be the 1' or only sign of early compensated shock"". Shock is an acute dramatic syndrome characterized by inadequate circulatory supply of oxygen so that the metabolic demands of vital organs and tissues are not met. Shock has been categorized into series of recognizable stage: ? Compensated Uncompensated Irreversible An initial insult triggers shock, thus disrupting blood flow to end organs leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. The body's compensatory mechanism is initiated to maintain perfusion to vital organs. If treatment is not introduced during this period, decompensated shock develops causing tissue damage that leads to multisystem organ dysfunction and death. Compensatory shock In the early phases of shock, multiple compensatory physiologic mechanisms act to maintain blood pressure and preserve tissue perfusion. - Blood pressure remains normal, initially, because of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance. - Thus hypotension occurs late and is more a characteristic of uncompensated stage of shock. - Patients in compensated shock have relatively normal cardiac output and normal blood pressures but they have alteration in microcirculation that increase flow to some organs and reduce flow to other. - In infants compensatory increases in cardiac output are achieved primarily by ""tachycardia"" rather than by increase in stroke volume. - Hea rates of 190-210/min are common in infants with compensated shock. - On the other hand in older patients cardiac contractility (stroke volume) and (hea rate) increase to improve cardiac output.",B

Most effective & safe drug to control fits in eclampsia is:,Phenytoin,Magnesium sulphate,Diazepam,None,"Ans. b (Magnesium sulphate). (Ref Williams Obstetrics 22nd/ Ch. 34; Obstetrics by Dutta, 3rd/ 244)MAGNESIUM SULFATE# Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.# In more severe cases of preeclampsia, as well as eclampsia, magnesium sulfate administered parenterally is an effective anticonvulsant agent without producing central nervous system depression in either the mother or the infant.# It may be given: intravenously by continuous infusion or intramuscularly by intermittent injection.# The dosage schedule for severe preeclampsia is the same as for eclampsia.# Magnesium sulfate is not given to treat hypertension.# Magnesium most likely exerts a specific anticonvulsant action on the cerebral cortex.Regimens for the Administration of Magnesium Sulfate for Seizure Prophylaxis in Labor with Preeclampsia.IntramuscularIntravenous10 g (5 g IM deep in each buttock)6-g bolus over 15 min1-3 g/h by continuous infusion pump5 g IM deep q4h, alternating sidesMay be mixed in 100 mL crystalloid; if given by intravenous push, make up as 20% solution; push at maximum rate of 1 g/min 40-g MgSO4 in 1000 mL Ringer's lactate; run at 25-75 mL/h (1-3 g/h)# Typically, the mother stops convulsing after the initial administration of magnesium sulfate and, within an hour or two, regains consciousness sufficiently to be oriented as to place and time.# Maintenance magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia is continued for 24 hours after delivery.# For eclampsia that develops postpartum, magnesium sulfate is administered for 24 hours after the onset of convulsions.# Magnesium sulphate practically always arrests eclamptic convulsions and prevents their recurrence.# The initial intravenous infusion of 4 to 6 g is used to establish a prompt therapeutic level that is maintained by the nearly simultaneous intramuscular injection of 10 g of the compound, followed by 5 g intramuscularly every 4 hours, or by continuous infusion at 2 to 3 g per hour.# Parenterally administered magnesium is cleared almost totally by renal excretion, and magnesium intoxication is avoided by ensuring that:- urine output is adequate,- the patellar or biceps reflex is present, and- there is no respiratory depression. EffectPlasma magnesium levels1Eclamptic convulsions are almost always prevented by levels maintained at:4 to 7 mEq/L(4.8 to 8.4 mg/dL, or 2.0 to 3.5 mmol/L).2Patellar reflexes disappear at:10 mEq/L (about 12 mg/dL)3Respiratory depression develops at:>10 mEq/L4Respiratory paralysis and arrest follows at:>12 mEq/L",B

Best prognosis in infeile women is seen in / most reversible form of infeility is :,Tubal block,Anovulation,Oligospermia,Endometritis,"Ans. is b i.e. Anovulation ""Disorders of ovulation account for about 30 - 40 % of all cases of female infeility. These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and most treatable causes of infeility."" In couples with infeility ovulatory disorder have the best prognosis. Relatively poor prognosis is observed in male factor infeility and tuba! factor infeility. Prognosis can be arranged as below in descending order on the basis of cumulative pregnancy. Ovulatory factor > unexplained > Male factors > Endometriosis > Tubal factors. Treatment of anovulation is determined by the diagnosis : An elevated FSH along with chronic anovulation indicates ovarian resistance or failure : treatment is steroids / in vitro feilisation in such cases. If chronic anovulation is present along with normal FSH and prolactin : then induction of ovulation can be achieved in 90% of cases. - A treatment plan is done using clomiphene as the first drug : 1. Colmiphene citrate : it is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml.

All of the following are features of mullerian agenesis except :,46 XX karyotype,Normal breast development,Absent vagina,Ovarian agenesis,"Ans:D.)Ovarian agenesis Mullerian agenesis It is Mayer Rokitansky-Kuster Hauser syndrome. . Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Mullerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper poion. Mullerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because ovaries do not develop from the Mullerian ducts, affected women might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infeile due to the lack of a functional uterus. Signs and Symptoms: An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, the person will enter pubey with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and adrenarche (pubic hair). The person's chromosome constellation will be 46,XX. At least one ovary is intact, if not both, and ovulation usually occurs. Typically, the vagina is shoened and intercourse may, in some cases, be difficult and painful. Medical examination suppoed by gynecologic ultrasonography demonstrates a complete or paial absence of the cervix, uterus, and vagina.

Congenital factor X deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease. Homozygous patients shows markedly prolonged PT and APTT, and heterozygous individuals show mildly prolonged or normal PT and APTT. Since this child is presenting with bleeding from umbilical stump with normal PT and PTT, most likely diagnosis is Factor X deficiency. In Von Willibrand disease: PT is normal, PTT is increased. In factor XIII deficiency: PT and PTT are normal, minimally prolonged thrombin time, increased fibrin degradation products. Diagnosis is established by increased clot solubility in 5M urea, dilute monochloroactic acid or acetic acid. In Bernard soulier sydrome: abnormally large platelets, moderate thrombocytopenia and prolonged bleeding time.

Diabetes in pregnancy all except:,Glucose challenge test is done between 24-28 week,50 gm of sugar given as screening test,Insulin resistance improves with pregnancy,Diabetes control before conception is impoant to prevent malformation,"Insulin resistance improves with pregnancy Carbohydrate metabolism during pregnancy:- Insulin resistance increases as the pregnancy progresses Abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism occurs frequently during pregnancy and between 1% and 3% of all pregnant patients will show glucose intolerance. The most impoant reason that pregnancy uncovers the diabetic tendencies of asymptomatic women is the progressive increase in insulin resistance that occurs during gestation. Other reasons for the diabetogenic tendency of pregnancy are increased lipolysis and the alterations in gluconeogenesis that normally occur. During pregnancy a given dose of insulin has a greater hypoglycemic effect when administered in the first trimester than in the last. The insulin resistance occurs mainly because of the antagonistic effect of placental human chnriottic sonzatornammotropin. Insulin destruction by the kidney and placental insulinases as well as the antiinsulin effect of other hormones(coisol, estriol, progesterone) produced in large amounts during pregnancy also contributes to insulin resistance. Periconceptional counselling of the diabetic patient :? Inadequate blood sugar control often results in higher incidence of first trimester aboion, fetal congenital abnormalities, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios, and still bihs. But if the blood sugar is strictly controlled before conception and during the pregnancy the frequency of these abnormal outcomes approaches that of non diabetic population. It is impoant to emphasize that the time of highest risk of fetal malformations is during the periconceptional period and the period of organogenesis and that the risk can be greatly reduced by adequate glycemic control before pregnancy and during early pregnancy. Screening for diabetes during pregnancy :? The best screening test for gestational diabetes is the measurement of plasma glucose 1 hour after ingesting 50 g of glucose. The results are interpreted as:- Plasma glucose > 140 mg/c11 ---> the patient may have gestational diabetes and requires fuher testing Plasma glucose < 140 mg/d1 --> patient is not at risk Patients with abnormal screening test should be given a 3 hour glucose tolerance test. Glucose tolerance test. Normal values for 3 hour GTT are given below. If two or more of these values are abnormal, the patient has gestational diabetes. If only one value is abnormal, the patient cannot be diagnosed as having gestational diabetes. Upper limits of Normal for the 3 hour Glucose tolerance test during the pregnancy Fasting 96 mg/dl (5.3 nmol/L) One hour 172 mg/dL (9.6 nmol/L) Two hours 156 mg/dL (8.49 nmol/L) Three hour 131mg/dL (7.31 ninon) Timing of the screening The best time to screen is between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation.",C

38 weeks primi in early labour with transverse presentation. TOC is,Allow for cervical dilatation,Internal podalic version,LSCS,Forceps,"Ans. is c i.e. LSCS When a patient with transverse lie is seen in labour, it is managed as follows according to Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 397. Early labor ECV - provided there is good amount of liquor amnii and there is no contraindication. ECV should be tried in all cases. LSCS - is the preferred method of delivery if version fails or is contraindicated. ate labor Baby alive - If the baby is mature and fetal condition is good, it is preferable to do LSCS in all cases. Baby dead - LSCS even in such cases, is much safer in the hands of those who are not conversant with destructive operation. If the obstetrician is conversant with destructive operation, decapitation or evisceration is to be done. Following destructive operation, the uterine cavity is to be explored to exclude rupture of uterus. Internal version should not be done. According to Onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudnal lie by abdominal manipulation are likely to be unsuccessful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are woh trying in absence of other complications that indicate cesarean section. In the given question 38 weeks primi is presenting in Early labour so external cephalic version could have been tried. but it is not given in the option, so our answer is LSCS. Note : While doing LSCS--a transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficult fetal extraction. Therefore a veical incision is typically indicated.",C

Allowing the cord blood passage to fetus before clamping the umbilical cord should be AVOIDED to prevent,Maternal alloimmunization,Prematurity,Growth retardation of fetus,All of the above,"Ans. a (Maternal alloimmunization) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Chapter 17; p. 431, 663)CLAMPING THE CORDThe umbilical cord is cut between two clamps placed 4 to 5 cm from the fetal abdomen, and later an umbilical cord clamp is applied 2 to 3 cm from the fetal abdomen. A plastic clamp that is safe, efficient, and fairly inexpensive.Timing of Cord ClampingIf after delivery, the newborn is placed at or below the level of the vaginal introitus for 3 minutes and the fetoplacental circulation is not immediately occluded by clamping the cord, an average of 80 mL of blood may be shifted from the placenta to the neonate. This provides about 50 mg of iron, which reduces the frequency of iron deficiency anemia later in infancy.Accelerated destruction of erythrocytes, as found with maternal alloimmunization, forms additional bilirubin from the added erythrocytes and contributes further to the danger of hyperbilirubinemia. Although the theoretical risk of circulatory overloading from gross hypervolemia is formidable, especially in preterm and growth-retarded neonates, the addition of placental blood to the otherwise normal newborn's circulation ordinarily does not cause difficulty.",A

"A 9-month-old girl is presented with PR bleed, vomiting, mass & colicky pain in Rt lumbar region with masked liver dullness. She is in shock like condition.

Patient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception.

Diagnosis of intussusception 

The clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation.
Retrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs.
Ileoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten­tion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of ""air"" enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia­tion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques.
Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception.

Treatment of Intussusception 

The child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration.
Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air.

""In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted"".

In the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i.e., manual operative reduction.
If the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis.
Treatment of shock (e.g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present.

About option a & b

As the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",D

Normal hemoglobin o The hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein. o Each subunit is composed of a protein pa, i.e. globin and a nonprotein pa, i.e. heme, i.e. Each hemoglobin molecule contains four heme units and two pairs of similar protein, globin. o The heme pa of globular protein is same in all types of hemoglobin. o The protein pa vary in different hemoglobin ? 1. Adult hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A) consist of two identical alpha-chains and two identical alpha-chains. 2. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical y chains. 3. Minor hemoglobin (HbA,) consist of two identical a-chains and two identical S chains. o Normally adult blood contains about 96% of HbA (a,(32)3-3.5% HbA2 (a2O2), and small amount of fetal hemoglobin HbF (.272). Defect in sickle cell anemia Sickle cell anemia results from mutation in fI-globin gene. o It is caused by a point mutation at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain leading to substution of a valine residue for a glutamic acid residue. resulting in sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder. o If an individual is homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS. o In heterozyogotes, only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, the remainder being normal hemoglobins.",B

Drug contraindicated in patient with rheumatic heart disease in PPH is,Oxytocin infusion,Methyl ergometrine,Misoprostol,Carboprost,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Methyl ergometrine Cardiac patients should not receive ergotamine because these agents cause significant vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure which can be deleterious to the patientAlso know,In healthy women, an intravenous bolus of 10 units of oxytocin caused a transient but marked fall in arterial blood pressure that was followed by an abrupt increase in cardiac output.These hemodynamic changes could be dangerous to women already hypovolemic from hemorrhage or who had cardiac disease that limited cardiac output.The same danger is present for women with right to left cardiac shunts because the decrease in systemic resistance would further increase the shunt.So, - Oxytocin should not be given intravenously as a large bolus, but rather as a much more dilute solution by continuous intravenous infusion or as an intramuscular infection.Management of cardiac patient during pregnancy Antepartum Bed restThe most important measure for attenuating the impact of pregnancy on diseased heart is bed rest.Bed rest increases the venous return to the heart, improves renal perfusion, induces diuresis and promotes elimination of water.Dietary salt restrictionIt helps to prevent excess retention of sodium and water.DiureticsIt should be given to cardiac pregnant patient if moderate restriction in sodium intake is insufficient to limit the normal intravascular volume expansion that occurs during gestation.Prophylactic digitalizationIt is commonly used in patients with severe heart disease who are not in overt congestive failure.During labour and deliveryThe pregnant cardiac patient should always labor and deliver in lateral supine position to avoid hemodynamic impairment caused by dorsal decubitus position.Effective pain relief during labour with morphine.Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry.Restriction of i.v. fluids to 75 ml/hr (Almost all cardiac patients in labour should be kept on the dry side).Antibiotic prophylaxis (This is given in patients with congenital or acquired heart lesions).Thrombosis prophylaxis.Patient should be placed in sitting position after delivery. This is done to avoid pulmonary edema (sitting will increase venous pooling in the lower extremities and decrease the venous return to the heart).",B

The mechanism of action of emergency contraception includes the following except:,By Causing early ovulation,Degeneration of corpus leutum,Inhibition of fertilization,Prevention of implantation of fertilized egg.,"Ans. A. By Causing early ovulation.Methods of emergency contraceptionThere are two methods of emergency contraception:# emergency contraception pills (ECPs)# copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs).When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception available.The emergency contraceptive pill regimen recommended by WHO is one dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, taken within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse.1. Emergency contraception pills# WHO recommends levonorgestrel for emergency contraceptive pill use. Ideally, this progestogen-only method should be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, a woman can take the levonorgestrel in two doses (0.75 mg each; 12 hours apart).# Mode of action :Levonorgestrel emergency pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation. They may also prevent fertilization of an egg by affecting the cervical mucus or the ability of sperm to bind to the egg. They are not effective once the process of implantation has begun.# Effectiveness :levonorgestrel regimen is 52-94% effective in preventing pregnancy. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken.2. Copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs)# WHO recommends that a copper-bearing IUD, as an emergency contraceptive, be inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse. This may be an ideal emergency contraceptive for a woman who is hoping for an ongoing, highly effective contraceptive method.# Mode of action : As emergency contraception, the copper-bearing IUD primarily prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change that damages sperm and egg before they can meet.# Effectiveness: When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. Once inserted, she can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception.# Postcoital contraceptivesDrugsDosePregnancy rate (%)Levonorgestrel0.75 mg stat and after 12 hours0-1Ethinyl estradiol 50 mg + Norgestrel 0.25 mg2 tab stat and 2 after 12 hrs0-2Conjugated estrogen15 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Ethinyl estradiol2.5 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Mifepristone10 mg single dose0-0.6Copper IUDsInsertion within 5 days0-0.1",A

Most patients have rhinorrhea, pharyngitis, mild cough, and low-grade fever for 1-3 days before the signs and symptoms of upper airway obstruction become apparent. The child then develops the characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor Symptoms are characteristically worse at night and often recur with decreasing intensity for several days and resolve completely within a week. Croup is a clinical diagnosis and must be distinguished from other diagnoses, including foreign body aspiration, epiglottitis, retropharyngeal abscess, angioedema, and subglottic stenosis or hemangioma. The radiographic steeple sign , consisting of progressive narrowing of the subglottic region of the trachea, is characteristic of croup Croup is a disease of the upper airway, and alveolar gas exchange is usually normal.

FSH and LH levels are normalA normal testicular biopsy in an azoospermic man with a normal FSH level suggests obstruction of the vas.Obstruction (Obstructive Azoospermia)Approximately 6% of men have blockages in the genital tract that prevent the passage of sperm between the testes to the penis and result in absence of sperm in the semen.There are three major groups of causes of male genital tract blockages:a. Disorders of development of the epididymis, vas and seminal vesicles,b. Scarring from inflammation (especially Gonorrhoea) andc. Vasectomy.The function of the testes is dependent upon hormones from the pituitary gland, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The blood levels of these hormones rise during the early stages of puberty and stimulate testicular development. LH controls production of the male sex hormone testosterone which in turn is responsible for the growth that occurs at puberty: development of the genitals, beard and body hair, prostate and seminal vesicles, and also development of bone and muscle and other aspects of masculine physique. If LH and FSH are deficient, the tests do not develop or function properly. In contrast, if the testes are damaged directly, the levels of these hormones in the blood rise.",A

Fetal heart starts contracting at,10-12 days,10-12 weeks,3-5 weeks,3- 5 month,"(C) 3-5 weeks[?]The Beginning:The human heart begins to beat and pump blood through the embryo around day 22 of gestation.The electric stimulus that triggers contractions in the myocardium arise spontaneously within the myocardium itself, and propagate from cell to cell. Input from the central nervous system can modify the heart rate (the frequency of heart beats), but it does not initiate beats.The ability of cardiac myocytes to beat is an intrinsic property of these cells. It has been found that myocytes removed from the early heart and grown in culture will beat sporadically, and if they become connected to each other, will then begin to beat rhythmically, in unison.As a functional organ, the heart begins to beat very early, even before it has assumed its final form.Interestingly, the heart begins to beat even before structures such as valves and septa (singular: septum; the muscular walls that divide the chambers) have formed. The initial contractions are peristaltic - that is, they proceed in a wave like fashion along the length of the heart.

Apt Test: Used to detect the presence or absence of fetal blood (qualitative) in a vaginal discharge to rule out vasa pre late in pregnancy or to detect the origin of a neonatal bloody vomiting, whether it is a genuine upper GI hemorrhage/ hemoptysis or simply swallowed maternal blood during delivery or from cracked nipple. Kleihauer-Betke Test: The sample is maternal peripheral smear and is used to see how much of fetal blood (quantitative) has been transfused into the maternal serum in order to assess the risk of isoimmunization and then the risk of hemolytic disease of newborn. Both of them relies on the fact that HbF is resistant to alkali (Apt) and acids (Kleihauer-Betke) and so the HbA containing RBCs (Maternal) will be hemolyzed but not the fetal RBCs as they contain the HbF.

Not used in treatment of thalassemia:,Folic-acid,Iron therapy,Splenectomy,Bone marrow transplant,"Ans. b (Iron therapy). (Ref. Harrison, Principles of Medicine, 18th/Ch. 104)# Iron therapy is infact contraindicated in thalassemic patients on transfusion, as they are likely to have iron overload.Many patients with Beta-thalassemia major require chronic hypertransfusion therapy designed to maintain a hematocrit of at least 27-30% so that erythropoiesis is suppressed. Splenectomy is required if the annual transfusion requirement (volume of RBCs per kilogram of body weight per year) increases by >50%. Folic acid supplements may be useful. Vaccination with Pneumovax in anticipation of eventual splenectomy is advised, as is close monitoring for infection, leg ulcers, and biliary tract disease. Many patients develop endocrine deficiencies as a result of iron overload. Early endocrine evaluation is required for glucose intolerance, thyroid dysfunction, and delayed onset of puberty or secondary sexual characteristics.Patients with Beta-thalassemia intermedia exhibit similar stigmata but can survive without chronic hypertransfusion.Persons with alpha-thalassemia trait may exhibit mild hypochromia and microcytosis usually without anemia. HbA2 and HbF levels are normal. Affected individuals usually require only genetic counseling. HbH disease (in which three loci deleted on the contrary to Hb Barts, in which all four loci are deleted) resembles -thalassemia intermedia, with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients.",B

The first sign of pubey in females is?,Pubarche,Thelarche,Menarche,Increase in height,"Adolescence: Stage of transmission from childhood to adulthood. During this stage, there will be an appearance of sexual characters with changes in cognition and psychology. Adolescence refers to this entire process, pubey refers to the physical aspect. Age 10-19 year is considered as a period of adolescence and pubey marks the early half of adolescence. Pubey in girls stas with breast development( thelarche) anytime between 8-13 years. This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair ( pubarche) and subsequently menstruation ( menarche), occurring at an average of 12.6 years. Menarche occurs after 2-21/2 years of thelarche. In boys, the earliest change is an increase in testicular size( testicular volume reaching 4 ml) and this occurs between 9-14 years. This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair and lengthening of the penis. Spermarche( sperm production) stas during mid-adolescence. Laryngeal growth, manifesting as cracking of voice, begins in boys in mid-pubey, deepening of voice is complete by end of pubey. During pubey, boys gain 20-30 cm and girls 16-28 cm of height. Peak growth velocity in girls occurs before attainment of menarche. Boys have their peak growth in later stages of pubey. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",B

The most appropriate course of action is to",Leave the IUD in place without any other treatment,Leave the IUD in place and continue prophylactic antibiotics throughout pregnancy,Remove the IUD immediately,Terminate the pregnancy because of the high risk of infection,"Although there is an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and a small risk of infection, an intrauterine pregnancy can occur and continue successfully to term with an IUD in place. However, if the patient wishes to keep the pregnancy and if the string is visible, the IUD should be removed in an attempt to reduce the risk of infection, abortion, or both. Although the incidence of ectopic pregnancies with an IUD was at one time thought to be increased, it is now recognized that in fact the overall incidence is unchanged. The apparent increase is the result of the dramatic decrease in intrauterine implantation without affecting ectopic implantation. Thus, while the overall probability of pregnancy is dramatically decreased, when a pregnancy does occur with an IUD in place, there is a higher probability that it will be an ectopic one. With this in mind, in the absence of signs and symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, especially after ultrasound documentation of an intrauterine pregnancy, laparoscopy is not indicated. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy, in which intrauterine and extrauterine implantation occur, is no higher than approximately 1 in 2500 pregnancies.",C

Milk and saline are good transport media if the child is uncooperative or for some other reason the teeth cannot be reinserted at the scene. Teeth may also be transported in the mouth of the older, cooperative patient or the parent. The immediate application of acrylic splints is needed to keep the teeth in place, so urgent dental attention is required. The need for full tetanus immunization should be evaluated. Unless the tooth is available, patients who are suspected of having a total avulsion should be evaluated for partial avulsion or total intrusion with a radiograph.

Most dangerous dehydration is –,Hyponatremic,Hypernatremic,Isonatremic,Non–diarrhoeal cause,"Types of Dehydration in diarrhoea

A large amount of water and water-soluble nutritive substances such as electrolytes, metabolites and vitamins are lost from the body during diarrhoea episodes.
Loss of water from the body causes a reduction or shrinkage in the volume of ECF.
Depending on the concentration of sodium, this ECF reduction can be classified into -

Isonatremic dehydration

Sodium loss is parallel to water loss so that sodium concentration in ECF or plasma remains normal (; 140 meq/L).  It occurs in about 50% of diarrheal cases.

Hyponatremic dehydration

Sodium loss is more than ECF loss
It occurs in 40-45% of diarrheal case
Because of low osmolality (due to reduced sodium) water moves from extracellular to intracellular compartment  → signs of dehydration (wrinkled skin due to loss of elasticity).

Hypernatremic dehydration

In about 5% of cases, especially in a child who has been given fluids with more salts, serum level may be elevated (> 150 mEq/L).
Water moves from inside the cells to the extracellular compartment.
This may mask the physical findings of dehydration and the patients may be undertaken as mild dehydration even in the presence of severe dehydration → complications of severe dehydration may occur due to delay in management.
So, hypernatremic dehydration is more dangerous.",B

Precardial buldge --> Frequent chest infections with tachypnea causes the soft rib cage being drawn inward at the diaphragmetic attachments of the ribs. This combined with cardioamegaly gives them a precordial buldge. 4. Hyperkinetic precordium 5. Delayed diastolic murmur in tricuspid or mitral area --> Due to increased flow through these areas depending on the type of CHDs. 6. Cardiomegaly with plethoric pulmonary vasculature on chest X-ray Due to increased flow through pulmonary circulation (plethoric lung) there is increased volume overload to left side of hea ---> Cardiomegaly. B) Obstructive lesions o Obstructive congenital diseases have following features. 1) Absence offrequent chest infection --> Pulmonary circulation is not overloaded. 2) Absence of cyanosis ---> No defect in pulmonary oxygenation and there is no shunt where aerial and venous blood can mix. 3) Absence of precardial buldge There is no chest infection or Cardiomegaly. 4) Heaving (forcible) cardiac impulse --> Obstructive lesions cause concentric hyperophy of ventricles that produce forcible contraction. 5) Systolic thrill due to systolic ejection murmur --4 When hyperophied ventricles forcibly pump the blood through stenotic pulmonary or aoic valve, systolic thrill and systolic ejection murmur are produced. 6)Absence of delayed diastolic murmur in mitral or tricuspid area --> Blood flow through these area is not increased. 7)Presence of delayed corresponding second sound (A2 in AS and P2 in PS) --> Because prolonged flow through these area results in delayed closure of that valve. 8)Normal sized hea and pulmonary vasculature in chest x-ray --> There is concentric hyperophy, i.e., hyperophy without dilatation. So, hea size is normal on x-ray.",B

True hermaphroditism karyotype:,45X0,45X0/46,47 XY/47 XX,46XX/46XY,"Ans. d. 46XX/46XYRef: Williams Obstetrics 24th Ed; Page No-148-49GENITAL AMBIGUITY OF THE NEWBORNAmbiguity of the neonatal genitalia results from excessive androgen action in a fetus that was destined to be female or from inadequate androgen representation for one destined to be male.Rarely, genital ambiguity indicates true hermaphroditism.Several transcription factors--SOX9, SF1, and WT1, and disruptions of signaling molecules--hedgehog, WNT, cyclin dependent kinase, and Ras/MAP kinase--cause disorders of sexual development.Examples are congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen insensitivity syndrome.Abnormalities of gender differentiation causing genital ambiguity can be assigned to one of four clinically defined categories:Female pseudohermaphroditismMale pseudohermaphroditismDysgenetic gonads, including true hermaphroditism; and rarelyTrue hermaphroditism.FEMALE PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISMIn this condition, mullerian-inhibiting substance is not produced.For a fetus genetically predestined to be a female, androgen exposure should be excessive and variable.The karyotype is 46XX with presence of ovary.Therefore, by genetic and gonadal gender, all are supposed to be female, and the basic abnormality is androgen excess. Because mullerian- inhibiting substance is not produced, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina develop.MALE PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISMIt is characterized by incomplete and variable androgenic exposure of a fetus supposed to be male.The karyotype is 46, XY and characterized by either presence of testes or no gonads.In some cases, incomplete masculinization follows inadequate production of testosterone by the fetal testis.It also may result from decreased responsiveness of the genital anlage to normal quantities of androgen--including failure of the in situ formation of 5a-DHT in androgen-responsive tissue.Because testes were present for at some point of embryonic life, mullerian inhibiting substance is produced. Thus, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina do not develop.DYSGENETIC GONADSIn affected individuals, karyotype differs and is mostly abnormal. As the name describes, most have abnormally developed gonads, and streak gonads are typically present.As a result, mullerian-inhibiting substance is not produced and fetal androgen exposure is variable, which results in presence of uterus, fallopian tubes and upper vagina.Most common form of gonadal dysgenesis is Turner syndrome (46, X).The phenotype is female, but secondary sexual characters don't develop at the time of expected puberty, and genital infantilism persists.TRUE HERMAPHRODITISMIn most of the cases, category 3 guidelines are met.External genitalia are seen in such type a case.The karyotype of True hermaphroditism of an infant with 46, XX/46, XY.True hermaphrodites have both ovarian and testicular tissues with germ cells for both ovum and sperm in the abnormal gonads.AMBIGUOUS GENITALIATypeKaryotype and featuresFigureFemalepseudohermaphroditism*.

A: Obstetric Conjugate Antero -posterior diameters: Anatomical antero-posterior diameter (true conjugate) (11cm)-from the tip of the sacral promontory to the upper border of the symphysis pubis. Obstetric conjugate (10 cm)-from the tip of the sacral promontory to the most bulging point on the back of symphysis pubis which is about 1 cm below its upper border. It is the shoest antero-posterior diameter. Diagonal conjugate (12 cm)-1.5 cm longer than the true conjugate. From the tip of sacral promontory to the lower border of symphysis pubis. External conjugate (20 cm)-from the depression below the last lumbar spine to the upper anterior margin of the symphysis pubis measured from outside by the pelvimeter. It has not a true obstetric impoance. Transverse diameters: Anatomical transverse diameter (13cm) -between the fahest two points on the iliopectineal lines. It lies 4 cm anterior to the promontory and 7 cm behind the symphysis. It is the largest diameter in the pelvis. Obstetric transverse diameter: It bisects the true conjugate and is slightly shoer than the anatomical transverse diameter. Oblique diameters: Right oblique diameter (12 cm) -from the right sacroiliac joint to the left iliopectineal eminence. - Left oblique diameter (12 cm) -from the left sacroiliac joint to the right iliopectineal eminence.

Weight Gain in the second year of life is _____________,1 kg,2 kg,3 kg,4 kg,"The average bih weight of neonates is about 3 kg. During the first a few days after bih, the newborn loses extracellular fluid equivalent to about 10% of the body weight. Most infants regain their bih weight by the age of 10 days. Subsequently, they gain weight at a rate of approximately 20-40 g per day for the first 3 months of life. Thereafter, they gain about 400 g weight every month for the remaining pa of the first year. An infant usually doubles his bih weight by the age of 5 months. The bih weight triples at 1 year and is four times at 2 years of age. Thus, the weight at 5months, 1 year and 2 years is approximately 6, 9 and 12 kg, respectively. The weight of a child at the age of 3 years is approximately five times that of the bih weight. At 5 years, the expected weight can be calculated by multiplying the bih weight by 6, at 7 years by 7 and at 10 years by 10. It follows that the expected weight at 3, 5, 7 and 10 years is approximately 15, 18, 21 and 30 kg, respectively.

Which of the following should be the line of management in a pregnant female with controlled diabetes?,Even controlled diabetes in pregnancy does not disappear on its own and needs extensive treatment even after delivery,Pregnant females with controlled diabetes are more likely to deliver child by normal vaginal delivery without any complication.,"In all females with gestational diabetes, blood sugar levels remain too high, and daily insulin therapy is essential.",LSCS is must in almost every case of gestational diabetes,"Ans. b (Pregnant females with controlled diabetes are more likely to deliver child by normal vaginal delivery without any complication). (Ref. Dutta, Obstertics, 6th ed., p 284)DIABETES IN PREGNANCY# Gestational diabetes usually begins in the second half of pregnancy, and goes away after the baby is bom.Effects on the fetus:# Macrosomia# IUGR# Newborns of diabetic mothers are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and hyperviscosity.# Caudal regression syndrome: sacral agenesis (most characteristic feature)# Congenital defects: In pregnancies complicated by type I or II diabetes, the major cause of neonatal mortality is congenital malformation incompatible with life. Therefore, MS AFP should be determined at 16 to 18 wk gestation, and a thorough ultrasound examination should be performed at 18 to 22 wk.# Respiratory distress syndrome# Left lazy colon syndrome# Stillbirth or death as a newborn is rare.# Increased risk of the baby developing type II diabetes or being overweight later in life.Effects on the mother# Women who get gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes in future pregnancies, and are at a higher risk of developing type II diabetes later in life.# Diagnosing gestational diabetes- Urine is routinely tested for sugar throughout pregnancy, and high blood sugar, if present, is usually detected between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.- The only way to confirm gestational diabetes is with a glucose tolerance test, which needs to be carried out after eight hours without food.- When suspected, GTT may be carried out earlier than 24-28 weeks.Q# Treatment- A few women's blood sugar levels remain too high, and they may need daily injections of insulin.- The extra insulin will not cross the placenta and will not affect the baby.- In almost every case, gestational diabetes disappears on its own after delivery.Q# Labor and Delivery- During the 3rd trimester, care of diabetic women consists mainly of controlling maternal plasma glucose levels, assessing fetal well-being, and determining fetal pulmonary maturation.- For most women with gestational diabetes, labor begins spontaneously at term, and delivery is vaginal. If these pregnancies go beyond 42 wk, the fetus is at risk of death in utero, so labor should be induced.- Cesarean section may be necessary in cases of dysfunctional labor or cephalopelvic disproportion or to avoid shoulder dystocia and injury to the newborn and to the birth canal.# Postpartum Care- For women with type I diabetes, insulin requirements decrease dramatically but gradually increase after about 72 h.- Women who have had gestational diabetes should have a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test with 75 g of glucose at 6 to 12 wk postpartum to determine whether they are normal, clearly diabetic, or have impaired glucose tolerance (based on WHO criteria).Educational points:HPL has putative actions in a number of important metabolic processes. These include.1. Maternal lipolysis and an increase in the levels of circulating free fatty acids, thereby providing a source of energy for maternal metabolism and fetal nutrition.2. An anti-insulin or ""diabetogenic"" action, leading to an increase in maternal levels of insulin, which favors protein synthesis and provides a readily available source of amino acids for transport to the fetus.3. A potent angiogenic hormone; it also may play an important role in the formation of fetal vasculature.",B

NADA's criteria are used for -,Assessment of child for degree of dehydration,Assessment of child for degree of malnutrition,Assessment of child for presence of hea disease,Assessment of child for degree of mental retardation,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Assessment of child for the presence of hea disease o The assessment of a child for the absence or presence of Hea disease can be done with the help of some guidelines suggested by NADA and are called NADA's criteria. NADA's Criteria o Either one major or two minor criteria are necessary for indicating the presence of hea disease. A) Major Criteria 1) Systolic murmur of grade III or more. The systolic murmur is classified into : ? a) Ejection systolic murmur b) Pansystolic murmur Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur --> i)VSD ii) MR iii) TR Ejection systolic murmur on the other hand may be organic or functional. If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity --) It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children. 2) Diastolic murmur Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic hea disease. There are two exceptions. i) Severe hypeension --> Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. ii) Anemia --> May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area. 3) Cyanosis Central cyanosis indicates presence of hea disease if lung disease has been excluded. 4) CHF Presence of CHF indicates presence of hea disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia. B) Minor criteria 1) Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. 2) Abnormal second hea sound Abnormal S2 always indicates presence of hea disease. It has been included as a minor criterian only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding. 3) Abnormal ECG Main value of ECG lies in determining the : ? i) Mean QRS axis ii) Right or left atrial hyperophy iii) Right or left ventricular hyperophy 4) Abnormal X-ray If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of hea disease. 5) Abnormal BP",C

"A premature baby weighing 1.5 kg, born with emergency C.S. at 32 weeks, now develops respiratory distress with grunting. The best management would be:",C-pap,Mechanical ventilation,Moist oxygen through headbox,Surfactant therapy plus mechanical ventilation,"Premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome present with progressively worsening retractions, tachypnea, and oxygen requirements because their lungs are too immature to synthesize surfactant. This disease has a characteristic radiographic pattern that includes ""ground glass"" opacities in the lung parenchyma and prominent air bronchograms. Initial therapy for respiratory distress syndrome involves using CPAP to stent open the airways, thereby reducing the collapse of the alveoli and limiting fuher damage. For intubated infants with respiratory distress syndrome, the second intervention involves surfactant administration through the ET tube. This procedure can result in rapid changes in pulmonary compliance. Ref: Wood K.S., Gordon P.V. (2011). Chapter 4. Neonatal and Pediatric Transpo. In J.E. Tintinalli, J.S. Stapczynski, D.M.

Investigations o If the cause of coma is unknown, following investigations may be required : - i) Lumbar puncture ECG iii) Skull radiography/CT/MR' iv) Cervical spine imaging o Blood is drawn for a CBC, electrolyte determination, toxicology tests, blood gas analysis, BUN and cross matching. Management o Care of the child in coma is directed towards maintaining body function in optimal state until the child regains consciousness. Management includes : ? 1) Airway As a general rule, place the child on his/her side to reduce the risk of aspiration. Oral suctioning to remove mucus from the mouth and pharynx may be necessary. If Glassgow score is 8 or less and clinical circumstances do not suggests improvement then intubation is indicated to secure airway. 2) Breathing Oxygen is given especially when oxygen saturation is low. 3) Circulation Venous access is obtained. Signs of shock are assessed and treated as indicated. 4) Drugs and specific therapy After maintenance of breathing and circulation, specific therapy is given e.g., antibiotics for infection, dextrose in hypoglycemia, naloxone in opiates poisoning etc.",A

Tuberculosis in children true is,Commonly sputum negative,Incidence < 5% of all TB cases,Clinically child does not show sign of florid TB,All of the above,"Tuberculosis in children :

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Cases of tuberculosis represent 5 - 15 percent of all tubercular cases.

Clinical manifestations of TB in children :

The majority of children with tuberculosis infection develop no signs or symptoms at any level.
Occasionally.

Infection is marked by low - grade fever, mild cough, malaise and u - like symptoms.
A) Primary pulmonary disease the lung is the portal of entry in >  98% of cases.

The primary complex of tuberculosis includes local infection at the portal of entry and regional lymph nodes that drain the area.
The combination of the parenchymal pulmonary - lesion and corresponding lymph node is called Ghon complex.
Asymptomatic pleural effusion is so frequent in primary - tuberculosis that it is basically a component of the primary complex.
Nelson, It may have one of the following course : - Heating by brosis and calcification.
Progressive primary > tuberculosis. Cavity Obstructive emphysema If the incomplete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Resorption atelectasis If the complete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Tubercular bronchitis & bronchiectasis Hematogenous dissemination During early bacteremia seeding may occur at apex Simon's focus.
Miliary tuberculosis Collapse consolidation (segmental lesion) A combination of pneumonitis and atelectasis.

B) Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis :

Infrequent in young children.
Children above the age of seven years, especially girls are more vulnerable.

The commonest site of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the apex of lung Puhl's lesion.

Infraclavicular lesion of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is called Assman's focus.Regional lymph nodes are not involved in chronic pulmonary TB (in contrast to primary TB). Lab investigations of pediatric TB.
ESR and blood counts : No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB.
Demonstration of AFB.
Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it.

Therefore sputum is not available for examination.

A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteriaIt is customer to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days, Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a Ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. The CSF, Pleural did or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculous sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli. Histopathology : Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC.
PCR : High sensitivity and specificity for pleural uid and low for gastric aspirate. CXR and CT may show characteristic features.
USG may be helpful for the detection of enlarged abdominal lymph nodes,
Serology : Elisa or other methods have no utility in pediatric TB. Antitubercular drugs used in children.
First line drugs : Isoniazid, Rifampicin, EthambutoL Streptomycin, Pyrazinamide.

Chronic ITP is caused by the formation of autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoproteins most often 11b-Hla or Ib-IX.
Antibodies reactive with these membrane glycoprotein can be demonstrated in the plasma as well as bound to platelet surface in approximately 80% of the patients.


In overwhelming majority of cases the antiplatelet antibodies are of the IgG class.
The mechanism of platelet destruction is similar to that seen in autoimmune hemolytic anemias. Opsonized platelets are rendered susceptible to phagocytosis by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system.
The spleen is the major site of the destruction of platelets.

Viral hepatitis (HAV, HBV)
Eclampsia, preeclampsia (HELLP syndrome)
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Let us discuss each option separately
Preeclampsia and eclampsia/HELLP syndrome:

It is the most common cause of abnormal liver function test in women.
Amniotransferases are modestly elevated.
But in these cases delivery of the fetus is followed by rapid normalization of the hepatic abnormalities.
Moreover the question does not mention any history of PIH, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (HELLP syndrome).

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy:

Acute fatty liver develops in the third trimester.
Jaundice develops a few days after the onset. The serum bilirubin is rarely above 10 mg/dL.
Alkaline phosphate is markedly elevated.
Aminotransferases are moderately elevated.
A markedly raised serum ammonia is the most diagnostic finding in establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and symptoms rapidly abate with parturition in most patients.

Fulminant hepatic failure:

The patient presents with features of severe acute hepatitis leading to the development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset.
The bilirubin increases to 20-30 mg/dL.
The aminotransferase levels are very high (>1000)
Alkaline phosphatase moderately elevated.
Delivery is usually the best treatment.

Budd-Chiari syndrome:

It is a disorder characterized by thrombotic occlusion of the hepatitis veins.
It is a rare complication of pregnancy.
Most of the cases presents within few weeks of delivery but in several cases onset occurs during pregnancy.
Clinical triad of Budd-Chiari syndrome includes sudden onset of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites (ascites with high protein content is almost always present) near term or shortly after delivery.
Tender hepatomegaly is one of the hallmark of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Aminotransferases are mildly elevated.

The consequences of Rh incompatibility are not serious during first pregnancy because:,In first pregnancy only IgM antibody is formed,Antibody titer is very low during primary immune response,IgG generated is ineffective against fetal red cells,Massive hemolysis is compensated by increased eryth ropoiesis,"As discussed is the preceeding text – The initial antibodies which are produced are of IgM variety which cannot cross the placenta and by the time IgG antibodies develop, patient has already delivered. Thus first pregnancy is safe.
Another reason is
In sensitised women, anti-D antibodies are produced at such a low level that they are not detected during or after the index pregnancy. Instead, they are identified early in a subsequent pregnancy when rechallenged by another D-positive fetus.",A

"A 28 yrs old lady, is suspected to have polycystic ovarian disease ,sample for testing LH and FSH are best taken on the following days of menstrual cycle",4-Jan,10-Aug,13-15,24-26,"In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries . These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3:1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.

Most commonly performed type of tubal ligation in current practice:,Pomeroy's method,Irwing's operation,Yoon ring application,Madlener procedure,"Ans. a (Pomeroy's method). (Ref. Textbook of Gynecology by Shaw 13th ed. 236)TUBAL STERILIZATIONOperationa) Pomeroys technique: This technique involves grasping and elevating a 2-cm midsegment of tube, ligating the tubal loop with a 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then excising the distal portion of the loop,b) Parkland method: opening created in mesosalpinx and prox portion of tube is cut.c) Irving procedure: Begins similarly to the Parkland method. However, after the knot on the proximal tubal segment is secured, the ties are left longd) Uchida method : Tubal serosa is first separated from the muscularis by a subserosal injection of a dilute saline solution of epinephrine (1:100,000). A longitudinal incision is made in the ballooned serosa on its surface opposite the mesosalpinx. The serosal peritoneum then is grasped and dissected away from the underlying tubal muscularis. Following this dissection, a 5- cm midsegment of dissected fallopian tube is ligated proximally and distally with 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then resected. The raw serosal edges are reapproximated, burying the proximal cut tubal end within the leaves of the broad ligament and exteriorizing the distal end from the broad ligamentLaparoscopic# Tubal ligation and resection (removal) of a portion of the fallopian tube is the most frequent method of blocking the tubes.# This involves tying a segment of tube and removing it.# There are many variations of this technique.# The tubal ligation procedure described by Dr. Ralph Pomeroy a century ago is most commonly used today.Steps: With the Pomeroy method of tubal ligation, part of the tube is elevated to create a loop or knuckle. An absorbable ligature is tied around the base of the elevated segment, and the tubal segment is cut out.Within a few days, the peritoneum (tissue that lines the organs of the abdominal cavity) grows over and covers the cut ends of the tubal segments. The cut ends of the fallopian tube separate as the ligature dissolves. The peritoneal covering and separation of the remaining tubal segments prevent them from re-attaching to each other.The Pomeroy method of tubal ligation is good if tubal reversal surgery is to be considered later. Approximately two- thirds of women with a Pomeroy tubal ligation become pregnant following tubal ligation reversal.Laparoscopic tubal sterilization methods:# Unipolar coagulation (First method of LTD to achieve widespread use)# Bipolar coagulation (Least failure rate)# Silicone rubber bands (Yoon's clip)# Spring clips (Hulka's clip)# Filshie clipModified Pomeroy Method. Many modifications of the Pomeroy technique have been described. One technique creates an avascular window in the mesosalpinx at a midpoint along the tube. Through this window, suture similar to that used for the Pomeroy method is passed. The portion of tube that lies proximal to this window is ligated first. The long ends of this suture then are tied around the entire tubal loop, as in the Pomeroy method. The distal portion of the loop is excised.",A

False about paial mole,Caused by triploidy,Can be diagnosed very early by USG,Can present as missed aboion,Rarely causes persistent GTD,"Ans. is b i.e. can be diagnosed very early by USG Paial moles Paial moles or incomplete molar pregnancy means that along with the hydatidiform changes some element of fetal tissue is present They have a triploid karyotype (69 chromosomes)deg, the extra haploid set of chromosomes usually is derived from the fatherdeg. Characteristic pathological features of paial mole Chorionic villi of varying sizes with focal hydatiform swelling, cavitation and trophoblastic hyperplasia Marked villous scalloping Prominent stromal trophoblastic inclusions Identifiable embryonic or fetal tissue. Clinical features -- hey generally do not have the dramatic clinical features characteristic of complete pt general these patients have the signs and symptoms of incomplete or missed aboion, and paial mole can be diagnosed after histologic review of tissue obtained by curettage"". Features like hyperemesis, hypehyroidism and Theca lutein cysts are rare in paial mole. Prognosis ""The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease after a paial mole is substancially lower than following a complete molar pregnancy. Moreover, persistent disease is seldom a choriocarcinoma."" The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease in a case of paial mole is 1-5% wherease with complete mole, it is 15-20% Hence option d i.e. it rarely causes persistent trophoblatic disease is paially correct Diagnosis -- of paial mole by USG is not that easy as is in the case of complete mole because it does not give the characteristic vesicular & ultrasonographic appearance like a complete mole. ""Sonographic features of a paial mole include a thickened, hydropic placenta with fetal tissue. Impoantly, in early pregnancy, sonographv will demon t te the rho raeristic appearance in as few as third of women with a paial mole"" ... Williams Obs 23/ed pg-260 Hence Option b i.e. it can be diagnosed very early by USG is incorrect Remember - - The USG criteria for diagnosis of paial mole is Presence of focal cystic areas in the placental tissues . Increase in transverse diameter of gestational sac. The combination of above two criterias have a positive predictive value of 90% for paial moles . (This means USG can diagnose paial mole but not in early pregnancy) The nonble fetus associated with a triploid paial mole typically has multiple malformations, like syndactyly and hydrocephaly and have symmetrical growth retardation. 13 hcg levels > 200 m IU/rni, after evacuation of paial mole in the third through the eighth week are associated with a 35% risk of persistent trophoblastic disease. Extra edge The most significant recent development in the pathological analysis of H. mole is the use of P57kip2 immunostaining to make a definitive diagnosis of androgenetic complete H. Mole as opposed to an hydropic aboion or a paial mole. P57kip2 is a paternally imprinted gene. which is maternally expressed.

Presentation Symptoms symmetric flaccid paralysis most affected infants are hypotonic at bih proximal muscle involvement lower extremity greater than upper extremity sparing of upper cranial nerves e.g., normal eye movements Physical exam absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes tongue and finger fasciculatons infants have flaccid ""frog-like"" posture restrictive respiratory insufficiency ALS appears to be increasing in incidence. In 5% to 10% of cases, there is an autosomal dominant pattern with strong age-dependent penetrance. Proposed etiologies include oxidative stress, viral infection, immunologic disease, or some unknown environmental factor. Currently, the oxidative stress theory is ored because a defect in the zinc-copper binding superoxide dismutase (5001) coded on chromosome 21 was discovered. Because SO 01 is an antioxidant that conves the superoxide free radical into peroxide and oxygen, reduced activity causes apoptosis (individual cell necrosis) of spinal motor neurons. Inhibition of glutamate transpo potentiates the toxicity associated with the reduced SODllevels. ALS most commonly presents with both upper motor neuron signs (e.g., spastic paralysis) and, eventually, lower motor neuron signs (e.g., muscle atrophy, fasciculations). Atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and forearms with hand weakness and spastic changes in the lower legs are early signs. Antioxidant cocktails have now been developed, which offer some symptomatic improvement. Werdnig- Hoffmann disease is a progressive muscular atrophy noted in infants. It often presents as the floppy child syndrome. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

The risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) can be reduced by using,Vitamin K,Vitamin C,Vitamin E,Vitamin A,"Ans. a (Vitamin K) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 29)INTRAVENTRICULAR HEMORRHAGEThere are four major categories of neonatal intracranial hemorrhage: subdural hemorrhage is usually the result of trauma. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebellar hemorrhage usually result from trauma in term infants but in preterm infants are commonly due to hypoxia. Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage results from either trauma or asphyxia in half of term infants but has no discernible cause in 25 percent of cases. In preterm neonates, the pathogenesis of periventricular hemorrhage is multifactorial and includes hypoxic-ischemic events, anatomical factors, coagulopathy, and many others.The severity of intraventricular hemorrhage can be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography. Papile and colleagues (1978) devised the most widely used grading scheme to quantify the extent of the lesion and estimate prognosis.# Grade I--hemorrhage limited to the germinal matrix.# Grade II--intraventricular hemorrhage.# Grade III--hemorrhage with ventricular dilatation.# Grade IV--parenchymal extension of hemorrhage.Prevention and Treatment# Administration of corticosteroids at least 24 hours before delivery appears to prevent or reduce the incidence and severity of intraventricular hemorrhage.# The type of corticosteroid administered may be important. Although both betamethasone and dexamethasone cross the placenta in their active form, betamethasone has a longer half-life. This is because it has a larger volume of distribution and is cleared more slowly than dexamethasone# The efficacy of phenobarbital, vitamin K, vitamin E, or indomethacin in diminishing the frequency and severity of intracranial hemorrhage, when administered either to the neonate or to the mother during labor, remains controversial.# Magnesium sulfate may prevent the sequelae of periventricular hemorrhage.# It is generally agreed that avoiding significant hypoxia both before and after preterm delivery is of paramount importance. There is presently no convincing evidence, however, that routine cesarean delivery for the preterm fetus presenting cephalic will decrease the incidence of periventricular hemorrhage.",A

First polar body is formed after ?,Mitosis,First meiosis,Second meiosis,Feilization,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., First meiosis Oogenesis Oogenesis refers to the process of formation of ova from the primitive germ cells. Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at pubey), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation. o The sequence of events in oogenesis are : i) The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both 'X' chromosomes are active. ii) The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). iii) Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. iv) Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. v) Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",B

Placenta with umbilical cord attached to its margin is called:,Battledore placenta,Circumvallate placenta,Succenturiate placenta,Velamentous placenta,"Ans. A. Battledore placentaIn Battledore placenta, the umbilical cord is attached to the margin of placenta. It is associated with low implantation of the placenta; there is chance of the cord compression in vaginal delivery leading to foetal anoxia and even death.Succenturiate placenta: An extra placenta separates from the main placentaVelamentous cord insertion is an abnormal condition during pregnancy. Normally, the umbilical cord inserts into the middle of the placenta as it develops. In Velamentous cord insertion, the umbilical cord inserts into the fetal membranes (chorioamniotic membranes), then travels within the membranes to the placenta (between the amnion and the chorion). The exposed vessels are not protected by Wharton's jelly and hence are vulnerable to rupture. Rupture is especially likely if the vessels are near the cervix, in which case they may rupture in early labor, likely resulting in a stillbirth. Early detection can reduce the need for emergency cesarean sections",A

This protein is required to regulate the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus.> Symptoms include: Intestinal obstruction may be an initial manifestation in the neonatal period (meconium ileus). This may be due to the presence of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secreted by the pancreatic enzymes. Later these children tend to retain the food residue in the ileum, caecum and colon and these may form firm masses. Impaction of the faeces causes intestinal obstruction. lleocaecal intussusception may occur in less than 1 percent of the patients. Two cardinal symptoms of the disease are chronic diarrhea with massive steatorrhea and recurrent respiratory tract infections Failure to thrive is also a prominent feature. Rectal prolapse occurs frequently. Biliary cirrhosis of liver is also often observed.> Crohn's disease: The disease is most often seen in teenagers but it has been also reported during infancy. Crampy abdominal pain and dysphagia are the usual early symptoms. Pain may be paraumbilical or may be localized to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

A 18 month baby can do?,Hide 8t seek game,Write Alphabet,Say short sentence,Walk short distance,"ANSWER: (D) Walk short distanceREF: Nelson 18th ed chapter 10In questions like this we must see milestones achieved on or before 18 months.Option (A) Play increases in complexity and imagination, from simple imitation of common experiences, such as shopping and putting baby to bed (2 or 3 yr of age), to more extended scenarios involving singular events, such as going to the zoo or going on a trip (3 or 4 yr of age), to the creation of scenarios that have only been imagined, such as flying to the moon (4 or 5 yr of age). By age 3 yr, cooperative play is seen inactivities such as building a tower of blocks together; later, more structured role-play activity, as in playing house, is seen. Play also becomes increasingly governed by rules, from early rules about asking (rather than taking) and sharing (2 or 3 yr of age), to rules that change from moment to moment, according to the desires of the players (4 and 5 yr of age), to the beginning of the recognition of rules as relatively immutable (5 yr of age and beyond).Option (B) By 6 years of age a child should be able to write the alphabetOption (C) Child starts speaking short sentences from 19 months onwardsOption (D) Child starts walking short distance from 13-15 months",D
"A baby of weight 2 kg born at 30 weeks, for a 19 year old primigravida died after 48 hours. Apgar scores were 5 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes.

Which of the following finding is expected to be associated with it?",Imperforate anus,Hepatic cyst and fibrosis,Absence of ureter,Holoprosencephaly,"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is increasingly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. In its most severe form, the cystic kidneys are nonfunctional in utero, and, therefore, newborns can have Potter facies and other complications of oligohydramnios. In infancy and childhood, kidney enlargement by cysts may initially be recognized by abdominal palpation of renal masses. Hypeension is an early problem. The rate of the progression of renal insufficiency varies, as does growth failure and other complications of chronic renal failure. Two genes (ADPKD1 and ADPKD2) account for 80% and 10% of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, respectively. The other most notable feature of ARPKD is liver involvement disease in the liver is typically diffuse presenting as poal and interlobular fibrosis.

"Apatient who is at risk of estrogen dependent carcinoma andhence estrogen is contraindicate d. So in order to prevent vasomotor symptoms, which drug is given?",Tamoxifen,Conjugated estrogen,Clonidine,Yombinine,"ANSWER: (C) ClonidineREF: Novak's gynecology 13th edition page 455In women for whom hormone replacement is contraindicated, multiple alternative treatments for hot flashes have been developed. Somewhat effective alternatives may be progestins such as medroxyprogesterone (10 to 30 mg daily orally) or megestrol acetate (20 to 40 mg daily orally). If either of these progestins results in intolerable side effects, the use of alternative progestins may be considered, although few data exist regarding their efficacy.In addition to the progestins, other nonsteroidal treatments for hot flashes have been developed. One of the best studied is the b 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine.

Medication used in the treatment of idiopathic central precocious pubey include:,Exogenous gonadotropins,Ethinyl estradiol,GnRH agonists,Clomiphene citrate,"Most effective treatment for central precocious pubey is the use of a Long-acting GnRH agonist, such as leuprolide and others. These drugs act by down regulating pituitary gonadotropes, eventually decreasing the secretion of FSH and LH, which are inappropriately stimulating the ovaries. As a result of this induced hypogonadotropic state, ovarian hormones (oestrogens, progestins, and androgens) are suppressed back to pre-pubeal levels, and precocious pubeal development stops or regresses. During the first 1 or 2 weeks of therapy, there is a flare-up effect of increased gonadotropins and sex steroids-a predicted side effect of these medications.

A pregnant female has past history of embolism in puerperium. What medical management she should take in next pregnancy to avoid this,Cumpulsory prophylaxis with warfarin sta at 10 weeks,To take warfarin after delivery,Chance of thromboembolism increases by 12% in next pregnancy,Does not need anything,"Ans. is b i.e. To take Warfarin after delivery Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we donot study in detail during undergraduation. So, I am giving in brief, all the impoant points you need to remember : Venous thromboembolism in pregnnacy : Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of virchow's triad are increased.deg A. Deep vein thrombosis : Left sided DVT is more common than Right sided DVT. Clinical features : swelling / redness / pain and calf muscle tenderness and oedema. Investigations - Recommended method during pregnancy : Doppler ultrasound - Gold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy) : venography Mangement : Therapeutic The treatment should be staed on clinical grounds if confirmatory tests are not available. Drug of choice - Heparin (as it doesnot cross the placenta) Initially intravenous Heparin is given with the aim to prolong APTT (activated paial thromboplastic time) by 1.5 to 2 times the control followed by subcutaneous Heparin. Monitoring is done by APTT and platelet count (as Heparin causes Thrombocytopenia). Oral anticoagulants like Warfarin cross the placenta and cause teratogenesis therefore should be avoided in pregnancy. Treatment is continued for 6 weeks following which prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is given throughout pregnancy. Heparin is stopped just before delivery. Regional anaesthesia should be avoided at the time of delivery in patients on heparin due to the risk of hematoma formation. Heparin is restaed about 6 - 8 hours after delivery as the puerperium is the time of greatest risk for VTE. Warfarin is commenced simultaneously and thereafter monitoring is done by prothrombin time (PT). Once the prothrombin time INR is between 2 and 3, heparin can be discontinued. Usually warfarin is continued for 6 to 18 weeks and is safe for breast feeding mothers. Thromboprophylaxis : Thromboprophylaxis is considered for women who are at increased risk of thromboembolism (TE). Risk category Risk factors High risk Recurrent TE Previous TE with thrombophilia Previous TE with family history TE in current pregnancy Low risk One episode of previous TE without thrombophiiia or family history Thrombophilia without previous thrombosis Additional risk Cesarean section, obesity, grand multiparity, age above 35, pre-eclampsia, prolonged immobilization etc. High risk patients need antepaum heparin, intrapaum heparin and postpaum prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Low risk patient require intrapaum and postpaum low dose prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Well, now that you have a detailed knowledge of thromboembolism, lets have a look at the question. It says : a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant,what medical management should be given to her? Option 'a. i.e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks. It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy. Option 'b Le to take warfarin after delivery - According to William obs. 22/e, p 1077 table 47-3, 23/e, p 1028 - table 47.6 In case of prior VTE associated with a non recurring risk factor and no known thrombophilia? During pregnancy : Only surveillance is required as per American college of chest physicians. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is required as per American college of obs & gynaecology (which also explains option 'd is paly correct). Postpaum : warfarin is given for 6 weeks. So, option 'b' is absolutely correct i.e. warfarin should be given in the post paum period for six weeks.",B

One of the following features can be used to define contracted pelvis :,Transverse diameter of inlet is 10 cm,AP diameter of inlet is 12 cm,Platypelloid pelvis,Gynaecoid pelvis,"Ans. is a i.e. Transverse diameter of inlet is 10 cm Minimal / Critical diameters of the Pelvis : (If any of the following diameter is less than critical diameter, Pelvis is said to be contracted) Inlet Mid pelvis Outlet Obstetric conjugate = 10 cms Interspinous diameter = 10 cms Inteuberous diameter = 8 cms Diagonal conjugate = 11.5 cm Transverse diameter = 12 cms Mid pelvis is said to be contracted when sum of interspinous diameter (Avg. = 10.5 cm) and posterior sagittal diameter (5 cm) falls from 15.5 cm to 13.5 cms. It can be clinically suspected when the inteuberous diameter does not admit four knuckles. Another way of defining contracted pelvis is where the essential diameters of one or more planes are shoened by 0.5 cms. In the question it is clearly evident that Transverse diameter (10 cms) is too sho and is therefore contracted. Gynaecoid, Anthropoid, Android and Platypelloid pelvis are variations of normal female pelvis. These varieties are not necessarily contracted, although there may be a detion of normal mechanism of labour. Extra edge: In women with contracted pelvis, face and shoulder presentations are encountered three times more frequently, and cord prolapse four to six times more often.",A

The differential diagnosis involves several possible causes. Excessive estrogens, such as with birth control pills, can reduce prolactin- inhibiting factor, thus raising serum prolactin level. Similarly, intensive suckling (during lactation and associated with sexual foreplay) can activate the reflex arc that results in hyperprolactinemia. Many antipsychotic medications, especially the phenothiazines, are also known to have mammotropic properties.

A young child with recurrent bacterial meningitis should be clinically evaluated for the presence of,Holoprosencephaly,Hypoplastic left hea syndrome,Spina bifida occulta with a dermal sinus tract,Syringomyelia of the lower cervical cord,"Spina bifida is a general term that refers to the abnormal fusion of the veebral arches of the lowest veebrae, usually in the sacrolumbar region. There are several disorders in this group of developmental abnormalities that have varying degrees of severity. Spina bifida occult is the mildest form and is characterized by failure of veebral fusion only. The spinal cord and meninges are normal. In spina bifida occult the defect in the closure of the neural tube is covered by skin and dermis, with only a pinpoint sinus or hair-covered depression marking the site. Bacterial meningitis, or meningomyelitis, is the major potential risk in these patients. The remaining types of spina bifida are classified as spina bifida cystic. Spina bifida with a meningocele is characterized by protrusion through the veebral defect of a meningeal sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because the cord is in its normal location, there are minimal neurologic deficits. Next in severity is spina bifida with a myelomeningocele, which is characterized by herniation of the cord and a meningeal sac through the veebral defect. This abnormality is often associated with severe neurologic defects in the lower extremities, bladder, and rectum. The most severe form of spina bifida, spina bifida apea or myeloschisis, results from complete failure of fusion of the caudal end of the neural plate, which lies open on the skin surface. This abnormality also results in severe neurologic defects in the legs, bladder, and rectum. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

A 1-week-old previously healthy infant presents to the emergency room with the acute onset of bilious vomiting. The abdominal plain film in the emergency department (A) and the barium enema done after admission (B) are shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?,Jejunal atresia,Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Malrotation with volvulus,Acute appendicitis,"The plain films demonstrate dilated stomach and proximal loops of bowel. The cross-table upper GI demonstrates a ""curly Q"" twist of barium as it passes through the malrotated portion of bowel. Malrotation results when incomplete rotation of the intestines occurs during embryologic development. The most common type of malrotation is failure of the cecum to move to its correct location in the right lower quadrant. Most patients present in the first weeks of life with bilious vomiting indicative of bowel obstruction and/or intermittent abdominal pain. Acute presentation, similar to that in the question, is caused by a volvulus of the intestines. The diagnosis is confirmed by radiographs; barium contrast studies (upper GI and/or enema) demonstrate malposition of the cecum in the vast majority of cases. Treatment is surgical. Appendicitis is rare at this age and presents as an acute, rigid abdomen and signs of sepsis. Pyloric stenosis usually does not occur until after 3 weeks of life and presents with nonbilious vomiting. If the child were 6 months or older, intussusception would be higher on the differential, but it is an unusual condition for this age. Jejunal atresia would have been noted on the first day of life, as the patient would not have tolerated any feeds prior to newborn discharge.",C

Which of the following is consistent with a diagnosis of delayed puberty?,Breast budding in a 10-year-old girl,Menarche delayed beyond 16 years of age,Menarche 1 year after breast budding,FSH values less than 20 mIU/mL,"Significant emotional concerns develop when puberty is delayed. By definition, if breast development has not begun by age 13, delayed puberty should be suspected. Menarche usually follows about 1 to 2 years after the beginning of breast development; if menarche is delayed beyond age 16, delayed puberty should be investigated. Appropriate laboratory tests include circulating pituitary and steroid hormone levels, karyotypic analysis, and central nervous system (CNS) imaging when indicated. An FSH value greater than 40 mIU/mL defines hypergonadotropic hypogonadism as a cause of delayed pubertal maturation. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is seen in girls with gonadal dysgenesis, such as occurs with Turner syndrome. Since gonadal dysgenesis is such a common cause of absent pubertal development, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is frequently but not invariably found in these patients.",B

Gestational hypeension- maternal blood pressure reaches 140/90 mm Hg or greater for the first time during pregnancy, after 20 weeks and proteinuria is not present. Preeclampsia- blood pressure increases to 140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks of gestation and proteinuria is present (300 mg in 24 h or 1+ protein or greater on dipstick). Eclampsia- is present when women with preeclampsia develop seizures. Chronic hypeension is defined as BP >140/90 mm Hg before pregnancy or diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation, or hypeension first diagnosed after 20 weeks of gestation and persistent after 12 weeks postpaum.",D
"A 25-year-old lady, Neethu, in her 22nd week of pregnancy develops hypeension and mild proteinuria.

Which of the following complications account for the most maternal deaths in preeclampsia?",Cerebral edema and laryngeal edema,Cerebral hemorrhage and adult respiratory distress syndrome,Convulsions and renal tubular necrosis,Hemolysis and hepatic infection,"The disease is preeclampsia, which may be complicated by a wide variety of serious conditions. Historically, the appearance of convulsions defined the transition from preeclampsia to eclampsia; however the concept of eclampsia is probably flawed because many other serious complications can occur even in the absence of seizures. Statistically, the most common causes of maternal death in preeclampsia are cerebral hemorrhage and pulmonary complications, notably adult respiratory distress syndrome. Cerebral edema and laryngeal edema, hemolysis and hepatic infarction, and hepatic rupture and renal coical necrosis can all be complications of preeclampsia, but are not the most common causes of maternal moality. Convulsions and renal tubular necrosis can be complications of preeclampsia, but convulsions indicate that eclampsia has developed. Other complications of preeclampsia not listed in the answer choices include retinal detachment, coical blindness, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, low platelet counts, and in the fetus, brain damage and death from asphyxia.",B

Multiparous
Advanced maternal age
Fetus is dead.

The patient is having strong uterine contractions and suddenly goes in shock with cyanosis, respiratory disturbance and pulmonary edema. All these favour the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism.
Amniotic fluid embolism : It is characterised by an abrupt onset of respiratory distress and coagulopathy.

Amniotic fluid enters the circulation and sets up a disseminated intravascular coagulation, leading to consumptive coagulopathy.
Classically a woman in late labour or immediate postpartum gasps for air, has bronchospasm, becomes cyanotic and undergoes immediate collapse and cardiorespiratory arrest, usually accompanied by hemorrhage. Sudden death is usual.

Kliegman et al, pp 1274-1275. McMillan et al, pp 371-372. Rudolph et al, pp 1420-1421.) A history of nonbilious vomiting for 10 days in a child of this age who does not look ill points to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis as the most likely diagnosis; surgical consultation for a likely pyloromyotomy is indicated. The ultrasound in the question demonstrates the thickened pylorus. The incidence of this condition in infants is between 1:200 and 1:750, with males affected more often than females. Although there is no specific pattern of inheritance, a familial incidence has been observed in about 15% of patients. Information about predisposing ancestry is conflicting, as are data concerning the assertion of a firstborn predilection. Metabolic alkalosis with low serum potassium and chloride levels is frequently seen in pyloric stenosis as a result of loss of gastric contents from vomiting. A child with a small-bowel obstruction (who may require an upper GI with small-bowel follow through to help diagnose the point of obstruction) should develop bilious emesis and should not look well 10 days into the illness; similarly, a child with intussusception (who requires an air contrast enema, which is both diagnostic and perhaps therapeutic) would be markedly ill at this point. Gastroenteritis (IV fluids alone to maintain hydration) does not usually last for 10 days. A brain tumor causing increased intracranial pressure could present with isolated emesis, but should show other symptoms such as irritability and somnolence.",A

First investigation done for abnormal uterine bleeding in reproductive age group is _______,Ultrasonography transabdominal,Pap smear,Urine Beta HCG,Ultrasonography transvaginal,"The first investigation for abnormal uterine bleeding is Urine Beta HCG to rule ouut pregnancy. Abnormal Uterine Bleeding(AUB): is a common and debilitating condition. Chronic AUB was defined as &;bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group , the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

"All of the following are causes of primary amenorrhea, EXCEPT:",Rokitansky syndrome,Sheehan syndrome,Kollman syndrome,Turner syndrome,"Sheehan's syndrome, characterized by postpaum amenorrhea, results from postpaum pituitary necrosis secondary to severe hemorrhage and hypotension and is a rare cause of secondary amenorrhea. Mullerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea. Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. It is a cause of primary amenorrhea. Patients with Turner's syndrome usually present with primary amenorrhea.

Which of the following is NOT characteristic of menopause?,There is a decrease in skin elasticity,Systemic vasomotor instability may be present,There may be an increase in FSH secretion by the pituitary gland,There is a marked decrease in adrenal coical estrogen secretion,"Menopause begins at age 45 to 50 years old. It is a gradual process which concludes with the cessation of menstruation. Cessation of menstrual flow for a period of one year is considered completion of menopause. Menopause is associated with a marked decline in ovarian estrogen secretion, but adrenal coical estrogens continue to be secreted but are not of sufficient quantity to maintain secondary sexual characteristics. There is a loss of breast tissue, subcutaneous fat, skin elasticity, and body hair as a result of decrease in estrogen supply. There is also systemic vaso instability leading to hot flashes, dizziness, and headaches. The pituitary gland responds to the decrease in estrogen by increasing FSH secretions.

For which of the following conditions screening for GDM is not required -,Previous macrosomia,Previous congenital malformation,Previous still born,Previous pre-eclampsia,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Previous preeclampsia Gestational diabetes mellitus It is defined as carbohydrate intolerance of varying severity with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a form of stress that can cause latent diabetes to manifest just as do surgical operations or acute infections.In most of these cases the carbohydrate intolerance will revert by the end of puerperium but this manifestation may be the first indication of diabetes yet to come.More than half of the women with gestational diabetes will develop frank diabetes within the next 20 years.Screening and diagnosis for gestational diabetes mellitusHistorical risk factors suggestive of gestational diabetes have been known for a long timeUnexplained still birth, macrosomia. preterm birth Unexplained still birth, macrosomia and preterm birth have been consistently found to be significantly increased in both gestational and progestational diabetic pregnancies.H/O gestational diabetes in previous pregnancyH/O gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy or diabetes in a first degree relative also increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in subsequent pregnancies.Congenital malformationsCongenital malformations are associated with true diabetes. Congenital malformations are increased much more in known diabetics for obvious reasons because true gestational diabetes usually manifests in the second half of pregnancy by which time fetal organogenesis is nearly complete.The incidence of gestational diabetes can be stratified and shows good correlation with risk factors which can be utilized to characterize women into low average and high risk of developing gestational diabetes. Low risk categoryHigh risk category* <25 years of age* Markedly obese* Normal baby weight* H/o diabetes in first degree relative* No family history of diabetes * Previous abnormal glucose tolerance test* No history of abnormal glucose metabolism* Previous large baby >4 kg* No history of poor obstetric outcome* Previous bad obstetric history unexplained still birth or congenital malformed babies* Not members of an ethnic/racial group with a high prevalence of diabetes* Those with persistent glycosuria There has been a debate whether screening for diabetes should be universal or selective based on risk factors, or whether it is required at allAlthough there is ample evidence to demonstrate increased pregnancy and neonatal complications with increasing maternal glycemic levels there is not enough quality data to ascertain the impact of screening on maternal and neonatal health outcomes.In such a scenario the best policy seems to be is to offer selective screening based on race, personal and obstetric risk factors and the background prevalence of type 2 diabetics in the community.Also knowThe screening for gestational diabetes mellitus is routinely done at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy.Best screening test is 50 g glucose challenge test.",D

"A 13-year-old patient with sickle-cell anemia presents with respiratory distress; she has an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The laboratory workup of the patient reveals the following: hemoglobin 5 g/dL; hematocrit 16%; white blood cell count 30,000/mL; and arterial blood (room air) pH 7.1, PO2 35 mm Hg, and PaCO2 28 mm Hg. These values indicate which of the following?","Acidemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and hypoxia","Alkalemia, respiratory acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, and hypoxia",Acidosis with compensatory hypoventilation,Long-term metabolic compensation for respiratory alkalosis,"While some texts use the terms acidosis and acidemia interchangeably, there are subtle differences. The low pH in the arterial blood can be called acidemia; it is caused by a metabolic acidosis that is a direct result of poor perfusion and lactic acid produced by anaerobic metabolism in tissues with inadequate oxygen delivery. Inadequate oxygenation is caused by the low PO2 , the low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (Hgb 5 g/dL), and circulatory inadequacy due to the sickling itself and to the vascular disease it produces. The low PCO2 reflects the hyperventilation, which is secondary to the respiratory difficulty, and to the anemia, and is also respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis. Note that some texts distinguish the two terms by using acidemia to refer specifically to inborn errors of metabolism that lead to low serum pH.",A
"A 32 year old female with a history of 2 mid-trimester abortions, comes now with 32 weeks of pregnancy and labour pains with Os dilated 2 cm. All are done, except:",Immediate circlage,Betamethasone,Antibiotics,Tocolytics,"In the question, patient is presenting with history of 2 midtrimester abortions and gestational age is 32 weeks with labor pains and dilatation of cervix 2 cm
The membranes are not ruptured, hence management includes:

Betamethasone: To accelerate lung maturation of the fetus.
Tocolysis: Tocolytics are not given with the aim to arrest preterm labor for a long time, but to prolong the labor for 48 hours.

This servers the following purposes:

The corticosteroids get time to act.
Allows time for transport of the woman to better obstetrical centre.

Beta-adrenergic agonists, calcium-channel blockers, or indomethacin are the recommended tocolytic agents for such short-term use–up to 48 hours. American college of obstetrics and gynecology recommends that women with preterm contractions without cervical change, especially those with cervical dilation of less than 2 cm, generally should not be treated with tocolytics.
In general, if tocolytics are given, they should be administered concomitantly with corticosteroids. The gestational age range for their use in debatable. However, because corticosteroids are not generally used after 33 weeks and because the perinatal outcomes in preterm neonates are generally good after this time, most practitioners do not recommend use of tocolytics at or after 33 weeks. In this patient G: Age is 32 weeks and cervix is 2 cm dilated so the use of tocolytics is justified

Rescue cerclage (Williams 24/e, p 857): There is support for the concept that cervical incompetence and preterm labor lie on a spectrum leading to preterm delivery. If cervical incompetence is recognized with threatened preterm labor, then emergency cerclage can be attempted.

Cervical cerclage is done in 3 conditions:

Cervical incompetence
Prophylactically in women identified on USG to have short cervix <15 mm
Rescue cerclage–as discussed above.


Antibiotics: Do not have a role in preterm pregnancy with intact membranes. In a study (ORACLE 11 trial) antimicrobials were given to patients with preterm labor but without membrane rupture, the results were disappointing. In his review, Goldenberg (2002) also concluded that antimicrobial treatment of women with preterm labor for the sole purpose of preventing delivery is generally not recommended. In a follow-up of the ORACLE II trial, Kenyon and associates (2008 b) reported that fetal exposure to antimicrobials in this clinical setting was associated with an increased cerebral palsy rate at age 7 years compared with that of children without fetal exposure.",C

All are true regarding dystocia except:,Dystocia is difficult labor,It is the M/C indication for primary cesarean delivery,ACOG recommends the cervix should be atleast 2 cms dilated for diagnosis of dystocia,"Dystocia can be due to abnormality in power, passage and passenger","Dystocia literally means difficult labor and is characterized by abnormally slow labor progress.
It arises from four distinct abnormalities that may exist singly or in combination:

– Abnormalities of the expulsive forces. Uterine contractions maybe insufficiently strong or inappropriately coordinated to efface and dilate the cervix–uterine dysfunction. Also, there may be inadequate voluntary maternal muscle effort during second-stage labor.
– Abnormalities of presentation, position, or development of the fetus.
– Abnormalities of the maternal bony pelvis–that is, pelvic contraction.
– Abnormalities of soft tissues of the reproductive tract that form an obstacle to fetal descent.
Common clinical findings in women with ineffective labor
Inadequate cervical dilation or fetal descent:

Protracted labor–slow progress
Arrested labor–no progress
Inadequate expulsive effort–ineffective pushing.
Fetopelvic disproportion:
Excessive fetal size
Inadequate pelvic capacity

Malpresentation or position of the fetus

Ruptured membranes without labor.
Dystocia is the most common current indication for primary cesarean delivery.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology recommend (1995a) that the cervix be dilated to 4 cm or more before dystocia is diagnosed, thus, the diagnosis often is made before active labor, and therefore before an adequate trial of labor which leads to unnecessary cesarean section.",C

A female with recurrent aboion and isolated prolonged APTT is most likely associated with,>Lupus anticoagulant,>DIC,>Von wilebrand disease,>Hemophilia,"Lupus anticoagulant They have asked about antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies account for 3% to 5% of patients with repetitive pregnancy losses. The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L.A.C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L.A.C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",A

"A 15 days old baby is brought to the hospital with complains of seizures.;Mood tests revealed serum Ca++ = 5 mg/dL, Phosphorous levels = 9mg/dL, and PTH levels 30pg/ml (normal range = 10–60 pg/ml). What is the most probable diagnosis?",Pseudohypoparathyroidism,Vitamin D deficiency,Hypoparathyroidism,Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy,"This child has :-


Hypocalcemia
Hyperphosphatemia
	Normal PTH levels


Option b & d can be ruled out because:-


In Vitamin D deficiency:- serum calcium is normal or slightly reduced (7.5 ­ 8 mg/dl); serum P043 is normal or slightly reduced, and parathormone levels are increased.
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is not related to calcium and phosphate metabolism.


Now, we are left with Pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism both of which have hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphatemia.
In Pseudohypoparathyroidism, there is an increased concentration of parathyroid most of the times. Thus, this option is also excluded.
Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH.
However, it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcaemia indicate 'inappropri­ately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcaemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcaemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' ­Practical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71.
Because normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcaemia episodes. Low levels of serum PTH and in some assays even inappropriately 'normal' levels despite hypocalcaemia should prompt consider­ation of various form of hypoparathyroidism' - Principles and Practice of Endocrinology & Metabolism ' by Beeker.",C

In contrast, the recipient becomes polycythemic and may develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops.The donor twin is pale, and its recipient sibling is Plethoric.Diagnosed based on two criteria: (1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy, and (2) hydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is >8 cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest veical pocket is < 2 cm in the other twin.Once identified, TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero staging system:Stage I--discordant amnionic fluid volumes, but urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin.Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder.Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical aery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin.Stage V--demise of either fetus.

Lady with infertility with B/L tubal block at cornua. Best method of management is :,Laparoscopy & Hysteroscopy,Hydrotubation,IVF,Tuboplasty,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy There is no treatment of choice or best treatment for proximal tubal obstruction (PTO) without proper evaluation of the tube because although proximal tubal obstruction is a frequent finding on hysterosalpingography (HSG) approximately 213rd of PTO reveals an absence of luminal obstruction.False positive diagnosis of PTO ranges from 16-40% and can be as high as 50%.Therefore careful evaluation of the fallopian tube prior to therapy is an absolute requirement.The distinction b/w true pathological occlusion, spasm or plugging and abnormality of the mucosa is crucial in determining therapy.Conventional HSG does not differentiate cornual spasm or other temporary causes from true obstruction.Selection of patients with tubal disease for future therapeutic management is based on tubal lesion including the state of tubal mucosa and tuboperitoneal assessment and the severity of tubal damage is key in determining the outcome.Proximal tubal occlusion is most treatable since it often occurs because of the accumulation of mucus or debris which forms an impacted plug in the interstitial or proximal isthumic portion of the tube.Until recently the treatment of PTO was a domain of microsurgery or I.V.F., but now days, tubal recanalization also plays an important role in the management of proximal tubal occlusion.In patients with documented tubal disease, options for management includes.Expectant managementMicrosurgeryI.V.F.Until recently, the management of proximal tubal obstruction was the domain of either microsurgery or I.V.F.Since microsurgery was technically very difficult and did not yield good results. So PTO's were frequently referred for I.V.F.Now day's Proximal tube recanalisation (PTR) with catheters or guidewires has gained wide application in treatment and diagnosis of proximal tube obstruction Proximal tube recanalisation is a non invasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of proximal tubal obstruction.Now IVF is required only in cases where the tubal mucosa is severely damaged and the obstruction is distal eg.Poor mucosal healthObi iterative fibrosisDistal tube obstructionBipolar tube damage The safety, efficacy. noninvasiveness reduced risk, costs and morbidity and encouraging results with fallopian tube recansalisation in the treatment and evaluation of proximal tubal obstruction makes them an excellent alternative to surgical invasive procedure and should be offered as the initial treatment in all patients with PTO.Hysteroscopy and LaparoscopyHysteroscopic tubal catherization in patients with PTO can be used both as a diagnostic and considerably effective therapeutic method.With laparoscopy, the hysteroscopic approach enables tubales cannulation and evaluation of the entire pelvic.Treatment of additional problems affecting the fallopian tubes particularly adhesion and endometriosis is possible.While laparoscopy helps monitor the procedure and visual assessment of tubal patency, the ability to observe theUTJ's directly by hysteroscopy provides an excellent approach for tubal cannulation.Laparoscopic hysteroscopic tubal cannulation with or without guidewire cannulation has yielded an average recanalization success rate as high as 39%.Combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopic cannulation is a patients with proximal tubal obstruction.",A

Which of the following parameters are not increased during pregnancy :,Vital capacity,Blood volume,Extracellular fluid,Weight,"RESPIRATORY SYSTEM: With the enlargement of the uterus, specially in the later months, there is elevation of the diaphragm by 4 cm. Total lung capacity is reduced by 5% due to this elevation. Diaphragmatic excursion is increased by 1-2 cm and breathing becomes diaphragmatic. Total pulmonary resistance is reduced due to progesterone effect. The subcostal angle increases from 68deg to 103deg, the transverse diameter of the chest expands by 2 cm and the chest circumference increases by 5-7 cm. The mucosa of the nasopharynx becomes hyperemic and edematous. This may cause nasal stuffiness and rarely epistaxis. Hyperventilation occurs during pregnancy leading to increase in tidal volume and therefore respiratory minute volume by 40%. It is probably due to progesterone acting on the respiratory center and also to increase in sensitivity of the center to carbon dioxide. The woman feels shoness of breath.

So pain and tenderness may not be located in the right iliac fossa, (d) Diagnosis is often confused with disturbed ectopic pregnancy, pyelonephritis, twisted ovarian cyst, abruption placenta and red degeneration of afibroid.Effect of appendicitis on pregnancy- may lead to abortion, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality and maternal mortality.Effect of pregnancy on appendicitis is not so good. This is because of (a) late diagnosis, (b) failure of localization due to displacement of the position and as such (c) peritonitis is more common, specially, in last trimester.Treatment consists of laparotomy at the earliest opportunity. Once the diagnosis is suspected it is better to operate rather than to wait until generalised peritonitis has developed. The incision should be made at the point of maximum tenderness. For the approach to the site, evacuation of the uterus may be required",A
Which of the following is the causative organism for formation of Baholin cyst?,Candida,Anaerobes,Neissea,Trichomonas,"Baholin's glands (great vestibular glands) are located at the vaginal orifice at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions. Their ducts are lined with transitional epithelium and their obstruction secondary to inflammation may lead to the development of a Baholin's cyst or abscess. Baholin's cysts range in size from 1 to 3 cm. Infections are often polymicrobial; however, sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are sometimes implicated. Treatment consists of incision and drainage and placement of a Word catheter, a small catheter with a balloon tip, for 2 to 3 weeks to allow for formation and epithelialization of a new duct.

Commonest presentation of sickle cell anemia ?,Priapism,Bone pain,Fever,Splenomegaly,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Bone pain Clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia o The clinical manifestations of sickle cell anemia are - 1. Chronic hemolysis Irreversible sickle cells have rigid, nondeformable cell membranes that lead to difficulty in negotiating the splenic sinusoids, sequestration, and rapid phagocytosis. This results in extra-vascular hemolysis. Some intravascular hemolysis may also occur because of increased mechanical fragility of severely damaged cells. 2. Vasoocclusive symptoms Reversible sickle cells express higher than normal levels of adhesion molecules and are abnormally sticky that is responsible for occlusion of microcirculation especially of bones, lungs, spleen and penis. Vasoocclusive symptoms are the most common manifestations of sickle cell anemia. They commonly manifest as - i) Painful bone crisis ii) Hand-foot syndrome Dactylitis of bones of hands/feet. iii) Autosplenectomy --> Predisposes to infection by encapsulated bacteria. iv) Acute chest syndrome v) Sequestration crisis Acute painful enlargement of spleen. vi) Aplastic crisis ----> due infection by parvovirus - B19 vii) CNS symptoms Seizure, stroke viii) Priapism and infarction of penis ix) Leg ulcers Remember o Sickle cell trait (heterozygous state) is almost always asymptomatic and the only significant manifestation is the renal concentrating defect presenting with isothenuria.",B

Turners syndrome is maximally associated with,Horseshoe kidney,Coarctation of aoa,VSD,ASD,"Turner syndrome (TS or monosomy X) is a genetic disorder that occurs in girls. It causes many traits and problems. Girls with TS are shoer than most girls. They don't go through normal pubey as they grow into adulthood. They may also have other health problems such as hea or kidney problems. The seriousness of these problems varies from girl to girl. Many of the health problems affecting girls with Turner syndrome can be managed or fixed with treatment. Turner syndrome is rare. It occurs in about 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 girl babies. There are 2 types of Turner syndrome: monosomy X TS and mosaic TS. About half of all girls with Turner syndrome have a monosomy disorder. Monosomy means that a person is missing one chromosome in the pair. Instead of 46 chromosomes, the person has only 45 chromosomes. This means a girl with TS has only one X chromosome in her 23rd pair. Sometimes an error occurs when an egg or sperm cell is forming. This causes it to have a missing sex chromosome. But it is often an error that happened by chance when the father&;s sperm cell was forming. The missing sex chromosome error can occur in either the mother&;s egg cell or the father&;s sperm cell. Girls with TS often have: Puffy hands and feet at bih Wide neck with folds of skin down the sides of neck (webbed neck) Sho height A low hairline at the back of the neck Feeding problems as a baby Small differences in the shape and position of the ears Broad chest with widely spaced nipples More small brown moles (nevi) on the skin than normal Deep-set nails Small jaw Narrow top of the inside of the mouth Skeletal problems Eye problems requiring glasses Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",B

AChE in amniotic fluid can also be seen in cases of ventral wall defect, fetal demise (including demise of a co-twin) and massive fetal blood contamination. When AChE is detected, the ratio of AChE to pseudocholinesterase (PChE), a non-specific cholinesterase normally found in amniotic fluid, may help distinguish open neural tube defects from open ventral wall defects. The levels of AChE are higher in open NTD than ventral wall defects. Ratio greater than 0.15 - open spna bifida Ratio less than 0.10 - ventral wall defect",B

A 23-year-old G1P0woman at 10 weeks' gestation presents to the obstetrics clinic for her initial evaluation. She says she has been hospitalized several times for asthma exacerbations but has never required intubation or admission to an intensive care unit. She is controlled on daily inhaled corticosteroids and albuterol with adequate relief of her symptoms. She is concerned about taking these medications now that she is pregnant.Which of the following is true regarding asthma medications in pregnancy:,B2 agonist are contraindicated during pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both contraindicated in pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are safe in pregnancy,B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both safe in pregnancy but during 2nd and 3rd trimester only,"Asthma in Pregnancy – Important Points:

Asthma is the most common chronic condition in pregnancy and affects 3–12% of gestations.
Effects of pregnancy on asthma: The course of the disease is very much unpredictable. In about 20%, the condition improves, in 30%, it deteriorates and in 50%, it remains unchanged.
It is more likely to deteriorate in women with severe asthma.
Exacerbations are most frequent between 24 to 36 weeks gestation and are most commonly precipitated by viral respiratory infections and non compliance with inhaled corticosteroid regimens.
Because asthma exacerbation can be severe, they should be treated aggressively in pregnancy.
Effects of asthma on pregnancy: Preterm labor PROM, preeclampsia, LBW baby and slight increase in abruptio placenta.
Severity of asthma correlates with FEV1 and PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) FEV1 ideally is > 80% of the predicted value and PEFR FEV1 less than 1L or less than 20% of predicted value, correlates with severe disease.

Management of Asthma in Pregnancy:

Mild asthma: Inhaled beta agonist (albuterol preferred because of more human data on safety in pregnancy).
Mild persistent: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide preferred).
Moderate: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids and long acting b agonist (Salmetrol preferred).
Severe: High dose inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist and oral steroids if needed.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis

Medical treatment of NEC include
Cessation of feeding
Nasogastric decompression
Administration of i.v. fluids
Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture).
Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia.
Early surgery consultation

Surgical interventions in NEC

Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel.
Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diversion.
Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required.
Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement.
A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS.

From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because:

Patients are on a ventilator (too unstable).
Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options.
Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",D

"Which of the following statements is true regarding spermicides found in vaginal foams, creams, and suppositories?",The active agent in these spermicides is nonoxynol-9,The active agent in these spermicides is levonorgestrel,Effectiveness is higher in younger users,Effectiveness is higher than that of the diaphragm,"All spermicides contain an ingredient, usually nonoxynol-9, that immobilizes or kills sperm on contact. Spermicides provide a mechanical barrier and need to be placed into the vagina before each coital act. Their effectiveness increases with increasing age of the women who use them, probably due to increased motivation. The effectiveness of spermicides is similar to that of the diaphragm, and increases with the concomitant use of condoms.

"A 19-year-old female comes to the physician because of left lower quadrant pain for 2 months. She states that she first noticed the pain 2 months ago but now it seems to be growing worse. She has had no changes in bowel or bladder function. She has no fevers or chills and no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The pain is intermittent and sometimes feels like a dull pressure. Pelvic examination is significant for a left adnexal mass that is mildly tender. Urine hCG is negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 6 cm complex left adnexal mass with features consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Repeat pelvic examination in 1 year,Repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weeks,Prescribe the oral contraceptive pill,Perform Laparotomy,"This patient has a presentation and findings that are most consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Dermoids are a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Germ cell tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasm in females under the age of 20 and dermoids are the most common benign ovarian neoplasm.Dermoids can range in size from small masses that are noted ncidentally on ultrasound and cause no symptoms, to large cysts that cause pain and pressure, as this patient has. Laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because, as adnexal masses enlarge--especially when they become greater than 5 cm--the risk of ovarian torsion increases. Thus, laparotomy withremoval of the dermoid is indicated to prevent torsion. Also, this patient's mass is causing her symptoms of pain and pressure and, on that basis, should be removeD. Finally, while the mass most likely is a dermoid, this is not ceain without pathologic diagnosis and, therefore, the cyst should be removed and evaluated by a pathologist. At the time of surgery, close examination should be made of the other ovary because dermoids may be found bilaterally in more than 10% of cases. To repeat pelvic examination in 1 year (Choice A)would not be correct management. This patient is symptomatic with a 6 cm ovarian mass that is at risk for torsion. She should, therefore, be managed surgically. To repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weekschoice B. is appropriate for some adnexal masses. For example, in a young woman with a small complex cyst that appears consistent with a corpus luteum, it may be most prudent to recheck an ultrasound in 6 weeks to see if the cyst has resolveD. This patient, however, is symptomatic with a 6 cm cyst that appears to be adermoid, which will not resolve spontaneously. She, therefore, requires surgery. To prescribe the oral contraceptive pill (Choice C) may help to prevent future ovarian cysts but it will not resolve this cyst, which requires surgical management.",D

Fortunately the malignancy is well-differentiated with good prognosis* Chronic non ovulatory cycle as seen in DUB* In some families, a strong familial predispotion is noticed. This may be due to genetic or dietic habits such as animal protein and fat. The oestrone is derived by peripherlal aromatization in the fat tissue from androstenedione and contributes to high level of oestrogen. Women with familial Lynch II syndrome suffering from anorectal and breast cancer are also likely to suffer from endometrial cancer* Tamoxifen given to women with breast cancer increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer to 2- 3 folds* Combined oral hormonal pills have protective effect and reduce its risk by 40-50% and also adding progestogens for 12 days each cycle to oestrogen in HRT reduces its risks to 20%**** Obesity, hypertension and diabetes characterize this cancer in 30%* Infertile women and women with PCOS on account of non-ovulation have high oestrogen.

“Steroid treatment is contraindicated in presence of overt infection.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 220
Steroid therapy in preterm labour:

Steroids are recommended for all women in preterm labour before 32 weeks with or without membrane ruptures in whom there is no evidence of chorioamnionitis. According to ACOG, single dose steroid injection is recommended between 24 to 32 weeks. There is no concensus regarding treatment between 32-34 weeks. Corticosteroid therapy is not recommended before 24 weeks.

Advantage:

Steroids reduce the rate of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in the newborn.
The effect of treatment is maximal between 24 hours of the first dose and uptil 7 days.
Earlier it was recommended to give repeated doses weekly till the patient delivers but this practice is associated with significant fetal and neonatal side effects like cerebral palsy and should be abandoned.
Betamethasone is the steroid of choice as it also prevents periventricular leukomalacia although dexamethasone can also be used.

HRT is useful in all except,Flushing,Osteoporosis,Vaginal atrophy,Coronary heart disease,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Coronary artery disease HRT refers to the use of oestrogen treatment in order to reverse or prevent problems due to the loss of ovarian hormone secretion after the menopause, whether physiological or induced.The tissues sensitive to estrogen include brain, bone, skin cardiovascular and genitourinary tissues.Consequently the two aims of hormone replacement therapy are:To reduce the everyday symptoms of oestrogen loss; hot flushes, sleeplessness, lethargy, depression and vaginal dryness. All types of HRT (oestrogen with or without progesterone) are effective in reducing the hot flushes experienced by more than 50% of postmenopausal women.The benefit is most during the first year of treatment when 80% of women report a reduced likelihood of flushes.The other major use from HRT is the relief of vaginal dryness.Vaginal administration is the most effective route for treatment of dyspareunia and related symptoms.To prevent fracturesEstrogen prevents osteoporotic fracturesEffect of HRT on coronary artery diseaseUntil recently it was believed that beneficial effect of estrogen on lipids, decrease the risk of coronary artery disease in women on hormone replacement therapy.However two recent landmark clinical trials ""Heart and Estrogen progestin replacement study (HERS)"" and ""women health initiative (WHI)"" have radically altered the approach of HRT.* According to these trials, the benefits and harms of these therapy are:",D

• It is due to persistent corpus luteum due to incomplete withdrawl of LH even on 26 day of cycle. The CL continues to secret progesterone
• Menstruation comes on time, is prolonged but not heavy. Slight bleeding continues intermittently for several days after proper flow.
• D & C done on 5-6th of cycle - endometrial tissue shows presence of progestational changes (proliferative endometrium) along with secretory endometrium.
Pregnanediol is found in urine during menstruation.
• Treatment - spontaneous cure or NSAIDs for 6 months.
Also know-Irregular ripening of corpus luteum
• It is due to poor formation and function of corpus luteum.
• The endometrium is without adequate hormonal support, so slight losses or spotting occur for many days before the proper flow starts.
Diagnosis: 
• Serum progesterone <5 ng/mL (or urinary pregnanediol <3 mg) in luteal phase.
• Endometrial study prior to or soon after spotting reveals patchy areas of secretory changes amidst proliferative endometrium.
Management: Administration of progestogens in premenstrual phase.",A
The following statements are true of patent ductus arteriosus(PDA) except – a) Spontaneous closure occurs in some term infantsb) Pulmonary hypertension developsc) Bacterial endocarditis is more frequent with small PDAd) Recurrent chest infection and congestive failure may develope) Anatomic existence of PDA is an indication for surgery,a,b,ae,ad,"Spontaneous closure of PDA
1) In premature infants

In premature infants, spontaneous closure of PDA may occur because in these infants PDA is due to unresponsiveness to oxygen and there is no structural abnormality.

2) In Full-term infants

Unlike that in premature infants, spontaneous closure of a PDA does not usually occur in full-term infants.
This is because the PDA in term infants results from a structural abnormality of the ductal smooth muscle.

Clinical manifestations of PIA

Patient may be asymptomatic
Symptoms develop early and CHF may develop at 6 to 8th weeks of age.
Common symptoms → Dysnea on exertion, palpitation and frequent chest infections.

Signs

Tachypnea & Tachycardia
Bounding pulse with wide pulse pressure (with elevated systolic and lower diastolic pressure).
Hyperkinetic cardiac impulse
Systolic or continuous thrill.
Accentuated S1
The narrow or paradoxical split of S2 (But it may be masked by continuous murmur since the maximum intensity of continuous murmur occurs at S2).
Continuous (machinery) murmur → Murmur starts after S and reaches the peak at S2. It then diminishes and is audible only during a part of the diastole. Murmur is best heard at second left intercostal space and is also heard below left clavicle.

"The behaviour therapeutic falls in management of enuresis, The pharmacological drug of choice for this case in",Phenytoin,Diazepalm,Imipramine,Alprax,"Enuresis Defined as normal, complete evacuation of the bladder at a wrong place and time at least twice a month after 5 year of age. More than 85% children attain complete diurnal and nocturnal control by 5 years of age. Enuresis is primary when the child has never been dry and secondary when bed wetting stas after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night. It is said to be monosymptomatic if not accompanied by any lower urinary tract infection and nocturnal if it occurs during sleep. It has to be differentiated from continuous or intermittent incontinence or dribbling.The bed is usually soaking wet in enuresis, compared to incontinence in which there is loss of urine without normal emptying of bladder. ETIOLOGY:- 1. Maturation delay is most likely cause. 2. Anxiety producing episodes during the 2 nd to 5 th years, the time for development of nocturnal bladder control, are associated with increased risk of enuresis. 3. Lack of circadian rhythm of ADH or impaired response of kidneys to ADH. 4. Secondary enuresis can be precipitated by acute stressful condition or traumatic experience. Bladder irritability due to urinary tract infection or severe constipation with the full rectum impinging on the bladder can cause enuresis. 5. Conditions causing polyuria, spina bifida, ectopic ureter and giggle and stress incontinence are other causes. Treatment:- General advice given to all enurectic children but active treatment need not begin before 6 years of age. Caffeinated drinks like tea , coffee, sodas should be avoided in evening. Adequate fluid intake during day as 40% in morning, 40% in afternoon and 20% in evening is recommended. First line of treatment is usually non pharmacological, comprising motivational therapy and use of alarm devices. Motivational therapy:- Successful in curing enuresis upto 25%. The child is reassured and provided emotional suppo.Every attempt is made to remove any feeling of guilt. The child is encouraged to assume active responsibility, including keeping a dry night diary, voiding urine before going to bed, and changing wet clothes and bedding. Dry nights should be credited with praise.punishments and angry parenteral response should be avoided. Child is encouraged both to void frequently enough to avoid urgency and daytime incontinence and to have daily bowel movement. Alarm therapy: Involves the use of device to elicit a conditioned response of awakening to the sensation of full bladder. Best used afteemr seven years if age. Successful in two third cases without much recurrence. The alarm device consists of a small sensor attached to child&;s underwear or a mat under the bed sheet and an alarm attached to the childs collar or at bedside. When the child stas wetting, sensors are activated thus causing the alarm to ring. Pharmacotherapy:- Used if enuresis persists despite alarm therapy, regular voiding habits, exclusion or treatment of constipation, exclusion of post voidal residual urine. Imipramine works by aleing the arousal sleep mechanism. It gives satisfactory initial response at dise of 1-2.5 mg/ kg/ day. Relapse rate after discontinuation of therapy seen. Cardiac arrythmia is a serious adverse effect. Anticholinergic drugs reduce uninhibited bladder contractions and are useful in children who have significant daytime urge incontinence besides nocturnal enuresis. Usual dose is 5 mg for oxybutynin, 2 mg for tolterodine. Desmopressin works by reducing volume of urine. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

Which is true regarding retroveed uterus :,Causes menorrhagia,Associated with endometriosis,It is a cause of infeility,All,"Ans. is a, b and c i.e. Associated with endometriosis; It is a cause of infeility; Causes menorrhagia; and Associated with PID The usual position of the uterus is one of anteversion and anteflexion, in which the body of the uterus is bent forward at its junction with cervix. Retroversion is a condition in which axis of cervix is directed upward and backward (instead of forward). Causes Seen in 20% of patients Mobile retroversion Fixed retroversion Retroversion can never be * Prolapse * PID congenital (it is always developmental) * Puerperium * Pelvic tumors malformation as the uterus is without * Fibroid * Chocolate cyst of ovary version and flexion at bih. * Ovarian cyst * Pelvic endometriosis (pushes uterus backward) Symptoms : Mobile retroversion is usually symptomless, main disadvantage being increased risk of perforation of the uterus at the time of instrumentation. Symptoms which can be seen are : Spasmodic dysmenorrheadeg Pelvic congestion syndrome causing : - Congestive dysmenorrhea - Polymenorrhagia - Premenstrual low backache - Dyspareunia (it is the most specific and genuine complain in case of retroversion) - Leucorrhoea Infeility as cervix is directed forward away from the seminal pool and the ejaculation of semen directly into the external os. Aboion : can cause aboion between 10th to 14th week. Treatment : If retroversion is mobile no treatment is required.

A 29-day old child presents with features of congestive cardiac failure and left ventricular hyperophy. Auscultation shows a sho systolic murmur. Most likely diagnosis is:,Rheumatic fever,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition of great aeries,Ventricular septal defect,"Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great aeries are cyanotic hea diseases and rheumatic fever will not occur in this age group. So the answer is ventricular septal defect. When the effective area of the defect is large, there is viually no resistance to flow, and systemic systolic pressure is present in the right ventricle and the pulmonary aery. At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, with little if any left-to-right shunt, despite the presence of a large defect. This resistance gradually falls over the first few weeks of life, permitting a progressively greater amount of blood to flow through the defect, to the pulmonary aeries and back to the left atrium and left ventricle. In many infants, the left ventricular volume overload eventually leads to left ventricular ""failure,"" with elevated left ventricular end-diastolic and left atrial pressures and pulmonary congestion. With a large VSD and a high pulmonary vascular resistance, the systolic murmur becomes soft and sho because there is little left-to-right shunt across a large defect, and a right-to-left shunt across the VSD causes little or no murmur.

"True about hCG :a) α subunit identical to LH, FSH and TSHb) Causes involution of corpus luteumc) Doubles in 7-10 daysd) Max. level seen at 60-70 days of gestatione) Detected in serum and urine 8-9 days after ovulation.",b,ad,ac,ab,"hCG

hCG is a glycoprotein
It is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta.
hCG has 2 subunits :

– α - biologically similar in LH, FSH and TSH. (i.e nonspecific)
– β subunit - unique to hCG. (i.e specific)

Structurally it is similar to - FSH, LH, TSH but functionally it is similar to LH ( i.e luteotropic), i.e. helps in maintaining corpus luteum. So, the main hormone which maintains activity of corpus luteum during pregnancy is hCG and in non pregnant state is LH.
The half life of hCG is 36 hours.
In early pregnancy the doubling time of hCG is 1.4-2 days.
It can be detected in maternal serum as early as 8 days following fertilisation/day 22 of menstrual cycle/5 days before missed period by immuno assay.
The level is 100 IU/L or mIU/mL around the time of the expected menses.
The levels progressively rise and reach maximum levels by about 8-10 weeks/70 days/1st trimester. It then falls until about 16 weeks and remains at low level up to term.
hCG disappears from circulation by 2 weeks following delivery.

Action:

Sustains the corpus luteum and thereby maintains the hormonal support to the pregnancy in early weeks.
Stimulates the Leydig cells of the male fetus to produce testosterone and thereby induces development of the male external genitalia.
Immunosuppressive action which helps in the maintenance of pregnancy.

Note: In 19, I have not included option ‘c’ as correct answer, i.e. detected in serum and urine 8-9 days after ovulation
because it is detected in serum 8-9 days after ovulation but not in urine.

In addition to hea rate, afterload, and cardiac contractility, preload determines cardiac output. In children, the most common cause of decreased preload is hypovolemia, usually from vomiting and diarrhea. Distributive shock secondary to sepsis, neurogenic spinal shock, or anaphylaxis is a less common cause of preload reduction. Acute anemia may also be associated with decreased preload. Congestive hea failure is a frequent complication in children with congenital hea disease. Increased preload results in elevation of left atrial pressure leading to pulmonary edema and decreased oxygenation. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",B

A patient in shock diagnosed of having ectopic pregnancy in right fallopian tube. The cause of fetal death in ectopic pregnancy is postulated as:,Vascular accident,Nutritional adequacy,Endocrine insufficiency,Immune response of mother,"Lack of a submucosal layer within the fallopian tube provides easy access for the feilized ovum to burrow through the epithelium and allow implantation within the muscular wall. As the rapidly proliferating trophoblasts erode the subjacent muscularis layer, maternal blood pours into the spaces within the trophoblastic or the adjacent tissue. The fallopian tube cannot sustain the growing pregnancy. This causes rupture and bleeding which expels the implantation out of the tubal end as tubal aboion.

Coming back to question -

The newborn baby in this question is preterm neonate (born before 37 weeks).
Diaphragmatic hernia may occur in term or preterm infants and may present as respiratory distress soon after birth.
Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is a disease of preterm neonates and present as respiratory distress during first 6 hours of life.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) occurs most commonly in neonate of HMD who have been treated with oxygen and positive pressure ventilation ---> Instead of showing improvement on 3rd-4th day, some infants of HMD develop an increased need of oxygen and ventilatory support. So, BPD is not a differential diagnosis of respiratory distress at 2-3 hours after birth.",D

The best treatment is,Marsupilisation,Incision and drainage,Surgical resection,Aspiration,"Ans. is a i.e. Marsupilisation Fluctuant non tender swelling at the introitus suggests a diagnosis of baholins cyst. Baholins cyst 7 It is the commonest cyst of vulva. Baholins cyst are produced from accumulation of secretions of Baholins gland. The cyst may develop either in the duct (more common) or in the gland Aetiology : cyst formation occurs due to the obstruction of the main duct or opening of an acinus. The cause of obstruction is usually fibrosis which follows either infection or trauma. It was formerly believed that the infection was invarialy gonococcal but almost any orgnaism can be responsible. Left Baholins gland is more often affected than the right. Presentation : Usually presents as a unilateral swelling that bulges across the vaginal introitus. Size of the cyst rarely exceeds hens egg. Swelling is present characteristically on the inner side of the junction of the anterior 2/3rd with posterior 1/3rd of the labium majus. The swelling is fluctuant and usually non tender. May present with discomfo, dyspareunia or infection. Treatment of choice is Marsupialization : Marsupialization is the gratifying surgery for Baholins cyst.

Which of the following is true about patent ductus arteriosus?,Indomethacin is used in medical management,It is congenital cyanotic heart disease,There is a patent connection between the aorta and pulmonary veins,Mid diastolic murmur is heard,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Indomethacin is used in medical management Patent ductus arteriosuso Patent ductus arteriosus is a communication between the pulmonary artery and aorta. The ductus arteriosus is present in fetal life which connects pulmonary trunk to aorta. It closes functionally and anatomically soon after birth.o 'Functional closure1 takes place within 15 hours of birth. rAnatomic closure' of ductus arteriosus occurs 10-21 days after birth.o Prostaglandins maintain the patency of ductus. The persistence of function of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate, i.e. if functional closure does not take place in 24 hours after birth, it is considered as PDA.o The aortic attachment of ductus arteriosus is just distal to subclavian artery. PDA is more common in females than in males.Hemodynamics of PDAo In PDA blood flows from aorta to pulmonary artery because aortic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery pressure - Left to right shunt.o Pressure gradient between aorta and pulmonary artery is maintained throughout the cardiac cycle (during systole and diastole) - Continous murmur, i.e., murmur starts in systole after S1 and reaches a peak at S2. It then diminishes and audible only a part of diastole.o Larger blood volume passes through pulmonary circulation (blood from right side of heart plus some blood from aorta) - Pulmonary plethora which may cause pulmonary hypertension,o Increased flow after passing through lung reaches the left atrium and causes volume overload - Left atrial dilatation and hypertrophy.o Increased blood volume passes from left atrium to left ventricle through mitral valve, i.e., increased flow through mitral valve - Accentuation of SI and delayed diastolic murmur.o Left ventricle recieves larger amount of blood that results in volume overload. Left ventricle enlargemento Extra volume passes through aortic area cause delayed closure of aortic valve which may close even after pulmonary valve (normal pulmonary valves close after aortic valves). - Paradoxical spliting of S2, i.e., A2 occurs after P2 (Normally A2 occurs before P2).o Large left ventricular volume ejected into the aorta results in dilatation of the ascending aorta. Aortic ejectionclick.o Large volume of blood passes through normal aortic valve Aortic ejection systolic murmur (but it is masked by continuous murmur).Clinical manifestations of PDAo Patient may be asymptomatico Symptoms develop early and CHF may develop at 6 to 8th weeks of age.o Common symptoms - Dysnea on exertion, palpitation and frequent chest infections.Signso Tachypnea & Tachycardiao Bounding pulse with wide pulse pressure (with elevated systolic and lower diastolic pressure)o Hyperkinetic cardiac impulseo Systolic or continuous thrillo Accentuated S1o Narrow or paradoxical split of S2 (But it may be masked by continuous murmur since maximum intensity of continuous murmur occurs at S2).o Continous (machinery) murmur - Murmur starts after SI and reaches the peak at S2. It then diminishes and is audible only during a part of the diastole. Murmur is best heard at second left intercostal space and is also heard below left clavicle.o S3 may occur at apex followed by a delayed diastolic murmur.Management of PDAo NSAIDs (most commonly indomethacin) are used to induce closure of PDA, as these drugs inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins (Prostaglanding are involved in maintainance of patency of ductus arteriosus).o If indomethacin is not successful and the ductus remains hemodynamically significant, surgical ligation with or without division of ductus should be performed.",A

Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 97, p 260, 51Friends, It is a tricky question which needs only common sense. Answer is hidden in the question itself. So, lets read the question once again and rule out each option one by one.The lady in our question is of 150 cm height ( 5 feet).""While an arbitrary measurement of 5 ft. is considered as short stature in western countries, it is 4' 7"" in India considered the low average height"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 98So, the lady is not constitutionally small, i.e. options 'b' is ruled out.Her Hb is 11 gm%.""According to the standards laid down by WHO. anemia in pregnancy is present when the hemoglobin concentration in the peripheral blood is 11gm% or less"". --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 262So, according to the WHO standard 11gm% is borderline for anemia.Anemia leads to IUGR when it is moderately severe i.e. Hb<8 gm% or if it is sickle cell anemia (Fernando arias, 3/e, p 41)So, option 'e' is ruled out.Her BP is 160/110 mm HgHypertension is an absolute rise of BP of at least 140/90 mm Hg, if the previous BP is not known. So, there is no doubt that the patient is hypertensive.Prolonged hypertension leads to placental insufficiency which ultimately results in IUGR.So, option 'c' is correct.Her weight gain is 12 kg.""Ideally weight gain should depend on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) level. Weight gain for a woman with normal BMI (20-26) is 11 to 16 kg"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 51So, the weight gain comes under normal range, option 'd' ruled out.Though maternal infection during pregnancy also causes IUGR, here in our question no such history has been mentioned.So, option 'a' is also ruled out.

Mechanism of action of Clomiphene citrate used for infeility:-,Block estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus,Negative feedback on HPO axis,Direct action on ovarian primordial follicles,Increase in tubal motility,"The ability of Clomiphene citrate (CC) to initiate an ovulatory sequence is primarily due to its ability to be recognized by and interact with the estrogen receptors in hypothalamus. In its capacity as an Estrogen antagonist,CC displaces endogenous estrogen from hypothalamic estrogen receptor sites and hence inhibiting the negative feedback of the endogenous estrogen on the hypothalamus (Reproductive Medicine & Surgery, Wallach and Zacur, Mosby '95). In simple terms, there is non recognition of the body's estrogens by the hypothalamus due to the blockade of estrogens receptors by CC and hence the hypothalamus directs the pituitary to make more of FSH which in turn drives the ovary to make a follicle to make estrogens.The development of follicle is the preceeding event before ovulation.",A

To say twin discordance the differences in the two twins should be :,15% with the larger twin as index,15% with the smaller twin as index25% with the,25% with the larger twin as index,25% with the smaller twin as index,"Ans. is c i.e. 25% with the larger twin as index Unequal sizes of twin fetuses with a difference of 25% (larger twin being used as the index), is called as Discordant growth. It is a sign of pathological growth restriction in the smaller fetus. As the weight difference within a twin pair increases and the earlier the growth discordance is evident, perinatal moality increases. Most common cause of discordance : In dichorionic twins - unequal placental mass. mr,nochnrinnic ftviriS - Twin - twin transfusion syndrome/Genetic syndrome Hazards of discordant growth. The smaller fetus is at increased risk of perinatal moality due to : Respiratory distress Intra ventricular hemorrhage - Seizure Sepsis - Periventricular leukomalacia Necrotising enterocolitis At a difference of more than 30% - Risk of fetal death increases.

Most common cause of platelet.L in pregnancy :,Immune,Incidental,Idiopathic,Benign Gestational,"Ans. is d i.e. Benign Gestational Gestational thrombocytopenia / Benign Gestational Thrombocytopenia It is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia accounting for 80-90% of all cases of thrombocytopenia occuring during pregnancy. Exact cause is not known (may be due to hemodilution and increased platelet consumption.) Platelet count is rarely <70,000/mm3. Women are asymptomatic and their is no H/O bleeding. Condition is benign and has no risk to mother or infant. The only problem associated with it is - that anaesthesiologists are reluctant to give epidural or spinal anaesthesia if platelet count is < 1lakh/mm3. Treatment with steroids and IgG or platelet transfusion before delivery is sometimes necessary.

Intraperitoneal volume capacity varies significantly between individuals. Most prefer to insufflate to 25 to 30 mm Hg for positioning the cannulas. This means that enough CO2 is insufflated to increase the pressure of the system to 25-30 mm hg with which there is extra volume and enough counter pressure against the peritoneum, facilitating introduction of the cannula and potentially reducing the chance of bowel or posterior abdominal wall and vessel trauma. After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 15 mm Hg, essentially eliminates hypercarbia or decreased venous return of blood to the hea 10-15 is essentially the 'Working pressures' in laparoscopic surgery.",A

It can be done : Per abdomen : A wide bore needle is inseed the maternal abdomen into the fetal head after emptying the bladder. The transabdominal approach is used successfully in both cephalic and breech presentation. ii. Per vaginal : With cephalic presentation, as soon as the cervix is dilated upto 3 - 4cm , ventricles are tapped trans vaginally with a wide bore needle. With breech presentation labour is allowed to progress upto delivery of trunk and shoulders. The needle is inseed transvaginally just below the anterior vaginal wall and into the aftercoming head through the widened suture line. Cesarean Section : recommends all hydrocephalic fetuses should be delivered abdominally, whereas the use of cephalocentesis should be limited to fetuses with severe associated abnormalities. Craniotomy is recommended if the obstetrician is well versed with the technique and is applicable for the forecoming (veex) and the after coming head (breech) in case of hydrocephalus if fetus is dead. Note: In a hydrocephalic fetus if BPD is < 10 cm or if head circumference is < 36 cms, vaginal delivery may be permitted.",D

Procidentia : all of the uterus outside the introitus. Utero vaginal Prolapse : It is the commonest type of prolapse. Cystocoele occurs first followed by traction on the cervix causing retroversion of the uterus and then uterus is pushed into the vagina. Vault prolapse : it follows vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, symptoms are-coital difficulty and difficulty in walking. Congenital Prolapse : There is no cystocoele. ""Data from Women's Health Initiative revealed anterior pelvic organ prolapse in 34.3%, posterior wall prolapse in 18.6% and uterine prolapse in 14.3% of women in the study."" Therefore, from the above data it is clear that cystocele (anterior organ prolapse) is the most common type of prolapse.

Hind milk is richer in -,Carbohydrate,Protein,Fat,Minerals,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Fat o The composition of breastmilk varies at different stages after bih to suit the needs of the baby. o According to the postnatal period the breast milk is divided into - 1. Clostrum Is the milk secreted during the first three days after delivery. It is yellow and thick. It contains more antibodies and cells and high amounts of vitamins A,D,E and K. 2. Transitional milk Is secreted during the following two weeks (after clostrum). The immunoglobulin and protein content decreases while the fat and sugar content increases. 3. Mature milk Follows transitional milk. It is thin and watery but contains all the nutrients essential for optimal growth of the body. o According to feed the breast milk is divided into ? 1. Fore milk It is watery and is rich in protein, sugar, vitamins, minerals and water that satisfy the baby's thirst. 2. Hind milk Comes towards the end of feed Rich in fat content and provides more energy, and satisfies the baby's hunger. o The milk of mother who delivers prematurely differs from the milk of a mother who delivers at term - Preterm milk Contains more protein S, sodium, iron, immunoglobins and calories as they are needed by the preterm baby.",C

Which is the COMMONEST type of seizure in newborn?,Clonic,Tonic,Myoclonic,Subtle,"Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Neonatal seizures: Usual onset at 12-48 hours. Seizure types include subtle (characterized by variable findings), tonic, and multifocal clonic. Most common causes include hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, intracranial bleeds, and infection. Most common type of seizures is newborn are subtle seizures and they constitute 50% of all seizures. Subtle seizures are usually mild paroxysmal alterations in motor behaviour or autonomic function that are not clearly clonic, tonic or myoclonic. Newborns rarely have well-organized tonic-clonic seizures because of their incomplete coical organization and a preponderance of inhibitory synapses. The most common type of seizure is characterized by a constellation of findings, including horizontal detion of the eyes with or without jerking; eyelid blinking or fluttering; sucking, smacking, drooling, and other oral-buccal movements; swimming, rowing, or paddling movements; and apneic spells.

Genes MOST closely associated with familial cases of ovarian cancer are:,BRCA1,WT1,NF2,VHL,"Ans. A. BRCA1About 5-10% of cases of ovarian cancer develops in women who belong to a cancer family. In familial instances of ovarian cancers, the cancers tend to develop at a younger age, but are thought to possibly have, a barely better analysis as compared to isolated instances, on an average.Additionally, families with multiple instances of breast cancers caused due to genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have an increased prevalence of ovarian cancers.The BRCA1 mutation is particularly malicious and up to 30-40% of females having this mutation develop ovarian cancer. (Also, there are cases of families where women have a BRCA1 mutation, does not develop breast cancer, but develop ovarian cancer at an increased rate). Another cancer syndrome, the Lynch II syndrome (also termed as the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome), is also linked with ovarian cancer (and cancers of the breast, pancreas, uterus and stomach).In both the families i.e. breast cancer families and Lynch II families, the genetic pattern seen is usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. In most of the cases, where women who belong to cancer families, having age of 35 and have had their children are offered prophylactic oophorectomy.Note:* VHL is associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease, pheochromocytoma and renal cell carcinoma.* NF2 is associated with neurofibromatosis type II, meningiomas and acoustic neuromas.* WT1 is associated with Wilms tumor",A

Polyhydramnios not associated with,B/L renal agenesis,Anencephaly,Open spina bifida,Tracheo esophageal fistula,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. B/L renal agenesis Polyhydramnios is defined as a state where liquour amni exceeds 2000 ml.Amniotic fluid measures about 50 ml at 12 weeks, 400 ml at 20 weeks and reaches its peak of 1 litre at 36-38 weeks.There after the amount diminishes till at term it measures about 600-800 ml Amniotic fluid formation:- Early pregnancy - Ultrafiltrate of plasma Beginning of 2nd trimester - Composed largely of extracellular fluid that diffuses through the fetal skin. After 20 weeks - Cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and the amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.The fluid in the amniotic fluid is completely changed and replaced in every 3 hours.Causes of increase in amniotic fluid (Polyhydramnios)Because the fetus normally swallows the amniotic fluid and excretes it through urine it has been assumed that this mechanism is one of the ways by which the volume is controlled.Thus renal agenesis will lead to oligohydramnios not polyhydramnios.Anencephaly causes polyhydramnios because of transudation from exposed meninges and absence of fetal swallowing reflex.Open spina bifida leads to polyhydramnios because of transudation of meninges.Causes of polyhydramnios MaternalPh isoimmunisationDiabetes PlacentalPlacental chrioangiomaCircumvallate placenta syndrome FetalMultiple pregnancyFetal anomaliesCNS abnormalities (Anencephaly)G.L abnormalities (Oesophageal or duodenal atresia)G.

Best indicator of Ovarian reserve :,AMH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH Ratio,"None of the ovarian reserve tests currently in use are accurate predictors for pregnancy With current methods, basal FSH concentration is simplest and most widely used to test ovarian reserve. Levels greater than 10 IU/L (10-20 IU/L) have high specificity (80-100%) for predicting poor ovarian response to ovulation. Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4). Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test. AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0.2-0.7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).

Follow up in a patient of H mole is done by:,Serum Beta-HCG monitoring,Serum CEA level estimation,Serum amylase level,Serum a feto protein estimation,"The chances of persistent trophoblastic disease and choriocarcinoma are high after evacuation of H. mole therefore regular follow-up is mandatory.
“After molar evacuation, patients should be monitored with weekly determinations of β-subunit hCG levels until these levels are normal for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by monthly determinations until the levels are nomrmal for 6 consecutive months. The average time to achieve the first normal hCG level after evacuation is about 9 weeks. At the completion of follow-up, pregnancy may be undertaken. After a patient achieves a nondetectable hCG level, the risk of developing tumour relapse is very low and may approach zero.”

Physical examination of a baby boy shortly after birth reveals a large bladder and palpable kidneys. The nurses note that he produces a weak urinary stream. A voiding cystourethrogram is shown below. He appears to be otherwise normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Posterior urethral valve,Prune belly syndrome,Duplication of the collecting system,"(b) Source: (Hay et al, pp 678-679. Kliegman, pp 1845-1846. McMillan, pp 1824-1826. Rudolph, p 1743.) The findings described point to posterior urethral valves; the radiograph shows an area of obstruction and proximal dilatation of the bladder. The clinical picture of posterior valves ranges from that described in the question to severe renal obstruction with renal failure and pulmonary hypoplasia. UTIs are common complications in older children, and sepsis occasionally can be the presenting sign in afflicted newborns. Despite early recognition and correction of the obstruction, the prognosis in these children for normal renal function is guarded. Prenatal diagnosis is often accomplished because of widespread use of ultrasound. Ureteropelvic junction obstruction, a common urinary obstruction in children that results in isolated hydronephrosis, can be found either on a prenatal ultrasound or after birth when the child is noted to have a mass, pain, or infection. Serial ultrasounds of the kidney assist in following the associated hydronephrosis. Prune belly syndrome occurs almost exclusively in males; it is diagnosed in a child with absent abdominal muscular tone, undescended testes, and urinary tract anomalies including hydronephrosis and dilated ureters and bladder. Duplication of the collecting system is often asymptomatic, but can present with symptoms of obstruction and reflux. Horseshoe kidney is often an asymptomatic condition, and results when both kidneys are joined at the lower pole by a fibrous band of tissue or by renal parenchyma; symptoms may arise resulting from obstruction and/or reflux.",B

Mothers are advised to continue breastfeeding at frequent intervals Breastmilk jaundice is seen in about 2-4% of exclusively breastfed babies. There is significant unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia after the 7th day and may last for 2-3 weeks. This may be caused by the breast milk that might contain beta-glucoronidase, which deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption and other inhibitors of glucuronyl transferase. Persistently high bilirubin levels may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24-48 hours and/or treatment with phototherapy, without cessation of breastfeeding.

Diagnosis is,Ovarian Ca,Endometrioma,Tuberculosis,Borderline ovarian tumor,"Endometrioma Another clinical based question with insufficient information to make any confirm diagnosis. At the best we can try to make the most probable diagnosis. Let's first see CA-125. CA-125 This is a non-specific tumor marker. Cut off level of CA-125 is < 35 U/ml. Ca 125 levels, as described above, can be raised in all the four options, so not very helpful in reaching a diagnosis. But if we weigh CA-125 level in terms of significance then it is least significant in tuberculosis as it is neither used for diagnosis nor for follow-up in tuberculosis. Palpable mass may be present in all the four conditions. Infeility is a feature of both endometriosis and tuberculosis. But for ovarian cancers infeility is a risk factor, not a feature or presenting symptom. Coming to Age: Patient is 35 yrs old. Age of 35 yrs ours endometrioma most. Peak incidence of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (most common ovarian cancer) is at 56-60 yrs of age and for border line tumor average age is 46 yrs approximately (Novak). Patients with tuberculosis are in their twenties commonly, the maximum age incidence at diagnosis being 28 yrs.

They can become infected with oropharyngeal bacteria, including S aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Eikenella corrodens, and anaerobes. A patient with an infected human bite of the hand requires hospitalization for appropriate drainage procedures, Gram stain and culture of the exudate, vigorous cleaning, debridement, and appropriate antibiotics. The infected wound should be left open and allowed to heal by secondary intention (healing by granulation tissue rather than closure with sutures). Empiric antibiotic therapy for an infected bite should be penicillinase-resistant; amoxicillin-clavulanate orally, or ticarcillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam IV are good choices.

What is the minimum hemoglobin levels in pregnancy below which anemia can be diagnosed?,9 mg %,10 mg %,11 mg %,12 mg %,"According to the standard laid down by WHO, anaemia in pregnancy is present when the haemoglobin concentration in the peripheral blood is 11 gm/100 ml or less. During pregnancy plasma volume expands (maximum around 32 weeks) resulting in hemoglobin dilution. For this reason, haemoglobin level below 10gm/dl at any time during pregnancy is considered anemia (WHO - 1993, CDC 1990). Hb level at or below 9gm/dl requires detailed investigations and appropriate treatment. Ref: Text Book of Obstetrics by D.C.Dutta, 6th edition, Page 262",C

Which is associated with Ted risk of Thromboembolism in a normal pregnancy :,|ed progesterone level,|ed production of clotting factors by liver,Change in blood viscosity,|ed antithrombin III,"Ans. is b i.e. |ed production of clotting factors by liver Pulmonary thromboembolism is a rare complication of pregnancy but is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and moality. All of us have studied in surgery - Virchow's Traid i.e. factors associated with thromboembolism viz : Endothelial injury Stasis Increased coagulobility. All the elements of Virchow's triad are present during pregnancy viz : i. Endothelial injury ? It may occur during traumatic vaginal delivery or cesarean section. ii. Stasis ? Pregnancy is associated with venous stasis, especially in lower extremities because the enlarging uterus reduces blood return to the inferior vena cava by direct mechanical effect. Hormonal factors also contribute to venodilatation and stasis during pregnancy. Stasis secondary to prolonged bed rest for medical or obstetrical complications also predispose a pregnant woman to increased venous stasis and formation of vascular thrombi. iii. Increased coagulability ? The maternal circulation becomes hypercoagulable as production of clotting factors like fibrinogen and factors VII. VIII, IX and X increase during pregnancy These changes are also associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity. Remember : * Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state. Levels of fibrinogen are increased in pregnancy. All factors except XI and XIII increase during pregnancy ESR T's during pregnancy. Fibrinolytic activity during pregnancy.

Barr body is absent in female having –,46 XX genome,45 XO genome,47 XXX,All of above,"Barr body (Sex - chromatin)

It is a densely staining inactivated condensed 'X' chromosome that is present in each somatic cells of the female.
It is found in the nucleus.
It is used as a test of genetic femaleness → it is possible to determine the genetic sex of an individual according as to whether there is a chromatin mass present on the inner surface of the nuclear membrane of cells with resting or intermittent nuclei. Remember the following fact and the question will seem very easy.
Chromatid body (Barr body or sex chromatin) is derived from one of the two X-chromosomes which becomes inactivated.
The number of Barr bodies is thus one less than the number of X-chromosomes.

16years old girl presents with rapid onset of hirsutism and amenorrhea . Best investigation is _____________,Testosterone estimation,Dihydroepiandrosterone,Adrenocoicoids,LH and FSH estimation,"Testosterone estimation: Assays of testosterone are impoant in the diagnosis and management of a number of clinical conditions in females including precocious pubey, androgen-secreting tumors, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) . There are several limitations to their use, and there is currently no standardized assay in the United States. Moreover, most testosterone assays have poor sensitivity and accuracy in the female ranges (normal range, 20-60 ng/dl), which, even when elevated in conditions such as PCOS, tend to be well below normal male ranges (300-1000 ng/dl) Circulating levels in females vary according to reproductive maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, time of day, and also feeding . There are no age and gender normal ranges, and in fact there is no testosterone standard on which to base an assay . Other steroids with similar configuration may cross-react with the antibody used in immunoassay. Measurement of total testosterone by mass spectrometry (MS) has been recommended as a possible solution to these problems. This is usually performed after extraction and purification by chromatography and is thought to be highly accurate, although gas chromatography (GC) (which is more difficult and costly) appears to be more precise than liquid chromatography (LC) Ref Dutta 4/e p 524 ; speroff 7/e p 502- 511",A

Apa from case history and physical examination, endocrine profile and semen analysis are essential to disclose the underlying cause. The testes have two distinct but related functions, both of which are under adenohypophyseal and hypothalamic control. The first one is the production and storage of ble spermatozoa, and the second one is the synthesis and secretion of androgenic hormones. Various factors that can induce sterility in men are: trauma, infections like mumps, environmental factors like excessive heat, medications, and drugs. Because of the failure of testes to descend into the scrotum, seminiferous tubules remain infantile in structure and due to greater temperature of the inguinal canal, they degenerate.

Aspiration of sperms from testes is done in :,TESA,MESA,ZIFT,GIFT,"Ans. is a i.e. TESA Friends, we have studied in detail IVF and IUI but either of them cannot be performed if appropriate methods for sperm recovery are not available in cases of male infeility. Sperm retrieval or Recovery can be done by : Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm aspiraton : MESAdeg Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm aspiration : PESAdeg Testicular sperm extraction : TESEdeg Percutaneous Testicular sperm fine needle aspiration : TESAdeg (also called as Fine Needle Aspiration FNA). The choice of the method depends on : the underlying diagnosis, whether goal of the procedure is diagnostic or therapeutic whether, isolated sperm will be used immediately or cryopreserved. TESA Is a percutaneous method which requires No/Local anesthesia and retrieves sperms from the testis when spermatogenesis is normal as in cases of post-testicular azoospermia (i.e. either there is congenital absence or obstruction of ',as deferens/ejaculatory ducts or Retrograde ejaculation). MESA Also indicated in cases of post testicular azoospermia. It is done when one need's to know the nature of obstruction or if surgical correction of the obstruction is to be performed at the same time of sperm recovery. (Done under GA/Regional anesthesia). Another advantage of MESA is that a very large number of sperms are usually retrieved so that cryopreservation and avoidance of repeat surgery may be possible PESA Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration can also be used in cases of Post testicular azoosperma but it is a blind procedure. Bleeding . epididymal injury and postsurgical fibrosis can occur. TESE Indicated in men with testicular azoospermia or Gonadal failure. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection : i.e. ICSI Here a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of the oocyte which is then incubated over night. The procedure involves stripping of the aspirated cumulus complex of all surrounding Granulosa cells, so that micromanipulation can be performed on the egg itself. A holding pipette is used to stabilize the egg while an injection pipette is used to inse a ble sperm into the cytoplasm of the egg. Advantage : This procedure bypasses events like capacitation and acrosome reaction by the sperms. Indication : It is indicated in male factor infeiliy : When sperm is count is less than 5 million / ml (severe oligospermia). Absolute indications : asthenospermia i.e. < 5% progressive motility. Teratospermia i.e. < 4% normal sperms. No.of motile sperms is < 0.5X106/m1 (as in these conditions IUI cannot be done). If sperms lack acrosome. Abnormal sperm morphology.

Kwashiorkor is characterised by all of the following features except –,Edema.,Patchy depigmentation of hair,Fatty liver,Fatty infiltration of  pancreas,"Kwashiorkor and marasmus are manifestations of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM).
Marasmus represents the compensated phase of PEM.
Kwashiorkor represents the uncompensated phase of PEM.

Kwashiorkor

It is characterized by following three essential features -

1) Edema

Edema starts in lower extremities and later involves upper limbs and the face.
Face appears moon shaped and puffy.
	a Edema is caused by -
Hypoalbuminemia → Major factor
Increased capillary permeability due to infection.
Free radical injury to the cell membrane.

2) Markedly retarded growth

Muscles of the upper limb are wasted, but the lower extremities appear swollen due to oedema. a Muscle wasting is masked by oedema.

3) Psychomotor (mental) changes

The child is lethargic, listless and apathetic (in contrast to marasmus, where the child is alert and irritable).
Appetite is impaired (in contrast to marasmus, where children show voracious appetite).

Other features of kwashiorkor
1) Hepatomegaly

Due to fatty infiltration

2) Hair changes in Kwashiorkor


Hair is thin, dry and brittle, easily pluckable
Straight and hypopigmented

Oral contraceptive acts by,Aseptic inflammation,Change in endometrial fluid,Foreign body reaction,Prevent ovulation,"Neither estrogen nor progestin hormone dose used in combination hormonal oral contraceptives alone would be able to suppress ovulation but together the estrogen and progestin hormones work synergistically to suppress ovulation ""successfully"". The synergistic antiovulatory effect from the combined use of estrogen and progestin directly decreases the secretion of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and is considered the main action. This negative feedback mechanism disrupts ovulation by interfering with the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. Specifically, the progestin component suppresses luteinizing hormone release and the LH surge, which is necessary for ovulation, and the estrogen component suppresses the follicle stimulating hormone, which prevents the selection and maturation of the dominant follicle.",D

The deficit in weight for height in a 3-year-old child indicates –,Acute malnutrition,Chronic malnutrition,Concomittant acute and chronic,Under weight,"SURVEILLANCE OF GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT

Surveillance of growth and development is an important component of the routine anticipatory care of children.
The main purpose of growth surveillance is to identify those children who are not growing normally. Surveillance for physical growth can be done in the following ways.

1) Weight for age 

Measurement of weight and rate of gain in weight are the best single parameters for assessing physical growth. The weight should be carefully repeated at intervals:
Birth -1 year → Monthly
The second-year → Every two months
2-5 years → Every 3 months
These measurements when compared with the reference standards of the weight of children of the same age, the trend of growth becomes obvious.
Weight for age can be used to classify malnutrition and determine its prevalence.
80 % of the median weight for age of the reference is cut off point below which children should be considered malnourished.

2)   Weight for age 

Height is a stable measurement of growth as opposed to body weight.
Whereas weight reflects only the present health status of the child, height indicates the events in the past also.

Low height for age :

This is also known as nutritional stunting or dwarfing.
It reflects past or chronic malnutrition.
The cutoff point commonly taken for the diagnosis of stunting is 90 percent of the united states NCHS height for age.

3) Weight for height

Weight in relation to height is now considered more important than weight alone. 
It helps to determine whether a child is within range of normal weight for his height.

Low weight for height

This is also known as nutritional wasting or emaciation (Acute malnutrition).
It is associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity.
A child who is less than 70% of the expected weight for height is classed as severely wasted.

4) Head and chest circumference 

Chest circumference
At birth → Less than 2 cm from head circumference
6-9 months →Two measurements become equal
> 6-9 months → Overtakes head circumference

Select the antibiotic most frequently associated with the Fetal high-tone hearing loss (SELECT 1 ANTIBIOTIC),Tetracycline,Streptomycin,Nitrofurantoin,Chloramphenicol,"Fetal exposure to an antibiotic depends on many factors such as gestational age, protein binding, lipid solubility, pH, molecular weight, degree of ionization, and concentration gradient. Some antibiotics are even concentrated in the fetal compartment. Tetracycline is contraindicated in all three trimesters. It has been associated with skeletal abnormalities, staining and hypoplasia of budding fetal teeth, bone hypoplasia, and fatal maternal liver decompensation. Sulfonamides are associated with kernicterus in the newborn. They compete with bilirubin for binding sites on albumin, thereby leaving more bilirubin free for diffusion into tissues. Sulfonamides should be withheld during the last 2 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. With prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy, streptomycin has been associated with fetal hearing loss. Its use is restricted to complicated cases of TB. Nitrofurantoin can cause maternal and fetal hemolytic anemia if glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is present. Chloramphenicol is noted for causing the gray baby syndrome. Infants are unable to properly metabolize the drug, which reaches toxic levels in about 4 days and can lead to neonatal death within 1 to 2 days.",B
"In beta thalassemia, there is –","Increase in beta chain, decrease in alpha chain","Decrease in beta chain, increase in alpha chain","Decrease in beta chain, decrease in alpha chain","Increase in beta chain, increase in alpha chain","Beta - thalassemia 

The abnormality common to all P-thalassemias is diminished synthesis of structurally normal β-globin chains, coupled with unimpaired synthesis of α-chain.
The reduced supply of (β-globin chain diminishes production of hemoglobin tetramers, causing hypochromic and microcytic anemia.
The haematological consequences of diminished synthesis of one globin chain stem not only from low intracellular hemoglobin, but also from a relative excess of the unimpaired chain.

Consequences of thalassemia

In (β-thalassemia, anemia is produced by two mechanisms


Deficit in HbA synthesis produce hypochromic microcytic anemia.
Excess free α-chains aggregate into insoluble inclusions within red cells and their precursors (normoblasts). These inclusions cause membrane damage that results in apoptosis of normoblasts in the marrow → ineffective erythropoiesis. The red cells which escape death in bone marrow are prone to splenic sequestration and destruction due to cell membrane damage and decreased deformability, leading to extravascular hemolysis.


The second mechanism is more important in producing anemia.
Anaemia leads to several additional problems -


Increased erythropoietin secretion in response to anemia leads to massive erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow that results in expansion of bone marrow and skeletal deformities.
Erythropoietin also induces extramedullary erythropoiesis in liver and spleen -p Hepatosplenomegaly.
Excessive absorption of iron (in response to ineffective erythropoiesis) along with repeated blood transfusion in severe β-thalassemia results in iron overload and secondary hemochromatosis → iron overload in heart, liver, endocrine glands, spleen -4 cardiac failure / endocrine deficiency → Death.",B

Conjugated equine estrogens are administered orally at dosages up to 10mg daily given in four divided doses. Similarly the drug can be given intravenously in 25mg doses every 4 hours for up to 3 doses. Once bleeding has slowed, patients can be transitioned to an oral taper using COCs.Androgens - Danazol - It is suitable for recurrent symptoms and in patients waiting for hysterectomy.

Anatomical sphincter of fallopian tubes,Ampulla,Isthmus,Intramural,Infundibulum,"FALLOPIAN TUBES The two fallopian tubes are oviducts which extend from the ovaries to the cornua of the uterus, one on either side. Each lies in the free upper border of the broad ligament and, when straightened, is 10 cm in length. Its lumen communicates with the uterine cavity at its inner end and with the peritoneal cavity at its outer and thus provides the final section of an open or potentially open canal which leads from the exterior to the abdominal cavity. The fallopian tube is divided into four pas Interstitial or Intramural Pa This is only 1-2 cm in length and is the pa which traverses the uterine wall. It has a very narrow lumen (1 mm in diameter) and is different from the remainder of the tube in that it is without a peritoneal coat, and in that the outer longitudinal muscle has disappeared to cover the uterus. Isthmus This is the straight and narrow poion adjacent to the uterus and measures 2-3 cm. It has thick walls but the lumen is so narrow that it will only admit the finest probe (1-2 mm in diameter). Ampulla This is the wider, thin-walled and touous outer poion, approximately 5 cm in length, which leads to the infundibulum. Infundibulum This is the trumpet-shaped outer end with an opening into the peritoneal cavity (abdominal ostium). The latter is surrounded by fronds or fimbriae, one of which is longer than the others and is directed towards the ovary (fimbria ovarica). The fimbriated extremity is free of the broad ligament and curls back on itself so that its fimbriae aim to embrace the ovary like the tentacles of an octopus; this is impoant to feility. jeffcoate&;s principles of gynaceology;7th edition;pageno 29",C

Superfecundation is?,Fertilization of an ovum by an insemination that takes place after one ovum has already been fertilized,Fertilization and subsequent development of an ovum when a fetus is already present in the uterus,The presence of two separate embryos in one amniotic sac,None of the above,"Ans. A. Fertilization of an ovum by an insemination that takes place after one ovum has already been fertilizedConjoined twins (Siamese twins--incidence, 1/50,000) probably result from relatively late monovular separation, as does the presence of two separate embryos in one amniotic sac. The latter condition has a high fatality rate that is due to obstruction of the circulation secondary to intertwining of the umbilical cords. The prognosis for conjoined twins depends on the possibility of surgical separation, which in turn depends on the degree that vital organs are shared. The site of connections varies: thoraco-omphalopagus (28% of conjoined twins), thoracopagus (18%), omphalopagus (10%), craniopagus (6%), and incomplete duplication (10%). Difficult to separate conjoined twins have occasionally survived to adulthood. Most conjoined twins are female.Superfecundation, or fertilization of an ovum by an insemination that takes place after one ovum has already been fertilized, and superfetation, or fertilization and subsequent development of an ovum when a fetus is already present in the uterus, have been proposed as uncommon explanations for differences in size and appearance of certain twins at birth.A prenatal diagnosis of pregnancy with twins is suggested by a uterine size that is greater than that expected for gestational age, auscultation of two fetal hearts, and elevated maternal serum a-fetoprotein or human chorionic gonadotropin levels, and it is confirmed by ultrasound. Ninety per cent of twins are detected before delivery.",A

Etiology of CHD

The etiology of the majority of CHDs is not known.
In less than 10% of cases, the cause and effect relationship has been established.
Both environmental and hereditary factors play a role in the etiology of CHDs.

1. Hereditary factors

 A higher incidence of CHD in siblings suggests heredity as an important factor.

No Cardiomegaly


First you should know the following facts : -


Pressure overload to ventricles causes concentric hypertrophy without dilatation.
Volume overload to ventricles causes hypertrophy with dilatation → Eccentric hypertrophy.


Due to pulmonary stenosis, there is pressure overload to right ventricle → Concentric hypertrophy of right ventricle without dilatation → No Cardiomegaly.

No CHF

The VSD of TOF is always large enough to allow free exit to the right to left shunt.
Since the right ventricle is effectively decompressed by the VSD, CHF never occurs in TOF.",B

Hysteroscopic myomectomy scores over open omectoim in alb of the following except:,Less recurrence,Less post-operative pain,Less bleeding,Early ambulation,"Ans. c. Less bleeding Possible risk or complication of open myomectomy is excessive bleeding during the operation requiring blood transfusion, anemia due to blood loss during the operation and in post-operative period. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare. Bleeding is unlikely unless vessels are lacerated or injured in the cervical canal or lower uterine segment during dilation or deep ablation or vaporization. Hysteroscopic Myomectomy Hysteroscpic myomectomy involves inseing a hysteroscope through the vagina and the cervix into the uterus. Hysteroscopes are so thin that they can fit through the cervix with minimal or no dilation. Because the instruments are inseed through the cervix, no abdominal incisions are needed. A resectoscope, which is a hysteroscope fitted with a wire loop that uses high-frequency electrical current to cut or coagulate tissue, is then inseed to remove the fibroids. The loop is placed around the fibroid, electrical energy passes through the loop, and the fibroid is cut loose. The fibroid can then be removed through the vagina. Advantages of Hysteroscpic Myomectomy: This procedure is most often done on an ""outpatient"" basis under general anesthesia. There is usually minimal discomfo during hysteroscopy. It takes about 60 minutes to complete the procedure, which is followed by a few hours of recovery time. Hysteroscopy can be used to remove fibroids on the inner wall of the uterus that have not grown deep into the uterine wall. Complications occur less than 1% of the time with hysteroscopic myomectomy. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare. Bleeding is unlikely unless vessels are lacerated or injured in the cervical canal or lower uterine segment during dilation or deep ablation or vaporization",C

Germ cell tumor(s) of paediatric includes all except –,Pure yolk sac tumor,Leydig cell tumor,Choriocarcinoma,Embryonal cell carcinoma,"Germ cell tumors 

Germ cell tumors, as the name suggests, arise from Primordial germ cells (Precursor germ cells or gametocytes),
Germ cells develops early in life. In growing fetus, germ cells migrate from their point of origin to the gondal area.
Germ cells that still have to reach the gonads are called primordial germ cells.
After reaching to gonads these become mature germ cells and the end products of germ cell cycle are the egg or sperm.
Germ cell tumors arise from primordial germ cells.
Therefore germ cells tumor may be : -


Gonadal (In testis or ovary)
Extragonadal : - When primordial genn cells fail to reach the right location and divide at the site of arrest. Extra-gonadal germ cell tumors may occur at nzediastinum (most common site), retroperitonium (2nd most common site), brain, pineal gland, sacrococcygeal region.

From the above statement answer could be second trimester, third trimester or puerperium. ""Red degeneration; manifests typically about midpregnancy when the leiomyoma suddenly become acutely painful, enlarged and tender."" This clears the doubts and confirms our answer i.e Red degeneration is most common during second trimester (midpregnancy). Friends you should also keep in mind the following impoant points regarding - Fibroids and pregnancy. Effects of Fibroid on pregnancy : Infeility - Leiomyomas are a sole cause of infeility in less than 30/0 of cases.deg - It causes infeility by : Hindering the ascent of the spermatozoa by distoing the uterus and tubes. By disturbances in ovulation and By interfering with implantation of the feilized ovum. - Pregnancy rate following myomectomy = 40%deg Aboiondeg, Placental abruptiondeg and Premature labourdeg. Occurs when fibroid interferes with enlargement of uterus, initiates abnormal uterine contractions or prevents efficient placentation, Ma!positiondeg and Malpresentationdeg of Fetus : occur as fibroid can prevent engagement of head. Obstructed labour : It can be caused by cervicaldeg and broad ligament tumoursdeg which are fixed in the pelvis and by pedunculated subserous leiomyomas which become trapped in the pouch of Douglas. During labour - If fibroid is situated above the presenting pa - uneventful vaginal delivery. - If fibroid is situated below the presenting pa spontaneous vaginal delivery may occur; otherwise caesarean section is done.

History of vomiting without bile (nonbilious vomiting).
Physical examination -


Palpable mass in the epigastrium
After feeding, visible gastric peristaltic wave those progress across the abdomen.

USG confirm the diagnosis

Criteria → Pyloric thickness > 4 mm or an overall pyloric length > 14 mm.

Contrast studies -

Shoulder sign → A bulge of the pyloric muscle into the antrum.
Double tract sign → Parallel streaks of barium in the narrowed channel.
Elongated pyloric channel


So the boy is having pyloric stenosis. The only problem is the age of boy i.e 6 yrs. The hypertrophic pyloric stenosis which we know of makes its clinical presentation in early infancy (3rd to 6th weeks of life)
But the problem is solved once you know that there is a similar disease in adults - hypertrophic pyloric stenosis of adults. (Bailey & Love, 22th/e, p 675).",B
A child with large perimembranous VSD has congestive hea failure. What may be the cause of improvement of cardiac failure in the patient ?,Aoic regurgitation,Vascular changes in pulmonary circulation,Infective endocarditis,Closure of VSD spontaneously,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Vascular changes in pulmonary circulation o A patient with large VSD develops CHF because of the large left to right shunt. Large amount of blood at high systolic pressure is entering into the pulmonary circulation and with this continued exposure of the pulmonary vascular bed to high systolic pressure and high flow, pulmonary vascular obstructive disease develops. o The pulmonary vascular resistance gradually rises and becomes equal to the systemic resistance. When this happens the shunt becomes bi-directional and the signs of hea failure diminish but the patient becomes cyanotic (Eisenmenenger physiology).",B

Dutta, Obstetrics 4th/ 447, Williams, Obstertrics, 21st/620, 635)Traditionally, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has been defined as the loss of 500 mL of blood or more after completion of the third stage of labor. This is unreasonable, because nearly half of all women who are delivered vaginally shed that amount of blood or more when measured quantitatively.

The specimen should be reach the laboratory within an hour of ejaculation. Extra Edge : Besides WHO criteria for evaluating sperm morphology, another 'strict criteria' by Kruger and Tygerberg is gaining impoance. Strict sperm morphology represents the best current predictor of sperm function (the capacity to feilize a mature oocyte) and has emerged as the most discriminating factor among infeile and feile men. If > 14% sperms are of normal morphology by the strict criteria then only the semen considered as normal. Teratospermia is < 4% normal sperms by the strict criteria and is an indicator of poor prognosis in assisted feilization by ICSI in IVF cycles. When no motile sperms are observed a sperm bility test differentiates ble non motile sperms from dead sperms. Round cells in semen analysis includes epithelial cells. prostate cells. immature sperms (spermatogonia, round spermatids, spermatocytes) and leucocytes. If total round cells is > 5 million/ml it is abnormal. True leukocytospermia means > 1 million leukocytes/ml and requires semen culture for mycoplasma hominis, ureoplasma ureolyticum and Chlamydia.

"All of the following are associated with placental abruption, EXCEPT:",Cocaine abuse,Cigarette smoking,Hypotension,Pre-eclampsia,"Placental abruption occurs when a previously normally implanted placenta separates from the endometrial wall. This can occur secondarily to vascular changes or mechanical sheer forces. Both cocaine and cigarette smoking result in vascular constriction which results in acute vasospasm, elevated total peripheral resistance, and an acute increase in maternal blood pressure. These phenomena are believed to be associated with an increased rate of placental abruption. Hypeension, not hypotension, is associated with abruption. Acute hypotension can, however, cause fetal distress if untreated and may result in a similar fetal hea rate tracing to that associated with an abruption. Similarly, pre-eclampsia with elevated blood pressures is associated with abruptions. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 35.

The definition of hypeension in children is,"Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","The definition of hypeension in adults is BP >=140/90 mm Hg, regardless of body size, sex, or age. This is a functional definition that relates level of BP elevation with the likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular events. Because hypeension-associated cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, usually do not occur in childhood, the definition of hypeension in children is statistical rather than functional. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents published the Fouh Repo on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents (Fouh Repo) in 2004. This repo established normal values based on the normative distribution of BP in healthy children and included tables with systolic and diastolic values for the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile by age, sex, and height percentile. The Fouh Repo defined hypeension as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions. Prehypeension was defined as average SBP or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile but <95th percentile. In adolescents beginning at age 12 yr, prehypeension is defined as BP between 120/80 mm Hg and the 95th percentile. A child with BP levels >=95th percentile in a medical setting but normal BP outside of the office has white coat hypeension. The Fouh Repo fuher recommended that if BP is >=95th percentile, then hypeension should be staged. Children with BP between the 95th and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg are categorized as stage 1 hypeension, and children with BP above the 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg have stage 2 hypeension. Stage 1 hypeension, if asymptomatic and without target organ damage, allows time for evaluation before staing treatment, whereas stage 2 hypeension calls for more prompt evaluation and pharmacologic therapy.

When does switchover from fetal to adult hemoglobin synthesis begin –,14 weeks gestation,30 weeks gestation,36 weeks gestation,7–10 days postnatal,"Fetal Hb → (α2 γ2)
Adults Hb → (α2 β2)

During the initial fetal life, the major haemoglobin synthesized in the body is fetal haemoglobin, because, in the fetus, the chain synthesized predominantly is the γ chain.
the β chain is present in only trace amount in early embryos
The rate of synthesis of y and β chains and the amount of HbA and HbF are inversely related during the intrauterine stage.
As the age of the fetus increases, the synthesis of β chains and the amount of adult haemoglobin in the blood increases
At 36 weeks of gestational age the rate of synthesis of (β chain exceeds that of γ chain. This is called switch over.",C

"A 35 year old female, with post coital bleeding, next step :",Clinical examination and pap smear,Visual inspection with acetowhite,Visual inspection with lugol's iodine,Colposcopy directed biopsy,"Ans. is a i.e. Clinical examination and pap smear Well friends first I want you to read what Williams has to say on Postcoital bleeding. ""Bleeding following intercourse most commonly develops in women aged 20 to 40 years and in those who are multiparous. No underlying pathology is identified in up to two thirds. If an identifiable lesions is found, however, it typically is benign. In a review of 248 women with postcoital bleeding. Selo-Ojeme and co-workers (2004) found that a fouh of cases were caused by cervical eversion. Other causes included endocervical polyps, cervicitis, and less commonly, endometrial polyps. In the cases of cervicitis. Chlamydia trachomatis is a frequent cause. In some women, postcoital bleeding may be from cervical or other genital tract neoplasia. The epithelium associated with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and invasive cancer is thin and friable and readily detaches from the cervix. In women with postcoital bleeding. CIN was found in to 10 percent, invasive cancer in about 5 percent, and vaginal or endometrial cancer in <1 percent. In another study, Jha and Sabharwal (2002) repoed that a number of women with postcoital bleeding had pathologic lesions identified at colposcopic evaluation that had been missed by Pap smear screening. Thus, most women with unexplained postcoital bleeding should undergo colposcopic examination if no other obvious souce of bleeding is identified."" So after reading the above text it is clear that - Colposocopy is the most definitive procedure for diagnosis of postcoital bleeding. But here question is specifically saying - a 35 years old female is coming with postcoital bleeding, what is the next step - so obviously in this age group we will first examine the patient, rule out other causes, perform a pap's and still if no diagnosis is made we will go for colposocpy to rule out CIN and Ca cervix.",A

"A pregnant female in first trimester has 4 fold rise in IgG against toxoplasmosis, what does it indicate-",Acute infection in mother,Chronic infection in mother,Protective antibodies,None of the above,"Ans. is B. IgG is chronic IgM is acute Ref- Distinguishing of acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis has critical importance in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. Some assays have been used to measure Toxoplasma specific IgM antibodies as indicators of the acute phase infection . Toxoplasma IgM antibodies can be detected for 1 year or longer in some cases, so in asymptomatic individuals with stable titers of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, positive IgM results are not easy to interpret . The IgG avidity assay that had been started in the 1980s for diagnosis of rubella and hepatitis C is now used to distinguish between acute and chronic toxoplasmosis . This method was originally developed by Hedman et al. in Finland. It is based on dissociation of hydrogen bond between antigen and antibody with urea . High avidity (AI>=60%) means that Toxoplasma infection was acquired before 3 months ago, whereas borderline avidity (50%<AI<60%) means infection at an indeterminate period, and low avidity (AI<=50%) means that the infection was acquired within the last 3 months. According to the present study, 88.9% of patients with acute toxoplasmosis had low avidity (AI<=50%) and 92.7% of individuals with chronic infection had high avidity ranges (AI>=60%). It was suggested that Toxoplasma specific IgG avidity assay that is performed on specific IgM positive samples could diagnose acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis . Candolfi et al. also demonstrated that measuring of IgG avidity could differentiate between acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis. Our results showed that there was no significant relation between the concentration of IgG antibody and the level of AI. Therefore, the strength of links between antibody and antigen is not dependent on antibody concentration, which was confirmed by other investigators . Meanwhile, there are a converse relationship between IgM titer and levels of IgG AI in this study (P<0.05). On the other hand, Remington et al. suggested that IgG avidity ELISA test is not enough to confirm acute toxoplasmosis, and it should be done in addition to IgM ELISA test. Many investigators had mentioned the role of IgM detection as a key for diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis . One of the limitations of IgG avidity method is detection of reactivated toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients . In the present study, both IgM ELISA and IgG avidity ELISA tests together could confirm the phases of infection absolutely.",B

Tenderness in uterine palpation Complete rupture : Sense of something giving away Collapse, shock, dehydration Absent FHS Palpation of superficial pas Shoening of cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic of uterine rupture. So it is clear that fetal distress and vaginal bleeding may be seen in impending uterine rupture. Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium ""There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs hpfnre labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive"" ...COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus. hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture. it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment.

Which vitamin deficient is most commonly seen in a pregnant mother who is on phenytoin therapy for epilepsy?,Vitamin B6,Vitamin B12,Vitamin A,Folic acid,"Antiepileptic drugs interfere with metabolism of folate, and patients taking phenytoin may therefore become deficient in folate, leading to the development of macrocytic anemia and possible, complications during pregnancy. Maternal side effects : Nystagmus, Ataxia, Hirsutes, Gingival hyperplasia, Pripheral neurotoxicity, Vit d and Folate deficiency Fetal side effects: Fetal Hydantoin syndrome, Facial clefting, Hea malformations, Limb anomalies, Vit K and D deficiency Possible cognitive effects Folic acid supplements can increase the activity of hepatic microsomal enzymes and thus hasten the clearance of antiepilepsy drugs, leading to a reduced concentration of phenytoin. This situation necessitates the careful monitoring of both folate and phenytoin levels after therapy is initiated. The normal range for folate is 5 to 25 ng/mL. Additionally, phenytoin therapy may increase the metabolism of vitamin D, leading to a decrease in vitamin D levels that can in turn cause alterations in calcium homeostasis that lead to osteomalacia and osteoporosis. Pregnant women taking phenytoin should receive the recommended 400 IU/day of cholecalciferol throughout pregnancy to prevent problems in vitamin D levels and calcium absorption.",D

A patient with genotype 46 XY diagnosed of having androgen insensitivity syndrome. TRUE about androgen insensitivity syndrome is:,Phenotype may be completely female,Predominantly ovarian component in gonads,Seen in males also,Testes formed abnormally and receptors are normal,"These patients have a male karyotype with a mutation of the androgen receptor on the X chromosome. They have normal testicular development and endocrine function. However, because the internal and external male sexual structures need testosterone for development, they are absent. This results in a female phenotype. Secondary sexual characteristics (female) develop as a result of peripheral conversion of testosterone to estradiol, effectively resulting in unopposed estrogen stimulation.

A child with acute myeloid leukemia presents with hyperleukocytosis. Treatment includes all of the following except –,IV fluid,Allopurinol,Ailcalinization,Immediately start induction chemotherapy,"Hyperleukocytosis and Leukostasis 

Hyperleukocytosis refers to condition in which patients with acute leukemia present with an extraordinary high leukocyte count usually greater than 100,000/ 1.
Leukostasis (Also known as symptomatic hyperleukocytosis) is a medical emergency most commonly seen in patients with AML or CML in blast crisis. There is sludging of leukemia blasts in the microcirculation (due to extremely elevated blast cells) leading to obstruction of small vessels especially in the cerebral and pulmonary circulation.



Treatment of hyperleukocytosis includes : -

1. Immediate leukoreduction (cytoreduction)

Immediate leukoreduction is required to lower the blast cells.
This can be achieved by leukopharesis or by administration of hydroxyurea.

2. Induction chemotherapy

Induction chemotherapy is initiated early, but only after attempts at leukoreduction (not immediately) as immediate administration of induction chemotherapy carries a high risk of acute tumor lysis syndrome.
So, early induction chemotherapy is advised but not immediately.

3. Supportive/Prevention of complications

Supportive therapy is given to prevent/reduce the metabolic complications of tumor lysis syndrome.
It includes IV hydration, allopurinol and alkalinization of urine.",D

A pelvis characterized by an anteroposterior diameter of the inlet greater than the transverse diameter is classified as:,Gynecoid,Android,Anthropoid,Platypelloid,"Ans. C. AnthropoidBy tradition, pelvis are classified as belonging to one of four major groups. The gynecoid pelvis is the classic female pelvis with a posterior sagittal diameter of the inlet only slightly shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter. In the android pelvis, the posterior sagittal diameter at the inlet is much shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter, limiting the use of the posterior space by the fetal head. In the anthropoid pelvis, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the inlet is greater than the transverse diameter, resulting in an oval with large sacrosciatic notches and convergent side walls. Ischial spines are likely to be prominent. The platypelloid pelvis is flattened with a short AP and wide transverse diameter. Wide sacrosciatic notches are common. The pelves of most women do not fall into a pure type and are blends of one or more of the above types.",C

Which is seen in nephrotic syndrome ?,Low serum calcium,Raised AT-III,Low lipid,Platelet activation,"NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:-. Characterised by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemua and edema, hyperlipidemia is often associated. Some patients show hematuria and hypeension. Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes.

It affects more than 50% of post-pubescent women in the age group of 18 to 25 years, with ovulatory cycles. Secondary dysmenorrhoea: It is associated with the presence of organic pelvic pathologies such as fibroids, adenomyosis, PID and endometriosis Unilateral dysmenorrhoea can be seen in a rudimentary horn of bicornuate uterus, IUCD users, and cervical stenosis. B. Clinical: Spasmodic dysmenorrhoea: It is the most prevalent and manifests as cramping pain, right before or at the sta of the menstrual period, and is most pronounced on the first and second days of menstruation Congestive dysmenorrhoea: It present as increasing pelvic discomfo and pelvic pain, a few days before menses begin. Thereafter, the patient experiences rapid relief of the symptoms. This variety is commonly seen in PID. IUCD users, varicosities of pelvic vein, pelvic veins, pelvic endometriosis, and fibroids.

Recombination of alpha and beta subunits of these four hormones gives a molecule with biological activity characteristic of the hormone from which the beta subunit was derivedo Principal form in plasma - Intact hCGo Principal form in urine - beta core fragment (terminal hCG degradation product).Functionsa) Maintainence of corpus luteum till 6 weeks of pregnancy.b) Stimulation of fetal testicular testosterone secretion which is maximum approximately when hCG levels peak. Thus at a critical time in male sexual differentiation, hCG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast. In the fetus, it acts as an LH surrogate to stimulate Leydig cell replication and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation. Before approximately 110 days, there is no vascularization of the fetal anterior pituitary from the hypothalamus. Thus, pituitary LH secretion is minimal,and hCG acts as LH before this time. Thereafter as hCG levels fall, pituitary LH maintains modest testicular stimulation.c) Immunosuppressive activity, inhibits maternal processes of immunorejection of the fetus as a homograft.d) Stimulates maternal thyroid (thyrotropic action).e) Promotes relaxin secretion from corpus luteum.o Choriocarcinoma is associated with increased secretion of beta - hCG that is glycosylated to a greater degree, so called hyperglycosylated hCG, sometimes called invasive trophoblast antigen.",B

"During a regular check-up of an 8-year-old child, you note a loud first heart sound with a fixed and widely split-second heart sound at the upper left sternal border that does not change with respirations. The patient is otherwise active and healthy. Which of the following heart lesions most likely explains these findings?",Atrial septal defect (ASD),Ventricular septal defect (VSD),Isolated tricuspid regurgitation,Tetralogy of Fallot,"Most children with an ASD are asymptomatic; the lesion is found during a routine examination. In older children, exercise intolerance can be noted if the lesion is of significant size. On examination, the pulses are normal, a right ventricular systolic lift at the left sternal border is palpable, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound is audible. For lesser degrees of ASD, surgical treatment is controversial.VSD commonly presents as a harsh or blowing holosystolic murmur best heard along the left lower sternum, often with radiation throughout the precordium. The auscultatory finding of tricuspid regurgitation is typically a blowing holosystolic murmur, augmented during inspiration, and best heard at the left lower sternal border; a middiastolic rumble may also be heard. A history of birth asphyxia or findings of other cardiac lesions may be present. Tetralogy of Fallot is a common form of congenital heart disease. The four abnormalities include right ventricular outflow obstruction, VSD, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy; the cyanosis presents in infants and in young children. Mitral valve prolapse occurs with the billowing into the atria of one or both mitral valve leaflets at the end of systole. It is a congenital abnormality that frequently manifests only during adolescence or later. It is more common in girls than in boys and seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. On clinical examination, an apical murmur is noted late in systole, which can be preceded by a midsystolic click. The diagnosis is confirmed with an echocardiogram that shows prolapse of the mitral leaflets during mid to late systole.",A

TRUE about 'Capacitation' of sperm:,Can be induced in IN-Vitro,Acrosomal reaction is capacitation,Its same as Zona reaction,Capacitation takes place in testis,"Both capacitation and the acrosome reaction can be induced in vitro. So in IVF, following semen collection and sperm processing sperm are incubated in media for 3 to 4 hours to promote sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction. The process of capacitation involves removal of inhibitory mediators such as cholesterol from the sperm surface, tyrosine phosphorylation, and calcium ion influx. The spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes, where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Near the time that the egg enters the ampulla of the tube, sperm initiate the capacitationprocess and are released from the oviduct epitheliumin a hyperactivated state This fuher maturation process involves two components: Increasing the motility of the spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. Capacitation is not an essential step though, since feilisation can also happen in 'Vitro'.",A
Transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) is used in:,Endometriosis,DUB,Carcinoma endometrium,Submucous fibroid,"Transcervical endometrial resection (Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation) is a technique for management of DUB.
Aim of the procedure is to produce a therapeutic Asherman’s syndrome and produce amenorrhea.
It destroys the endometrium → formation of synchea → Asherman syndrome → amenorrhea.
It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of myometrial depth.
Procedure : After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endomyometrium, to a depth of 4mm. Resected tissue is used for pathologic examination and documentation of the absence of cellular atypia. After a few strips are resected initially from the posterior uterine wall, resection of almost all the remaining surface with loop electrode by vaporization is performed. The procedure should be performed soon after menstruation or the woman should be given progesterone, danazol or GnRH to suppress the endometrium.
Result : Short term and long term studies show amenorrhea rates of 20–50%, overall improved bleeding patterns (including amenorrhea) in 85–95%, with failure rates of 5–10% which requires additional surgery i.e. hysterectomy.
Extra Edge:
• A COG recommends endometrial sampling prior to ablation surgery. Women with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer should not undergo ablation.
• Absolute contraindications for endometrial ablation :

However, most cases show that the first three months in a pregnancy are when most bih defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form.One common cause is amniotic band syndrome, which occurs when the inner fetal membrane (amnion) ruptures without injury to the outer membrane (chorion).Fibrous bands from the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can get entangled with the fetus, thus reducing blood supply to the developing limbs to such an extent that the limbs can become strangulated, the tissues die and are absorbed into the amniotic fluid.",A

"Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by all of the following mechanisms, except :",Delaying / inhibiting ovulation,inhibiting feilization,preventing implantation of the feilized egg,Interrupting an early pregnancy,"Postcoital Contraception (Interceptives): interferes with postovulatory events leading to pregnancy and is therefore known as interceptive. It is also known as 'emergency contraception' method used to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of a condom during coitus taking place around ovulation. It is used in misplaced IUCD and missed pill. These postcoital methods should be used mainly as 'back-up' methods The preparations available include: -Two tablets of relatively high doses of combined pill (Ovran/Eugynon 50), containing 100 mcg EE2 and 1 mg norethisterone, or 500 mcg LNG, taken within 72 h of intercourse followed by two tablets taken 12 h later (Yuzpe and Lancee, 1977). Failure rate--3.2 per 100 woman years. Mode of action: The hormones may delay ovulation if taken soon after intercourse, cause corpus luteolysis, and bring about cervical mucus changes and endometrial atrophy. -Levonorgestrel (LNG). Prostinar tablet contains 0.75 mg LNG. One tablet should be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse and another 12 h later. Alternately, two tablets can be taken as a single dose. The failure rate is 1.1%. The tablets can be offered up to 120 h but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital-drug interval. LNG prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency). The period may come earlier or delayed. Side effects are those of progestogens. The hormone is not teratogenic in case pregnancy does occur but risk of ectopic pregnancy remains.Advantages: It has no oestrogen and its associated side effects, It can be offered to hypeensive, cardiac and diabetic woman,It can be offered to a lactating woman,It can be given as late as 120 h after the unprotected intercourse,Single-dose therapy is an advantage.Contraindicated in liver disease, contains lactate, so allergy to galactose. The drug is also contraindicated in a woman with history of thrombophlebitis and migraine. -RU 486 (Mifepristone) : RU 486 is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It does not prevent feilization but by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium, it causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and prevents implantation. It is not teratogenic. A single dose of 25-50 mg is effective in preventing pregnancy in 99.1% cases (failure rate 0.9%). It causes delayed menstruation. Ectopic pregnancy is not avoided. The drug is expensive as compared to LNG. -Ulipristal. Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, attaches to progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, prevents implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. Two per cent pregnancy rate is repoed. Side effects are headache and mood changes. -Centchroman. Two tablets (60 mg) taken twice in 24 h within 24 h of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% women. -GnRH Agonists. Daily administration of GnRH agonist (buserelin) prevents ovulation. The drug is on trial for its contraceptive effect. Very expensive--has to be given by subcutaneous injection. -Prostaglandin : Self-administered vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin following an unprotected intercourse, by viue of its luteolytic effect on the ovary and its increased motility effect on fallopian tubes and the uterus, prevents implantation and brings about menstruation. Its specific role as contraceptive is however yet to be established. -Copper T IUCD. Inseed within 5 days of intercourse can prevent implantation of a feilized ovum. Advantages of Copper T as emergency contraception are: It can be inseed as late as 5 days after the unprotected intercourse. It is cheap. Failure rate is 0.1%. It can remain as ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years. Reference : page 280 Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition",D

Antiprogesterone compound RU-486 is effective for inducing aboion if the duration of pregnancy is :,63 days,72 days,88 days,120 days,"Ans. is a i.e. 63 days RU-486 i.e. Mifepristone, is an analogue of the progestin ""norethindrone"". which has strong affinity for progesterone receptors but acts as an antagonist of progesterone. Given alone, the drug was moderately useful in causing aboion of early pregnancy, however the combination of mifepristone with analogue of prostaglandin E, i.e. misoprostol is very effective. hegimen : FDA approved protocol - (Original protocol) : 600 mg of Mifepristone (i.e. 3 tablets) given orally on day 1 followed 2 days later by oral misoprostol 400 pg (2 tablets) on day 3. The treatment should be staed no more than 49 days from the sta of the last menstrual period. But according to the recent protocol : 200 mg of mifepristone (it is as effective as 600 mg of mifepristone) is given orally on Day 1 followed 2 days later by vaginal misoprostol 800 pg. ibis regime provides highest efficacy within 63 bays of amenorrhea. Role of mifepristone in Medical aboion : Mifepristone blocks progesterone receptors in the endometrium which leads to disruption of the embryo. production of prostaglandins and a decrease in human chorionic gonadotropin levels. The success rate is dependant on the length of pregnancydeg - the more dependant the pregnancy is on progesterone from the corpus luteum, the more likely that the progesterone antagonist, mifepristone will result in aboion. The production of prostaglandins leads to softening of the cervix as well.

The requirement of which nutrient cannot be compensated by dietary intake in pregnancy,Iron,Protein,Carbohydrate,Fats,"(Iron) (121 -Shaw's 15th)Adequate energy intake and a diversified diet that includes fruit,vegetables, and animal products throughout the life cycle help ensure that women enter pregnancy and lactation without dcficienciesand obtain adequate nutrients during periods of heightened dcmand.Some nutrient requirements, particularly iron, folic acid, and vitaminA, aremore difficult to achieve than others through food sources.For this reason, supplements with these nutrients are recommendedin addition to improved diets. Fortified foods should be promotedthrough counseling and social marketing in countries where foodsfortified with iron, iodine, folic acid, or vitamin A are available andaffordable.IRON* In the absence of Iron supplementation, there is drop in hemoglobin serum iron, and serum ferritin concentration at term pregnancy thus pregnancy is an inevitable iron deficiency state* Daily iron requirement in non menstruating women to compensate the overage daliy loss is 1 mg. Thus in the second help, the daily requirement, actually becomes very much increased to the extent of about 6-7 mg* Total iron requirement during pregnancy is estimated approximately 1000 mg* The fall in the hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy is due to combined effect of hemodilution and negative iron balance* Folic acid supplementation beginning 1 month before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy has reduced the incidence of neural tube defects signilicantly A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended* Folic acid deficient most commonly seen in a pregnant mother who is on phenytoin therapy for epilepsy",A

Hereditary spherocytosis is best tretaed with,Splenectomy,Immunoglobulns,Steroids,Blood transfusion,"Treatment of choice for hereditary spherocytosis is splenectomy especially in case of severe hemolysis,done after 6 years of age. The treatment of hereditary spherosytosis (HS) is dependent on the severity of the condition and recommendations vary a bit in the medical literature. In general, folate therapy (a type of vitamin B to suppo red blood cell production) is recommended for those with moderate to severe anemia, although some doctors may also recommend it for those with mild anemia. Red blood cell transfusions may be required in severe cases of anemia, paicularly in the first years of life or during infections and pregnancy. If red blood cell transfusions are needed repeatedly, iron chelating therapy may be required to reduce iron overload. Regular monitoring for anemia and gallstones is advised. Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) is usually only performed in severe HS or in moderate to severe cases with significant anemia and gallstone complications. Splenectomy is not recommended in cases of mild HS except in specific cases. The majority of medical researchers no longer recommend that the spleen be removed during gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy), unless there are other reasons to do so. In some cases only removing of pa of the spleen is advised. Expe evaluation is recommended in order to avoid unnecessary spleen removal. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

ESR and blood count: No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB.
Demonstration of AFB: Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it. Therefore sputum is not available for examination. A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteria. It is customary to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days. Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a Ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. The CSF, Pleural fluid or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculosis sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli.
Histopathology: Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC.

The vein of Markowski actually drains into the vein of Galen.VGAM typically result in high-output congestive heart failure or may present with developmental delay, hydrocephalus, and seizures.The vein of Galen abnormality is the MOST COMMON arteriovenous malformation in neonates.Signs and symptomsIt commonly presents in the neonatal period, although it may present later, in early childhood.Typically, in the neonatal period. VGAM presents with congestive heart failure, a cranial bruit, hydrocephaly, subarachnoid hemorrhage and marked carotid pulses.The heart failure is due to the size of the arteriovenous shunt that can steal 80% or more of the cardiac output, w ith large volumes of blood under high pressure returning to the right heart and pulmonary circulation and sinus venosus atrial septal defects.CCF is also the most common cause of death in VGAM.Neonates may present with tachypnea, respiratory distress, and cyanosis.They often require ventilatory support and institution of aggressive management of heart failure.Hydrocephalus may be the presenting feature in older infants (""sunseting sign"" in the eye).Developmental delay: Signs of hydrocephalus and congestive heart failure should be looked for in infants with developmental delay.In early childhood, symptoms include headache, convulsive seizures, hydrocephalus, and cardiac failure.TreatmentNeurosurgical procedures to relieve hydrocephalus (A ventriculoperitoneal shunt)Open surgery has a high morbidity and mortality.Recent advances over the past few decades have made endovascular embolization the preferred method of treatment.Another treatment option is Radiotherapy.

First investigation to be done is Babygram (full body radiograph of the baby) to rule out duodenal atresia. Babygram is a full body radiograph of the baby, which shows the double bubble sign in duodenal atresia.The hallmark of duodenal obstruction is bilious vomiting without abdominal distention, which is usually noted on the 1st day of life. Peristaltic waves may be visualized early in the disease process. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of a 'double-bubble sign' on plain abdominal radiographs. The appearance is caused by a distended and gas-filled stomach and proximal duodenum. Contrast studies are usually not necessary and may he associated with aspiration if attempted.

Pedigree analysis - Analyze the following pedigree and give the mode of inheritance ?,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial inheritance,X linked dominant,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Mitochondrial inheritance i) Disease is manifesting in both males and females. ii) But, the disease is transmitting to next generation only by females (mother). Both these are characteristics of mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial diseaes o Mitochondria' DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells DNA in humans may be found either in the Nucleus (Nuclear DNA) or in the Mitochondria (Organelle DNA) o Mitochondria' DNA,is always maternally inherited. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA are located in different places in the cell. During feilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo. The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells' nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only. Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mother's egg. All children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmitted from an affected father to his children.-",C

Most common Enzyme Deficiency leading to childhood hypeension is,17- Alpha hydroxylase,21- Beta hydroxylase,11- Beta hydroxylase,3- Beta hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase,"Most common enzyme deficiency causing hypeension in pediatric child group is APPARENTMINERALOCOICOID EXCESS. Apparent mineralocoicoid excess (AME) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of 11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11-beta HSD 2) enzyme which is encoded by a gene in chromosome 16q22. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11b-hydroxylase deficiency is a form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) which produces a higher than normal amount of androgen,resulting from a defect in the gene encoding the enzyme steroid 11b-hydroxylase (11b-OH) which mediates the final step of coisol synthesis in the adrenal. 11b-OH CAH results in hypeension due to excessive mineralocoicoid effects. It also causes excessive androgen production both before and after bih and can virilize a genetically female fetus or a child of either sex. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

A 20-year-old G2P1 patient comes to see you at 17 weeks gestational age to review the results of her triple test done 1 week ago. You tell the patient that her maternal serum a-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is 2.0 multiples of the median (MOM). The patient's obstetrical history consists of a term vaginal delivery 2 years ago without complications. What do you tell your patient regarding how to proceed next?,Explain to the patient that the blood test is diagnostic of a neural tube defect and she should consult with a pediatric neurosurgeon as soon as possible,Tell the patient that the blood test result is most likely a false-positive result and she should repeat the test at 20 weeks,Refer the patient for an ultrasound to confirm dates,Offer the patient immediate chorionic villus sampling to obtain a fetal karyotype,"The multiple marker screening test, also referred to as the expanded AFP test or triple screen, consists of maternal serum measurements of estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin, and a-fetoprotein. The multiple marker screening test is used to determine a pregnant patient's risk of having a baby with an- euploidy and a neural tube defect. The AFP test has the greatest sensitivity when done between 16 and 18 weeks. A maternal serum AFP level that is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 2.5 MOM indicates an elevated risk for a neural tube defect and indicates that further workup and evaluation are needed. The first step when an elevated serum AFP result is obtained is to have the patient undergo an ultrasound to verify that the gestational age of the pregnancy is correct. The sonogram can also identify a fetal death in utero, multiple gestation, or a neural tube or abdominal defect, which could all explain the elevated AFP level. A repeat serum AFP test can be done, because at a level of 2.0 MOM there is some overlap between normal and affected pregnancies. The repeat test should be done as soon as possible; waiting until 20 weeks decreases the sensitivity of the test and wastes valuable time in the workup. An amniocentesis is recommended if a neural tube defect is suspected, in order to measure amniotic fluid levels of AFP and therefore confirm the findings of the maternal serum AFP. The physician would not immediately refer the patient for a chorionic villus sampling because this procedure obtains placental tissue for fetal karyotyping and does not add to information regarding the presence of a neural tube defect. A cordocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) is a procedure whereby the umbilical vein is punctured under ultrasonic guidance and a fetal blood sample is obtained. Usually a PUBS is performed when rapid fetal karyotyping must be done, such as in a situation where severe growth restriction exists. PUBS is most commonly used in situations where fetal hydrops exists to obtain information regarding fetal platelet counts and fetal hematocrits.",C

Most impressive is that total endometrial height is fixed at roughly its preovulatory extent (5 -6 mm) despite continued availability of estrogen."" Reading the above text it is clear that endometrium is - 5 - 6 mm thick at the time of implantation, which is not given in the option. Still if you have to mark one answer option 'a' i.e. 3 - 4 mm being closest could be right. Extra Edge Implantation occurs 7 - 9 days after ovulationdeg. In human, the blastocyst burrows in the uterine cavity till whole of it lies within the thickness of endometrium. This is called as interstitial implantation. After implantation of the embryo the uterine endometrium is called the decidua"". Decidua basalis - The pa of decidua where the placenta is to be formed. Decidua Capsularis - The pa of the decidua that separates the embryo from the uterine lumen. Decidua Parietalis - The pa of the decidua lining rest of the uterine cavity. At the end of pregnancy, the decidua is shed off along with placenta and membranes.",A

Next step to be taken should be?",Increase rate to 60 per minute,"Increase FiO, to 80",Continue ventilation with the same settings,Weaning ventilator,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Continue ventilation with the same settings Lets see the individual findings. The neonate is premature. X - Ray shows 'White - Out' : is a sign of Hyaline Membrane disease in the Newborn i.e. RDS. ABG reveals p0, of 75 : which is acceptable. Fi02 : Fractional Inspiratory 02, here in the ventilator settings, is 75% well above the normal. Respiratory Rate settings in the ventilator is 50/min : Normal for that age. Now, we have the complete picture here : The premature baby is having HMD, and so has been put on Aificial respiration. The Fi02 being given is in the higher normal range, and also the paial pressure of 0, in the neonates blood is acceptable . So we will avoid increasing the Fi0,, as this carries a risk of blindness by ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). As a rule, we avoid tampering with the ventilator rate settings, because it causes changes in the CO, levels of the blood, and consequent disturbances in the acid - base balance. This is also one of the reasons for keeping this rate of 50/min. in this neonate. Weaning from ventilator will sta once the baby shows hyper - oxygenation with the currect settings, i.e. the p02 in the range of 120 . The answer here would be to continue the current settings till such time when the baby shows hyper-oxygenation, and then slowly wean him off the ventilator",C

Although the overall incidence of ectopic pregnancy is not increased, When pregnancy occurs (with minipill use) the clinician must suspect that it is more likely to be ectopic. A previous ectopic pregnancy should not be regarded as a contraindication to the minipill."" Also Know : Main side effect of Minipill : Irregular bleeding and amenorrhea. Women on progestin only contraceptive develop more functional ovarian follicular cyst (Most of them regress after minipill is stopped). Minipill are associated with acne, anxiety, headache, dizziness, backache and hair loss. Progestin only pills are associated with a 3 fold increased risk of diabetes mellitus in lactating women with recent Gestational diabetes. There is no indication of increased risk of stroke, MI or venous thromboembolism with progestin only pills. There is no impact on Coagulation system.

Differential expression of the same gene depending on parent of origin is referred to as –,Genomic imprinting,Mosaicism,Anticipation,Nonpenetrance,"The phenomenon referred to as genomic imprinting leads to pereferential expression of an allele depending on its parental origin - Harrisons

Genomic imprinting

Human inherits two copies of each gene, i.e. two alleles, from homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes.
There is no functional difference between the genes derived from the mother or the father.
But, with respect to some genes, there are functional differences between the paternal gene and maternal gene.
These differences result from an epigenetic process, called genomic imprinting.
In most cases, genomic imprinting selectively inactivates either the maternal or paternal allele.

1. Maternal genomic imprinting

Selective inactivation of the maternal allele
An example is an Angelman syndrome

2. Paternal genomic imprinting

Selective inactivation of paternal allele.
An example is Prader-Willi syndrome.",A

Oxygenated blood to the fetus is carried by –,Umblical artery,Umblical vein,SVC,Pulmonary artery,"Fetal circulation

Fetal circulation differs from adult circulation in several ways. Almost all differences are attributable to the fundamental difference in the site of gas exchange.
In the adult, gas exchange occurs in the lungs, while in the fetus placenta provides the exchange of gases and nutrients.

The course of fetal circulation
A) Blood returning to the heart

Blood oxygenated in the placenta returns by way of the umbilical vein, which enter the fetus at the umbilicus and course through to join the portal vein.
The ductus venous is a bypass shunt between the portal vein and IVC.
Most of the umbilical venous blood shunt through the ductus venosus to the IVC.
Blood from IVC (which carries the blood drained from lower extremities, umbilical veins, hepatic veins and renal veins) enters the right atrium.
On reaching the right atrium, about 1/3rd of total inferior vena caval return of blood enters the left atrium through formen oval.
The rest two third mixes with the venous return from SVC (which carries the blood drained from head, neck and upper limbs) to enter the right ventricles.

B) Blood coming out of the heart
1. Right side

The right ventricle pumps out the blood into pulmonary trunk very small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation because the lungs are collapsed and pulmonary vascular resistance is high.
Most of this blood passes to descending aorta through ductus arteriosus, a shunt between pulmonary trunk and descending Aorta.
The descending aorta carries blood to umbilicus through the umbilical artery, for oxygenation.
Descending aorta also supplies the blood to lower limbs, kidney and abdominal viscera.

2. Left side

The left ventricle pumps blood into the ascending aorta for distribution in the coronary circulation, head and upper limbs.",B

Between the age of 3 to 9 months, the cause of acute intussusception is idiopathic.
It is postulated that gastrointestinal infection or the introduction of new food proteins result in swollen Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum. The prominent mounds of tissue leads to mucosal prolapse of the ileum into the colon thus causing an intussusception.
In 2-8% of patient, recognizable lead points for the intussusception are found, such as a Meckel's diverticulum, intestinal polyp, neurofibroma, intestinal duplication, hemangioma or malignant condition such as lymphoma.",A

Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 161; Fernando Arias 2/e, p 56According to the clinical and echographic findings, it is possible to separate early pregnancy losses into two groups:Blighted ova: Those early pregnancy losses in which foetal development is not observed with ultrasound (so that only a gestational sac is present with or without a yolk sac) and fetal tissue is absent on histologic examination of the products of conception.Early Fetal demise: Those early pregnancy losses in which fetal development is clearly observed by ultrasound and fetal tissue is found on the histologic examination.The difference between these two types of abortion is of fundamental importance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of abortions of genetic origin.In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies. Therefore, the patients with blighted ova do not require extensive work up, whereas patients who have aborted cytogenetically normal fetuses need an extensive search for non genetic factors responsible for the pregnancy loss.",B

What is shoulder dystocia? It is a type of obstructed labour in which the anterior shoulder of the fetus fails to deliver after the emergence of the head. Risk factors Diabetes Fetal macrosomia Procedures used in the management of shoulder dystocia McRobes maneuver - The mothers thighs are abducted and flexed onto her abdomen. Rubin I maneuver (suprapubic pressure) Rubin II maneuver (posterior pressure on anterior shoulder) Wood's corkscrew maneuver - This is performed only if suprapubic pressure and McRobes maneuver are unsuccessful.

The duration of hypeension, degree of blood pressure control, and current therapy are asceained. Those women who require multiple medications for control or those who are poorly controlled carry greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Tell women who take antihypeensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs or chlorothiazide that the limited evidence available has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such treatments.Angiotensin-Conveing Enzyme InhibitorsThese drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters. These include oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria, and renal dysfunction Some studies also suggest teratogenic effects, and because of this, they are not recommended at any time during pregnancy.Angiotensin - receptor blockers act in a similar manner. But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin-II, they inhibit binding to its receptor.They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition; Chapter 50; Chronic Hypeension",C

What is the probable diagnosis?",Neurofibromatosis,Sturge Weber,Tuberous sclerosis,Incontinentia Pigmenti,"Essentials of Diagnosis & Typical Features of Tuberous sclerosis: Facial angiofibromas or subungual fibromas. Often hypomelanotic macules, gingival fibromas. Retinal hamaomas. Coical tubers or subependymal glial nodules, often calcified. Renal angiomyolipomas. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. Up to 20% of patients with infantile spasms (a serious epileptic syndrome) have tuberous sclerosis. Ninety-six percent of patients have one or more hypomelanotic macules, facial angiofibromas, ungual fibromas, or shagreen patches. Adenoma sebaceum, the facial skin hamaomas, may first appear in early childhood, often on the cheek, chin, and dry sites of the skin where acne is not usually seen. Mental retardation occurs in up to 50% of patients referred to teiary care centers; the incidence is probably much lower in randomly selected patients. Patients with seizures are more prone to mental retardation or learning disabilities. Diagnostic studies: More helpful is MRI or CT scanning; the latter can show the viually pathognomonic subependymal nodular calcifications and sometimes widened gyri or tubers and brain tumors. Contrast material may show the often classically located tumors near the interventricular foramen. Hypomyelinated lesions may be seen with MRI.

In a girl with sexual infantilism and defective smell sensation which of the following is the likely diagnosis transmitted by sex chromosome?,Kallman's syndrome,Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauster syndrome,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,McCune-Albright syndrome,"Ans. a (Kallman's syndrome) (Ref. H -18th/Ch. 339).Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic GnRH synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. The syndrome also may be associated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and neurologic abnormalities such as mirror movements. Defects in the X-linked KAL gene impair embryonic migration of GnRH neurons from the hypothalamic olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. Autosomal recessive (i.e., GPR54, K1SS1) and dominant (i.e., FGFR1) modes of transmission have been described. Males present with delayed puberty and pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis, probably the result of low testosterone levels during infancy. Females present with primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development.Kallmann syndrome and other causes of congenital GnRH deficiency are characterized by low LH and FSH levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol).Long-term Rx of men with hCG or testosterone restores pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics; women can be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestin. Fertility also may be restored by the administration of gonadotropins or by using a infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, pulsatile GnRH.Kallmann's syndromeis an X-linked disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is associated with anosmia. It more commonly affects men than women.McCune-Albright syndromeis characterized by patchy cutaneous hyperpigmentation, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and several endocrine disorders including toxic multinodular goiter.Testicular feminization syndrome (complete androgen insensitivity syndrome)A genetic disorder that makes XY fetuses insensitive to androgens (male hormones)Instead, they are born looking externally like normal girls. Internally, there is a short blind-pouch vagina and no uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. There are testes in the abdomen or the inguinal canal.Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster- Hauster syndromeCongenital absence of the uterus is usually associated with absent vagina.

Newer progestational contraceptives primarily act by:,Oviductal motility,Uterine endometrium,Cervix,Inhibiting ovulation,"FOGSI is Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India and the highest governing body in Obs and Gynae in India.
Progesterone only pills act mainly by causing thickening of cervical mucus.
Progesterone only pills
Mechanism of action of POP's is mainly on cervical mucus -

""All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently.""
The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4.hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside.
Unlike COC's that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. ""A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 lig desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestrel the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation"". - FOGSI Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41
Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation.

Remember

Traditional POP's are also known as Low-dose progestogen only pills.                                                    
Main progesterone used are:  
 Norethisterone 350 mcg
Norgestrel 75 mcg
Levonorgesterel 30 mcg

Mild disease can be treated by surgical removal of implants at the time of diagnosis followed by continuous administration of low dose combination oral pills to prevent recurrence. More advanced disease can be treated medically for 6 months, followed by continuous OCP's to prevent disease progression. The question now arises - which medical therapy is best suited for young women. Danazol causes virilising side effects and so not should be given to young women. GnRH causes severe osteoporosis and without backup therapy (like progesterone, OCP or tibolone) should not be used in young women especially in adolescent less than 16 years.

True statement regarding twin delivery is:,First twin has more chances of asphyxia,Second twin has more chances of developing polycythemia,Second twin has more chances of developing hyaline membrane disease.,Increased mortality in first twin.,"Twin pregnancy in general is associated with higher incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality.
Perinatal mortality in twins is 5 times greater than in singleton pregnancies.
Perinatal mortality in twins varies with birth order and the type of placentation.
 “Second twins do not do as well as the first twin…perinatal mortality being 9% for the first twin and 14% for the second twin”.

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 297

Also monochorionic—monoamniotic twins have a poor prognosis, perinatal mortality being 50%.
Now with this background lets see each option separately.

Option a: First twin has more chances of asphyxia—incorrect as:

“Asphyxia and stillbirth are more common (in twin pregnancy) due to increased prevalence of pre-eclampsia, malpresentations, placental abruption and increased operative interferences. The second baby is more atrisk.

Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 206
Option b: Second twin has more chances of developing polycythemia:

This statement can be true as second baby has more chances of asphyxia which can stimulate erythropoeisis in the second twin. Also there are chances of bleeding from the first twin into the second twin in case of monochorionic twins which can cause polycythemia.

Option c: Second twin has more chances of developing hyaline membrane disease—this is incorrect as is evident from the following lines of Williams:

“As measured by determination of the lecithin and sphingomyelin ratio, pulmonary maturation is usually synchronous in twins.”

Williams 23/e, p 880

Hence second twin does not have increased chances of developing hyaline membrane disease.
Coming to the last option—Increased mortality in first twin (option d)",B

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is most useful for which of the following gynecological malignancies:,Carcinoma endometrium,Carcinoma cervix,Carcinoma vulva,Carcinoma vagina,"Ans. C. Carcinoma vulvaVulvar carcinoma is the most promising site for sentinel lymph node biopsy strategy. Studies suggest that a sentinel node can be identified in most patients. Sentinel node is always located in the groin making vulva an ideal site for sentinel node biopsy'. 'The detection of SLN is currently a standard component of the surgical treatment of malignant melanoma, breast cancer and is a promising staging technique for patients with vulvar cancer. In cervical cancer SLN mapping is more recent and preliminary studies indicate that it may be a feasible technique' - 'Trends in Cervical Cancer' by Varaj Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy for Gynaecological Malignanciesa. The sentinel lymph node is defined as the first draining lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from the tumor site. A negative sentinel lymph node would thus predict the absence of lymph node metastasis in the entire draining basin.b. Sentinel lymph node evaluation in female genital tract cancers is relatively new and a number of promising studies are under evaluation.c. The concept has shown most promising results in vulvar cancer followed by cervical cancer.d. (SLN is however not yet accepted as a standard procedure for either of these). For endometrial cancer the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been studied by small studies and requires further larger studies. Results from current studies are favorable but not to the same extent as vulvar and cervical cancers.e. For vaginal cancer the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy is very new and studies are limited mainly to case reports.",C

It does not cause postmenopausal bleeding.# There may rarely be rupture or torsion of an endometrioma, irregular menses or cyclical problems with rectal bleeding, tenesmus, diarrhea, constipation, haemoptysis, dysuria, ureteric colic or scar pains.# The chance of conception may be as low as half that of the normal population (infertility).Investigations# Laproscopy is the best diagnostic measure.# Laparoscopically, endometriosis may appear white or red (active lesions), black/brown 'Powder9 burns or burn matchstick like lesions or white plaques of old collagen.# There may also be circular defects in the peritoneum (peritoneal windows/Allemmaster syndrome) or endometriomas with 'chocolate' fluid containing debris from cyclical menstruation.# Chocolate cysts of ovaries represents the most important manifestation of endometriosis.Medical treatment# Drugs are not indicated for the RX of asymptomatic, minimal endometriosis in patients wishing to conceive.# Recurrence after treatment is common.# All therapies suppress ovulation, thus conception is unlikely with good compliance.# For symptomatic endometriosis, continuous progestogen therapy, e.g., medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg TID for 90 days is most cost effective, has fewer side-effects and is more suitable for long-term use compared with more expensive alternatives. It acts by producing a state of pseudo-pregnancy, which ultimately leads to regression of the disease .# Another very cost effective alternative suitable for long term use is the continuous low-dose OCpills.# Second line drugs (alternative therapy) are the GnRH analogues, which can be administrated by nasal spray or implants (e.g., nafarelin, buseralin, goseralin, leuproelin), and the danazol 200 mg OD-TID.# Danazol is mildly anabolic, androgenic, anti-estrogenic and anti-progestational drug which acts by inhibiting pituitary gonadotropins (AIIMS-93). It causes pseudomenopause.# Its side effects are atrophy of the breasts, weight gain, hirsutism, excessive sweating, depression, & vaginitis# Conservative treatment: This may be carried out at laproscopy or laprotomy and includes diathermy destruction or laser vaporization of endometriosis deposits. Adhesions may be divided. It is also possible to enucleate or excise endometriomas.# Advantages of laser therapy in treatment of endometriosis are:- Precise tissue destruction- Minimum damage to surrounding tissues.- Relatively bloodless field- Promotes tissue healing without adhesion formation.Surgical treatment# Radical surgery (BSO +/- TAH) This may be indicated for those in whom fertility is no longer required.

Uterine blood flow at term is?,800-1200 ml/min,50-70 ml/min,175-200 ml/min,500-750 ml/min,"The massively increased uterine blood flow necessary to maintain pregnancy is made possible by significant hyperophy and remodeling of all pelvic vessels. After delivery, their caliber diminishes to approximately the size of the pre pregnant state. Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 ml/min in non pregnant states to about 750 ml near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of utero-placental an feto-placental vasodilation. The vasodilation is due to smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, oestrogen, nitric oxide, prostaglandins and ANP.

Deep white matter lesion with bilateral deep bright thalamic appearance is suggestive of which disease?,Alexander disease,Canavan's diseases,Krabbe's disease,Metachromatic leukodystrophy,"Deep white matter lesion along with the involvement of thalamus suggests Krabbe's disease. The deficient lysosomal enzyme in Krabbe disease is galactocerebrosidase (GALC; also called galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase); it normally degrades galactocerebroside to ceramide and galactose. The deficiency results in the accumulation of galactocerebroside; a toxic metabolite, psychosine, leads to the early destruction of oligodendrocytes and depletion of lipids in the cerebral white matter. The EEG shows nonspecific slowing without spikes, and the CSF protein is usually elevated (70 to 450 mg/dL). CT scanning and MRI reveal symmetrical nonenhancing areas of increased density in the internal capsules and basal ganglia. C.T. shows diffuse symmetric attenuation of the cerebellar and cerebral white matter in Alexander's disease. The onset is in infancy with a failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, spasticity of the craniospinal musculature, and seizures. An early and progressive macrocephaly has been a consistent feature.Pathologically, there are severe destructive changes in the cerebral white matter, most intense in the frontal lobes. Distinctive eosinophilic hyaline bodies, most prominent just below the pia and around blood vessels, are seen throughout the cerebral coex, brainstem, and spinal cord. These have been identified as Rosenthal fibers and probably represent glial degradation products. C.T. scan demonstrates degeneration of the white matter most prominent in the frontal lobes. Canavan's disease. C.T. scan shows diffuse white matter degeneration primarily in the cerebral hemispheres with less involvement in the cerebellum and brainstem in Metachromatic leukodystrophy. This is another of the lysosomal (sphingolipid) storage diseases. The abnormality is the mutation of the gene for enzyme arylsulfatase A, which prevents the conversion of sulfatide to cerebroside (a major component of myelin) and results in an accumulation of the former. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. Ref: Ropper A.H., Samuels M.A. (2009). Chapter 37. Inherited Metabolic Diseases of the Nervous System. In A.H.

So, orchidopexy should be done at 6 months, because spontaneous descend of the testis will not occur after 4 months of age. B) Why before 2 years 1. To prevent infeility Undescended testis is normal at bih histologically, but pathological changes develop by 6-12 months that results in infeility.

Head delivery by flexion occurs in:,Brow presentation,Face presentation,OP vertex presentation,OA Vertex presentation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Face presentation * Flexion: is the movement by which the head is delivered in mentoanterior position when the submental region hinges below the symphysis. The vulva is much distended by the submento-vertical diameter 11.5 cm.* Following internal rotation, the mentum is below the maternal symphysis, and delivery occurs by flexion of the fetal neck. As the face descends onto the perineum, the anterior fetal chin passes under the symphysis and flexion of the head occurs, making delivery possible with maternal expulsive forces. The above mechanisms of labor in the term infant can occur only if the mentum is anterior and at term, only the mentum anterior face presentation is likely to deliver vaginally. If the mentum is posterior or transverse, the fetal neck is too short to span the length of the maternal sacrum and is already at the point of maximal extension. The head cannot deliver as it cannot extend any further through the symphysis and cesarean delivery is the safest route of delivery.* Option (a) persistent brow presentation , vaginal delivery is not possible 8c will require LSCS* Option (b) as the head is extented, delivery occurs by flexion.# In mento anterior face, a vaginal delivery is possible.# Mento posterior face, vaginal delivery is not possible 8c requires LSCS* Option (c) & (d): in both the head is flexed 8c delivery takes place by extension.",B

Which of the following is the least common cause of ambiguous genitalia in a female child,Fetal placental steroid sulfatase deficiency,Fetal placental aromatase deficiency,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,WNT-4 gene mutation,"Ambiguous genitalia is a rare condition in which an infant&;s external genitals don&;t appear to be clearly either male or female. In a baby with ambiguous genitalia, the genitals may be incompletely developed or the baby may have characteristics of both sexes. The external sex organs may not match the internal sex organs or genetic sex. How ambiguous genitalia occurs A disruption of the steps that determine sex can result in a mismatch between the appearance of the external genitals and the internal sex organs or the genetic sex (XX or XY). A lack or deficiency of male hormones in a genetic male fetus can cause ambiguous genitalia, while exposure to male hormones during development results in ambiguous genitalia in a genetic female. Mutations in ceain genes can influence fetal sex development and cause ambiguous genitalia. Chromosomal abnormalities, such as a missing sex chromosome or an extra one, also can cause ambiguous genitalia. In some cases, the cause of ambiguous genitalia may not be determined. Possible causes in genetic females Causes of ambiguous genitalia in a genetic female may include: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Ceain forms of this genetic condition cause the adrenal glands to make excess male hormones (androgens). Prenatal exposure to male hormones.Ceain drugs that contain male hormones or that stimulate production of male hormones in a pregnant woman can cause developing female genitals to become more masculine. A developing baby also may be exposed to excess male hormones if the mother has a disease or condition that causes hormone imbalance. Tumors. Rarely, a tumor in the mother can produce male hormones. Possible causes in genetic males Causes of ambiguous genitalia in a genetic male may include: Impaired testicle development. This may be due to genetic abnormalities or unknown causes. Androgen insensitivity syndrome. In this condition, developing genital tissues don&;t respond normally to male hormones made by the testes. Abnormalities with testes or testosterone. Various abnormalities can interfere with the testes&; activity. This may include structural problems with the testes, problems with production of the male hormone testosterone or problems with cellular receptors that respond to testosterone. 5a-reductase deficiency. This enzyme defect impairs normal male hormone production. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

This medication is a long-acting synthetic analogue of vasopressin. The medication acts at V2 receptors, which are found on renal tubule cells, and mediates an anti-diuretic effect by increasing water permeability and water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine output. It is effective in 70% of patients with increased nocturnal urine output. Detrusor muscle tone is under control of the parasympathetic system. DDAVP does not affect this system. Some sympathomimetic drugs may cause enough wakefulness so that the child perceives the urge to void . Dextroamphetamine sulfate is one such medication. The external sphincter is under somatic nervous control. This medication does not contribute to this system. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior. In W.W.

"Preterm baby with PDA, which is the least likely findings?",CO2 washout,Bounding pulses,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Necrotising enterocolitis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., CO2 washout PDA in preterm neonate o In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:? 1) Normal neonate :- Ductus aeriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of bih. 2) PDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus aeriosus beyond 24 hours after bih is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. 3) PDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus aeriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. i) Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). ii)Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is commonplace, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. o So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not normal term neonate in which ductus aeriosus closes within 15 hours of bih). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate 1) Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; 2) A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; 3) Carbon dioxide retention; 4) Increasing oxygen dependence; 5) X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and 6) Hepatomegaly o Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a PDA is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. o The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preterm infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",A

Vulval carcinoma metastasizes to which lymph group :,Para aoic nodes,Superficial inguinal nodes,Internal iliac nodes,External iliac nodes,"Ans. is b i.e. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes Vulvar cancer spreads by the following routes : Direct extension, to involve adjacent structures such as the vagina, urethra, and anus Hematogenous spread to distant sites, including the lungs, liver, and bone Lymphatic embolization : At first the superficial inguinal nodes are involved through lymphatic emboli, but later lymphatic channel permeation is seen. The malignancy spreads to deep nodes. and gland of Cloquet to the external iliac glands, obturator and common iliac nodes, in the late stages. Thus inguinal, femoral and pelvic lymph nodes are involved in vulvar cancer. But most impoant amongst these are inguinal-femoral nodes. ""The overall incidence of inguinal-femoral lymph node metastasis is repoed to be about 30%. Metastasis to pelvic nodes occur in about 12% of cases. Pelvic nodal metastasis are rare (0.6%) in the absence of groin node involvement.""",B

A female at 37 wks of gestation has mild labour pain for 10 hours and cervix is persistently 1CM dilated but non effaced. What will be next appropriate management ?,Sedation and wait,Augmentation with syntocin,Cesarean section,Amniotomy,"Sedation and wait It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour Latent phase of the labour is difficult to define. It stas with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix stas dilating at an active rate. A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phase Active phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs. Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal poion of active phase dilatation. This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic dispropoion. Prolonged latent phase The diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours.(In the question the cervix is dilated.for I cm for the last 10 hrs). More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase. This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods. Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes. A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic rest. 843 For this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate. Patients in false labour Sleep for a few hours and awake without contractions. Patietns in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period. The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours. These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation. To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity. - Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase. - A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest. The degree of cervical dilatation is also impoant. - 60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm. Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase. - Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced - If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase. Management There are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase. - Therapeutic rest - Oxytoein stimulation.",A

Quintero staging is used for:,Twin to twin transfusion syndrome,Twin reversed arterial perfusion,Discordant twins,Monoamniotic twins,"Ans. A. Twin to twin transfusion syndromeTwin Twin Transfusion Syndrome: TttsOccurs in monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation resulting from unidirectional flow through deep arteriovenous anastomoses in the shared placenta. In this syndrome blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor may eventually become anemic and its growth may be restricted. In contrast, the recipient becomes plethoric, develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops, polycythemic, may develop hyperviscosity and Occlusive thrombosis is another concern. Finally, polycythemia in the recipient twin may lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus.TTTS is diagnosed based on two criteria:(1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy(2) hydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 8cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 2cm in the other twin.TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero (1999) staging system:Stage I--urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin.Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder.Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin.Stage V--demise of either fetus.Treatment - laser ablation of the vascular anastomoses",A

All of the following are true about regional blood flow in pregnancy except :,Uterine blood flow at term is 750 ml/min,Blood flow through skin decreases,Renal blood flow increases by 50%,Pulmonary blood flow increase,"REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW: Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 mL/min in non-pregnant state to about 750 mL near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of uteroplacental and fetoplacental vasodilatation. The vasodilatation is due to the smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, estrogen, nitric oxide (endothelium derived factor), prostaglandins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In a normal pregnancy, vascular system becomes refractory to angiotensin II, endothelin I and other pressure agents. Pulmonary blood flow (normal 6000 mL/min) is increased by 2500 mL/min. Renal blood flow (normal 800 mL) increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term. The blood flow through the skin and mucous membranes reaches a maximum of 500 mL/min by 36th week. Heat sensation, sweating or stuffy nose in pregnant woman is thus explained.

The patient is in active stage of labour once the cervix is effaced and dilated till 3 cm, following this the rate of dilatation is 1 cm/hour in cases of primigravidas and 1.5 cm/hour in cases of multigravidasThe beginning of the 2 stage of labour is characterized by the complete dilatation and the effacement of the cervixThe main aim of the 2 stage of the labor is the expulsion of the foetus through the female reproductive tract. The 2 stage consists of engagement, progressive flexion and descent, internal rotation, restitution, external rotation and lateral flexion for the delivery of the trunk.Engagement occurs when the greatest possible transverse diameter of the foetus enters the pelvic brim.Flexion and descent are the processes which occurs constantly during the 2 stage.Internal rotation is the most important step occurring in the 2 stage.Expulsion of the placenta is the 3 stage of labor which immediately follows the expulsion of the foetus.Once the baby is expelled, active management of the third stage of labour is recommended. In this immediately post the delivery of the baby, and after ensuring that the uterus is adequately contracted, controlled cord traction, uterine massage and administration of uterotonics is carried out.",A

Which of the following strategy has been recommended to reduce the heredity risk for ovarian cancer in women with BRCA - 1 and BRCA - 2 mutations:,Use of oral contraceptive pills,Screening with transvaginal ultrasound,Screening with CA - 125,Prophylactic oophorectomy,"As discussed in previous question:
• BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumour suppressor genes.
• Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant.
Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer
• Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology.
Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations.
a. Prophylactic oophorectomy:
“The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oophorectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BS0) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%.”
• Additional benefit of prophylactic oophorectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%.
b. Oral contraceptive pills:
• Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oral contraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is short term increased risk of developing breast cancer.
c. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound:
“In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA125 blood testing should be done”.
• Best method of prevention: Prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO at 35 years or as soon as family is complete.
• 2nd line: OCP’s + screening
• Screening: TVS + Ca 125 started at 35 years and done every 6 or 12 months, breast screening by MRI and mamography at 30 years done annually.",D

"A newborn with ambiguous genitalia and a 46,XY karyotype develops vomiting, low serum sodium concentration, and high serum potassium. Which of the following proteins is most likely to be abnormal?",21-hydroxylase,An ovarian enzyme,5a-reductase,An androgen receptor,"Sex steroids are synthesized from cholesterol by side chain cleavage (employing a P450 enzyme) to produce pregnenolone.Pregnenolone is then conveed to testosterone in the testis, to estrogen in the ovary, and to coicosterone and aldosterone in the adrenal gland. The enzymes 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, 11b-hydroxylase, and 18-hydroxylase modify pregnenolone to produce other sex and adrenal steroids. Deficiencies in adrenal 21-hydoxylase can thus lead to inadequate testosterone production in males and produce ambiguous external genitalia. Such children can also exhibit low sodium and high potassium due to deficiency of the more distal steroids, coisol and aldosterone. 5a-reductase conves testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and its deficiency produces milder degrees of hypogenitalism without salt wasting.

According to me the best answer is 4 months because renal involvement may be seen up to 3 months after the onset of other symptoms (examiner is asking about the renal involvement after onset of disease, not after the onset of other symptoms).
""Renal manifestations usually start at the onset or within 3 months of the onset of other symptoms"" — Pediatric nephrology

When there is no feilization of the ovum, the endometrial cells die because;",The involution of corpus luteum causes estradiol and progesterone levels to fall dramatically,LH levels rise after ovulation,Estradiol levels are not involved in the LH surge phenomenon,Estradiol inhibits the induction of the progesterone receptor in the endometrium,"The stimulus for the corpus luteum to continue its function of progesterone production is LH. This stops after the 10th day of its formation in the absence of pregnancy. As the corpus luteum involutes, the levels of estrogen and progesterone falls and leads to a withdrawl bleed due to absence of progesterone that was suppoing the estrogen primed endometrium. Once pregnancy ensues , the hCG made from the syncytiotrophoblast is the stimulator for continuous corpus luteum function till around 12th week of gestation after which the placenta takes over the function of pregnancy maintenance.",A

A neonate has ABO incompatibility. Peripheral smear will showaEUR',Microspherocytes,Elliptocytes,Fragmented RBCs,Polychromophilia,"Microspherocytes ABO incompatibilityis usually a mild hemolytic disease that causes mild to moderate anemia. Ilemolysis associated with ABO incompatibility exclusively occurs in type ""0"" mothers with fetuses who have type A or type B blood. - The naturally occurring antibodies in ABO blood group (A, B, AB) is of the ""IgM class"" and it cannot cross the placenta. - As compared with the other ABO blood groups that have predo- minantly IgM antibodies group 0 mothers also have significant amount of naturally occurring ""IgG antibody"". -These IgG antibodies can easily cross the placenta and produce hemolysis in,fetus. ABO incompatibility usually causes mild hemolysis and anemia. The lack of severity of hemolytic disease can be attributed to the following factors. - There is wide expression of A and B antigens not only on red cells but also in plasma and other cells which will paially neutralize maternally derived ABO antibodies. - In addition, fetal RBC's are not .fully developed in the infant and they express less number of A and B antigenic sites, hence the low incidence of significant hemolysis in affected neonates. Therefore in ABO incompatibility, hyperbilirubinemia is the predo- minaret manifestation of incompatibility (rather than anemia). The peripheral blood picture in these patients show Micro.spherocytesQ Reticulocytosis Polychromasia (not as characteristically seen as in other hemolytic anemias) Microspherocytes Spherocytes are associated with allt0i117177Une hemolytic anemias as the cell membrane of antibody coated RBC is lost .following interaction of RBC's with splenic macrophages. The slow. .flow of blood through the spleen provides an ample oppounity for the macrophage to come in contact with coated RBC's. The macrophages subsequently removes a poion of the RBC membrane and release the RBC in the spherocy- tic form with a typically decreased surface area to volume ratio. Note : Microspherocytes are characteristically seen in of ABO incompati- bility but in the other hemolytic disease of the newborn, i.e. erythroblastosis fetalis, they are characteristically absent. Polychromasia Polychromasia can be seen in ABO incompatibility but is not characteristic as in any other hemolytic anemia Polychromasia refers to variation in erythrocyte coloration - This variation is largely related to be maturation of the erythrocytes - The younger form owing to the presence of nucleus or RNA, stains blue, with Romanowsky stains where as mature forms due to the absence of nuclear material will stain uniformly orange pink. - Polychromasia is usually seen when RBC is released prematurely from the bone 111(1i-row to compensate for the blood loss. They are usually associated with hemolysis - In these conditions there is an increased erythroid response from the bone marrow - Immature RBC's or reticulocytes move into the circulation from the bone marrow. These RBC's have nucleus (if they are upto normoblast stage, or RNA's (as in reticulocytes) - These immature BBC's stain blue with Romanowsky stains. In ABO incompatibility in the newborn hemolysis is mild, the compensatory erythroid response from the bone marrow too would be mild. That means few immature RBC's move into the circulation from bone marrow therefore polychromasia is not so prominent.",A

Right Sided Isomerism is associated with:,Asplenia,One spleen,Two spleens,Polysplenia,"Cardiosplenic syndrome or Heterotaxy Syndrome 

Normal arrangement of organs and vessels within the body is called 'Sims solitus Complete reversal of organs and vessels within the body is called ""situs invertus"". Incomplete reversal/Random reversal of body organs is called ""Situs ambiguous"".
Heterotaxy refers to the variation in the normal arrangement of organs and vessels within the body.
Visceral heterotaxy (Situs ambiguous) is primarily classified on the bases of the position of spleen which is embryologically destined to be a left sided organ. Other normal assymetrical viscera are placed more or less sym­metrically.
Situs ambiguous or situs indeterminus is generally expressed in two major forms based on the position of spleen and whether the body resembles the normal right side or normal left side of the body.

(i) Right isomerism (Asplenia)

The spleen is typically absent and hence either side of midline resembles right side.
Therefore, it is also called bilateral right sidedness.
It is usually associated with severe complex cardiac abnormalities and has poor prognosis.

(ii) Left isomerism (Polysplenia)

There are multiple small spleens placed on either side of midline, therefore, either side of the midline resembles the left (splenic) side.
Thus, it is also called bilateral left sideness.
It is associated with less severe cardiac abnormalities and has relatively better prognosis.",A

Sometimes due to dense adhesions around the Cu T, a laparotomy may be required to remove it.

Oxytocin should be discontinued if the number of uterine contractions persists with frequency more than,5 per 10 minutes,5 per 15 minutes,5 per 20 minutes,Any of the above,"Ans. a (5 per 10 minutes) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 22)Oxytocin is a nanopeptide, synthesized in hypothalamus (Paraventricular nucleus) but stored and released by posterior pituitary. Its half life of 3-4 minutes. Alcohol inhibits its release. Uses: Stimulates labor, uterine contractions, milk let-down; controls uterine hemorrhage. Oxytocin when used for stimulation of labour should be discontinued if the number of contractions persists with a frequency > 5 in a 10-min period or 7 in a 15-min period or with a persistent nonreassuring FHR pattern.INTRAVENOUS OXYTOCIN ADMINISTRATION for stimulation of labour# The goal of induction or augmentation is to effect uterine activity sufficiently to produce cervical change and fetal descent while avoiding development of a nonreassuring fetal status.# Discontinuation of oxytocin nearly always rapidly decreases the frequency of contractions.# When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma rapidly falls because the mean half-life is approximately 5 min.# It is found that a uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion and that a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes.# Response depends on -- preexisting uterine activity,- cervical status,- pregnancy duration, and- individual biological differences.# The uterine response to oxytocin increases from 20 to 30 weeks and increases rapidly at termEducational point:# Maximal Dosage of oxytocin- The maximal effective dose of oxytocin to achieve adequate contractions in all cases is not known.- Wen and colleagues found that the likelihood of progression to a vaginal delivery decreases at and beyond an oxytocin dosage of 36 mU/min.- At a dosage of 72 mU/min, however, half of the nulliparas were delivered vaginally.- Thus, if contractions are not adequate--less than 200 Montevideo units--and if the fetal status is reassuring andlabor has arrested, an oxytocin infusion dose greater than 48 mU/min has no apparent risks.Hypothalamic/pituitary drugs DRUGCLINICAL USE1.GHGH deficiency, Turner syndrome.2.Somatostatin (octreotide)Acromegaly, carcinoid, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, esophageal varices.3.OxytocinStimulates labor, uterine contractions, milk let-down; controls uterine hemorrhage.4.ADH (DDAVP)Pituitary (central, not nephrogenic) Dl.",A

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the contraceptive effect of bih control pills that contain both synthetic estrogen and progestin?,Direct inhibition of oocyte maturation,Inhibition of ovulation,Production of uterine secretions that are toxic to developing embryos,Impairment of implantation hyperplastic changes of the endometrium,"The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Thus, the Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in bih control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses.",B

"A 16-year-old girl has not yet reached menarche. She has normal secondary sex characteristics, and visual inspection of her external genitalia is unremarkable. The patient is given progesterone and has withdrawal bleeding a few days later. This patient most likely has",Primary ovarian disease,Turner syndrome,A destructive hypothalamic disorder,A constitutional delay in pubey,"The patient most likely has a delayed onset of pubey rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e.g., imperforate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progesterone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring.Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with secondary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex characteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. The absence of secondary sex characteristics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics.In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a progesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ovaries must be normal. This test also rules out an end-organ defect. The following cha (paial list) provides a classification for these subdivisions of primary amenorrhea.",D

Management includes urgent laparotomy irrespective of period of gestation.
The ideal surgery is to remove the entire sac, fetus, placenta and membrane. This can be done if placenta is attached to a removable organ like uterus or broad ligament.
If placenta is attached to some vital organs, it is better to take out the fetus and leave behind the placenta and the sac after tying and cutting the cord with its placental attachment.

You have a patient who is very health-conscious and regularly ingests a large number of vitamins in mega doses and herbal therapies on a daily basis. She is a strict vegetarian as well. She is going to attempt pregnancy and wants your advice regarding her diet and nutrition intake. Which of the following is true regarding diet recommendations in pregnancy?,"Because herbal medications are natural, there is no reason to avoid these dietary supplements in pregnancy",It is recommended that in pregnancy the majority of the protein consumed be supplied from animal sources,Routine supplementation of vitamin A is necessary during pregnancy because dietary intake alone does not provide sufficient amounts needed during pregnancy,"During pregnancy, vegetarians obtain sufficient amounts of vitamin B12 in their diet needed for the fetus","The use of herbal remedies is not recommended during pregnancy because such products are classified as dietary supplements and therefore are not FDA-regulated for purity, safety, and efficacy. In fact, the actual ingredients of many herbal substances are not even known. There is almost no data regarding the teratogenic potential of herbal medications in humans. It is not recommended that women assume a vegetarian diet during pregnancy because animal sources of protein such as meat, poultry, fish, and eggs contain amino acids in the most desirable combinations. In addition, strict vegetarians can give birth to infants who are low in vitamin B12 stores because vitamin B12 occurs naturally only in foods of animal origin. Pregnant women do not need to take vitamin A supplements because adequate amounts can be obtained in the diet; in addition, a very high intake of vitamin A has been associated with the type of congenital malformations seen with oral Accutane use. Adequate vitamin C levels needed for pregnancy can be provided in a reasonable diet. No known fetal anomalies have been reported with vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy.",B

Which of the following condition is diagnosed by Marshall-Bonney test?,Stress incontinence,Urge incontinence,Vesico veginal fistula,Utero vesical fistula,"Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is defined as the complaint of involuntary leakage on effo or physical exeion or on coughing or sneezing. The cause is related to pelvic relaxation with age, resulting in descent of the trigone and proximal urethra. There is obliteration of the urethrovesical angle, which normally provides resistance at the bladder outlet. The diagnosis is made by the history and physical examination and urodynamic evaluation. Digital pressure applied to the paraurethral tissues in an anterior direction through the vagina reestablishes the urethrovesical angle and prevents stress incontinence (Marshall-Bonney test). Treatment includes behavioral therapy and perineal exercises; if unsuccessful, pharmacologic methods include oxybutynin and ephedrine. Definitive management is surgical.

Regarding IUGR,Abdominal circumference (AC) is the least sensitive parameter for detection of IUGR,In asymmetric IUGR head circumference/abdominal circumference (HC/AC) is reduced,Serial biparietal diameter (BPD) is the only important measurement in IUGR,AC indirectly reflects fetal liver size and glycogen storage,"‘AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
‘Serial measurements of AC (not BPD) and estimation of fetal weight are more diagnostic to fetal growth restriction’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio exceeds 1.0 before 32 weeks. It is approximately 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected
Pathophysiology: Basic pathology in small for gestational age is due to reduced availability of nutrients in the mother or its reduced transfer by the placenta to the fetus. It may also be due to reduced ultilization by the fetus. Brain cell size (asymmetric–SGA) as well as cell numbers (symmetric-SGA) are reduced. Liver glycogen content is reduced.

Cryosurgery is effective in all except:,Chronic cervicitis,Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL),Condyloma accuminata,Cases with severe dysplasia or CIS lesion,"Cryosurgery
This is a procedure whereby destruction of the tissue is effective by freezing.
Indications
• Cervical ectopy
• Benign cervical lesions—such as CIN (ideal for minor degree and localized CIN), condyloma acuminata, leukoplakia, etc.
• Condyloma acuminata of vulva and VIN diagnosed colposcopically and not more than 2 cm in size.
• VAIN, condyloma acuminata or vault granulation tissue following hysterectomy.
• As a palliative measure to arrest bleeding in carcinoma cervix or large fungating recurrent vulvar carcinoma.
Principle: It consists of a ‘probe’, the tip of which is cooled to a temperature below freezing point (– 60°C). Freezing produces cellular dehydration by crystallization of intracellular water and ultimately death of cells. This is effective by rapid expansion of gas which is passed through it. Carbon dioxide is widely used while nitrous oxide and liquid nitrogen are also used.
The application to the cervix freezes the tissue to a depth of about 3 mm. Healing is complete in 6 to 10 weeks.",D

There may also be decreased production of , low serum sodium concentrations (hyponatremia), and high serum <a href="" deficiency</a> accounts for 95% of all cases of CAH and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is due to a mutation of the CYP21 gene. It can occur in a classical or nonclassical form. The incidence of the classical form of CAH is roughly 1:15 000, while that of the nonclassical form is approximately 1:100. Classical CAH can be fuher divided into a salt-wasting form (75%) and a simple virilizing form (25%). 21-Hydroxylase is necessary for the production of coisol and aldosterone. Lack of this enzyme shunts intermediate steroid precursors toward androgen production. Symptoms are related to excess androgens and, in the salt-wasting form of classical CAH, decreased aldosterone. Aldosterone is necessary for normal sodium retention and potassium secretion by the kidney. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

These will compress the lower pa of the brain stem and upper cervical cord, resulting in life-threatening consequences. It usually occurs along with ascending or descending transtentorial herniation. (1) CINGULATE (SUBFALCINE) HERNIATION under falx cerebri. (2) CENTRAL (DOWNWARD TRANSTENTORIAL) HERNIATION through tentorial notch. (3) UNCAL (LATERAL MASS) HERNIATION over edge of tentorium. (4) CEREBELLAR TONSILLAR HERNIATION through foramen magnum. (5) TRANSCALVARIAL HERNIATION - swollen brain herniates through any defect in dura & skull. (2) - (4) types may cause death through brainstem compression. Cushing&;s triad is response to diminished brain stem perfusion, regardless of etiology.

This causes a characteristic coeur-en-sabot (boot-shaped) appearance as seen by chest X-ray.> Pathophysiology:> TOF generally results in low oxygenation of blood due to mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the left ventricle and preferential flow of blood from the ventricles to the aorta because of obstruction to flow through the pulmonary valve.> This is known as a right-to-left shunt. It is often evidenced by a bluish tint to the baby's skin (cyanosis).> However there are 'pink tests' in which the degree of obstruction in the right ventricular outflow tract is low.> Blood flows preferentially from the ventricles to the lungs and only minimal desaturation occurs in the systemic circulation beca use of mixing of saturated and desaturated blood in the ventricles.> This degree of desaturation may be undetectable to the eye and requires a pulse oximeter to identify it.> Even children who are generally not too deeply cyanosed (blue) may develop acute severe cyanosis or hypoxic 'tet spells> The precise mechanism of spelling is in doubt but certainly, this is a dangerous event and presumably results from an increas e in resistance to blood flow to the lungs with the increased preferential flow of desaturated blood to the body.> Untreated TOF, over the long term, results in progressive right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation due to the increased resists nee on the right ventricle.> This progresses to right heart failure and death.",B

Treatment of choice of stage III CIN in 40 year old female is :,Hysterectomy,Laser coagulation,Cryocoagulation,Cone excision,"Ans. is a i.e. Hysterectomy Before discussing the answer to this questions lets first have a look at the treatment modalities available in case of CIN Modalities for management of CIN Ablative procedures Cryotherapy * Loop electro surgical * Hysterectomy Laser Vaporisation Therapy excision (LEEP) * Conisation Ablative Procedures : They are performed in out patient setting (OPD procedures). They must only be performed when the following conditions exist : There is no evidence of micro invasion or invasive cancer (on cytology, colposcopy or ECC). The lesion is located on the ectocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). There is no involvement of the endocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). Cytology and histology correspond with each other Modalities available in Ablative procedure : Cryotherapy It destroys the surface epithelium of the cervix by crystallizing the intra cellular water, resulting in eventual destruction of the cell. Major advantage is its ability to control exactly the depth and width of destruction by It is useful when : It is paicularly useful in : - Small lesions - Larger lesions that cryoprobe cannot cover - CIN Grade I & II - Irregular cervix with a Fish Mouth appearance. - When lesion is located in ectocervix - Extension of the disease to vagina or satellite lesions on Vagina Lesions with extensive glandular involvement Depth of destruction = 4-5 mm * Depth of destruction = 7mm Complications : - Discharge (M/C) * Complications : - Slight discharge Bleeding (Rare) - Pain - Cervical Stenosis (Rare) - Bleeding - Infection (Rare) drawback of Ablative procedures : it destroys the tissue and so no tissue specimen is available for additional histological evaluation.deg Excici'InI Procedures :They can be used LEEP (Loop electrosurgical excision Cold Knife Conization procedure) or LLETZ= (Large loop excision of transformation zone) It is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. It is an OPD procedure & requires LA. Now it has become the procedure of choice for treating CIN II & CIN III. Complications are less & include : - Slight bleeding - Infection It is both diagnosis and therapeutic (Indications-given earlier) It is performed in 0.T and requires GA It refers to the excision of a cone shaped pa of cervix using a scalpel. Complications are more : - Paindeg - Bleedingdeg - Infectiondeg when Endocervix is involved as well Disadvantages of Excisional procedures : All Excisional procedures produce - Pregnancy complication. Cervical stenosisdeg Incompetent osdeg Aboiondeg Premature labourdeg Dystociadeg Advantage of excision procedures over ablative methods is tissue is available after excision method for fuher histological studies and Transformation zone is visible. Remember : In both ablative and excision methods patient should be followed with Pap smears every 3-4 months and by endocervical curettage (ECC), if endocervix is involved. As far as hysterectomy is concerned : ""Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for C1N1,2 or 3. However it may be considered when treating recurrent high grade cervical disease if childbearing has been completed or when a repeat cervical exicison is strongly indicated but technically not feasible."" But most of the other books say that : Large Loop excision of transformation zone has become the procedure of choice for management of CIN in many developed countries. But in developing countries where women are likely to default from follow up, hysterectomy is still the best option. According to Shaw 14/e, p 365 ? Hysterectomy is desirable in : * Older and parous women When a woman cannot comply with follow-up If uterus is associated with fibroids, DUB or prolapse. If micro invasion exists. If recurrence occurs following conservative therapy. According to Jeffocate 7/e, p 421 ? ""If smear remains or becomes positive after conservative surgery, total hysterectomy is indicated, but the ovaries need not be removed if the woman is premenopausal. There is also a place for totarhysterectomy as an elective procedure when micro-invasion is found on biopsy, or when the patient is more than 40 years of age.""

Patent truncus arteriosus leads to -,Both ventricular hypertrophy,Pulmonary oligemia,Ductus dependant flow,CCF at birth,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Both ventricular hypertrophy * In truncus arteriosus, a single arterial trunk (truncus arteriosus) arises from the heart and supplies the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulations. A VSD is always present, with the truncus overriding the defect and receiving blood from both the right and left ventricles.* The number of truncal valve cusps varies from 2 to as many as 6 and the valve may be stenotic, regurgitant, or both.* The electrocardiogram shows right, left, or combined ventricular hypertrophy.* Types:-i) Type I:- The pulmonary arteries can arise together from the posterior left side of the persistent truncus arteriosus and then divide into left and right pulmonary arteries.ii) Types II and III - No main pulmonary artery is present, and the right and left pulmonary arteries arise from separate orifices on the posterior (type II) or lateral (type III) aspects of the truncus arteriosus.iii) Type IV - No identifiable connection between the heart and pulmonary arteries, and pulmonary blood flow is derived from major aortopulmonary collateral arteries arising from the transverse or descending aorta; this is essentially a form of pulmonary atresia.* Both ventricles are at systemic pressure and both eject blood into the truncus. When pulmonary vascular resistance is relatively high immediately after birth, pulmonary blood flow may be normal; as pulmonary resistance drops in the 1st mo of life, blood flow to the lungs is greatly increased and heart failure ensues.* Truncus arteriosus is a total mixing lesion with complete admixture of pulmonary and systemic venous return.* Because of the large volume of pulmonary blood flow, clinical cyanosis is usually mild. If the lesion is left untreated, pulmonary resistance eventually increases, pulmonary blood flow decreases, and cyanosis becomes more prominent.* The clinical signs of truncus arteriosus vary with age and depend on the level of pulmonary vascular resistance. In the immediate newborn period, signs of heart failure are usually absent; a murmur and minimal cyanosis may be the only initial findings.* Over the next 1-2 month of life, pulmonary blood flow begins to become torrential and the clinical picture is dominated by heart failure, with still mild cyanosis.",A

True statement regarding Brain Tumor in children is:,is the most common tumor in children,Hydrocephalus is rare,Mostly is infra-tentorial,Papilledema is rare,"Infratentorial AVMs are rare entities that, in contrast to their supratentorial equivalents, present more commonly with hemorrhage (1.99 odds ratio, 1.07-3.69 95% CI). The size of the AVM is a controversial risk factor for the first bleeding episode, since different analyses have yielded contradictory results.
Patients with small infratentorial AVMs may present more frequently with hemorrhage than those with large AVMs, given that small malformations otherwise remain asymptomatic. Each episode of hemorrhage is accompanied by a 30% morbidity and a 10% mortality. Morbidity due to bleeding of posterior fossa AVMs is high given their critical location.
Patients with posterior fossa AVMs have a high mortality associated with the first hemorrhagic episode (66.7%).
In some studies, however, authors have found only a 27% mortality from the initial bleeding episode.36 Subsequent hemorrhagic episodes often result in devastating neurologic deficits and have a mortality of 35.7%. 8,13 Risk factors for hemorrhage identified for all brain AVMs—but not necessarily for infratentorial AVMs—include young age, large size of the malformation, deep venous drainage, associated aneurysms, and infratentorial location.",C

Resuscitation protocol o As soon as the baby is delivered, five signs are assessed ? Clearance of meconium Active breathing or crying Good muscle tone (flexed posture and active movement of baby). Pink color (look at tougue and lips) Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy). o If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required. o If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation. o The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps. Initial steps of resuscitation 1. Positioning The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended. This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress. 2. Suctioning The mouth and nose should be suctioned The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned. One should not inse the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction -4 Stimulation of posterior pharynx during the first few minutes after bih can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea. 3. Dry, stimulate and reposition After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss. A brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of good respiratory effos. 4. Free flow of oxygen If the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask. After providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs ?

Which one of the following is the most common problem associated with the use of condom:,Increased monilial infection of vagina,Premature ejaculation,Contact dermatitis,Retention of urine,"Directions for use of condom

The condom should be put on by unrolling it over the erect penis after pulling back the foreskin, before there is any contact between the male and female organs. An airfree space should be left by squeezing the tip and holding it up, till it is unrolled fully for better collection of semen.
It should be used only once.
It should not be inflated for testing.
Vaseline oils, skin lotions, cold creams, should not be used as they increase the chance of rupture. If lubrication is needed, glycerine, K-Y jelly or spermicidal jelly can be used.
Soon after discharge, the male should withdraw the penis holding the condom firmly against his body
To increase the effectiveness, a dose of spermicidal jelly or foam tablet may be used at the same time. In case of breakage, slippage, or defective use, women should report or use emergency contraceptive within 72 hours and a spermicidal agent should be quicldy inserted into the vagina.

Advantages of condom

Condoms gives very good protection against STDs. These includes syphilis gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, moniliasis, nongonococcal urethritis, and infection with Chlamydia and Herpes virus.
They are the only contraceptives to protect against HIV and against sexually transmitted hepatitis B Virus.
Condoms reduce the chances of developing cervical dysplasia and cancer cervix (by preventing HPV infection)

Unlike adults malignancy is exceptionally rare. In infants an anal fissure, necrotizing enterocolitis, intussusceptions and allergic enterocolitis are possible causes. In older children, more common causes includes an anal fissure, a juvenile polyp and certain gastroenteritides (e.g. Campylobacter infection); Meckel's diverticulum, duplication cyst and inflammatory bowel disease are less common. - Bailey and Love.Juvenile polyps are the most common type of childhood polyp, occurring in up to 1% of preschool children.

The typical radiographic changes occur at the distal ends of the long bones and are paicularly common at the knees. The shafts of the long bones have a ground-glass appearance because of trabecular atrophy. The coex is thin and dense, giving the appearance of pencil outlining of the diaphysis and epiphysis. The white line of Frankel, an irregular but thickened white line at the metaphysis, represents the zone of well-calcified cailage. The epiphyseal centers of ossification also have a ground-glass appearance and are surrounded by a sclerotic ring. The more specific but late radiologic feature of scurvy is a zone of rarefaction under the white line at the metaphysis.

Cervix carcinoma arises from :,Squamo-columnar junction,Isthmus,Cervical lip,Internal os,"Ans. is a i.e. Squamo-columnar Junction The cervix is lined by columnar epithelium which lines the endocervix (supravaginal pa of cervix) and squamous epithelium which lines the ectocervix (vaginal pa of cervix). The point at which they meet is called as Squamo-Columnar Junction (SCJ). The SCJ originally lies at the level of External OS. With response to hormonal stimulation the subcolumnar reserve cells present below the squamous epithelium undergoes metaplasia and replace the columnar epithelium. Thus location of SCJ is not fixed but keeps migrating and this called as Translormatior) cone The original SCJ can be recognized by Gland openings and Nabothian cysts. ""Nearly all cervical neoplasia, boh squamous and columnar develop within the transformation zone, usually adjacent to the new SCJ."" This is because theoretically, cervical cells underging metaplasia are more vulnerable to the oncogenic effects of HPV and cocarcinogens. Metaplasia is most active during adolescence and pregnancy that is why early age of sexual activity and first pregnancy are known risk factors for cervical cancer. In women exposed to Diethylstilbesterol (DES) in utero, the original SCJ is located on the vagina rather than on the cervix.",A

Causes of female pseudohermaphroditism –,17–alpha hydroxylase deficiency,21–alpha hydroxylase deficiency,Mixed gonadal dysgenesis,All of the above,"Ambiguous genitalia (Hermaphroditism)

Ambiguous genitalia is defined as a discrepancy between the external genitals and internal gonads.
They can be categorized : -


Female pseudohermaphroditism
Male pseudohermaphroditism
True hermaphroditism

Female pseudohermaphroditism.

Genotype is XX
Gonads are ovaries
External genitalia is virilized (male differentiation).
As there is no Mullarian inhibiting factor, Mullerian duct develops into uterus tubes and ovary. But due to the presence of androgen external genitalia are virilized.

Causes are:

Maternal virilizing tumour → Arrhenoblastoma
21 hydroxylase deficiency
11 beta hydroxylase deficiency

single most sensitive marker of intrauterine growth restriction in USG is :,AC,AFI,FL,BPD,"USG is extremely useful not only to diagnose the growth retardation but also to identify a fetus of symmetrical or asymmetrical one. Sonographic predictive values that are commonly used are: * Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio > 1.0 before 32 weeks,= 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected. Transcerebellar diameter correlates well with the gestational age. AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR. * Femur length (FL) is not affected in asymmetric IUGR. The FL/AC ratio is 22 at all gestational ages from 21 weeks to term. FL/AC ratio greater than 23.5 suggests IUGR. * Amniotic fluid volume--The reduced amniotic fluid volume is often associated with asymmetrical IUGR. A veical pocket of amniotic fluid < 1 cm suggests IUGR. An AFI between 5 and 25 cm is normal and an AFI less than 5 indicates oligohydramnios. * Anatomical survey: To exclude fetal anomalies by sonography Reference: Dutta,s Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page no 463.",A

Which of the following is the BEST indicator of ovarian reserve?,FSH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH ratio,Measurement of rise in basal FSH is an excellent indicator of ovarian aging. As women age serum FSH concentrations in the early follicular phase begins to increase due to a decline in the number of small follicles secreting inhibin. Day 3 FSH concentration greater than 20 to 25 IU/L is considered to be elevated and is associated with poor reproductive outcome. Measurement of serum E2 levels along with serum FSH adds to the predictive power of an isolated FSH determination.

Most common cause of UTI in pregnancy:,Proteus mirabilis,Group B b haemolytic streptococcus,E. coli,Klebsiella,"Ans. C. E. colia. Urinary tract infections are more concerning in pregnancy due to the increased risk of kidney infections.b. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, which leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys.c. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present, they do have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection.d. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection--even in the absence of symptoms--treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures).e. E coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI), accounting for approximately 80-90% of cases.

Which is the COMMONEST degenerative change that is observed in a uterine myoma?,Red degeneration,Hyaline degeneration,Malignant change,Haemorrhage,"The typical appearance of leiomyomas may change if normal muscle tissue is replaced with various degenerative substances following hemorrhage and necrosis. This process is collectively termed degeneration, and the replacement substances dictate the naming of these degenerative types. Forms include hyaline, calcified, cystic, myxoid, carneous or red, and fatty. Hyaline degeneration is the most common form of degeneration that can occur in a uterine leiomyoma. It is thought to occur in up to 60% of uterine leiomyomas. As with many other types of degeneration, it happens when fibroids outgrow their blood supply. Hyaline degeneration involves the presence of homogeneous eosinophilic bands or plaques in the extracellular space, which represent accumulation of proteinaceous tissue.

A woman treated for infertility presents with 6-week amenorrhea with urinary retention. The most likely etiology is:,Retroverted uterus,Pelvic hematocoele,Impacted Cervical Fibroid,Carcinoma Cervix,"The patient in the question:

Was being treated for infertility.
Now H/O 6 weeks of amenorrhea.
Presents with urinary retention.
The first diagnosis which comes in our mind is the retroverted gravid uterus.
Points which favour the diagnosis are: The woman is pregnant and has complained of urinary retention.
But friends, here it is important to understand that retroverted gravid uterus causes urinary retention at 14-15 weeks of gestation (not 6 weeks).                                                                                                                                                  

So Option ""a"" is ruled out
Option ""b"" Pelvic hematocele

""Pelvic hematocele is formed in a patient complaining of 6 weeks amenorrhea in case of ectopic pregnancy."" Though pelvic hematocele causes urine retention but then other symptoms (pain) and signs of ectopic pregnancy should be present.

Option ""c"" Impacted cervical fibroid

""A cervical fibroid impacted in the pouch of Douglas can cause retention of urine. The onset of retention is acute and usually occurs immediately before menstruation when the uterus is further enlarged by congestion or during early pregnancy.""
The fibroid is associated with infertility.
Thus, an impacted cervical fibroid can explain all features seen this woman and is our option of choice.",C

Ecchymoses, muscle hematomas, prolonged bleeding following trauma and hemahroses also are characteristic. PT and aPTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency. Diagnosis of factor XIII deficiency is established by demonstrating increased clot solubility in 5 M urea, dilute monochloroacetic acid, or acetic acid. Factor XIII activity also can be determined quantitatively by a chromogenic assay or by an incorporation assay. Ref: Seligsohn U., Zivelin A., Salomon O. (2010). Chapter 125.

A pregnant woman with fibroid uterus develops acute pain in abdomen with low grade fever and mild leucocytosis at 28 week. The most likely diagnosis is :,Preterm labour,Torsion of fibroid,Red degeneration of fibroid,Infection in fibroid,"Ans. is c I.e. Red degeneration of fibroid Friends, the answer is quite obvious but let's see how other options can be ruled out. Option ""a-Preterm labour Points in our Patient is pregnant Pain in abdomen at 28 weeks (Preterm labour is where labour stas before the 37'"" completed weeks. The lower limit is 28 wks in developing countries and 20 wks in developed countries Points against Preterm labour is diagnosed - When there are regular uterine contractions. (Not acute pain) With or without pain at least in every 10 minutes. Dilatation of cervix is > 2 cms -- Effacement of cervix = 80% - Length of cervix as measured by TVS < 2.5 cms & funneling of the internal OS. Pelvic pressure backache, vaginal discharge or bleeding. None of the above criteria are being fulfilled. Presence of leucocytosis & fever can also go against it as even if there is intraamniotic infection causing preterm labour - features like : fever, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness and fetal tachycardia are absent. Rather if these features are present it means a final stage of uterine infection has reached. And here our patient is having fever, Leukocytosis without regular uterine contractions (off and on pair) but with acute pain in abdomen so it can be ruled out . Points in our Points against Patient has fibroid (Though no mention has * Torsion is not associated with fever been made whether it is pedunculated and leucocytosis. or not, Remember torsion is seen in subserous pedunculated Myomas)deg Patient is complaining of acute pain in abdomen. Option ""d"" Infection of fibroid Points in our Points against Presence of fibroid * Acute pain in abdomen (Remember : Infection is common (Infection of fibroid will not cause acute pain in abdomen). in submucous fibroids)deg * Infection of fibroid occurs following aboion or labour Fever (Here patient is pregnant but there is no history of Option ""c"" Red degeneration of fibroid Red degeneration of fibroid : also called as Cameous degeneration. It is seen mostly during pregnancy mid pregnancydeg (But can occur at other times as well and in non pregnant females also).deg It is an aseptic condition.deg The myoma suddenly becomes acutely painfuldeg, enlargeddeg and tenderdeg.

Conditions associated with decreased variability of fetal hea rate are all EXCEPT:,Fetal movement,Chronic hypoxia,Sleep,Acidemia,"Fetal movement REF: Danfoh's Obstetrics and Gynecology, 10th Edition P.158 Increased variability (more than 25 beats per minute), or saltatory FHR pattern, is uncommon and most often represents an exuberant autonomic response of a normal fetus. Decreased (three to five beats per minute) or absent (zero to two beats per minute) FHR variability reflects diminished fetal CNS activity, usually attributable to fetal sleep cycles or to medications administered to the mother (e.g., analgesics, magnesium sulfate, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, atropine). Persistently decreased variability, however, may signal fetal acidosis. This is paicularly true in the presence of other FHR findings suggestive of hypoxia, including tachycardia, loss of reactivity, or repetitive decelerations.",A

"A 26 yr. old woman with a known case of mitral valve replacement done 2 years back for severe MS, currently on therapeutic anticoagulation with 5mg daily Warfarin, wants to conceive and has come for preconception counseling. All are true except:",The risk for warfarin embryopathy is around 6%,Warfarin should be stopped periconceptionally and switch over to heparin,Anticoagulation has to continue throughout pregnancy,The prognosis for her pregnancy depends on her NYHA class,"Ans. B. Warfarin should be stopped periconceptionally and switch over to heparinThe pregnancy outcome and prognosis of mitral stenosis is related to the functional capacity of the woman with the mortality rising considerably in the NYHA class III & IV group. Prognosis is also worsened when the mitral valve area is <2cm2. Therefore, pregnancy is contraindicated in these women and termination is advised. Such lesions should be treated, and cardiac status optimized before conceiving.Women who have undergone valve replacement are on therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin when they have a metallic valve in situ. Warfarin is the most effective for preventing maternal thromboembolic complications. But warfarin also leads to embryopathy, 6%, the risk being highest when the mean daily dose exceeded 5mg.Therefore, warfarin is stopped once pregnancy is confirmed and heparin is substituted till 12 weeks, following which warfarin is restarted for the remainder of pregnancy till 36 weeks. Warfarin is not recommended during labor as it can lead to post-partum hemorrhage.Beyond 36 weeks' heparin is started again because its effect can be controlled, it does not affect the synthesis of clotting factors and a specific antidote in the form of protamine sulfate is available. Heparin is also discontinued just before delivery.Anticoagulant therapy with warfarin or heparin may be restarted 6hr following vaginal delivery or 24hr after caesarean section.",B

An asymptomatic tumour is discovered during routine ultrasound scanning in early pregnancy. Symptomatic tumour however presents with abdominal pain in pregnancy. Corpus luteal cyst regresses after the 12th week and can therefore be observed. The benign tumour should be removed in the second trimester between the 14th and 16th week. Earlier surgery may increase the risk of aboion. In the third trimester surgical difficulty because of the growing uterus; preterm labour is also a possibility. The tumour discovered late in pregnancy should be removed in early puerperium to avoid torsion and infection.

"10 year old girl with primary amenorrhoea, absent breasts, malformed uterus. The most likely diagnosis:",MRKH syndrome,Turner's syndrome,Swyer syndrome,Mixed gonadal dysgenesis,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Turner's syndrome Swyer syndrome (Pure gonadal dysgenesis)Patients with pure gonadal dysgenesis have XY karyotype.In these cases primitive germ cells do not migrate to the genital ridge so testis will not develop instead, the patients have streak gonads.Normal testis secretes Mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone.Thus in these cases there is absence of mullerian inhibiting factor and Testosterone.So these patients have normal female internal and external genitaliaAbsence of MIF causes - Development of mullerian structures i.e. uterus, Fallopian tubeAbsence of testosterone stops the development of - wool lian duct structures i.e. seminal vesicle, prostateThese individuals are not able to produce any estrogen so they will not develop breast Mayor Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome :This is also known as Mullerian agenesis syndrome.In these cases patient does not develop mullerian structures i.e. uterus, Fallopian tube and upper portion of vagina.The breast development is normal in these patients.Mixed Gonadal dysgenesisMixed gonadal dysgenesis is a type of asymmetrical gonadal dysgenesis (one side is more developed than the other).In most of the cases there is a unilateral testis usually intraabdominal and a streak gonad on the contralateral side. Functionally the gonads are incompetent i.e. theyFailed to completely inhibit mullerian developmentFailed to support full differentiation of mesonephric duct structuresFailed to adequately masculinize development of external genitaliaOften fail to mediate their own descent, resulting in asymmetry of internal and external genitalis.The mullerian structures are present since no anti mullerian hormones are produced.The patient has normal uterus usually B/L fallopian tubes.The external genitalia are always masculinized.The breast is not developed.Turner's syndromeIn Turner's syndrome the gonads are not properly developed (streak gonads)The ovary is not properly developed and it cannot secrete adequate amount of estrogen.This leads to lack of secondary sexual characteristic.Breast is not developed properly.Uterus is not developed properly in most of the patients who have not received estrogen therapy.The crux is:MRKSNo uterusNormal breastPrimary AmenorrhoeaPure Gonadal dysgenesisNormal uterusPrimary amenorrhoeaNo breastMixed Gonadal dysgenics* Normal uterus Primary amenorrhoeaNo breastTurners syndromeUnderdeveloped uterusUndeveloped breastPrimary amenorrhoea",B

A most common cause of urinary obstruction in a male infant is –,Anterior urethral valves,Posterior urethral valves,Stone,Stricture,"""The most common cause of severe obstructive uropathy in children is posterior urethral valves"".___ Nelson
Posterior urethral valves

These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter.
It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum.
It occurs only in males.
It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty.
Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood.
Approximately 30% of patients experience end-stage renal disease
Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients.
Diagnosis is made by


Voiding cystourethrogram
Endoscopy


Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction.

Feilization of a secondary oocyte by a spermatozoan usually occurs in the,Cervical canal,Uterine cavity,Uterine poion of the uterine tube,Ampulla of the uterine tube,"After the secondary oocyte is released from the ovary, it is captured by the fimbriae of the uterine tube. In the uterine tube, the oocyte enters the funnel-shaped infundibulum, reaches the abdominal ostium, and passes through the ampulla. Here, a spermatozoan typically feilizes the oocyte. The feilized ovum or the unfeilized secondary oocyte then moves through the narrow isthmus of the uterine tube to reach the intramural or uterine poion of the tube (that pan of the tube that is within the wall of the uterus). After the feilized ovum enters the uterus, it implants in the uterine wall. By this time, the embryo has developed into the blastocyst stage. If passage of the feilized ovum through the uterine tube is restricted, implantation into the tubal wall may occur.",D

Clomiphene citrate is the initial treatment for most anovulatory infeile women. It is chemically similar to tamoxifen Clomiphene is a non steroidal triphenylethylene derivative which demonstrates both estrogen agonist and antagonist propeies (predominant). It is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml. Patient selection : Normal gonadotropicdeg normoprolactinemicdeg patients with normal cycle with absent or infrequent ovulation.deg PCOSdeg Post pill amenorrhea.deg Dose : Initial dose of 25 to 50mgdeg is given daily from D2 - D 5. Ovulation is expected to occur about 5 - 7 days after the last day of therapy. If ovulation doesnot occur, dose is increased in 50mg steps to a maximum of 250mg daily. (Although doses > 100 mg /day are not approved by FDA). Therapy is in given for 4-6 cycles. Clomiphene will be successful in inducing ovulation in about 70% of women, with ovaries producing estrogen Switch over from clomiphene to more aggressive therapy is done when : There is no response to clomiphenedeg (even with 100 mg / day dosing). There is ovulatory response to clomiphene but no pregnancydeg (following 3 to 6 months of ovulatory response to clomiphene). Patients with pituitary insufficiencydeg These patients usually respond to Gonadotropins. Note : Letrozole - 2.5mg (non steroidal aromatase inhibitor) is found superior to clomiphene. 2. Gonadotropin therapy : Prerequisite for Gonadotropin therapy : Ovarian reserve must be present. The Gonadotropins used are Human menopausal Gonodotropin : -- It is a formulation containing equal amounts of FSH and LH (751U each). -- It is prepared from hormones obtained from urine of postmenopausal women. HCG is required as an ovulatory trigger. FSH : purified urinary FSH and Recombinant FSH are also available. 3. Gonadotropin releasing hormone : Pulsatile GnRH : If other methods have failed then pulsatile GnRH is needed in patients with anovulation and hypothalamic insufficiency. Other drugs which can be used to for ovulation : Bromocriptine/Cabergoline : Are used to to treat anovulation caused by increase in serum prolactin level. Coicosteroids : Use to treat anovulation due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Also know : Mangement of unilateral proximal tubal block : Hysteroscopic cannulation or microsurgical tubo cornual anastomosis (if any periadenaxal adhesions are also present). Management of distal tubal block : Best is IVF. Surgical procedures like fimbrioplasty (lysis of fimbrial adhesions or dilatation of fimbrial stenosis) or neosalpingostomy may be done.

In which of the following conditions left atrium is not enlarged –,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,Aortopulmonary window,Patent ductus arteriosus,"ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger’s syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect.
All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt.
Size of left atrium in left to right shunts

In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of heart (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aorta) to right side of heart (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary artery) depending on the site of abnormal communication.
This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium.
The path of blood is then depending on the defect.
In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation → Blood from right side of heart plus some blood from left side of heart because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal.
But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1)In ASD
Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but fortunate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i.e., septal defect.
So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium.



Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle.
Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, FDA, Aortopulmonary window).


In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit.
So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium → Volume over load → Left atrial enlargement.",B

This is due to:",Increased abdominal pressure,IVC compression,Increased intracranial pressure,After heavy lunch,"SUPINE HYPOTENSION SYNDROME (POSTURAL HYPOTENSION): During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. In 90% cases this, however, results in opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paravertebral and azygos veins. In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed.

(c) Congenital syphilisRef: OP Ghai 8th ed./182y 273Early manifestations of congenital infection vary and involve multiple organ systems.* About 60% of infants born with congenital syphilis are asymptomatic at birth. Symptoms develop within the first 2 months of life. In symptomatic infants, the most common physical finding, reported in almost 100% of cases, is hepatomegaly; biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction is usually observed.* The other common findings are skeletal abnormalities, rash, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Radiographic abnormalities, periostitis or osteitis, involve multiple bones and are seen in the vast majority of symptomatic infants, but they also can be found in a fifth of infants with no symptoms or relevant findings on physical examination. Sometimes, the lesion is painful and an infant will favor an extremity (pseudopalsy).* The rash is maculopapular and may involve palms and soles. In contrast to acquired syphilis, a vesicular rash and bullae may develop. These lesions are also highly contagious.* Mucosal involvement may present as rhinitis (""snuffles""). Nasal secretions are highly contagious.* Hematological abnormalities include anemia and thrombocytopenia. Some infants have leukocytosis. Abnormal CSF examination is seen in a half of symptomatic infants but also can be found in 10% of those who are asymptomatic.* Late-onset congenital syphilis (diagnosed >2 y)* Scarring from the early systemic disease causes late manifestations of congenital syphilis. Manifestations include neurosyphilis and involvement of the teeth, bones, eyes, and the eighth cranial nerve, as follows:# Bone involvement - Saber shins, saddle nose# Teeth involvement - Notched, peg-shaped incisors (Hutchinson teeth)# Pigmentary involvement - Linear scars (rhagades) at the corners of the mouth# Interstitial keratitis - Presents in the first or second decade of life# Sensory-neural hearing loss (eighth cranial nerve deafness) - Presents between age 10 and 40 years.# Classic Hutchinson triad - (1) defective incisors, (2) interstitial keratitis, (3) eighth cranial nerve deafness.",C

"In a young female of reproductive age with regular menstrual cycles of 28 days, ovulation occurs around 14th day of periods. When is the first polar body extruded ?",24 hrs prior to ovulation,Accompanied by ovulation,48 hrs after the ovulation,At the time of fertilization,"Most of the standard text books say the first polar body is expelled just before or shortly before ovulation.
Which does not mean that it is released 24 hours before ovulation.
While still in the ovary the ovum is in the primary oocyte stage. Shortly before it is released from ovaria follicle (i.e. shortly before ovulation), its nucleus divides by meiosis and a first polar body is expelled from the nucleus of the oocyte. The primary oocyte then becomes the secondary oocyte. In this process each of the 23 unpaired of chromosomes loses one of its partners which become the first polar body that is expelled. This leaves 23 unpaired chromosomes in the secondary oocyte. It is at this time that the ovum, still in the secondary oocyte stage is ovulated into the abdominal cavity
So, first polar body is released at the time of ovulation i.e. Option “b”",B

HIV transmission in relation to pregnancy is maximum during:,Labor and delivery,First trimester,Second trimester,Breastfeeding,"Ans. A. Labor and deliverya. The maximum risk is at labor and delivery. A baby can become infected with HIV in the womb, during delivery or while breast-feeding. If the mother does not receive treatment, 25% of babies born to women with HIV will be infected by the virus.b. With treatment that percentage can be reduced to less than 2%. If no preventative steps are taken, the risk of HIV transmission during childbirth is estimated to be 10-20%.c. The chance of transmission is even greater if the baby is exposed to HIV-infected blood or fluids. Health care providers should avoid performing amniotomies (intentionally rupturing the amniotic sac to induce labor), episiotomies and other procedures that expose the baby to the mother's blood.d. The risk of transmission increases by 2% for every hour after membranes have been ruptured.e. Cesarean sections performed before labor and/or the rupture of membranes may significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.f. About 15% of newborns born to HIV-positive women will become infected if they breastfeed for 24 months or longer.",A

Which of the following organism is most commonly considered responsible for SIDS especially after giving honey to the neonate or infant?,Clostridium botulinum,Staphylococcus aureus,E. coli,Clostridium perfringens,"Ans. A. Clostridium botulinum.(Ref. Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, 19th ed. Chapter 367)Sudden infant death syndrome# Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected, sudden death of a child under age 1 in which an autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death.# SIDS is most likely to occur between 2 and 4 months of age. SIDS affects boys more often than girls. Most SIDS deaths occur in the winter.# The following have been linked to a baby's increased risk of SIDS:# Sleeping on the stomach# Being around cigarette smoke while in the womb or after being bom# Sleeping in the same bed as their parents (co-sleeping)# Soft bedding in the crib# Multiple birth babies (being a twin, triplet, etc.)# Premature birth# Having a brother or sister who had SIDS# Mothers who smoke or use illegal drugs# Being bom to a teen mother# Short time period between pregnancies# Late or no prenatal care# Living in poverty situations# Honey is the one identified, avoidable source of C botulinum spores for susceptible infants.# Because botulinal toxin is the most potent poison known (about 10-9 mg per kg of body weight given intravenously being a lethal amount for man), it appeared possible that rapid in vivo production of botulinal toxin might in some infants lead to sudden death if upper airway obstruction or apnea resulted from flaccidity of airway and respiratory muscles.# In a British study released May 29, 2008, researchers discovered that the common bacterial infections Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli appear to be risk factors in some cases of SIDS.",A

Increase seen in plasma volume in pregnancy: March 2010,10-20%,20-30%,30-40%,40-50%,"Ans. D: 40-50% The most striking maternal physiologic alteration occuring during pregnancy is the increase in the blood volume. The magnitude of the increases varies according to the size of woman, the number of pregnancies she has had, the number of infants she has delivered, and whether there is one or multiple fetuses. The increases in blood volume progress until term; the average increase in volume at term is 45-50%. The increase is needed for extra blood flow to the uterus, extra metabolic needs of fetus and increased perfusion of others organs, especially kidneys. Extra volume also compensate for maternal blood loss delivery. Plasma volume increases during pregnancy. The rate of increase almost parallels to that of blood volume but the maximum is reached to the extent of 50%.Total plasma volume increases to the extent of 1.25 litres.",D

Tentorial tears are due to mechanical injury to the fetal cranium causing rupture of the deep venous system or laceration of the inferior surface of the cerebellum. Cephalhematoma is generally due to laceration of the blood vessels passing through the periosteal layer and hence the hematoma formed is limited to that paicular bone and does not spread across the cranial suture lines.

Which of the following is the least likely physiological change in pregnancy,Increase in intravascular volume,Increase in cardiac output,Increase in stroke volume,Increase in peripheral vascular resistance,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. increase in peripheral vascular resistance Hemodynamic changes during pregnancyThe most important point to remember about cardiovascular changes during pregnancy is that in normal pregnant patients, circulation is hyperdynamic and that a high cardiac output is present.The increase in cardiac output starts about 10 weeks into the pregnancy reaches the maximum at about 24-28 weeks and remains elevated until parturition.The rise in cardiac output is initially determined by increase in stroke volume and later on as the pregnancy advances the heart rate also increases.An increase in intravascular volume is one of the main determinants of the increased cardiac output of pregnancy.There is an increase in both red cell volume and plasma volume.A good clinical marker of the presence of an expanded I. V. volume during pregnancy is the presence of grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.This physiologic murmur appears at about 10-12 weeks into the pregnancy and disappears in the beginning of the postpartum period.The increase in the intravascular volume fulfills the needs of the developing uteroplacental circulation and protects the mother against the potentially harmful effects of the blood loss that occurs at parturition.The increase in blood volume of pregnancy does not alter the central venous pressure (CVP), which is the same as in the nonpregnant women.Another important hemodynamic change in pregnancy is decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR).PVR decreases during pregnancy on the arterial side and the venous side of the circulation. The cause of this change is not well understood, but is most likely a direct effect of placental hormones or vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclins) on blood vessels.The decreased peripheral vascular resistance is manifested clinically by a decrease in both mean and diastolic blood pressure. This decrease is clearly observed during second trimester.Because most of the intravascular volume is contained in the capacitance vessels, the decrease in venous resistance represents the adaptation of the vascular tree to the blood volume expansion. If this adaptation does not occur, thev. volume will not expand, thereby seriously compromising the uteroplacental circulation.Hemodynamic changes in normal pregnancy*Cardiac output- Increased*Heart rate- Increased*Systemic vascular resistance- Increased*Pulmonary vascular resistance- Increased*Mean arterial pressure- Increased*Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure- Increased*Central venous pressure- Normal*Left ventricular stroke volume- IncreasedAlso knowThere are several periods during pregnancy when the danger of cardiac decompensation is especially great.First is between 12 and 32 weeks of gestation, a time during which hemodynamic changes of pregnancy develops.The most critical period is between 28-32 weeks of gestation, when the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy peak and cardiac demands are maximum.The other dangerous time for pregnant cardiac patient is during labour and delivery.During labour every uterine contractions injects blood from the uteroplacental circulation into the maternal blood stream increasing the cardiac output by approximately 15% to 20%.This continuous demand on the heart may trigger congestive heart failure,During the second stage of labour, maternal pushing further compromises the venous return to the heart causing a decrease in cardiac output that may be critical for some cardiac patients.The final dangerous time for the pregnant cardiac patient is 4-5 days after delivery.Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome, Aortic stenosis and cyanotic heart disease may be able to go through pregnancy and labour and delivery without major complications.However, sudden death in the early postpartum period may occur. Decreased peripheral resistance with right to left shunting and pulmonary embolization from silent iliofemoral thrombus are two problems occurring at this time.",D

This allows small masses to be easily identified and removed.* Alternatively agents like progestins, combined pills, Danazol and GnRH agonist can be administered prior to anticipated surgery.* Hysteroscope consists of a rigid 4mm diameter telescope so, cervix has to dilated to 4mmQ for insertion of hysteroscope.Distension media:* Because the anterior and posterior uterine walls are in apposition, a distention medium is required to expand the endometrial cavity for viewing.* Distension media includes CO2 and low viscous fluids such as sorbitol, mannitol and glycine solutions.* To expand the cavity, intrauterine pressure of these media must reach 45 to 80mm of Hg. it should not exceed 100mg of Hg because high pressure can result in increased intravasation of medium into the patient's circulation and fluid volume overload.Most common media used for diagnostic purpose - CO2 Most common media used for therapeutic purpose - GlycineContraindications:- Infection (except in case of misplaced IUCD)- Pregnancy- Genital malignancyDiagnostic Indications of hysteroscopy:Let us understand the diagnostic indications of hysteroscopeA hysteroscope can visualize the interior of uterus so, it can diagnose* Any congenital malformation of uterus and can also help in differentiating between a bicornuate uterus from a septate uterus.Q* Any uterine synechiae (as in Asherman syndrome).Q* Misplaced IUCD.Q* Submucous fibroidQA hysteroscope can visualize the cornua so, it can diagnose* Any cornual pathologyHysteroscope can directly visualize the endometrium so, it can diagnose* Endometrial lesions like - endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, endometrial T.B.Q* Pregnancy-related conditions like: Molar tissue or products of conception.QBesides these hysteroscopy is also indicated inQ:* Unexplained abnormal uterine bleedingQ- Pre menopausalQ- Post menopausalQ* Selected infertility cases: In case of- Abnormal HSGQ- Unexplained infertilityQ* Recurrent spontaneous abortion* The therapeutic indications of hysteroscope are (here also don't mug up, just try to understand them).Q* To excise uterine septumQ* To lyse adhesions in Asherman's syndromeQ* To retrieve lost IUCDQ* Hysteroscopic myomectomyQ* PolypectomyQ* Endometrial ablation for menorrhagiaQ* Tubal occlusion for control of fertilityQ* Intratubal ballooning in tubal blockageQAs far as adenomyosis is concerned - it can be suspected on hysteroscopy by appearance of diverticuli but definitive diagnosis requires transvaginal ultrasonography.For management of adenomyosis hysterectomy is the definitive treatment""Endometrial ablution and resection using hysteroscopy has been used to successfully treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia caused by adenomyosis.

In which of the following transmissions meiosis occurs :,Primary to secondary spermatocyte,Second spermatocyte to globular spermatid,Germ cells to spermatogonium,Spermatogonium to primary spermatocyte,"Ans. is a i.e. Primary to secondary spermatocyte The process involved in the development of spermatids from the primordial male germ cells and their -!Werentiation into spermatoznq (or sperms) is called as spermatogenesis. Sholy before pubey. the primordial germ cells develop into sperrnatogonia in the wall of seminiferous tubules. Meiosis is a special type of cell division that reduces the diploid number of chromosomes (i.e., 46) to the haploid number of 23. It takes place only in germ cells; to give rise to gametes (sperms and egg cells) It involves two meiotic cell divisions, meiosis I and meiosis II. The first metotic division is a reduction division because the chromosome number is reduced from diploid (46) to haploid (23). The 2nd meiotic division is similar to mitosis as daughter cells formed contain the same haploid number of chromosomes as the mother cell. Thus. though nation 'a' and both are correct but reduction division occurs when primary spermatocyte is transformed to secondary spermatocyte, so it is the answer of choice. Extra Edae : The developmental process from spermatogonium to sperm takes about 61 daysdeg and the entire process, including the transit time in the ductal system takes approximately three months.deg Clinical significance The above fact is clinically significant, as in case of male factor infeility a repeat semen analysis to see the sperm count, motility etc. after giving treatment should be ;,,ne three months the first analysis (as new sperms will be formed after 3 months).",A

Which of the following are true for Bronchiolitis in children?,"Commonly seen in children between 1- 6 months of age, but can be seen upto 2 years",RSV is the most common causative organism,Disease usually occurs in winter and spring season.,All of the above,"Ans. D. All of the aboveBronchiolitis primarily affects young infants (1- 6 months some may be affected upto 2 years of age), clinical manifestations are initially subtle. Infants may become increasingly fussy and have difficulty feeding during the 2 to 5-day incubation period. A low-grade fever, usually less than 101.5degF, and increasing coryza and congestion usually follow the incubation period. In older children and adults, as well as in up to 60% of infants, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is generally confined to the upper airway and does not progress further. Over a period of 2-5 days, RSV infection progresses from the upper to the lower respiratory tract, and this progression leads to the development of cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and feeding difficulties.",D

Modified BPP consists of:,NST with AFI,NST with fetal breathing,NST with fetal movement,NST with fetal tone,"Ans. a. NST with amniotic fluid index (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 24/e p342. 343)Modified Biophysical profile consists of NST with amniotic fluid index.Modified Biophysical Profile: Because the biophysical profile is labor intensive and requires a person trained in sonography, Clark and coworkers (1989) used an abbreviated biophysical profile as a first-line screening test in 2628 singleton pregnancies. Specifically, a vibroacoustic nonstress test was performed twice weekly and combined with amnionic fluid index determination for which < 5 cm was considered abnormal. This abbreviated biophysical profile required approximately 10 minutes to perform, and they concluded that it was a superb antepartum surveillance method because there were no unexpected fetal deaths. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics (2012) have concluded that the modified biophysical profile test is as predictive of fetal well-being as other approaches to biophysical fetal surveillance.

There are 2 types of deficiencies; the classic and salt wasting form tends to present in the newborn but the non-classic form can occur in late childhood and adolescence and is less associated with salt wasting. The ambiguous genitalia results from the virilization effects of excess DHEA produced. In the testes, 5-alpha-reductase conves testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and a single mutation in the enzyme could result in ambiguous genitalia. 11-hydroxylase deficiency can present similarly to late-onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency, with hirsutism and abnormal menses, but it is less common. Maternal ingestion of progesterone has been associated with virilization in utero.",B

Patients with the beta thalassemia trait generally have no unusual physical findings. In patients with beta thalassemia major, the physical findings are related to severe anemia, ineffective erythropoiesis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and iron overload resulting from transfusion and increased iron absorption. The skin may show pallor from anemia and jaundice from hyperbilirubinemia, and the skull and other bones may be deformed secondary to erythroid hyperplasia with intramedullary expansion and coical bone thinning. Skin ulceration may be present on the extremities. Thalassemia can result in maxillary enlargement, leading to an appearance known as chipmunk face, along with increased spaces between teeth, overbite, and malocclusion. Painful swelling of salivary glands and a dry mouth may occur, which leads to reduced salivary protection and an increased rate of tooth decay. Cardiac examination may reveal hea failure and arrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation), related to either severe anemia or iron overload. Abdominal examination may reveal changes in the liver, gallbladder, and spleen. Hepatomegaly related to significant extramedullary hematopoiesis is typically found.

A girl with normal stature and minimal or absent pubertal development is seen in:,Kallman syndrome,Turner syndrome,Testicular feminization syndrome,Pure gonadal dysgenesis,"Ans. a. Kallman syndrome (Ref: Nelson 19/e p1956; Harrison 19/e p2256. 18/e p2878)Normal stature and minimal or absent pubertal development in a girl is seen in Kallman syndrome.'Kallmann syndrome is a genetic condition where the primary symptom is a failure to start puberty or a failure to fully complete it. It occurs in both males and females and has the additional symptoms of hypogonadism and almost invariably infertility. Kallmann syndrome also features the additional symptom of an altered sense of smell: either totally absent (anosmia) or highly reduced (hyposmia).' - Nelson 19/e p1956Testicular Feminization Syndrome:Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) cause resistance to androgen (testosterone, DHT) action or the androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS)Q.Because the androgen receptor is X-linked. only males are affected and maternal carriers are phenotypicalIy normalQ.XY individuals with complete AIS (testicular feminization syndrome) have a female phenotype, normal breast developmentQ (due to aromatization of testosterone), a short vagina but no uterusQ (because MIS production is normal), scanty pubic and axillary hairQ, and female psychosexual orientationQ.Most patients present with inguinal hernia (containing testes) Q in childhood or with primary amenorrhea in adulthood.GonadectomyQ is usually performed, as there is a low risk of malignancy, and estrogen replacementQ is prescribed.Turner's Syndrome (Gonadal Dysgenesis: 45.X):MC karyotype is 45 XO, rest are 45XO/46XX, 45XO/46XY (mosaics)Loss of one X chromosome is due to non-disjunctionQ during meiosis, the X chromosome retained is maternal in originQ in most cases.MC chromosome disorder in human beings.Characteristic features are short stature, widely spaced nipples, webbed neckQTurner's Syndrome: PresentationIn neonatal periodAt PubertyAdditional features* Slow growthQ* Presence of shield chest, cystic hygroma, lymphedemaQ* Cardiac defects: Coarctation of aorta (MC), bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysmQ* Urinary tract malformations, MC is Horse shoe shaped kidneyQ* Primary amenorrhea, failure to mature and infertilityQ.* Absent secondary sexual characteristics (due to bilateral streak gonads, no estrogen secretion leading to undeveloped breast, absent axillary and pubic hair)Q* Hormonal profile: Raised FSH and LH, decreased estrogen and progesteroneQ* Micrognathia, exaggerated epicanthal fold, low set earsQ* Sensorineural hearing loss, otitis media (conductive hearing loss)Q* Low posterior hair line, colour blindness, high arched palateQ* Broad shield like chest, lack of breast development, shortened 4th metacarpalQ* Cubitus valgusQ, hyperconvex nail, multiple pigmented naeviTesticular Dysgenesis:Patients with pure (or complete) gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer syndrome) have streak gonads, mullerian structures (due to insufficient AMH/MIS secretion), and a complete absence of androgenization.Gonadal dysgenesis can result from mutations or deletions of testis-promoting genes (WT1, SF1, SRY, SOX9, DHH, ATRX, ARX, DMRT) or duplication of chromosomal loci containing 'antitestis' genes (e.g., WNT4/RSPOI, DAXI).Absent (vanishing) testis syndrome (bilateral anorchia) reflects regression of the testis during development.Early testicular regression causes impaired androgenization in utero, and in most cases, androgenization of the external genitalia is either normal or slightly impaired (e.g., small penis, hypospadias).Kallmann SyndromeKallmann syndrome is a genetic condition where the primary symptom is a failure to start puberty or a failure to fully complete it.It occurs in both males and females and has the additional symptoms of hypogonadism and almost invariably infertility. Kallmann syndrome also features the additional symptom of an altered sense of smell: either totally absent (anosmia) or highly reduced (hyposmia).Kallmann syndrome occurs when the hypothalamic neurons that are responsible for releasing gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH neurons) fail to migrate into the hypothalamus during embryonic development.Reproductive Features of Kallmann Syndrome* Failure to start or fully complete puberty in both men and women* Lack of testicle development in men* Infertility* Poorly defined secondary sexual characteristics in both men and women.* Primary amenorrhea or failure to start menstruation in women",A

All of the following are neural tube defects except:,Myelomeningocele,Anencephaly,Encephalocele,Holoprosencephaly,"Ans. D. HoloprosencephalyNeural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of birth defects in which an opening in the spinal cord or brain remains from early in human development. In the 3rd week of pregnancy called gastrulation, specialized cells on the dorsal side of the embryo begin to change shape and form the neural tube. When the neural tube does not close completely, an NTD develops. There are 2 types of NTD: open and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae (back bones).Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.",D

True about breast feeding –,Best for both preterm & term,Promote lactobacillus growth in bowel,Decrease allergic disorder,All of these,"Breast milk is beneficial for both preterm and term infants because the composition of breast milk varies according to the needs and age of the infants. For example, preterm milk contains more protein `S', sodium, iron, immunoglobulins and calories as they are needed by the preterm baby.
Breast milk and energy by different constituents

Carbohydrate                                      30-40%
Protein                                                  7-10%
Fat                                                          45-60%

Breast milk contains N-acetyl-D glucose and lactose which promotes lactobacillus. On the other hand, high content of glucose and casein in formula feeds inhibits the growth of lactobacillus.
Breast milk appears to be protective for necrotizing enterocolitis. Almost all patients of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis are artificially fed.

Omphalocele Omphalocele is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal visceral in to the base of the umbilical cord. Omphalocele is a defect of the umbilical ring which results from a failure of the two lateral abdominal wall folds to migrate and. fuse normally in the midline around the 3rd or 4th week of intrauterine life. The defect is characteristically located at the base of the umbilical cord and may contain abdominal and thoracic structures.

Causes of hypoglycemia Let us see each option one by one.
Option ‘a’ IUGR
“Hypoglycemia is due to shortage of glycogen reserve in the liver as a result of chronic hypoxia”
Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 465
Option ‘b’ Mother with hypothyroidism
Maternal hypothyroidism can cause hypoglycemia if it leads to fetal hypothyroidism also but “Maternal TSH receptor bloking antibodies can cross the placenta and cause fetal thyroid dysfunction.They however have little or no effect on fetal thyroid function even though they too cross the placenta.”.
Williams 23/e, p 1131, 1132
So according to latest editon of Williams, maternal hypothyroidism does not lead to fetal hypothyroidism, thus it does not cause fetal hypoglycemia.
Option ‘c’ Rh incompatibility
There is no definite correlation between Rhincompatibility and hypoglycemia.
Option ‘d’ Macrosomia
Macrosomia usually is due to maternal diabetes which inturn results in fetal hyperinsulinemia due to beta cell hyperplasia, which further results in neonatal hypoglycemia.

The perineal injury can be prevented in normal labour by all except:,Maintaining flexion of the head,Timely episiotomy as a routine,Slow delivery of the head in between contractions,Effective perineal guard,"Now if you have ever been to labor ward and assisted or even seen a normal delivery, you know all the options given in the question are done to prevent perineal laceration.
The controversy lies in option b i.e. whether routine episiotomy should be performed: Well read for yourself what williams has to say on this issue.
“There once was considerable controversy concerning whether an episiotomy should be cut routinely. It is now clear that an episiotomy will increae the risk of a tear into the external anal sphincter or the rectum or both. Conversely, anteriortears involving the urethra and labia are more common in women in whom an episiotomy is not cut. Most, advocate individualization and do not routinely perform episiotomy.”
Hence option b is incorrect.
Steps done for prevention of perineal laceration : More attention should be paid not to the perineum but to the controlled delivery of the head.

Delivery by early extension is to be avoided. Flexion of the the sub-occiput comes under the symphysis pubis so that lesser suboccipitofrontal 10 cm (4”) diameter emerges out of the introitus.
Spontaneous forcible delivery of the head is to be avoided by assuring the patient not to bear down during contractions.

"A 6-year-old boy is often teased at school because he has stooled in his underwear almost daily for the last 3 months. He was toilet trained at 2 years of age without difficulty, but over the last 2 years he has developed ongoing constipation. His family is frustrated because they cannot believe him when he says, ""I didn't know I had to go."" He is otherwise normal; school is going well, and his home life is stable. His only significant finding on examination is stool in the rectal vault. The plain radiograph of his abdomen is shown. Initial management of this problem should include which of the following?",Barium enema and rectal biopsy,Family counseling,Time-out when he stools in his underwear,Clear fecal impaction and short-term stool softener use,"(d) Source: (Hay et al, pp 84-85. Kliegman et al, pp 73-75. McMillan et al, pp 672-674, 1920-1923. Rudolph et al, pp 1386-1389.) Encopresis is defined as the passage of feces in inappropriate locations after bowel control would be expected (usually older than 4 years). Encopresis is seen both with chronic constipation and overflow incontinence (retentive encopresis), and without constipation (nonretentive encopresis). Retentive encopresis is more common, and is the source of this child's problem. There is leakage of liquid stool around a large fecal impaction, resulting in fecal soiling. The radiograph demonstrates a dilated, stool-filled colon consistent with retentive encopresis. Treatment involves clearing the fecal mass, maintaining soft stools for a short period of time with mineral oil or stool softeners (3-6 months), and behavioral modification. Most children will grow out of this condition. Timeout would be ineffective, because these children usually have dysfunctional anal sphincters and little control over the problem; they do not know they are soiling their clothes until it is too late. Daily enemas could potentially be harmful. A rectal biopsy would help diagnose Hirschsprung disease, but the story presented is not consistent with that diagnosis.",D

Gross hematuria is seen in 20-30% of cases.* All changes result from the deposition of circulating immune complexes, containing IgA and complement on the endothelium of the blood vessels throughout the body and within the glomerular mesangial regions.* Diagnosis is confirmed by presence of palpable purpura with normal platelet count along with one or more of the following : abdominal pain, arthralgia/arthritis and mesangial deposition of IgA.* Biopsy of the kidney may be performed both to establish the diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and IgA deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where blood is filtered), white blood cells, and the development of crescents.* Renal manifestations usually start at the onset or within 3 months of onset of other symptoms.",B

A new bom of 3-4 days old passes greenish stools 8-10 times /day management is,Give ORS,Give antibiotics,Reassure the mother that this is normal,Send stool for culture,"(C) (Reassure the mother that this is normal)What will my newborn's poos be like?For the first couple of days after the birth, baby will pass meconium. Meconium is greeny-black in colour, and has a sticky, tar-like texture. It is made up of mucus, amniotic fluid, and everything baby has ingested while she was in mothers womb (uterus). Meconium may be difficult to wipe off baby's tiny bottom, but its appearance is a good sign that her bowels are working normally. In the early weeks, baby may poo during or after every feed. On average, she will do four poos a day in the first week. This will slowly settle down and her bowels will work out their own routine. One then find that she poos at a similar time each day.A newborn can have as many as eight to ten bowel movements a day, but as long as she is having at least one, she's probably all right.One day without a bowel movement is usually no cause for concern. As long as baby is feeding well and wetting her diaper five or six times a day, then she's most likely getting enough to eat. If she starts to become uncomfortable or has a persistently swollen abdomen, then she may need some help with pooping, and one should speak to pediatrician about how to facilitate this.In the early days, a newborn's bowel movements are thick and dark green in color. This is due to a substance called meconium that has been building up in her intestines during pregnancy. As the baby starts to feed and have bowel movements, she will finish expelling the meconium and her stools will start to turn yellowish. It is not uncommon for an infant's bowel movements to vary in color from day to day. The color of the stools can depend on a variety of things, including what a breastfeeding mom is eating, how hydrated the baby is, and the type and frequency of formula the infant is being fed, if applicable* Most sensitive indicator of intravascular volume depletion in infants- Heart rate *** Probiotics have been shown to have beneficial effects in prevention of Necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants* Rota virus is the single most common cause (MCC) of diarrhea amonget children in both developed and developing world* Enterotoxigenic E.coli (ETEC) is the MCC of bacterial diarrhea amongs children in developing world* ETEC is the MC bacterial cause for Traveler's diarrhea **",C

A 3 month old child presents with intermittent stridor which reduces on lying prone. The most likely diagnosis is:,Laryngomalacia,Laryngotracheobronchitis,Vocal nodule,Foreign body,"Ans. A. LaryngomalaciaLaryngomalacia is a congenital softening of the tissues of the larynx (voice box) above the vocal cords. This is the most common cause of noisy breathing in infancy. The laryngeal structure is malformed and floppy, causing the tissues to fall over the airway opening and partially block it. It is the most common congenital lesion of the larynx. The epiglottis is found to be omega shaped. Stridor typically start at age 4-6 weeks, but they may begin in the nursery or as late as age 2-3 months and more than 90% of cases, the only treatment necessary for laryngomalacia is time. The lesion gradually improves, and noises disappear by age 2 years in virtually all infants.",A
In an infeile woman. endometrial biopsy reveals proliferative changes. Which Hormone should be preferred ?,MDPA,Desogestrol,Norethisterone,None of the above,"Ans. is a i.e MDPA Synthetic progesterones : Progesterone derivatives have weak antiovulatory actions. except - Chlormadione acetate eg : MDPA, Mesogestrol, Dydrogesterone, Hydroxy progesterone caproate, Nomegesterel 19 Noestosterone derivatives have strong antiovulatory actions eg- Desogestrel, Norgestimate, Gestodene, Norethindrone, Norethisterone Norgesterel In the question the infeile woman's endometrial biopsy shows proliferative changes. As we know endometrial biopsy for infeility is taken on D 21-23 with the aim to rule out anovulation. Normally on these days endometrial biopsy should show secretory changes (as ovulation occurs on D-14 and subsequent there is increase in progesterone levels in body) But in case of anovulation endometrial biopsy does not show secretory changes but show proliferative changes. The hormone which should be administered here is obviously progesterone. but that derivative of progesterone which has weak antiovulatory effect and not strong one as it would fuher inhibit anovulation So, our answer is MDPA",A
Which statement concerning polyhydramnios is true?,Acute polyhydramnios always leads to labor prior to 28 weeks,The incidence of associated malformations is approximately 3%,"Maternal edema, especially of the lower extremities and vulva, is rare","Complications include placental abruption, uterine dysfunction, and postpaum hemorrhage","Polyhydramnios is an excessive quantity of amniotic fluid. The frequency of diagnosis varies, but poly hydramnios sufficient to cause clinical symptoms probably occurs in 1 of 1000 pregnancies, exclusive of twins. The incidence of associated malformations is about 20%, with CNS and GI abnormalities being paicularly common. For example, polyhydramnios accompanies about half of cases of anencephaly and nearly all cases of esophageal atresia. Edema of the lower extremities, vulva, and abdominal wall results from compression of major venous systems. Acute hydramnios tends to occur early in pregnancy and, as a rule, leads to labor before the 28th week. The most frequent maternal complications are placental abruption, uterine dysfunction, and postpaum hemorrhage.",D

Screening should ideally be done for all newborns: because there are generally not signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism at birth.
Use cord blood, or wait for 5-7 days for sampling: results are difficult to interpret in between.
Test for T4 and TSH : insist on an early report (within 2-3 days). level of TSH upto 10 piu/ml is considered normal upto 8-10 weeks of age.
If abnormal, repeat to confirm diagnosis.
If conveniently possible WITHOUT DELAY, do thyroid scan before starting treatment.
Explain the problem, and the consequences of not treating, in detail to parents to ensure compliance.
Begin treatment with thyroxin (not thyroid extract) as early as possible: dose 10-12 mg/kg/day as single daily dose.
Monitor with TSH levels : at age of 2 weeks, then every 2 months for the first year of life, and then every 3-6 months till puberty is completed.
Soon after beginning therapy, monitor T4 also for rapid assessment of the adequacy of dose. After the first year, in a good laboratory, T4 assessment, alone should be adequate for monitoring.
Review at age of 2-3 years to reconfirm diagnosis. Thyroxine should be stopped for 6-8 weeks and T4, TSH repeated. Thyroid scan should be done at this time if not done before starting treatment",A

During acute flare-ups, the skin of the distal phalanx becomes red and scaly and develops small pustules. The pustules often join together and on bursting, reveal a painful, red and glazed area where new pustules then develop. Pustulation of the nail bed and its growth site (matrix) can result in onychodystrophy (malformation) and anonychia (loss of nail). Slowly, the disease can rarely spread proximally to affect the hand, forearm and/or foot. There may be osteolysis (destruction of bone) resulting in a wasted and tapered tip of finger or toe.

NOT a feature of childhood asthma is –,History of atopic dermatitis,Raised IgG level,Improves with age,Absence of wheezing after exercise,"Asthma 

Bronchial asthma is a disease characterized by an increased responsiveness of airways to a variety of stimulus and causes recurrent attacks of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough.
The symptoms are due to bronchoconstriction which is reversible in a large majority of the cases, either spontaneously or in response to treatment.
Asthma is the commonest chronic illness during childhood.
It is a type I hypersensitivity, which is mediated by IgE IgE is raised (not IgG)

Risk factors

Family history of asthma
Family history of atopic disease (Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis).
Bronchiolitis during infancy.
Sensitization to allergenes (dust mite, animal danders, cockroaches and Alternaria) during childhood.
Passive smoking

The response of Asthmatic patients to exercise -
Mild exercise i.e., running for 1-2 minutes caused bronchodilation in asthmatic patients and can reduce wheezing (wheezing is produced due to obstruction in bronchi). Severe exercise will cause bronchoconstriction in virtually all asthmatic patients and will aggravate wheezing.
Prognosis of Asthma -
The prognosis of young asthmatic children is generally good. Longitudinal studies indicate that in patients who have mild asthma the remission rate is about 50% i.e., 50% of them will be asthma free in their adulthood.
In severe asthma characterized by chronic steroid-dependent disease, the remission rate is very less. About 95% of them will develop into asthmatic adults.",B

A tablet of 30 mg staed on 1st day of menstruation and taken twice weekly for 12 weeks, and weekly thereafter (t1/2 - 170 hrs). Mechanism of action : - it prevents implantation through endometrial changes and does not inhibit ovulation. - increases transpo of zygote through the fallopian tube. - It accelerates blastocyst formation. Developed by CDRI, Lucknow and released in India by 2 trade names Saheli and Centron. Exhibits strong anti-estrogenic and a weak estrogenic actions peripherally at receptor level. It is not teratogenic or carcinogenic, exes no pharmacological effect on other organs. The only side effect noted is prolonged cycles and oligomenorrhea in 8% cases. This is due to prolonged proliferative cases. Pregnancy rate is (1-4 )/100 women years. Return of feility is within 6 months of stopping the drug.

The foetal blood is separated from syncytiotrophoblast with all except :,Fetal blood capillary membrane,Mesenchyme of intervillous blood space,Cytotrophoblast,Decidua parietalis,"Ans. is d i.e. Decidua parietalis Friends, once again we will have to peep into embryology to answer this question. Formation of placenta : Placenta is formed by the trophoblast. The trophoblast is made up of a single layer of cells. Cells of trophoblast multiply to form distinct layers. The cells that are near to the decidua lose their cell boundaries to form syncytium. This layer of the trophoblast is known as the syncytiotrophoblast. Deep to the syncytium, the cells of the trophobiast retain their cell walls and form the second layer called as the cyto trophoblast. The cyto trophobiast rests on the mesoderm. Small cavities appear in the syncytiotrophoblast called as Lacunae. The lacunae are separated from one another by paitions of syncytium called as trabeculae. The syncytiotrophoblast grows into the endometrium (Decidua). As the endometrium is eroded. some of the maternal blood vessels are opened up and blood from them fills the lacunar space. So. lacunae have maternal blood. Each trabeculas is, initially made up entirely of syncytiotrophoblast. Later cells of cytotrophoblast begin to multiply and grow into each trabeculas. This is called as Primary Extra embryonic mesoderm then invades the centre of each primary villus. This is now called as secondary villus. Soon thereafter. fetal blood vessels can be seen in the mesoderm forming the core of each villus. The villus is called as Teiary villus. Thus the maternal blood in the lacuna is never in direct contact with fetal blood. They are separated by 1. Syncytiotrophoblast 1 2. Cytotrophoblast Together k/a 3. Basement membrane placental 4. Mesoderm barrier or 5. Endothelium of fetal capillaries 1 membrane",D

"In the mother, suckling leads to which of the following responses?",Decrease of oxytocin,Increase of prolactin-inhibiting factor,Increase of hypothalamic dopamine,Increase of hypothalamic prolactin,"The normal sequence of events triggered by suckling is as follows: through a response of the central nervous system, dopamine is decreased in the hypothalamus. Dopamine suppression decreases production of prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF), which normally travels through a portal system to the pituitary gland; because PIF production is decreased, production of prolactin by the pituitary is increased. At this time, the pituitary also releases oxytocin, which causes milk to be expressed from the alveoli into the lactiferous ducts. Suckling suppresses the production of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor and, as a result, acts as a mild contraceptive (because the midcycle surge of luteinizing hormone does not occur).",D

Signs of increased intracranial pressure or impending herniation may develop quite rapidly (see Chapter 68). Acutely, increasing the serum concentration an infusion of 3% sodium chloride can reverse the cerebral edema. Each 1 mL/kg of 3% sodium chloride increases the serum sodium concentration by approximately 1 mEq/L. An infusion of 4 mL/kg often results in resolution of the symptoms.

Primi patient with Rh negative blood group
She is 37 years old-elderly primi (>30 years) and has risk of Down syndrome (>35 years)
She is concerned about the risk of having a down syndrome baby at this age and so insists on having amniocentesis done.

Option a: Advise against amniocentesis as it will increase the risk of isoimmunisation –although the risk of isoimmunisation will definitely be increased but still I will not advise her against amniocentesis seeing her age and her concern.
Option b: Follow Rh titres carefully and give Anti D if evidence of isoimmunisation is present. Come on in the theory I have explained that Anti d should be given only if evidence of isoimmunisationt is absent. If isoimmunisation is present it means antibodies are already formed, hence no need for giving Anti D. Thus this statement is absolutely wrong.
Option c: Give Anti D at 28 weeks of pregnancy and after delivery if baby is Rh negative. If baby is Rh negative, no need to give Anti D.
Option d: Give Anti D prior to her amniocentesis: This is the most logical step which should be done in this case.

This patient most likely has",Endometriosis,Endometritis,Adenomyosis,Uterine sarcoma,"Adenomyosis is a condition in which normal endometrial glands grow into the myometrium. The symptomatic disease primarily occurs in multiparous women over the age of 35 years, compared to endometriosis, in which onset is considerably younger. Patients with adenomyosis complain of dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia, and the classical examination findings include a tender, symmetrically enlarged uterus without adnexal tenderness. Although patients with endometriosis can have similar complaints, the physical examination of these patients more commonly reveals a fixed, retroveed uterus, adnexal tenderness and scarring, and tenderness along the uterosacral ligaments. Leiomyoma is the most common pelvic tumor, but the majority are asymptomatic and the uterus is irregular in shape. Patients with endometritis can present with abnormal bleeding, but endometrial biopsies show an inflammatory pattern. Uterine sarcoma is rare and presents in older women with postmenopausal bleeding and nontender uterine enlargement.",C

The commonest cyanotic heart disease manifesting as congestive cardiac failure during first week of life is –,Pulmonary stenosis,Fallot's tetralogy,Tricuspid atresia,Hypoplastic left heart syndorme,"Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left heart syndrome causes CHF in First week.
Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF : -

1) Left to right shunt

At birth, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i.e., the pressure on rt side of circulation is high -> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure.
So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary artery level.

As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks
(Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks).

This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time.
So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life.

2) Right to left shunt

Patients with right to left shunt may have : -

a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary artery level.
b)Shunt at atrial level

Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary artery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt.
Patients with shunt at atrial level may have.

i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia)      CCF develops in the first few days
of life as rt ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level.
Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) ---> CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3)Obstructive lesions

If the stenosis is critical (e.g., in aortic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression.
Coarctation of aorta may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction.

4) Transposition

Patients with transposition of great arteries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level ---> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF.
Patients with transposition of great arteries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.",D

A 5-year-old child suffering from nephrotic syndrome is responding well to steroid therapy. What would be the most likely finding on light microscopy –,No finding,Basement membrabne thicking,Hypercellular glomeruli,Fusion of foot processes,"Minimal change disease

Minimal Change Disease is the most common cause of Nephrotic syndrome in children.
Oedema and Selective proteinuria are features of the nephrotic syndrome. Fever may be present on account of increased susceptibility to infection.
Minimal change disease presents with insidious onset of nephrotic syndrome in children below 6 years of age.
Hypertension is not a feature of nephrOtic syndrome and is rare in Minimal change disease. Hematuria (a finding of the nephritic syndrome) is also rare.

Pathological findings include

Light microscopy → No abnormality
Electron microscopy →Obliteration (loss) and fusion of foot processes of epithelial cells.

It was believed that the mass effect of herniated viscera is the major factor in cardiorespiratory compromise. o Now it is recognized that major cause of cardiorespiratory compromise is pulmonary hypeension and pulmonary hypoplasia. o So now the patient is initially resuscitated before surgery is performed. This resuscitation consists of a) Stabilization by mechanical ventilation with 100% 0, b) Nasograstric suction o Ventilation prevents the development of pulmonary hypeension and provide adequate oxygen delivery. Now days infants are ventilated by high frequency oscillation. o Nasogastric tube is used for suction to aspirate swallowed air and to prevent distension of the herniated bowel which would fuher compress the lung. o So both option 'c' & 'd' are preoperative procedures in congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The question is which should be performed fist. Remember that nasogastric suction is performed first in a case of CDH unless the patient presents with following symptoms ----> a) Cyanosis, b) Apnea, c) Respiratory disease o Here in the question the patient does not complain of any of the above symptoms so nasogastric suction should be the first priority.",C

Which of the following strategy has been recommended to reduce the heredity risk for ovarian cancer in women with BRCA -1 and BRCA - 2 mutations :,Use of oral contraceptive pills,Screening with transvaginal ultrasound,Screening with CA - 125,Prophylactic oophorectomy,"Ans. is d i.e. Prophylactic oophorectomy BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumour suppressor genes. BRCA-1 is located on chromosome 17 and BRCA-2 on chromosome 13. Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant. Lifetime risk of Ovarian Ca in individual with these mutation - 25% Lifetime risk of Breast Ca in individual with these mutation - 50% BRCA-1 - (20-40% life time risk of ovarian cancer). BRCA-2 - (10-20% life time risk of ovarian cancer). Men in these families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology. Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. Prophylactic oophorectomy : ""The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oopherectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (B50) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%."" Additional benefit of prophylactic oopherectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%. Oral contraceptive pills : Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oralcontraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is sho term increased risk of developing breastcancer. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound : ""In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA 125 blood testing should be done"".

True statement regarding oogenesis is/are:a) Primary occyte arrests in prophase of 1st meiotic divisionb) Primary occyte arrests in prophase of 2nd meiotic divisionc) Secondary oocyte arrest in Metaphase of 1st meiotic divisiond) Secondary oocyte arrest in Metaphase of 2nd meiotic divisione) 1st polar body is extruded during 1st meiotic division of primary oocytes,acd,ade,abd,ad,"The process involved in the development of mature ovum is called Oogenesis.
The primitive germ cells take their origin from yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and migrate to the developing gonadal ridge, at about the end of 4th week.
Important facts:

Oogenesis begins in the ovary at 6-8 weeks of gestation.
Maximum number of oocytes/oogonia are in the ovary at 5th month of development (20 weeks of gestation number being 6-7 million).
At birth no more mitotic division occur, all oogonia are replaced by primary oocyte.
At birth total content of both ovaries is 2 million primary oocytes.
At puberty number is further decreased and is ~ 300000-500000, of which only 500 are destined to mature during an individual’s life time.
All the primary oocytes in the ovary of a newborn are arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase (of meiosis).
All the primary oocytes then remain arrested and the arrested phase is called as “Dictyate stage” till puberty.
The primary oocyte gets surrounded by follicular cells in the ovary and this structure is now called as Primordial follicle.
At puberty as a result of mid cycle preovulatory surge, meiosis is resumed and completed just prior to ovulation.
Therefore first polar body is released just prior to ovulation or along with ovulation..
The second division starts immediately after it and is arrested in metaphase.
At the time of fertilization second division is completed which results in the release of oocyte and second polar body.
Therefore second polar body is released only at the time of fertilisation.
Size of mature ovum = 120-130 μm (It is the largest cell in the body).
Size of mature follicle = 18-20 mm",B

Differences in the etiology of cardiac arrest between child and adult victims necessitate some differences in the recommended resuscitation sequence for infant and child victims compared with the sequence used for adult victims. Because there is no single anatomic or physiologic characteristic that distinguishes a ""child"" victim from an ""adult"" victim and no scientific evidence that identifies a precise age to initiate adult rather than child CPR techniques, the ECC scientists made a consensus decision for age delineation that is based largely on practical criteria and ease of teaching.
In these 2005 guidelines, the recommendations for newborn CPR apply to newborns in the first hours after birth until the newborn leaves the hospital. Infant CPR guidelines apply to victims less than approximately 1 year of age.
Child CPR guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to children about 1 to 8 years of age, and adult guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to victims about 8 years of age and older. To simplify learning for lay rescuers retraining in CPR and AED apropos the 2005 guidelines, the same age divisions for children are used in the 2005 guidelines as in the ECC guidelines 2000.
Child CPR guidelines for healthcare providers apply to victims from about 1 year of age to the onset of adolescence or puberty (about 12 to 14 years of age) as defined by the presence of secondary sex characteristics. Hospitals (particularly children's hospitals) or pediatric intensive care units may choose to extend the use of Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines to pediatric advanced of all ages (generally up to about 16 to 18 years of age) rather than use onset of puberty for the application of ACLS versus PALS guidelines.",C

Most common cause of Hirsutism :,Polycystic ovary disease,Arrhenoblastoma,Cushing syndrome,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"Ans. is a i.e. Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen dependant sexual hair or male distribution of hair in a female. ""The most common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome."" ""Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 70 - 80% of cases of hirsutism, with idiopathic hirsutism being the second most frequent cause."" Pathophysiology of Hirsutism : Figure showing effect of androgen on pilosebaceous unit Ted androgen leads to Ted sebum production acne formation. It conves vellus follicles to terminal follicles leading to hirsutism. Under the influence of androgens, terminal hairs that were previously not dependent on androgens reve to a vellus form and balding results. Elevated androgen levels play a major role in determining the type and distribution of hair. Within a hair follicle, testosterone is conveed by the enzyme 5a reductase to dihydrotestosterone (active metabolite). DHT conves sho, soft vellus hair to coarse terminal hair. This conversion is irreversible. Only hairs in androgen - sensitive areas are changed in this manner to terminal hairs. The sites affected are : upper hp - chin side burns - chest lines alba of the lower abdomen Ethinicity and familial tendency also influence hirsutism. Causes of Hirsutism : Remember : Hirsutism is associated with excess androgen production (either from ovaries or adrenals), so any cause which increases androgens causes hirsutism. Most of the testosterone is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and is considered biologically inactive. Testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is considered biologically active, therefore any factor which decreases",A

Because IgM does not cross the placenta, it is the test of choice for determining congenital infection Avidity Test It measures the strength of antigen antibody reaction, which increases with duration of infection .

"In neonatal herpes, true is :",Caused by HSV – II,Hepatosplenornegaly is diagnostic,Spontaneous recovery occurs,"If not treated, disseminates","Neonatal herpes infection :

It is commonly caused by HSV-2 (70% cases are caused by HSV - 2 and 30% caused by HSV - 1).
Case fatality rate exceeds 60% in untreated neonatal herpes.
The infection is acquired by passage through an infected genital tract at birth.
The greatest risk i.e. 50% transmission rate occurs with a primary infection in the mother at time of delivery (because the antibodies have not yet developed, there is more virus present and no antibody transfer). With recurrent herpes at term, the transmission rate is only 8% or less.
Neonatal infections present on the 6th day postpartum. There are three major categories.


Localized skin, eye and mouth infection.

"During Pomeroy technique of female sterilization, which poion of the tube is ligated?",Isthmo-ampullary,Ampullary,Isthmus,Corneal,"Isthmus is ligated in pomeroy technique. The most popular technique of tubal ligation is the pomeroy techniue . Procedure: The fallopian tube is identified on each side, brought out through the incision, and the middle poion is formed into a loop which is tied at the base with catgut (any rapidlyy absorbing sutures) and excised. There should be an adequate margin between the suture and the cut end to prevent the cut ends of the tube from slipping out of the suture. The cut ends of the tube are inspected to visualize the tubal lumen; this confirms resection of a full thickness of the tube. As the tubal stumps heal, the suture absorbs and the end fall apa The failure rate is only 0.4% and it is mainly due to spontaneous canalization. The operation is simple, requires sho hospitalization and is surgically reversible Pomeroy&;s technique of tubal ligation: Ref: Shaw&;s textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition Pgno: 272",C
Lowest recurrence in nocturnal enuresis is seen with,Bed alarms,Desmopressin,Imipramine,Oxybutynin,"Enuresis Defined as normal, complete evacuation of the bladder at a wrong place and time at least twice a month after 5 year of age. More than 85% children attain complete diurnal and nocturnal control by 5 years of age. Enuresis is primary when the child has never been dry and secondary when bed wetting stas after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night. It is said to be monosymptomatic if not accompanied by any lower urinary tract infection and nocturnal if it occurs during sleep. It has to be differentiated from continuous or intermittent incontinence or dribbling.The bed is usually soaking wet in enuresis, compared to incontinence in which there is loss of urine without normal emptying of bladder. ETIOLOGY:- 1. Maturation delay is most likely cause. 2. Anxiety producing episodes during the 2 nd to 5 th years, the time for development of nocturnal bladder control, are associated with increased risk of enuresis. 3. Lack of circadian rhythm of ADH or impaired response of kidneys to ADH. 4. Secondary enuresis can be precipitated by acute stressful condition or traumatic experience. Bladder irritability due to urinary tract infection or severe constipation with the full rectum impinging on the bladder can cause enuresis. 5. Conditions causing polyuria, spina bifida, ectopic ureter and giggle and stress incontinence are other causes. Treatment:- General advice given to all enurectic children but active treatment need not begin before 6 years of age. Caffeinated drinks like tea , coffee, sodas should be avoided in evening. Adequate fluid intake during day as 40% in morning, 40% in afternoon and 20% in evening is recommended. First line of treatment is usually non pharmacological, comprising motivational therapy and use of alarm devices. Motivational therapy:- Successful in curing enuresis upto 25%. The child is reassured and provided emotional suppo.Every attempt is made to remove any feeling of guilt. The child is encouraged to assume active responsibility, including keeping a dry night diary, voiding urine before going to bed, and changing wet clothes and bedding. Dry nights should be credited with praise.punishments and angry parenteral response should be avoided. Child is encouraged both to void frequently enough to avoid urgency and daytime incontinence and to have daily bowel movement. Alarm therapy: Involves the use of device to elicit a conditioned response of awakening to the sensation of full bladder. Best used afteemr seven years if age. Successful in two third cases without much recurrence. The alarm device consists of a small sensor attached to child&;s underwear or a mat under the bed sheet and an alarm attached to the childs collar or at bedside. When the child stas wetting, sensors are activated thus causing the alarm to ring. Pharmacotherapy:- Used if enuresis persists despite alarm therapy, regular voiding habits, exclusion or treatment of constipation, exclusion of post voidal residual urine. Imipramine works by aleing the arousal sleep mechanism. It gives satisfactory initial response at dise of 1-2.5 mg/ kg/ day. Relapse rate after discontinuation of therapy seen. Cardiac arrythmia is a serious adverse effect. Anticholinergic drugs reduce uninhibited bladder contractions and are useful in children who have significant daytime urge incontinence besides nocturnal enuresis. Usual dose is 5 mg for oxybutynin, 2 mg for tolterodine. Desmopressin works by reducing volume of urine. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

Most common site for fibroids in uterus is:,Subserous,Intramural,Submucous,Cervical,"Ans: (b) Intramural Ref: Shaw s Textbook of Gynaecology 15th Edition Pg 352.Explanation:Uterine FibroidsFibroids are the most common benign solid tumours in femalesMost common tumour of uterus.Fibroids are estrogen dependent for growthProgesterone inhibits their growth.GnRH shrinks size of fibroidIncreases in size during pregnancy and OCP intakeDecreases in size after menopauseThe presence of myoma causes hyperplasia of the myometrial wall.The cavity of the uterus is often distorted and enlarged.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia.The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo- oophoritis in about 15% cases.Distribution of fibroid in the body of uterus:Intramural 75%Submucus 15%Subserous 10%Most common site is body of uterusA typical myoma is a w ell-circumscribed tumour with a pseudocapsuleThe vessels which supply blood to the tumour lie in the capsule and send radial branches into the tumour. Because of this arrangement of blood supply, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply, and degeneration is noticeable early and most often in this part of the tumour. On the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels.Microscopically, the tumour consists of bundles of plain muscle cells, separated by varying amount of fibrous strands. Areas of embryonic muscle tissue may be present in a myoma.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia. The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo-oophoritis in about 15% cases.Points to be Remembered in FibroidMost common complication of fibroid during pregnancy- Red degenerationIncidence of sarcomatous change in fibroid - 0.5 %Most common presenting symptom is menorrhagiaMetrorrhagia is caused by - sub mucus fibroidMost common degeneration - Hyaline degeneration.Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with submucous fibroidPolycythemia in myoma is due to extramedullary erythropoisis within the substance of myomaDanazole.

"A 5-year-old child refuses to sleep in his bed, claiming there are monsters in his closet and that he has bad dreams. The parents allow him to sleep with them in their bed to avoid the otherwise inevitable screaming fit. The parents note that the child sleeps soundly, waking only at sunrise. Choose the sleep disturbance most consistent with the history",Night terrors,Nightmares,Learned behavior,Obstructive sleep apnea,"Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",C

The WHO classification of vitamin A deficiency is as follows: XNNight blindness:Night blindness is the earliest clinical symptom X1A Conjunctival xerosis XIB Bitot's spot : Bitot's spots are the buildup of keratin located superficially in the conjunctiva, which are oval, triangular or irregular in shape. X2 Corneal xerosis X3A Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-third or less of the cornea X3B Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia involving one-half or more of the cornea XS Corneal scar Treatment Oral therapy: The oral regimen of vitamin A is 200,000 IU on day of presentation, next day, and 2-4 weeks later. Children less than 1 year of age or less than 8 kg should receive half the dose of the above dose. Repeat 200,000 IU every 6 months up to 6 years of age to prevent recurrence.

Clinical features consist of -


Ochronosis → Dark spot on the sclera or ear cartilage.
Arthritis → Spine, hip, knee.


But both these occur in adulthood.
The only sign of disease in children is a blackening of urine on standing. This is caused by oxidation and polymerization of homogentisic acid.

This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair ( pubarche) and subsequently menstruation ( menarche), occurring at an average of 12.6 years. Menarche occurs after 2-21/2 years of thelarche. In boys, the earliest change is an increase in testicular size( testicular volume reaching 4 ml) and this occurs between 9-14 years. This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair and lengthening of the penis. Spermarche( sperm production) stas during mid-adolescence. Laryngeal growth, manifesting as cracking of voice, begins in boys in mid-pubey, deepening of voice is complete by end of pubey. During pubey, boys gain 20-30 cm and girls 16-28 cm of height.

The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meoll. Two tests on different days are required .for accurate diagnosis. A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic .function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis. Nasal potential difference Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference. Nasal potential difference is a sensitive test of electrolyte transpo (CFTR) function that can be used to suppo or refute a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Genetic analysis Cystic .fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations. More than 1500 CFTR polymoiphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome. The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid 4.508 This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in nohern European populations. Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of nohern European ancestry are homozygous for 4.508 and > 70% carry at least one 4.508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalence of more than several percent. Testing for cystic .fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease. Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations. This testing identifies > 90% individuals who carry 2 CF mutations. No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for 4508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The patient has features of cystic fibrosis but sweat chloride levels are normal. - To diagnose cystic .fibrosis in this patient, another laboratory evidence demonstrating CFTR dysfunction is required. This can be done by two methods:? - Demonstrating abnormal potential difference - Demonstrating abnormal CF mutations. But the diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis requires. - Demonstration of two CF mutations (demonstration of single abnormal F508 mutation is not enough) So we are left with abnormal nasal potential difference. - It is an established laboratory evidence for CFTR dysfunction and is accepted as a diagnostic criteria to establish the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Diagnostic criteria for cystic fibrosis Presence of typical clinical features (respiratory, G.LT, genitourinary) OR A history of CF in a sibling OR A positive newborn screening test PLUS Laboratory evidence for CFTR Dysfunction Two elevated sweat chloride concentrations obtained on separate days OR Identification of two CF mutations OR An abnormal nasal potential difference",C

Which among the following is the BEST parameter for estimation of fetal age by ultrasound in third trimester?,Femur length,Biparietal diameter,Abdominal circumference,Inter-ocular distance,"In the third trimester femur length is most accurate to estimate the gestational age. Gestational age in the first trimester is usually calculated by from fetal crown rump length. This is the longest demonstrable length of the embryo or fetus excluding the limbs and the yolk sac. Four fetal parameters routinely measured in the second and third trimester are BPD, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femoral length. In the second trimester, the best parameters for estimating gestational age are biparietal diameter and head circumference. When BPD is altered head circumference has the advantage of being shape independent and can be used as an alternative. Femoral length can also be used and is nearly as accurate as head measurements.

Main function of B HCG:,Maintain corpus luteum,Stimulate decidua,Initiate implantation,initiate breast growth,"Ans: a (Maintain corpus luteum)Ref: William's Obstetrics, 23rd ed., Chapter 3Both alpha- and beta-chain synthesis of hCG are regulated separately. A single gene located on chromo- some 6 encodes the alpha-subunit for hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH. There are seven separate genes on chromosome 19 for the beta-hCG- beta-LH family.The best-known biological function of hCG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum-- that is, continued progesterone production.Progesterone-producing life span of a corpus luteum of menstruation could be prolonged perhaps for 2 weeks by hCG administration.Maximum plasma hCG concentrations are attained well after hCG-stimulated corpus luteum secretion of progesterone has ceased. Specifically, progesterone luteal synthesis begins to decline at about 6 weeks despite continued and increasing hCG production.Before 5 weeks, hCG is expressed in both syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. Later, when maternal serum levels peak, hCG is produced almost solely in syncytiotrophoblasts.",A

A woman has previously have 2 anencephalic babies. What is her RISK of having a third baby with anencephaly?,0%,10%,25%,50%,"The risk of having anencephalic baby in this patient is 13%. The recurrence risk after having one anencephalic baby is 5% and is 13% after having two affected children. Recurrence risk can be reduced with the use of folic acid. Anencephaly isone of the most frequent congenital malformation of the brain. In this condition large poions of scalp, cranial bones, brain including both cerebral coex and white matter are missing. Only hemmorhhagic nubbin of nerves, glial and connective tissue remains. Brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord are present but they are malformed. Most common causes are chromosomal anomalies, maternal hypehermia, deficiencies of folate, zinc and copper. This condition can be detetced by elevated maternal serum levels of alpha feto protein and acetyl cholinesterase.
