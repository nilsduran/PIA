"Positive progesterone challenge test in a patient of secondary amenorrhoea, seen in :",Asherman Syndrome,Endometrial TB,Hypopituitarism,PCOD,"Ans. is d i.e. PCOD If a patient is having positive progesterone challenge test it means Uterus is sufficiently primed with estrogen i.e. estrogen production is normal so, hypopituitarism (option ""c"") Uterus with its endometrial lining is normal i.e. Ashermann syndrome (option ""a"")and Endometrial TB (option ""b"") ruled out. Outflow tract is normal. The defect lies in production of progesterone (as when progesterone is supplemented from outside it results in withdrawl bleeding) and since progesterone is produced mainly by corpus luteum so, the defect is anovulation. The main cause of Anovulation in a case of 2deg amenorrhea is polycystic ovarian disease (option ""d"")",D
A primigravida with veex presentation is having fully dilated cervix. Head is well engaged and is having a station of +2. Foetal hea monitoring shows late deceleration. Most appropriate management in such a case would be: September 2009,Observation,Vacuum extraction,Forceps application,Immediate Caesarean,"Ans. C: Forceps Application Criteria for types of forceps deliveries: Outlet forceps: - The scalp is visible at the introitus, without separating the labia. The fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor. - The sagittal suture is in anteroposterior diameter, right or left occiput anterior or posterior position (ie, the fetal head is at or on the perineum and rotation does not exceed 45deg). Low forceps: The leading point of the fetal skull is at a station greater than or equal to +2 cm and is not on the pelvic floor; any degree of rotation may be present. Mid forceps: The station is above +2 cm, but the head is engaged. High forceps: Previous systems classified high-forceps deliveries as procedures performed when the head is not engaged. High-forceps deliveries are not recommended. The following indications apply to use of forceps, when no contraindications exist: Prolonged second stage: This includes nulliparous woman with failure to deliver after 2 hours without, and 3 hours with, conduction anesthesia. It also includes multiparous woman with failure to deliver after 1 hour without, and 2 hours with, conduction anesthesia. Suspicion of immediate or potential fetal compromise in the second stage of labor. Shoening of the second stage for maternal benefits: Maternal indications include, but are not limited to, exhaustion, bleeding, cardiac or pulmonary disease, and history of spontaneous pneumothorax. In skilled hands, fetal malpositions, including the after-coming head in breech vaginal delivery, can be indications for forceps delivery. Prerequisites for forceps delivery include the following: The head must be engaged. The cervix must be fully dilated and retracted. The position of the head must be known. Clinical assessment of pelvic capacity should be performed. No dispropoion should be suspected between the size of the head and the size of the pelvic inlet and mid pelvis. The membranes must be ruptured. The patient must have adequate analgesia. The operator should be competent in the use of the instruments",C

Maturation of spermatids is called spermiogenesis and involves all of the following except-,Condensation of the nucleus,Formation of the flagellum,Formation of the acrosome,Mitosis,"Maturation of spermatids is called spermiogenesis and involves condensation of the nucleus, formation of the flagellum, and the formation of the acrosome (a structure derived from the Golgi complex covering the tip or head of the sperm nucleus). The resultant spermatozoa are released into the seminiferous tubule lumen and then enter the epididymis, where they continue to mature and become progressively more motile during the 2 to 6 days that are required to traverse this touous structure and reach the vas deferens. As depicted in the image below, the last step is known as spermiogenesis. Mitosis has occured earlier in the process of spermatogenesis.",D

"Apatient who is at risk of estrogen dependent carcinoma andhence estrogen is contraindicate d. So in order to prevent vasomotor symptoms, which drug is given?",Tamoxifen,Conjugated estrogen,Clonidine,Yombinine,"ANSWER: (C) ClonidineREF: Novak's gynecology 13th edition page 455In women for whom hormone replacement is contraindicated, multiple alternative treatments for hot flashes have been developed. Somewhat effective alternatives may be progestins such as medroxyprogesterone (10 to 30 mg daily orally) or megestrol acetate (20 to 40 mg daily orally). If either of these progestins results in intolerable side effects, the use of alternative progestins may be considered, although few data exist regarding their efficacy.In addition to the progestins, other nonsteroidal treatments for hot flashes have been developed. One of the best studied is the b 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine. This drug probably works through both central and peripheral mechanisms and can be given either orally (0.05 mg twice daily) or by transdermal patch.",C

The presence of a uterus and fallopian tubes in an otherwise phenotypically normal male is due to,Lack of Mullerian-inhibiting factor,Lack of testosterone,Increased levels of estrogens,"46, XX karyotype","Remember that the Mullerian structures appear during embryonic development in both males and females. Female gonads do not secrete Mullerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), and the Mullerian structures persist. Male testes secrete MIF, which causes regression of Mullerian structures. Anything that prevents MIF secretion in genetic males will result in persistence of Mullerian structures into the postnatal period. Persons who appear to be normal males but who possess a uterus and fallopian tubes have such a failure of Mullerian-inhibiting factor. Their karyotype is 46, XY, testes are present, and testosterone production is normal. When the testes are located intraabdominally, orchidectomy is required to prevent malignant degeneration in these ectopic gonads.",A

35 year old female patient Radha having children aged 5 and 6 years has history of amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Blood examination reveals increased prolactin. CT of head is likely to reveal:,Pituitary adenoma,Craniopharyngioma,Sheehan's syndrome,Pinealoma,"Patient is presenting with amenorrhea; galactorrhea with raised prolactin levels. So lets rule out some of the options:
Sheehan's Syndrome 
• In Sheehan's syndrome there is failure of lactation (due to ischemic necrosis of anterior pituitary) and not galactorrhea (so, option ""c"" ruled out).
Pinealoma: 
• If you go through the list of causes of hyperprolactinemia given in Harrison 17th/ed p 2205; Table 333-8 - Pinealoma is not one of the causes. (as there is no reason for a pineal gland tumor to raise prolactin levels), ruling out option ""d"".
That leaves us with 2 options:
Pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngiorma: Both are pituitary tumors which can present with amenorrhea galactorrhea, and raised prolactin levels.
Now comes the age factor - Craniopharyngiomas present usually before 20 years (Harrison 1762/ed p 2201) of age and so by exclusion: Option ""a"" i.e. Pituitary adenoma seems more likely as the cause.
""In patients with both galactorrhea and amenorrhea approximately two-thirds will have hyperprolactinemia, in that group approximately one third will have a pituitary adenoma.""
So, pituitary adenoma is more common than craniopharyngioma and this confirms our answer.",A

The first and second polar bodies are normally extruded from the developing oocyte following meiosis I and II, and their sampling should not affect fetal development 2. Blastomere biopsy is done at the 6- to 8-cell (cleavage) stage when an embryo is 3 days old, and it is the technique most commonly used for preimplantation testing. One cell is typically removed through a hole made in the zona pellucida. The technique is associated with a 10-percent reduction in the pregnancy rate 3. Trophectoderm biopsy involves removal of 5 to 7 cells from a 5- to 6-day blastocyst. An advantage is that because the trophectoderm cells give rise to the trophoblast no cells are removed from the developing embryo. Disadvantage is because the procedure is performed later in development, if genetic analysis cannot be performed rapidly, then cryopreservation and embryo transfer during a later IVF cycle may be required.(Ref: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition)",D

At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems. It has been suggested that bed rest improves the chances of the pregnancy continuing when a small subchorionic hematoma has been found on ultrasound scans.Alternatively, the following terms are used to describe pregnancies that do not continue:An empty sac is a condition where the gestational sac develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. Other terms for this condition are blighted ovum and anembryonic pregnancy.An inevitable abortion describes where the cervix has already dilated open, but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete abortion. The fetal heartbeat may have been shown to have stopped, but this is not part of the criteria.",D

Test for ovarian reserve -,LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce eRg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow All the others and the remaining .follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these .follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single .follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1.5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovan' to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a)Passive testing b) Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early, ,follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 101uhn1in women with reproductive potential - In one study it was found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/m1 were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24.9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally, .found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test ? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets .false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates .follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the ,first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen. measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",C

It can be done : Per abdomen : A wide bore needle is inseed the maternal abdomen into the fetal head after emptying the bladder. The transabdominal approach is used successfully in both cephalic and breech presentation. ii. Per vaginal : With cephalic presentation, as soon as the cervix is dilated upto 3 - 4cm , ventricles are tapped trans vaginally with a wide bore needle. With breech presentation labour is allowed to progress upto delivery of trunk and shoulders. The needle is inseed transvaginally just below the anterior vaginal wall and into the aftercoming head through the widened suture line. Cesarean Section : recommends all hydrocephalic fetuses should be delivered abdominally, whereas the use of cephalocentesis should be limited to fetuses with severe associated abnormalities. Craniotomy is recommended if the obstetrician is well versed with the technique and is applicable for the forecoming (veex) and the after coming head (breech) in case of hydrocephalus if fetus is dead.

Karyotype of Sweyer syndrome,46XY,46XX,45XO,47XXY,"Sweyer syndrome is an uncommon form of gonadal dysgenesis, characterized by a 46, XY karyotype. Despite the presence of a Y chromosome, the phenotype is female because the dysgenetic (streak) gonads produce neither AMH nor androgens. Consequently, the vagina, cervix, uterus, and fallopian tubes develop normally and the internal and external genitalia do not masculinize. In approximately 10-15% of patients, the disorder results from an inactivating mutation in the SRY gene, but in most, no cause can be identified. Patients with Swyer syndrome generally present after the expected time of pubey with delayed sexual maturation, primary amenorrhea, normal pubic hair, and normal female internal and external genital anatomy. Evaluation reveals hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, prompting a karyotype that establishes the diagnosis. Gonadectomy is indicated soon after diagnosis due to the significant risk for development of germ cell tumours in occult testicular elements (20-30%).

"A 38-year-old woman is in her first pregnancy, which has been uneventful until the 34th week, when she develops swelling of feet and hands. An obstetric check-up reveals that she also has hypeension and proteinuria. Laboratory analysis shows elevated aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and slightly decreased platelets. The initial event in the pathogenesis of her condition is thought to be which of the following?",Chorioamnionitis,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Maternal hypeension,Placental ischemia,"This patient's condition is a classic third trimester complication referred to as toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia. It occurs in 6% of all pregnancies but is more frequent in primiparas. Although the pathogenesis is still unclear, the first event appears to be placental ischemia, probably due to abnormalities in the trophoblast and alterations in the maturation of placental vessels. The trophoblast of invading placental vessels fails to acquire the characteristics of normal endothelial cells, with subsequent alterations in blood flow. Placental ischemia then triggers the release of thromboplastic substances, increases renin synthesis, and reduces prostaglandin E levels. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of chorioamniotic membranes due to bacteria that ascend through the vaginal canal. This is an impoant cause of spontaneous aboion in the second and third trimester, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of toxemia of pregnancy. The release of thromboplastic substances may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Increased renin and reduced prostaglandin E mediate increased sensitivity to angiotensin, leading to maternal hypeension.",D

"Primigravida with full term, complains of faintness on lying down and she feels well when she turns to side or sitting position. This is due to:",Increased abdominal pressure,IVC compression,Increased intracranial pressure,After heavy lunch,"SUPINE HYPOTENSION SYNDROME (POSTURAL HYPOTENSION): During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. This, however, results in opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygos veins. In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the hea may be seriously cuailed. This results in production of hypotension,tachycardia and syncope. The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position. The augmentation of the venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labor. Reference: Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page 53",B

Supine hypotension syndrome is characteristic finding of the following trimester:,First trimester of pregnancy,2nd trimester of pregnancy,3rd trimester of pregnancy,Twin pregnancy,"During third trimester, in about 10 percent of women, supine compression of the great vessels by the uterus causes significant aerial hypotension, sometimes referred to as the supine hypotensive syndrome. Also when supine, uterine aerial pressure--and thus blood flow--is significantly lower than that in the brachial aery. This may directly affect fetal hea rate patterns. This also occurs with hemorrhage or with spinal analgesia. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 5. Maternal Physiology. In F.G.

You are called to the operating room. The general surgeons have operated on a woman to rule out appendicitis and the signs of an abdominal pregnancy with an 18 week fetus and placenta attached to the omentum. The best course of action in the case is:,Removal of both fetus and placenta,Laparoscopic ligation of umbilical cord,Removal of the fetus only,Closely follow until viability and then deliver by lapa- rotomy,"Abdominal pregnancy

Management includes urgent laparotomy irrespective of period of gestation.
The ideal surgery is to remove the entire sac, fetus, placenta and membrane. This can be done if placenta is attached to a removable organ like uterus or broad ligament.
If placenta is attached to some vital organs, it is better to take out the fetus and leave behind the placenta and the sac after tying and cutting the cord with its placental attachment.
Absorption of placenta occurs by aseptic autolysis.
If placenta is left, its involution is monitored by serum hCG and USG.

Dangers related to leaving placenta attached:

Infection and abscess
Adhesions
Intestinal obstruction

Main function of B HCG:,Maintain corpus luteum,Stimulate decidua,Initiate implantation,initiate breast growth,"Ans: a (Maintain corpus luteum)Ref: William's Obstetrics, 23rd ed., Chapter 3Both alpha- and beta-chain synthesis of hCG are regulated separately. A single gene located on chromo- some 6 encodes the alpha-subunit for hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH. There are seven separate genes on chromosome 19 for the beta-hCG- beta-LH family.The best-known biological function of hCG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum-- that is, continued progesterone production.Progesterone-producing life span of a corpus luteum of menstruation could be prolonged perhaps for 2 weeks by hCG administration.Maximum plasma hCG concentrations are attained well after hCG-stimulated corpus luteum secretion of progesterone has ceased. Specifically, progesterone luteal synthesis begins to decline at about 6 weeks despite continued and increasing hCG production.Before 5 weeks, hCG is expressed in both syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast. Later, when maternal serum levels peak, hCG is produced almost solely in syncytiotrophoblasts.",A

As far as candidial (monilial) vaginitis is concerned, OCP's use increase their incidence. But for Chlamydial infections : ""Persons who use barrier contraception are less frequently infected by C. Trachomatis than those who use no contraception, and women who use oral contraceptives may have a higher incidence of cervical infection than women not using oral contraceptives"". As if replying to CGDT ""Chlamydial colonization of the cervix appears more likely in OC users than in non users, but despite this. there is a 40-50% reduction in risk for Chlamydial PID"" I then had to confirm the answer from Clinical Gynaecologic Endocrinology and Infeility 7,/e by Leon Speroff (It is the most authentic and reliable book for all problems related to Endocrinology, Contraception and Infeility) ""Fifteen of the 17 published studies repoed a positive association of oral contraception with lower Genital tract infections caused by Chlamydial cervicitis. Because lower genital tract infection are on the rise (now the most prevalent STI in the US) and the rate of hospitalization for PID is also increased, it is wohwhile for both patients and clinicians to be ale for symptoms of cervicitis or salpingitis in women on oral contraceptives who are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections."" As far as HPV infection i.e. Vaginal was is concerned 'The viral sexually transmitted infections (STI's) include HIV, Human papilloma virus (HPV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and hepatitis B (HBV).

Fimbriectomy is also known as:,Pomeroy technique,Uchid's procedure,Kroener's procedure,Irving's procedure,"The technique of fimbriectomy as described by kroener employs the ligation of the distal ampulla of the tube with two permanent sutures and then division and removal of the infundibulum of the tube. Pomeroy technique: The most popular technique of tubal ligation is the Pomeroy operation. The fallopian tube is identified on each side, brought out through the incision, and the middle poion is formed into a loop which is tied at the base with catgut and excised. Irving&;s procedure: The mid-poion of the tube is ligated and the intervening poion excised. The proximal end is buried in the myometrium and the distal end is buried in the broad ligament. It is a reliable method but is irreversible and may require a laporotomy incision. Uchida&;s method: The tubal serosa is stripped off the muscular layer in the mid-segment of the tube, which is then excised. The proximal end is ligated and buried in the broad ligament. The minimal excision of the tube preserves the potential for tuboplasty. Ref: Shaw&;s textbook of 17th edition Pgno: 272,273",C

Which of the following statements concerning placenta previa is true?,Its incidence decreases with maternal age,Its incidence is unaffected by parity,The initial hemorrhage is usually painless and rarely fatal,Management no longer includes a double setup,"The initial hemorrhage in placenta previa is usually painless and rarely fatal. If the fetus is premature and if hemorrhaging is not severe, vaginal examination of a woman suspected of having placenta previa frequently can be delayed until 37 weeks gestation; this delay in the potentially hazardous examination reduces the risk of prematurity, which is often associated with placenta previa. Vaginal examination, when needed to determine whether a low- lying placenta is covering the internal os of the cervix, should be performed in an operating room fully prepared for an emergency cesarean section (i.e., a double setup).

In a retrospective study of 123 women with PPCM, a history of hypertension was obtained in 43% of patients and twin pregnancies were reported in 13%.Idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with heart failure secondary to LV systolic dysfunction from 1 month antepartum, up to 5 months after delivery, when no other causes of heart failure is evident.Incidence of 1:300 to 1:4000 pregnancies.Predisposing factors:Multi-parity, Multiple Births, Smoking, diabetes, Pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia, eclampsia or hypertension, Advanced age or teenage pregnancy.Criteria for Peripartum Cardiomyopathy:Classic:Development of Cardiac failure in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months after delivery.Absence of an identifiable cause for the cardiac failure.Absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of pregnancy.Additional:Left ventricular systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classic Echo Cardio Graphic criteria such as depressed shortening fraction or ejection fraction.Peripartum Cardiomyopathy:Important diagnostic criteria are:Cardiac failure within last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum.No determinable cause for failure.Absence of previous heart disease.Left ventricular dysfunction as evidenced on echocardiography-Ejection fraction <45%-Left ventricular end diastolic dimension >2.7cm/m2. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. The patients are usually multiparous & young (20-35 years). They complain of weakness, shortness of breath, cough, nocturnal dyspnoea & palpitation. Examination reveals - tachycardia, arrhythmia, peripheral oedema & pulmonary rales. Pregnancy is poorly tolerated in women with dilated cardiomyopathy.The treatment is bed rest, digitalis, diuretics (preload reduction), hydralazine or ACE inhibitors (postpartum) (after load reduction), beta blocker & anticoagulant therapy. Vaginal delivery is preferred. Epidural anaesthesia is ideal. There is no contraindication of breast feeding. Mortality is high (20-50%) due to pulmonary embolism & cerebral thrombosis. It may recur in subsequent pregnancies.Myocardial infarction is rare in pregnancy. Management is mostly as in on pregnant state. Coronary angioplasty, stenting and thrombolytic therapy has been done in pregnancy when indicated. Supine position and hypotension should be avoided. Labor: managed as with standard cardiac care. Elective delivery within two weeks of infarction should be avoided. Regional analgesia for pain in labor and p blockers for tachycardia may be used. Maternal pushing is avoided and second stage is shortened by forceps or vacuum. Syntocinon should be used in the third stage management as ergometrine may cause coronary artery spasm. Percutaneous transluminant coronary angioplasty can be done successfully around 36 weeks of pregnancy if needed.",D

A primigravida at 37 week of gestation reported to labour room with central placenta previa with heavy bleeding per vaginum. The fetal heart rate was normal at the time of examination. The best management option of her is:,Expectant management,Cesarean section,Induction and vaginal delivery,Induction and forceps delivery,"The patient in the question:

Has gestational age = 37 weeks i.e. fetus has attained maturity so immediate termination of pregnancy is recommended.
Has central placenta previa Type IV i.e. vaginal delivery is contraindicated, cesarean section has to be done.
Patient is having heavy bleeding.

According to Fernando Arias 3/e, p 337
“In patients with heavy bleeding an efficient management plan including life support measures and immediate operative intervention is the only way to avoid a maternal death.”
It further says – on p 339
“Patients with placenta previa and severe bleeding should be delivered by cesarean section irrespective of the type of placenta previa.”
So, from the above discussion, it is very much clear that in this patient, immediate cesarean section is the best resort. Friends, here I want to point out that earlier it was said that for minor degrees of placenta previa, vaginal delivery can be tried, but now, irrespective of degree of placenta previa, cesarean section is done and recommended.",B

The patient is in active stage of labour once the cervix is effaced and dilated till 3 cm, following this the rate of dilatation is 1 cm/hour in cases of primigravidas and 1.5 cm/hour in cases of multigravidasThe beginning of the 2 stage of labour is characterized by the complete dilatation and the effacement of the cervixThe main aim of the 2 stage of the labor is the expulsion of the foetus through the female reproductive tract. The 2 stage consists of engagement, progressive flexion and descent, internal rotation, restitution, external rotation and lateral flexion for the delivery of the trunk.Engagement occurs when the greatest possible transverse diameter of the foetus enters the pelvic brim.Flexion and descent are the processes which occurs constantly during the 2 stage.Internal rotation is the most important step occurring in the 2 stage.Expulsion of the placenta is the 3 stage of labor which immediately follows the expulsion of the foetus.Once the baby is expelled, active management of the third stage of labour is recommended. In this immediately post the delivery of the baby, and after ensuring that the uterus is adequately contracted, controlled cord traction, uterine massage and administration of uterotonics is carried out.",A

Test for ovarian reserve:,LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"Ans. c. FSH /Ref Harrison 19e p2388, 18/e p17/e p2331]Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into Passive testing and Dynamic testing. FSH level is a method for testing passive ovarian reserve.""As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.""Ovarian reserve* Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg* During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovaiy. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. AH the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic.* The process of atresia is important because it normally allow s only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy.* The single follicle reaches a diameter of l-l .5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle.* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines.Methods of assessing ovarian reserve:* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age.* Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelerated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30. So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovrian reserve have been developed.* Goal of methods for assessing ovarian reserve is to provide information regarding oocyte quality and quantity.Methods for Assessing Ovarian ReservePassive testingDynamic testingFSH level:* Early folloicular phase FSH levels play an important role in pregnancy outcomes.* As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality.* High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.Measurement of Inhibin B:* Inhibin B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally found in postmenopausal women.* Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve.Transvaginal ultrasound:* Diminshed ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by fertility drugs.* Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume.)Ciomiphene citrate challenge test:* Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen.* Clomiphene is able to exert this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low.* In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene.* When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test. the first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphere is administered on cycle day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurement are repeated on cycle day 10.* In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",C

Sperm capacitation takes place in -,Testes,Epididymis,Female genital tract,All of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Female genital tract * After the ejaculation the sperm cells go through several essential physiological changes during their time in the female genital tract before they, at the end, are able to penetrate the oocyte membrane.* The first change in this cascade is capacitation. The sperm cells accomplish this during the ascension through the female genital tract (in contact with its secretions). It has to do with a physiological maturation process of the sperm cell membranes, which is seen as the precondition for the next step to follow, namely the acrosome reaction.* Capacitation is a functional maturation of the spermatozoon. The changes take place via the sperm cell membrane in which it may be that receptors are made available through the removal of a glycoprotein layer. The area of the acrosomal cap is also so altered thereby that the acrosome reaction becomes possible.* Through the membrane alterations, the motile properties of the spermatozoon also change. Discharging whipping movements of the tail together with larger sideways swinging movements of the head take place. This type of motility is designated as hyperactivity. One can therefore say that the visible consequences of capacitation consist in hyperactivity of the spermatozoon.",C

D: PPH not controlled by ligation of internal iliac Hysterectomy is normally recommended for: Reproductive system cancers (uterine, cervical, ovarian). As a prophylactic treatment for those with either a strong family history of reproductive system cancers. Severe and intractable endometriosis (overgrowth of the uterine lining) and/or adenomyosis (a more severe form of endometriosis, where the uterine lining has grown into and sometimes through the uterine wall). Postpaum to remove either a severe case of placenta prae (a placenta that has either formed over or inside the bih canal) or placenta accreta (a placenta that has grown into and through the wall of the uterus to attach itself to other organs), as well as a last reso in case of excessive postpaum bleeding. Several forms of vaginal prolapse. Heavy or abnormal menstrual bleeding. Hysterectomy is occasionally performed for fibroid (benign tumor-like growths inside the uterus itself made up of muscle and connective tissue). Most hysterectomies are done laparotomy/ open technique/ open hysterectomy. The open technique carries increased risk of hemorrhage due to the large blood supply in the pelvic region, as well as an increased risk of infection. However, an open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to ensure complete removal of the reproductive system as well as providing a wide opening for visual inspection of the abdominal cavity. Complications: Hemorrhage Infection Constipation Urinary retention Blood clots -- Pelvic surgery increases the risk of developing blood clots in the large veins of the leg or lung.

Alpha chain of HCG is identical to all except ?,LH,TSH,FSH,ACTH,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., ACTH Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) HCG is a placental hormone. It is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblasitc cells of the placental villi It is a glycoprotein It is a dimer and has two dissimilar subunits a Subunits b Subunits But only the b subunit of HCG is typically measured as a tumour marker because of specificity of the b subunit The b subunit of HCG has unique sequences that are not shared with other human glycoprotein hormones. It is detected by radioimmunoassay using antibodies to the b chain. HCG is not used as tumour marker because a unit of the FSH, LH and TSH are identical So there can be cross reactivity between a subunits of these hormone. That is why in case of testicular tumours the patients also undergo simultaneous assay of LH to be ceain that the marker detected is b HCG.",D
Emergency contraceptives are effective if administered within following period after unprotected intercourse :,24 hours,48 hours,72 hours,120 hours,"Ans. is d i.e. 120 hours The standard recommendation is to sta emergency contraceptive not later than 72 hours. The greatest protection is offered if it is taken within 12 hours, as postponing the dose by 12 hours raises the chances of pregnancy by almost 50% For this reason, the treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after sexual exposure. Note : But here the question says - till how / long are ECs effective or till how long can they be adminsitered. ""The tables can be offered upto 120 hours, but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital - drug interval."" According to current concepts in contraceptions and women health also -Emergency contraception can be given upto 5 days. This is becasue ""Emergency contraception is not an aboifacient i.e. it will not act after implantation has occured. This is also the basis for the window period of 5 days for use effectiveness of EC ,as the whole proocess from deposition of sperms to implantation takes about 5 days.""",D

Which of the following is the BEST indicator of ovarian reserve?,FSH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH ratio,Measurement of rise in basal FSH is an excellent indicator of ovarian aging. As women age serum FSH concentrations in the early follicular phase begins to increase due to a decline in the number of small follicles secreting inhibin. Day 3 FSH concentration greater than 20 to 25 IU/L is considered to be elevated and is associated with poor reproductive outcome. Measurement of serum E2 levels along with serum FSH adds to the predictive power of an isolated FSH determination. Basal E2 concentration greater than 75 to 80 pg/ml are associated with poor response to ovarian stimulation and pregnancy outcome.

All of the following are features of mullerian agenesis except :,46 XX karyotype,Normal breast development,Absent vagina,Ovarian agenesis,"Ans:D.)Ovarian agenesis Mullerian agenesis It is Mayer Rokitansky-Kuster Hauser syndrome. . Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Mullerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper poion. Mullerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because ovaries do not develop from the Mullerian ducts, affected women might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infeile due to the lack of a functional uterus. Signs and Symptoms: An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, the person will enter pubey with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and adrenarche (pubic hair). The person's chromosome constellation will be 46,XX. At least one ovary is intact, if not both, and ovulation usually occurs. Typically, the vagina is shoened and intercourse may, in some cases, be difficult and painful.

The syndrome is caused by blood circulation problems in and around the Fallopian tubes and ovaries, pressure on nerves, and intrapelvic adhesion. Differentiating between this syndrome and endometritis during diagnosis and differentiating between functional hemorrhage due to hormonal abnormality and anatomical hemorrhage due to polyp or tumor is very impoant. Since the symptoms of this syndrome are mild, simple symptomatic treatment is sufficient in most cases. In some cases, however, desquamation surgery or reversal of tubal ligation may be necessary. Endoscopic surgery is also available. In Japan, because of widespread use of condoms and IUDs, tubal ligation is not very common.",D

But since progestin only pills are not given the second best choice is Barrier contraception Barrier method -- Condoms can be used as a method of contraception in lactating females. It has the advantage of being readily available and having no effect on breast feeding. They also provide protection against sexually transmitted diseases but can be irritating to vaginal tissue and may require additional lubrication. Barrier methods are an excellent choice in motivated couples"" Lactational amenorrhea For mothers who are nursing exclusively , ovulation occurring during the first 10 weeks after delivery is unlikely. But it is not a reliable method if mother is nursing only in day time. Waiting for first menses involves a risk of pregnancy because ovulation usually antedates menstruation. Safe period method -- In this method the feile period is calculated and the female should refrain from having sex during that period The basic prerequisite of this method is that cycles should be regular which is usually not the case with lactating mothers -- safe period method is not applicable in them. IUCD'S -- IUCD'S can be used as an alternative to progesterone only pills by lactating mothers but only following complete uterine involution FRemember in Nutshell -- 1s1 contraceptive of choice in lactating mother -- progesterone only pill 2'd contraceptive of choice in -- Barrier method Most effective contraceptive in lactating mother is progestin only pill.",A

Whole of the transformation zone needs to be visualised, as this area is believed to be the site of neoplastic change. Colposcopy is deemed unsatisfactory if the whole of the transformation zone is not visualised. This situation may arise in postmenopausal women, and the clinician may reso to a sho course of oral oestrogens; and when colposcopy is repeated 6 -- 8 weeks later, the squamocolumnar junction will often be visible.

It is especially appropriate at 13 to 16 weeks gestation, although many proponents use this procedure through 20 weeks.# If induction of labor is chosen, vaginal PGE2 is used, one 20-mg suppository is placed high in the posterior vaginal vault every 4 hours until the fetus and placenta are expelled.# In this situation, a retained placenta is relatively common and may require manual removal and uterine curettage.# Misoprostol, 200-mg tablets placed high in the vagina every 4 hours, is equally effective.

What does the below diagram indicate?,Abruptio placenta,Placenta accreta,Placenta increta,Placenta percreta,"The above image shows the placental villi penetrating through the myometrium and getting attached to the serosa. Hence, this is known as placenta percreta. Placenta Accreta syndromes include any placental implantation with abnormally firm adherence to myometrium because of paial or total absence of decidua basalis and imperfect development of the fibrinoid. The increased risk conveyed by previous uterine trauma (eg., cesaerean delivery) may be paially explained by an increased vulnerability of the decidua to trophoblast invasion following incision into the decidua. Microscopically, placental villi are anchored to muscle fibers rather than to decidual cells. Decidual deficiency then prevents normal placental seperation after delivery. Variants of placental accreta syndromes are classified by the depth of trophoblastic growth: Types Definition Placenta accreta Villi are attached to the myometrium Placenta increta Villi invade the myometrium Placenta percreta Villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa In cases of first- and second-trimester accreta syndromes, there is usually hemorrhage that is the consequence of coexisting placenta pre.

During pregnancy, there is a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure and a fall in plasma osmolality. Moreover, there is an increase in venous pressure created by partial occlusion of the vena cava by the gravid uterus, which also contributes to pedal edema. Diuretics are sometimes given to pregnant women who have chronic hypertension, but this is not the case in this patient. More commonly, Lasix is used in the acute setting to treat pulmonary edema. This patient is not hypertensive and does not have any other signs or symptoms of preeclampsia and therefore does not need to be admitted for a further workup. Trace protein in the urine is common in normal pregnancies and is not of concern.

The regimen used for expectant management of placenta previa is -,Macafee & Johnson regimen,Brandt Andrew method,Credes method,Mcdonald's regimen,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., MacAfee and Johnson regimen It has long been taught that placenta previa cannot be managed expectantly.It was believed that a patient with major degree of placenta previa would in the absence of intervention frequently bleed to death and that fatal hemorrhage may ensue without warning.But evidence is accumulating that more morbidity is produced by overtreatment rather than observation.In their overenthusiasm to manage the placenta previa patients actively, by L.S.C.S., most of the obstetricians end up delivering premature baby.It has been a major conclusion in several studies that most important cause of fetal morbidity in placenta previa is i fetal prematurity"" which in many cases occur due to ""over active"" intervention.Macafee's and Jhonson 's great contribution lav in their advocacy of expectant treatment there by reducing the prematurity.The aim of expectant management is to prolong pregnancy till the fetus is reasonably mature and if possible till term. Sometimes cases of minor previa presenting early in pregnancy may resolve spontaneously with expectant management.As a rule, the first hemorrhage is not lethal either to the mother or child particularly in case of a primigravida and it soon ceases in practically every case.The separated area of the placenta becomes infarcted and the maternal vessels supplying the exposed portion of the placental site thrombose.If more than l/3rd area of the placenta is not detached, the fetus, also develops some compensatory mechanism to meet its oxygen requirement.Johnson and MacAfee's regimen includesIn hospital management till delivery which includesRestMonitoring of mother and fetusCorrecting anemia with blood transfusionsUltrasound localisation of placentaPer speculum examination, once active bleeding ceasesDigital examination is avoided in all casesBlood transfusion (maternal hematocrit 30%)",A

A baby is born with a large defect in the occipital bone through which the posterior poion of the brain has herniated. Which of the following terms best describes this lesion?,Encephalocele,Meningocele,Myelocele,Spina bifida,"The central neurons system and its overlying bones are subject to a variety of malformations and developmental diseases. The defect described in the question stem is a cranial encephalocele, in which brain herniates through a defect in the skull bones. The most common site for such a herniation is the occipital bone. Small defects in the occipital bone can be treated surgically, but large defects are very problematic, paicularly if significant herniation has occurred, since the brain becomes very vulnerable to trauma and infection. Meningocele is the term used when the meninges, but not the brain or spinal cord, herniate through a defect in the bony cranium or spinal column. Myelocele is the term used when the spinal cord herniates through a defect in the spinal column. Spina bifida refers to veebral defects through which the spinal cord or meninges may herniate.

Prolactin is under the control of prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF), which is produced in the hypothalamus. Many drugs (e.g., the phenothiazines), stress, hypothalamic lesions, stalk lesions, and stalk compression decrease PIF. In hypothyroidism, elevated TRH acts as a prolactin-releasing hormone to cause release of prolactin from the pituitary; hyperthyroidism is not associated with hyperprolactinemia.

"Common cause of ""Sepsis syndrome"" in obstetrics includes",Antepartum pyelonephritis,Puerperal infection,Chorioamnionitis,All of the above,"Ans. d (All of the above)SEPSIS SYNDROME# The sepsis syndrome is induced by a systemic inflammatory response to bacteria or their by-products such as endotoxins or exotoxins.# Infections that most commonly cause the sepsis syndrome in obstetrics are:- Antepartum pyelonephritis,- Chorioamnionitis and puerperal sepsis,- Septic abortion, and- Necrotizing fasciitis.# Etiopathogenesis- usually polymicrobial- most commonly Escherichia coli.- Other pathogens are aerobic and anaerobic streptococci, Bacteroides species, and Clostridium species. Some group A -hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus produce virulent exotoxins that can rapidly cause all features of the sepsis syndrome. Some virulent streptococci produce proteases that degrade IL-8. In pyelonephritis, E coli and Klebsiella species commonly cause bacteremia and sepsis syndrome.- Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide released on lysis of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.- A number of potent bacterial exotoxins can also cause severe sepsis syndrome. Examples include exotoxins from Clostridium perfringens, toxic shock syndrome toxin from S aureus, and toxic shock-like exotoxin from group A -hemolytic streptococci.- These exotoxins cause rapid and extensive tissue necrosis and gangrene, especially of the postpartum uterus, and may cause profound cardiovascular collapse with maternal death.",D

Serum LH level is 35 mIU/mL and FSH is 9 mIU/mL. Androstenedione and testosterone levels are mildly elevated, but serum DHAS is normal. The patient does not wish to conceive at this time. Which of the following single agents is the most appropriate treatment of her condition?",Oral contraceptives,Corticosteroids,GnRH,Parlodel,"This patient has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), diagnosed by the clinical picture, abnormally high LH-to-FSH ratio (which should normally be approximately 1:1), and elevated androgen but normal DHAS. DHAS is a marker of adrenal androgen production; when normal, it essentially excludes adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism. Several medications have been used to treat hirsutism associated with PCOS. For many years contraceptives were the most frequently used agents; they can suppress hair growth in up to two-thirds of treated patients. They act by directly suppressing ovarian steroid production and increasing hepatic binding globulin production, which binds circulating hormone and lowers the concentration of metabolically active (free unbound) androgen. However, clinical improvement can take as long as 6 months to manifest. Other medications that have shown promise include medroxyprogesterone acetate, spironolactone, cimetidine, and GnRH agonists, which suppress ovarian steroid production. However, GnRH analogues are expensive and have been associated with significant bone demineralization after only 6 months of therapy in some patients. Surgical wedge resection is no longer considered an appropriate therapy for PCOS given the success of pharmacologic agents and the ovarian adhesions that were frequently associated with this surgery.",A

They are often referred to as uterine myomas, and are incorrectly called fibroids because the considerable amount of collagen contained in many of them creates a fibrous consistency. Estrogen has a hormonal role in the patho-physiology of formation of fibroids. * Drugs used to decrease the size of the fibroid: # GnRH analogue (Buserelin, Nafarelin, Goserelin, Triptorelin, Leuprorelin acetate) # GnRH antagonist: Cetrirelix, Ganirelix # Mifepristone (anti-progesterone) # Danazol",B

It has been observed that the procedure gives optimum results in terms of least occurrence of associated risks when performed between 42nd and 49th day since the last menstrual period. When the procedure is performed before the 35th day since the LMP, there is the possibility that there was no pregnancy at all and that the procedure was unwarranted. When performed after the 49th day, there is a possibility that the procedure may have not been sufficient to remove the embryonic growth completely.",C

Fetal distress is the commonest cause of Cesarean section in modern obstetrics. Also, 'meconium in the liquor' indicates present or recent fetal strain. If the fetal hea rate is reassuring and patient is likely to deliver soon, then we can do amnio-infusion to dilute the meconium in the liqour with strict fetal monitoring and expedite delivery.

Hormone responsible for ferning pattern of cervical mucus: March 2007,Progesterone,Estrogen,LH,Prolactin,"Ans. B: Estrogen An enzyme called plasmin contained in the endometrium tends to inhibit the blood from clotting. Follicular Phase Through the influence of a rise in (FSH), five to seven teiary-stage ovarian follicles are recruited for entry into the next menstrual cycle. One (or occasionally two) dominant follicles will continue to maturity and secrete increasing amounts of estradiol which initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium Ovulation When the egg has matured, it secretes enough estradiol to trigger the acute release of (LH). In the average cycle this LH surge stas around cycle 12th day and may last 48 hours and leads to ovulation. At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and has the propey of great elasticity and this is called spinnbarkeiti thread test under estrogenic activity. When viewed under the microscope, the mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation, which is due to presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogenic effect. Luteal phase After ovulation, the residual follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. This corpus luteum will produce Progesterone in addition to estrogens for approximately the next 2 weeks. Progesterone plays a vital role in conveing the proliferative endometrium into a secretory lining receptive for implantation and suppoive of the early pregnancy. It raises the body temperature. Hormonal control Gonadal Estradiol peaks twice, during follicular growth and during the luteal phase. Progesterone remains viually absent prior to ovulation, but becomes critical in the luteal phase and during pregnancy. Many tests for ovulation check for the presence of progesterone. After ovulation the corpus luteum which develops from the burst follicle and remains in the ovary secretes both estradiol and progesterone. Hypothalamus and pituitary These sex hormones come under the influence of the pituitary gland, and both FSH and LH play necessary roles: FSH stimulates immature follicles in the ovaries to grow. LH triggers ovulation. The Gonadotropin releasing hormone of the hypothalamus controls the pituitary, yet both the pituitary and the hypothalamus receive feedback from the follicle.",B

HIV transmission in relation to pregnancy is maximum during:,Labor and delivery,First trimester,Second trimester,Breastfeeding,"Ans. A. Labor and deliverya. The maximum risk is at labor and delivery. A baby can become infected with HIV in the womb, during delivery or while breast-feeding. If the mother does not receive treatment, 25% of babies born to women with HIV will be infected by the virus.b. With treatment that percentage can be reduced to less than 2%. If no preventative steps are taken, the risk of HIV transmission during childbirth is estimated to be 10-20%.c. The chance of transmission is even greater if the baby is exposed to HIV-infected blood or fluids. Health care providers should avoid performing amniotomies (intentionally rupturing the amniotic sac to induce labor), episiotomies and other procedures that expose the baby to the mother's blood.d. The risk of transmission increases by 2% for every hour after membranes have been ruptured.e. Cesarean sections performed before labor and/or the rupture of membranes may significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.f. About 15% of newborns born to HIV-positive women will become infected if they breastfeed for 24 months or longer.",A

"A 19-year-old patient presents to your office with primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast and pubic hair development, but the uterus and vagina are absent. Diagnostic possibilities include",XYY syndrome,Gonadal dysgenesis,Mullerian agenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Since this patient has other signs of pubertal development which are sex steroid-dependent, we can conclude some ovarian function is present. This excludes such conditions as gonadal dysgenesis and hypothalamic-pituitary failure as possible causes of her primary amenorrhea. Mullerian defects are the only plausible cause, and the diagnostic evaluation in this patient would be directed toward both confirmation of this diagnosis and establishment of the exact nature of the Mullerian defect. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, presents as amenorrhea with absence of a vagina. The incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 female births. The karyotype is 46, XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, tubes, and external genitalia. There are associated skeletal (12%) and urinary tract (33%) anomalies. Treatment generally consists of progressive vaginal dilation or creation of an artificial vagina with split-thickness skin grafts (Mclndoe procedure). Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46, XY. These genetic males have a defective androgen receptor and/or downstream signal transduction mechanism (in the genome) such that the androgenic signal does not have its normal tissue-specific effects. This accounts for 10% of all cases of primary amenorrhea. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased. Although there is a 25% incidence of malignant tumors in these patients, gonadectomy should be deferred until after full development is obtained. In other patients with a Y chromosome, gonadectomy should be performed as early as possible to prevent masculinization. Patients with gonadal dysgenesis present with lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have a karyotype of 47, XXY and a male phenotype. Causes of primary amenorrhea, in descending order of frequency, are gonadal dysgenesis, Mullerian agenesis, and testicular feminization.

For those interested in knowing : how placenta is formed from these villi : continue reading (but no question has been asked on it till yet). Development of placenta As pregnancy advances, villi on the embryonic pole grow and develop into the chorion frondosum, whereas villi on the opposite abembryonic pole degenerate. and this smooth chorion is called the chorion laeve. Similarly, the decidua overlying the chorion frondosum is called the decidua basalis, with large decidual cells full of glycogen and lipids. The decidua over the abembyronic pole is the decidua capsularis. The chorion frondosum along with decidua basalis forms the placenta. The formation of placenta begins in 6th weeks and is completed by 12th week.",A

The major predisposing factor in the development of ectopic pregnancy is pelvic inflammatory disease. However, any operative procedure on the fallopian tubes may increase a patient's risk. It appears that tubal sterilizations with laparoscopic fulguration have a higher rate of ectopic pregnancy than tubal ligations performed with clips or rings.

The attitude of the fetus shows complete flexion of the limbs with extension of the spine. There is complete extension of the head so that the occiput is in contact with the back.
The denominator is mentum.
The commonest position is left mentoanterior (LMA).
Face presentation present during pregnancy (primary) is rare, while that developing after the onset of labor (secondary) is common. It occurs more frequently seen in multiparae (70%), like other malpresentations.
Most common maternal cause is platypelloid pelvis and most common fetal cause is anencephaly.

Vaginal epithelium is derived from:,Endoderm of urogenital sinus,Mesoderm of urogenital sinus,Endoderm of genital ridge,Mesoderm of genital ridge,"The wall of the vagina from the lumen outwards consists firstly of a mucosa of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with an underlying lamina propria of connective tissue, secondly a layer of smooth muscle with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers, and thirdly an outer layer of connective tissue called the adventitia. Some texts list four layers by counting the two sublayers of the mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) separately. The lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers, with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle, an inner layer of circular muscle, and oblique muscle fibers between. The outer layer, the adventitia, is a thin dense layer of connective tissue, and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers that is present between the pelvic organs.The epithelial covering of the cervix is continuous with the epithelial lining of the vagina. The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands. The vaginal epithelium consists of three rather arbitrary layers of cells - superficial flat cells, intermediate cells and basal cells - and estrogen induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with glycogen. The superficial cells exfoliate continuously and basal cells replace them Under the influence of maternal estrogen, newborn females have a thick stratified squamous epithelium for two to four weeks after bih. After that, the epithelium remains thin with only a few layers of cells without glycogen until pubey, when the epithelium thickens and glycogen containing cells are formed again, under the influence of the girl's rising estrogen levels. Finally, the epithelium thins out during menopause onward and eventually ceases to contain glycogen, because of the lack of estrogen In abnormal circumstances, such as in pelvic organ prolapse, the vaginal epithelium may be exposed becoming dry and keratinized",A

They are each graded on a scale of 1-4 (1+ is < 1 cell per field, 2+ is 1-5 cells per field, 3+ is 6-30 cells per field, and 4+ is > 30 cells per field).* In this system, Lactobacillus and Bacteroides / Gardnerella are given scores between 0-4 but Mobiluncus is only graded from 0-2.* Total scores are then calculated and used as follows: 0-3 (Normal), 4-6 (intermediate bacterial count), and 7-10 (bacterial vaginosis).",D
"A 38-year-old woman complains to a physician because of having chronic pelvic pressure. On fuher questioning, she repos chronic lower back pain, constipation, difficulty in walking, and difficulty while intercourse. Pelvic examination showed uterine cervix lying low within the vaginal canal, but does not protrude through the introitus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cystocele,Femoral hernia,Rectocele,Uterine prolapse,"Uterine prolapse is the term used for when the uterus descends from its normal position to one lower in the body. The prolapse is graded based on the level of descent. This woman has first degree prolapse, with descent of the cervix into the vagina. Second degree prolapse is characterized by protrusion of the cervix through the introitus. Third degree prolapse is characterized by complete eversion of the vagina. Uterine prolapse, rectocele, and cystocele are usually due to problems with the strength of the muscles forming the pelvic floor, and the lesions are classified as pelvic relaxation disorders. A history of trauma (notably related to multiple pregnancies) and hormonal changes (e.g., menopause) is frequently elicited. Cystocele refers to the descent of the bladder to a lower than normal position. It is usually due to problems with the strength of the muscles forming the pelvic floor, and the lesions are classified as pelvic relaxation disorders. A history of trauma (notably related to multiple pregnancies) and hormonal changes (e.g., menopause) is frequently elicited. A femoral hernia would present with a mass in the upper pa of the thigh, adjacent to the groin. Rectocele refers to descent of the rectum to a lower than normal position.",D
A young nulliparous woman has 3rd degree uterovaginal prolapse without any cystocele or rectocele. There is no stress incontinence. Uterocervical length is 3 inches. All other symptoms are normal.

Risk factors for congenital prolapse:


Spina bifida
Connective tissue disorders like Marfans syndrome, Ehler Danlos syndrome


Cystocele is not seen in congenital prolapse and in congenital prolapse there is infravaginal elongation of cervix (not supravaginal which is usually seen).

Management of congenital prolapse is:
Abdominal sling surgeries/ cervicopexy Like

A Hysterosalpingogram was performed for infertility evaluation and revealed the appearance shown here. The diagnosis is?,Septate uterus,Bicornuate uterus,Unicornuate uterus,Arcuate uterus,"Ans. B. Bicornuate uterusMullerian duct anomalies are an often-treatable cause of infertility. Mullerian duct anomalies are estimated to occur in 0.1-0.5% of women. However, the true prevalence is unknown because the anomalies usually are discovered in patients presenting with infertility. Full-term pregnancies have occurred in patients with forms of bicornuate, septate, or didelphys uteri; therefore, true prevalence may be slightly higher than currently estimated. An association exists between mullerian duct anomalies and renal anomalies such as unilateral agenesis.The bicornuate uterus results from incomplete fusion of the uterovaginal horns at the level of the fundus and accounts for approximately 10% OF mullerian duct anomalies. Patients with a bicornuate uterus and no extrauterine infertility issues usually have little difficulty conceiving. A bicornuate uterus consists of two symmetric cornua that are fused caudally, with communication of the endometrial cavities--most often at the level of the uterine isthmus. The intervening cleft of the complete bicornuate uterus extends to the internal cervical os (bicornuate unicollis), while the cleft of a partial bicornuate configuration is of variable length. A bicornuate bicollis uterus is associated with a duplicated cervix, although a degree of communication is maintained between the two horns. The bicornuate uterus has been reported to have the highest associated prevalence--38%--of cervical incompetence among mullerian duct anomalies.",B

Which can be used in pregnancy aEUR',>ACE inhibitors,>Aldosterone,>AT receptor antagonist,>Propylthiouracil,"Propylthiouracil Propylthiouracil is the drug of choice for hypehyroidism during pregnancy. Antithyroid drugs in pregnancy Propylthiouracil and methirnezole are both antithyroid drugs that cross the placenta and can lead to fetal goiter. Methimazole has been associated with ""cutis aplasia"". Scalp defects cloanal atresia esophageal atresia and increased maternal side effects. Because both medications are equally effective the drug of choice for hypehyroidism in pregnancy is propylthiouracil. Propylthiouracil is not available throughout the world and in those conditions methimazole may be substituted. Antihypeensives in pregnancy Angiotensin conveing enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) e.g., Enalapril, captopril can cause fetal renal tubular dysplasia in the second and third trimesters leading to oligohydramenios fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformities and hypoplastic lung development. A recent large coho study found an increased risk of congenital malformations with isolated first trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors. Infants exposed in utero to ACE inhibitors were at increased risk of cardiovascular and CNS malformations. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists have been shown to have second and third trimester findings consistent with ACE inhibitors and are not recommended in pregnancy.

The neonate will have passive immunity and will not develop the infection. Therefore, the best method to prevent neonatal infection is to continue the pregnancy for at least one week after the mother develops the rash. If delivery occurs within one week, the baby should be given VZIG soon after birth.",A

"A 26-year-old patient has had three consecutive spontaneous abortions early in the second trimester. As part of an evaluation for this problem, the least useful test would be",Hysterosalpingogram,Chromosomal analysis of the couple,Endometrial biopsy in the luteal phase,Postcoital test,"A major cause of spontaneous abortions in the first trimester is chromosomal abnormalities; however, the causes of losses in the second trimester are more likely to be uterine or environmental in origin. Patients should be screened for thyroid function, diabetes mellitus, and collagen vascular disorders. There is also a correlation between patients with a positive lupus anticoagulant and recurrent miscarriages. A hysterosalpingogram should be performed to rule out uterine structural abnormalities, such as bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, unicornuate uterus, submucous fibroids, or intrauterine adhesions. Endometrial biopsy is performed to rule out an insufficiency of the luteal phase or evidence of chronic endometritis. If no abnormalities are found, both the husband and wife should be karyotyped to see if a balanced translocation or 45, X mosaicism exists. A postcoital test is useful for couples who cannot conceive but does not address post conception losses.",D

If the life style factor that is causing infeility in a young male is identified. Which of the following life style modification will have no effect?,Weight gain,Less exercise,Vegetarian diet,Weight loss,"Ans. c. Vegetarian diet Vegetarian diet will have minimal or no effect on feility. 1 'Weight definitely matters when it comes to feility. Women who are overweight - or underweight - tend to have a more difficult time conceiving. The same goes for men, but more about that later.'- http //www early-pregnancy-tests com/ weight-feility html 'Exercise can affect feility in several ways. Over-exercising is one of the bigger causes of infeility for women. If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of feility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their feility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen. This overproduction of estrogen can negatively impact ovulation and conception. In addition, being overweight puts you at risk for insulin resistance, which can ultimately keep you from ovulating. http://wwwbabyhopes.com/aicles/exercise-feility.html",C

She is concerned about taking these medications now that she is pregnant.Which of the following is true regarding asthma medications in pregnancy:,B2 agonist are contraindicated during pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both contraindicated in pregnancy.,Both B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are safe in pregnancy,B2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroids are both safe in pregnancy but during 2nd and 3rd trimester only,"Asthma in Pregnancy – Important Points:

Asthma is the most common chronic condition in pregnancy and affects 3–12% of gestations.
Effects of pregnancy on asthma: The course of the disease is very much unpredictable. In about 20%, the condition improves, in 30%, it deteriorates and in 50%, it remains unchanged.
It is more likely to deteriorate in women with severe asthma.
Exacerbations are most frequent between 24 to 36 weeks gestation and are most commonly precipitated by viral respiratory infections and non compliance with inhaled corticosteroid regimens.
Because asthma exacerbation can be severe, they should be treated aggressively in pregnancy.
Effects of asthma on pregnancy: Preterm labor PROM, preeclampsia, LBW baby and slight increase in abruptio placenta.
Severity of asthma correlates with FEV1 and PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) FEV1 ideally is > 80% of the predicted value and PEFR FEV1 less than 1L or less than 20% of predicted value, correlates with severe disease.

Management of Asthma in Pregnancy:

Mild asthma: Inhaled beta agonist (albuterol preferred because of more human data on safety in pregnancy).
Mild persistent: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids (Budesonide preferred).
Moderate: Low dose inhaled corticosteroids and long acting b agonist (Salmetrol preferred).
Severe: High dose inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist and oral steroids if needed.

Best prognosis in infeile women is seen in / most reversible form of infeility is :,Tubal block,Anovulation,Oligospermia,Endometritis,"Ans. is b i.e. Anovulation ""Disorders of ovulation account for about 30 - 40 % of all cases of female infeility. These disorders are generally among the most easily diagnosed and most treatable causes of infeility."" In couples with infeility ovulatory disorder have the best prognosis. Relatively poor prognosis is observed in male factor infeility and tuba! factor infeility. Prognosis can be arranged as below in descending order on the basis of cumulative pregnancy. Ovulatory factor > unexplained > Male factors > Endometriosis > Tubal factors. Treatment of anovulation is determined by the diagnosis : An elevated FSH along with chronic anovulation indicates ovarian resistance or failure : treatment is steroids / in vitro feilisation in such cases. If chronic anovulation is present along with normal FSH and prolactin : then induction of ovulation can be achieved in 90% of cases. - A treatment plan is done using clomiphene as the first drug : 1. Colmiphene citrate : it is the agent of choice for women with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea having sufficient ovarian function to maintain estrogen at a serum level of 40pg/ml.

Earliest detection of pregnancy by ultrasound is by:,Gestation sac,Fetal node,FSH,Fetal skeleton,"Ans. is a i.e. Gestational sac ""The first definitive sonographic finding to suggest pregnancy is visualization of the gestational sac."" First sign of intrauterine pregnancy is presence of yolk sac within the gestational sac.deg Extra Edge The position of a normal gestational sac is in the mid to upper uterus. As the sac implants into the decidualized endometrium it is adjacent to the linear central cavity echo complex without displacing this echogenic anatomic landmark. This is known as Intradecidual Sign. As the sac enlarges it gradually impresses on and deforms the central cavity echo complex giving rise to the characteristic sonographic appearance of the double decidual sac signdeg This sign is most effective with transabdominal sonography, performed at 5 - 6 weeks gestational age because using this approach, sonographer can confirm the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy before a yolk sac is identified.",A

The advantages of hysterectomy in molar pregnancy are:,Chance of choriocarcinoma becomes nil,Follow up is not required,Enlarged ovaries can be removed during operation,Chance of pulmonary embolisation is minimal,"Hysterectomy when performed in molar pregnancy significantly decreases the chances of developing choriocarcinoma (by 5 fold times) but does not make it nil and hence follow up is required (so both options a and b are incorrect)

This is supported by following lines from Dutta-
“It should be remembered that following hysterectomy, persistent GTD is observed in 3–5% cases. As such, it does not eliminate the necessity of follow up.The enlarged ovaries (theca lutein cysts) found during operation should be left undisturbed as they will regress following removal of mole. But, if complication arises, like torsion, rupture or infarction, they should be removed.”
Dutta 7/e, p 195
Thus from above lines it is also clear that ovaries even if they are enlarged should not be removed during hysterectomy for h mole.
As far as pulmonary embolisation in concerned -acute pulmonary insufficiency due to pulmonary embolization of trophoblastic cells, is a complication seen with suction evaculation and not hysterectomy.",D

If the fetal head is at station below this or rotation doesn't exceed 45, then one can apply outlet forceps. Mid forceps are for station above+ 2 cm and high forceps are not applied and considered unsafe It's better to do a 'Safe' caesarean section than to do a 'complicated' high forceps Classification for operative vaginal delivery Outlet Fetal scalp visible without separating the labia Fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor Sagittal suture is in the anterio - posterior diameter or right or left occiput anterior or posterior position (rotation does not exceed 45o) Fetal head is at on the perineum Low Leading point of the skull (not caput) is at station plus 2 cm or more and not on the pelvic floor. Two Subdivisions: Rotation of 45o or less from the occipito - anterior position. Rotation of more than 45o including the occipito - posterior position Mid Fetal head is no more than 1/5th palpable per abdomen Leading point of the skull as is above station plus 2 cm but not above the ischial spines.

Assessment of caput and moulding. Pelvis is deemed adequate. Irreducible moulding may indicate cephalo-pelvic dispropoion Although traditional teaching says that vacuum can be applied after 6-7 cms cervical dilatation, Forceps and vacuum extractor deliveries before full dilatation of the cervix are contraindicated. Forceps can be used for the after-coming head of the breech Avoid use of vacuum extraction below 34 weeks +0 days of gestation susceptibility of the preterm infant to cephalohaematoma, intracranial haemorrhage, subgaleal haemorrhage and neonatal jaundice. Higher rates of failure with instrumental delivery are associated with: maternal body mass index over 30 estimated fetal weight over 4000 g or clinically big baby occipito-posterior position mid-cavity delivery or when 1/5th of the head palpable per abdomen.

The diagnosis goes more in our of Ectopic pregnancy because values of phCG are very high -- In case of failed intrauterine pregnancy -- at this high level of IihCG, either the dead fetus or the Yolk Sac etc. would have been visible (if the case was of missed aboion) or patient would have given history of bleeding and passage of product of conception (if it would have been a case of complete aboion --) then only the gestational sac can be empty).But here is no such history. So the chances of ectopic pregnancy are more. But since, this option is not given so I will directly do medical management in this case. If there is any doubt -- see the following flow cha given both in williams obs and gynae--which clearly shows-- if the value of phCG is more than the discriminatory zone then either a D&C should be done or ectopic should be managed straight away.",A

i. Infection
ii. Prior cervical surgery
iii. Use of antiestrogens (e.g. clomiphene citrate) for ovulation induction (so clomiphene is a cause of cervical factor
infertility rather than management)
iv. Sperm antibodies
The treatment of cervical factor thus depends on the cause:
• If it is due to chronic cervicitis/infection - Treatment of infection by antibiotics is the cure.
• If is due to decreased mucus volume - Treatment includes short term supplementation with exogenous estrogen like ethinyl estradiol and use of mucolytic expectorant like guaifenesin. However, their value has not been confirmed.
• If it is due to antisperm antibodies. Treatment options include:
– Use of condom or diaphragm as a barrier method for 3 months. During this period, the antibodies will disappear and conception may occur then.
– Corticosteroids given to female partner can also help in getting rid of these antibodies.
– Intrauterine insemination at the time of ovulation (most acceptable method for cervical factor infertility) or GIFT (Gamete intrafallopian transfer) are very useful techniques in such cases.
• IUI is the best method for treating cervical factor infertility and unexplained infertility. So many clinicians forgo cervical mucus testing and proceed directly to IUI treatment in absence of tubal disease.",D

Any factor which leads to distoion of normal urethro vesical anatomy or decreased urethral pressure leads to GSI like Developmental weakness, child bih trauma, pregnancy (due to increased progesterone which is a relaxant), menopause (it leads to atrophy of suppoing structures), trauma, obesity and following surgeries like Ant. Colporrhaphy, repair of VVF (as they lead to fibrosis of urethra). Management Aim : To restore the function of muscles of Urethro vesical junction. Strengthen the suppo of urethra. Conservative approach : Pelvic floor exercises Drugs Sympathomimetic drugs (a- adrenergic drugs) as they increase tone of urethra and bladder neck.eg. - lmipramine - Ephedrine Paraurethral implants using teflon or periurethral injection of Glutaraldehyde linked collagen. Surgical approach : Principles : * Restoration of normal anatomy. Strengthening the suppo of bladder neck. Increasing the functional length of urethra.

Nuchal translucency at 14 wks is suggestive of :,Down's syndrome,Oesophageal atresia,Trisomy 18,Foregut duplication cyst,"Ans. is a i.e. Down syndrome Friends, before I go into the details of nuchal translucency I want to first explain why I have opted for Down syndrome as the answer and not Turner syndrome, though increased nuchal translucency is seen in both the conditions. My answer is based on the following lines from USG in Obs. & Gynae. by Callen ""Johnson et al showed that simple nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks were associated with a 60% incidence of abnormal karyotypes-mostly trisomy 21. Unlike the second trimester experience, in which large cystic hygromas were most often associated with turner syndrome, the 45X karyotype represented a minority of the karyotypic abnormalities in the group of fetuses with first trimester nuchal translucency thickening."" Nuchal translucency and its Significance * Nuchal translucency is a thickening of the nuchal soft tissues. Embryos with aneuploidy have an increased amount of fluid in the neck region resulting in increased NT measurement. The maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucent area between the skin and soft tissue that overlies the fetus spine in the sagittal plane is measured. A cut off of 3mm is used as threshold for an abnormal nuchal translucency in first trimester and 6mm for second trimester (16 - 20 weeks). Best time to assess nuchal translucency in first trimester 10 - 13 weeks. Best approach - Transvaginal (but trans abdominal is also reasonably good). It is best seen in the mid sagittal plane as a sonolucency at the back of fetal neck. Note: Increased nuchal translucency itself is not a fetal abnormality, but rather a marker or soft sign that confers increased risk of fetal abnormality. Causes of Increased nuchal translucency : - Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) - Trisomy 18 - Trisomy 13 -- Turner syndrome -- Klinefelter syndrome -- Triploidy. Nuchal translucency with large cystic hygroma is seen in Turners syndrome. Nuchal translucency with septations carries bad prognosis. Chromosomally normal fetus with increased nuchal translucency is associated with increased risk of : -- Cardiac abnormalitiesdeg -- Diaphragmatic herniadeg -- Anterior abdominal wall defectdeg -- Fetal akinesia/dyskinesia syndromedeg Therefore, ACOG recommends that when nuchal translucency measurement is 3.5 mm or more with a normal karyotype, then targeted sonographic examination or fetal echocardiography or both should be done. Nuchal translucency of > 3mm in 1st trimester identifies 67% of fetus with trisomy 21. Increased nuchal fold thickness (> 6mm) is the most sensitive and specific single ultrasound marker for the mid trimester detection of down syndrome. Extra Edge : Nuchal translucency is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in the first trimester whereas, Nuchal fold thickness (NFT) is the most impoant sonographic marker of aneuploidy in second trimester. NT is measured from external surface of the skull to the internal surface of the skin. NFT is measured from the external surface of occipital bone to the external surface of skin. NFT is useful for screening between 14-23 weeks. Cut off value for NFT is 5mm (above which it is considered abnormal). Note: In the first trimester 2 most reliable ultrasonographic markers for detecting Down syndrome? Increased muscal translucency Absent nasal bone.",A

Which of the following is the causative organism for formation of Baholin cyst?,Candida,Anaerobes,Neissea,Trichomonas,"Baholin's glands (great vestibular glands) are located at the vaginal orifice at the 4 and 8 o'clock positions. Their ducts are lined with transitional epithelium and their obstruction secondary to inflammation may lead to the development of a Baholin's cyst or abscess. Baholin's cysts range in size from 1 to 3 cm. Infections are often polymicrobial; however, sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are sometimes implicated. Treatment consists of incision and drainage and placement of a Word catheter, a small catheter with a balloon tip, for 2 to 3 weeks to allow for formation and epithelialization of a new duct.

This allows small masses to be easily identified and removed.* Alternatively agents like progestins, combined pills, Danazol and GnRH agonist can be administered prior to anticipated surgery.* Hysteroscope consists of a rigid 4mm diameter telescope so, cervix has to dilated to 4mmQ for insertion of hysteroscope.Distension media:* Because the anterior and posterior uterine walls are in apposition, a distention medium is required to expand the endometrial cavity for viewing.* Distension media includes CO2 and low viscous fluids such as sorbitol, mannitol and glycine solutions.* To expand the cavity, intrauterine pressure of these media must reach 45 to 80mm of Hg. it should not exceed 100mg of Hg because high pressure can result in increased intravasation of medium into the patient's circulation and fluid volume overload.Most common media used for diagnostic purpose - CO2 Most common media used for therapeutic purpose - GlycineContraindications:- Infection (except in case of misplaced IUCD)- Pregnancy- Genital malignancyDiagnostic Indications of hysteroscopy:Let us understand the diagnostic indications of hysteroscopeA hysteroscope can visualize the interior of uterus so, it can diagnose* Any congenital malformation of uterus and can also help in differentiating between a bicornuate uterus from a septate uterus.Q* Any uterine synechiae (as in Asherman syndrome).Q* Misplaced IUCD.Q* Submucous fibroidQA hysteroscope can visualize the cornua so, it can diagnose* Any cornual pathologyHysteroscope can directly visualize the endometrium so, it can diagnose* Endometrial lesions like - endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, endometrial T.B.Q* Pregnancy-related conditions like: Molar tissue or products of conception.QBesides these hysteroscopy is also indicated inQ:* Unexplained abnormal uterine bleedingQ- Pre menopausalQ- Post menopausalQ* Selected infertility cases: In case of- Abnormal HSGQ- Unexplained infertilityQ* Recurrent spontaneous abortion* The therapeutic indications of hysteroscope are (here also don't mug up, just try to understand them).Q* To excise uterine septumQ* To lyse adhesions in Asherman's syndromeQ* To retrieve lost IUCDQ* Hysteroscopic myomectomyQ* PolypectomyQ* Endometrial ablation for menorrhagiaQ* Tubal occlusion for control of fertilityQ* Intratubal ballooning in tubal blockageQAs far as adenomyosis is concerned - it can be suspected on hysteroscopy by appearance of diverticuli but definitive diagnosis requires transvaginal ultrasonography.For management of adenomyosis hysterectomy is the definitive treatment""Endometrial ablution and resection using hysteroscopy has been used to successfully treat dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia caused by adenomyosis.

True regarding rubella infection in pregnancy is: March 2010,Risk of congenital infection is more in last trimester,Vaccination is indicated in pregnancy for protection,IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity,It is caused by DNA virus,"Ans. C: IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity Fetal rubella syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from primary maternal infection with the rubella virus. It is characterized mainly by deafness, mental retardation, congenital cataract, hea defects, and other structural anomalies that may be found with variable severity and frequency. During acute rubella in pregnancy, the rate of congenital infection is over 90% in the 12 first weeks of pregnancy, approximately 60% in weeks 13 to 17, 25% in weeks 18 to 24 and then increases again during the last month of pregnancy. Etiology: It is caused by a RNA togavirus, which is the only member of the genus Rubivirus. The fetus is infected by transplacental transmission. Administration of rubella vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of maternal infection, although reinfection after vaccination is possible. The development of fetal infection reaches 50% among those exposed during the first trimester and 20% during the second trimester. Diagnosis: The most frequent sonographic findings are cardiac malformations (in paicular, septal defects), eye defects (cataracts, microphthalmia, and retinopathy), microcephaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and growth restriction. Deafness and mental retardation are expected after bih. Test for rubella specific antibody (IgM) should be done within 10 days of the exposure to know whether patient is immune or not. Associated anomalies: Occasionally the following anomalies can be associated with the classic findings of fetal rubella syndrome: renal disorders, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, meningocele, glaucoma, patent ductus aeriosus, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Differential diagnosis: All the conditions that can be associated with congenital hepatomegaly and/or cataract should be excluded. It includes congenital infections (TORCHS), fetal anemia, fetal liver tumor, chondrodysplasia punctata, NeuLaxova syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Walker-Warburg syndrome. Prognosis: Intrauterine death may occur. Postnatal impact of the intrauterine infection varies from absence of any defect to all the anomalies mentioned above with variable severity. The agent may remain for years in the tissues, causing chronic infection and its complications (such as diabetes mellitus due to chronic viropathy of the pancreas). Management: Termination of pregnancy should be considered every time fetal infection is detected during the first trimester, due to the severity of the condition in this group. After bility, monthly sonographic monitoring for growth and follow-up of the anomalies is recommended. Prevention: Women found to be susceptible during pregnancy should be offered vaccination postpaum and before discharge from the hospital (vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy). Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to receiving the rubella vaccine.",C

Tripple screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy includes all of the following except:,Maternal serum AFP,Serum beta-HCG,Alkanline Phosphatase,Serum oestriol,"Ans. C: Alkanline Phosphatase The triple test/ triple screen/Kettering test/ Ba's test is an investigation performed during pregnancy in the second trimester to classify a patient as either high-risk or low-risk for chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects). The term ""multiple-marker screening test"" is sometimes used instead. This term can encompass the ""double test"" and ""quadruple test"". A positive test means having a high risk of chromosomal abnormalities (and neural tube defects), and such patients are then referred for more sensitive and specific procedures to receive a definitive diagnosis, mostly invasive procedures like amniocentesis. The Triple test measures serum levels: Alpha-fetoprotein is made in the yolk sac and in the fetal liver, and some amount of AFP gets into the mother's blood. In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amount of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies.",C

Cervix carcinoma arises from :,Squamo-columnar junction,Isthmus,Cervical lip,Internal os,"Ans. is a i.e. Squamo-columnar Junction The cervix is lined by columnar epithelium which lines the endocervix (supravaginal pa of cervix) and squamous epithelium which lines the ectocervix (vaginal pa of cervix). The point at which they meet is called as Squamo-Columnar Junction (SCJ). The SCJ originally lies at the level of External OS. With response to hormonal stimulation the subcolumnar reserve cells present below the squamous epithelium undergoes metaplasia and replace the columnar epithelium. Thus location of SCJ is not fixed but keeps migrating and this called as Translormatior) cone The original SCJ can be recognized by Gland openings and Nabothian cysts. ""Nearly all cervical neoplasia, boh squamous and columnar develop within the transformation zone, usually adjacent to the new SCJ."" This is because theoretically, cervical cells underging metaplasia are more vulnerable to the oncogenic effects of HPV and cocarcinogens. Metaplasia is most active during adolescence and pregnancy that is why early age of sexual activity and first pregnancy are known risk factors for cervical cancer. In women exposed to Diethylstilbesterol (DES) in utero, the original SCJ is located on the vagina rather than on the cervix.",A

Expectant management of placenta previa includes all except,Anti D,Cervical encirclage,Blood transfusion,Steroids,"Macafee and Johnson regime is the name given to the expectant management of placenta previa as it was advocated by McAfee and Johnson
Aim of expectant management in case of placenta previa is to continue pregnancy for fetal maturity without compromising the maternal health.
Prerequisites for expectant management:

Availability of blood for transfusion whenever required
Facilities for caesarean section should be available throughout 24 hours.

Candidates: Suitable for expectant management are:

Mother in god health status- Hemoglobin > 10 gm%
Hematocrit > 30% and she should bev hemodynamically stable.
Duration of pregnancy less than 37 weeks
Active vaginal bleeding is absent
Fetal well being is assured by USG and cardiotocography

The expectant management is carried upto 37 weeks of pregnancy until baby matures.
Expectant management includes (i.e. MacAfee and Johnson regime includes)

Hospitalisation till active bleeding stops and then readmission at 34 weeks
Complete bed rest
Anaemia corrected with blood transfusion (if necessary), but blood should always to be kept ready as placenta previa is a recurrent condition.
Antenatal steroids to promote fetal lung maturity
Anti D if patient is Rh negative
If uterine contractions are present - tocolytics (magnesium sulphate/nifedipine) can be given as it leads to more advanced gestational age at delivery, greater birth weight of fetus, less neonatal complications, and decreased cost of hospitalization. Tocolytics should not be used for more than 48 hours.
Some obstetricians do cervical encirclage in case of placenta previa. The rationale behind the use of cervical cerclage in placenta previa, is that it limits the development of the low uterine segment brought about by advancing gestation and the effect of uterine contraction. But other studies have failed to confirm these findings. Thus, RCOG doesnot recommend the use of cervical cerclage in placenta previa till further data is available",B

Spasmodic pain during dysmenorrhoea is attributed to:,PGE1,PGE2,PGI2,PGF2-a,"Spasmodic pain is attributed to myometrial contractions, due to increased PGF2a, which is secreted under the effect of progesterone.. Note that progesterone is mainly secreted after ovulation, by the corpus leuteum. Therefore, whenever ovulation is absent (Anovulatory cycles), menstruation is not acconpanied by spasmodic pain (i.e., painless bleeding in anovulatory cycles) Congestive dysmenorrhoea is explained by pelvic venous congestion, which can be seen on Doppler ultrasound. Vasopressin and endothelin, by increasing PGF2a secretion also contribute to dysmenorrhoea. Ref: Shaw&;s textbook of Gynaecology 17th edition Pgno: 124",D

The sensitivity of the uterine musculature is :,Enhanced by progesterone,Enhanced by oestrogen,Inhibiled by oestrogen,Enhanced by oestrogsn and inhibited by progesterone,"Ans. is d i.e. Enhanced by oestrogsn and inhibited by progesterone Estrogens : The main and most powerful estrogen produced by the ovary is oestradiola, followed by less active oestrone. Many metabolites of the estrogen are produced by liver, amongst which most impoant is oestriol.o Chief oestrogen in the reproductive year : Oestradiolo Main oestrogen in menopause : oestroneo Main oestrogen in pregnancy : oestriolo Estrogen receptors ER - a ER-ss Predominant sub-type in uterusdeg Predominant subtype in ovary, testis, prostate, brain, blood vessels, bone Main action of estrogen is on Secondary sexual characteristics Genital tract It determines feminine sensitivity and shyness Has main role in breast development Mainly uterus (see below) Progesterone : lt is secreted mainly by the corpus luteumo (i.e. secreted mainly after ovulation). The preovulatory rise in the progesterone is because luteinizing hormone initiates luteinization and progesterone production by the granulosa layer. Main action of progesterone is maintenance of pregnancyo and its action on uterus are inclined in this direction' Effect of estrogen and progesterone on uterus : Effect of estrogen Eflect of progesterone Estrogen causes marked proliferation of the endometrial stroma and greatly increased development of the endometrial glandso that will later be imPlanting ovum. Promote secretory changes in the ulreine endometrium during the later half of the monthly female sexual cycle, thus prepares the uterus for implanatation of the feilized ovum. Estrogen causes hyperophy of the myo metrium.o Progesterone causes marked swelling and secretory development of the endometrium Estrogen stimulates the synthesis of myometrial contractile protein actinomybin through aAMP. lJnder the influence of estrogens the muscles beile more active and excitable and action potentials in the individual fibres become more frequent.o lt aids estrogen in myometrial hyperophy Glands increase in touosity and excess of secretory substance is accumulated in glandular epithelial cells. Lipid and glycogen deposits also increase' The estrogen dominated uterus is also more sensitive to oxytocin. In addition to the secretory effect on endometrium, prrysterone decreases the frequency and intensity of utrine contractions, thereby helping to prevent expulsion of the implanted ovum but increases the amplitude of contraction.",D

Fern test is due to :,Presence of NaCI under progesterone effect,Presence of NaCI under estrogenic effect,LH/FSH,Mucus secretion by Glands,"Ans. is b i.e. Presence of NaCI under estrogenic effect Fern test is for documenting ovulation. Procedure : A specimen of cervical mucus is obtained and is spread on a clean Glass slide and allowed to dry. It is then viewed under the low power microscope. Result and interpretation : Under the influence of estrogen on Day12-Day 14 cervical mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation. The ferning is due to the presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogen effect. After ovulation on Day 21-23, ferning disappears because protein content increases and Sodium chloride decreases under the effect of progesterone. Disappearance of ferning after ovulation and if previously present its disappearance is presumptive evidence of corpus luteum activity. Also know : * Cervical mucus will show palm leaf pattern due to Estrogen. Spin barkeit of cervical mucus in a woman is maximum at ovulatory phase. Spin barkeit is demonstrated in Proliferative phase.",B

Whiff test is positive in,Bacterial Vaginosis,Trichomonas Vaginitis,Vulvovaginal Candidiasis,Inflammatory Vaginitis,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an alteration of normal vaginal bacterial flora that results in the loss of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli and an overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria. Diagnosis A fishy vaginal odor, which is paicularly noticeable following coitus, and vaginal discharge are present.Vaginal secretions are gray and thinly coat the vaginal walls. The pH of these secretions is higher than 4.5 (usually 4.7 to 5.7). Microscopy of the vaginal secretions reveals an increased number of clue cells, and leukocytes are conspicuously absent. In advanced cases of BV, more than 20% of the epithelial cells are clue cells.The addition of KOH to the vaginal secretions (the ""whiff"" test) releases a fishy, amine-like odor. Treatment Metronidazole, an antibiotic with excellent activity against anaerobes but poor activity against lactobacilli, is the drug of choice for the treatment of BV.

"Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by all of the following mechanisms, except:",Delaying/inhibiting ovulation,Inhibiting fertilization,Preventing implantation of the fertilized egg,Interrupting an early pregnancy,"Emergency Contraceptives are also called as INTERCEPTIVES.
It refers to a type of contraception that is used as an emergency to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse.
Mechanism of action
The mechanism of action is not known with certainty, but it is believed with justification that this treatment combines delay of ovulation (Option ‘a’) with a local effect on endometrium (Option “c”) and prevention of fertilization (Option “b”).
As far as option ‘d’ is concerned,
“How much a post fertilization effect (option d) contributes to efficacy is not known, but it is not believed to be the primary mechanism”.

Estrogen administration in a menopausal woman increases the,Gonadotrophin secretion,LDL -- cholesterol,Bone mass,Muscle mass,"Ans. is c i.e Bone mass Before seeing any Reference for the Question let's rule out some options. Estrogen administration will exe a negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion and decreases Gonadotropin secretion rather than increasing it (Option 'a' ruled out). As I have already discussed in previous Question -Estrogen decreases LDL and not increases it (ruling out Option `b). Now we are left with 2 options, Option 'c' i.e. Bone mass and Option 'rile. Muscle mass. Estrogen given as hormone replacement therapy is most beneficial in preventing osteoporosis i.e it must be increasing bone mass. So, Option 'c'seems to be correct. Now have a look what texts have to say : Estrogen helps to maintain bone mass and skeletal integrity thereby protecting against osteoporosis. Effect of estrogen on bones : Estrogen causes increased osteoblastic activity in the bones. It is impoant in maintaining bone mass primarily by retarding bone resorption. The major action of estrogen is directed at reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts, by modifying regulatory cytokine signals from osteoblasts. The action of estrogen and progesterone result in increased expression of bone matrix proteins such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen and alkaline phosphatase.

Aspiration of sperms from testes is done in :,TESA,MESA,ZIFT,GIFT,"Ans. is a i.e. TESA Friends, we have studied in detail IVF and IUI but either of them cannot be performed if appropriate methods for sperm recovery are not available in cases of male infeility. Sperm retrieval or Recovery can be done by : Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm aspiraton : MESAdeg Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm aspiration : PESAdeg Testicular sperm extraction : TESEdeg Percutaneous Testicular sperm fine needle aspiration : TESAdeg (also called as Fine Needle Aspiration FNA). The choice of the method depends on : the underlying diagnosis, whether goal of the procedure is diagnostic or therapeutic whether, isolated sperm will be used immediately or cryopreserved. TESA Is a percutaneous method which requires No/Local anesthesia and retrieves sperms from the testis when spermatogenesis is normal as in cases of post-testicular azoospermia (i.e. either there is congenital absence or obstruction of ',as deferens/ejaculatory ducts or Retrograde ejaculation). MESA Also indicated in cases of post testicular azoospermia. It is done when one need's to know the nature of obstruction or if surgical correction of the obstruction is to be performed at the same time of sperm recovery. (Done under GA/Regional anesthesia). Another advantage of MESA is that a very large number of sperms are usually retrieved so that cryopreservation and avoidance of repeat surgery may be possible PESA Percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration can also be used in cases of Post testicular azoosperma but it is a blind procedure. Bleeding . epididymal injury and postsurgical fibrosis can occur. TESE Indicated in men with testicular azoospermia or Gonadal failure. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection : i.e. ICSI Here a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of the oocyte which is then incubated over night. The procedure involves stripping of the aspirated cumulus complex of all surrounding Granulosa cells, so that micromanipulation can be performed on the egg itself. A holding pipette is used to stabilize the egg while an injection pipette is used to inse a ble sperm into the cytoplasm of the egg. Advantage : This procedure bypasses events like capacitation and acrosome reaction by the sperms. Indication : It is indicated in male factor infeiliy : When sperm is count is less than 5 million / ml (severe oligospermia). Absolute indications : asthenospermia i.e. < 5% progressive motility. Teratospermia i.e. < 4% normal sperms. No.of motile sperms is < 0.5X106/m1 (as in these conditions IUI cannot be done). If sperms lack acrosome. Abnormal sperm morphology.

True hermaphroditism karyotype:,45X0,45X0/46,47 XY/47 XX,46XX/46XY,"Ans. d. 46XX/46XYRef: Williams Obstetrics 24th Ed; Page No-148-49GENITAL AMBIGUITY OF THE NEWBORNAmbiguity of the neonatal genitalia results from excessive androgen action in a fetus that was destined to be female or from inadequate androgen representation for one destined to be male.Rarely, genital ambiguity indicates true hermaphroditism.Several transcription factors--SOX9, SF1, and WT1, and disruptions of signaling molecules--hedgehog, WNT, cyclin dependent kinase, and Ras/MAP kinase--cause disorders of sexual development.Examples are congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen insensitivity syndrome.Abnormalities of gender differentiation causing genital ambiguity can be assigned to one of four clinically defined categories:Female pseudohermaphroditismMale pseudohermaphroditismDysgenetic gonads, including true hermaphroditism; and rarelyTrue hermaphroditism.FEMALE PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISMIn this condition, mullerian-inhibiting substance is not produced.For a fetus genetically predestined to be a female, androgen exposure should be excessive and variable.The karyotype is 46XX with presence of ovary.Therefore, by genetic and gonadal gender, all are supposed to be female, and the basic abnormality is androgen excess. Because mullerian- inhibiting substance is not produced, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina develop.MALE PSEUDOHERMAPHRODITISMIt is characterized by incomplete and variable androgenic exposure of a fetus supposed to be male.The karyotype is 46, XY and characterized by either presence of testes or no gonads.In some cases, incomplete masculinization follows inadequate production of testosterone by the fetal testis.It also may result from decreased responsiveness of the genital anlage to normal quantities of androgen--including failure of the in situ formation of 5a-DHT in androgen-responsive tissue.Because testes were present for at some point of embryonic life, mullerian inhibiting substance is produced. Thus, the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper vagina do not develop.DYSGENETIC GONADSIn affected individuals, karyotype differs and is mostly abnormal. As the name describes, most have abnormally developed gonads, and streak gonads are typically present.As a result, mullerian-inhibiting substance is not produced and fetal androgen exposure is variable, which results in presence of uterus, fallopian tubes and upper vagina.Most common form of gonadal dysgenesis is Turner syndrome (46, X).The phenotype is female, but secondary sexual characters don't develop at the time of expected puberty, and genital infantilism persists.TRUE HERMAPHRODITISMIn most of the cases, category 3 guidelines are met.External genitalia are seen in such type a case.The karyotype of True hermaphroditism of an infant with 46, XX/46, XY.True hermaphrodites have both ovarian and testicular tissues with germ cells for both ovum and sperm in the abnormal gonads.AMBIGUOUS GENITALIATypeKaryotype and featuresFigureFemalepseudohermaphroditism*.

Most vaginal bleeding in antepaum hemorrhage are due to abruption and Placenta pre. Placental abruption (32 percent), pre (21 percent), and cervical bleeding (6.6 percent) were the most frequent causes However, when these are not confirmed , then to suspect fetal bleeding due to Vasa Pre, an APT test is done. Here, the vaginal blood is mixed with NaOH, and if the hemoglobin gets denatured ( Colorless) then its maternal blood. A positive APT test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin.

HCG is secreted by:,Cytotrophoblasts,Syncytiotrophoblasts,Both,Habfaur cells,"Ans. b (Syncytiotrophoblasts). (Ref. Ganong Physiology 21st ed. -453)HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN (hCG)# It is a glycoprotein (molecular wt 36,000 to 40,000 d) with highest carbohydrate (30%) content of any human hormone. It is structurally related to three other glycoprotein hormones--LH, FSH, and TSH.# The 36-hour plasma half-life of intact hCG is much longer than the 2 hours for LH.# Biosynthesis:- Source: Syncytiotrophoblasts of placenta- A single gene located on chromosome 6 encodes the -subunit of all four glycoprotein hormones--hCG, LH, FSH, and TSH.- The secretion of b-hCG roughly corresponds to placental mass, whereas the rate of secretion of the complete hCG molecule is maximal at 8 to 10 weeks' gestation. Plasma cone of beta-hCG, although a minor portion of intact hCG at 10 weeks, can represent 30 to 50 percent during the last trimester.# Concentrations of hCG in Serum and Urine:- The intact hCG molecule is detectable in plasma of pregnant women about 7 to 9 days after the midcycle surge of LH that precedes ovulation. Thus, it is likely that hCG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Blood levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at about 8 to 10 weeks' gestation.- Because hCG circulates as multiple highly related isoforms with variable cross-reactivity between commercial assays, there is considerable variation in calculated serum hCG levels among the more than 100 assays. Peak levels reach about 100,000 mlU/mL between the 60th and 80th days after the last menses. Beginning at about 10 to 12 weeks' gestation, maternal plasma levels of hCG begin to decline, and a nadir is reached by about 20 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the remainder of pregnancy.- The pattern of appearance of hCG in fetal blood is similar to that in the mother, however, fetal plasma levels are only about 3 percent of those in maternal plasma.# Elevated or Depressed hCG Levels in Maternal Plasma or Urine:- Significantly higher plasma levels of hCG are sometimes found in:- Women pregnant with multiple fetuses or with a single erythroblastotic fetus resulting from maternal D-antigen isoimmunization.- Hydatidiform mole or choriocarcinoma.- Women carrying a fetus with Down's syndrome, and this finding can be used in biochemical screening tests# Relatively lower levels of hCG in plasma are found with:- Ectopic pregnancies and impending spontaneous abortion.# Biological Functions of hCG- The best-known biological function of hCG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum--that is, continued progesterone production.- Used to detect pregnancy because it appears in the urine 8 days after successful fertilization (blood and urine tests available).- Elevated hCG in women with hydatidiform moles or choriocarcinoma.- It stimulates fetal testicular testosterone secretion that is maximum at approximately the same time that maximal levels of hCG are attained. hCG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast, acts as an LH surrogate, and stimulates replication of testicular Leydig cells and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation.- There is hCG stimulation of the maternal thyroid gland.- Other functions include:* Promotion of relaxin secretion by the corpus luteum.* LH-hCG receptors are found in myometrium and in uterine vascular tissue, and it has been hypothesized that hCG may act to promote uterine vascular vasodilatation and myometrial smooth muscle relaxation.Note: Peak levels reached on 72nd day or 12th week of pregnancy.",B

Dutta 6th/pg. 142)Accidental administration of ergometrine or methergin during delivery of first baby in undiagnosed twins produce grave danger to the unborn 2nd baby caused by asphyxia due to tetanic uterine contractions.MANAGEMENT OF THE THIRD STAGE OF LABORThe third stage of labor begins following the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta.Signs of spontaneous placental separation include an apparent lengthening of the umbilical cord, a gush of vaginal bleeding, and a change in shape of the uterus from discoid to globular along with a rise in fundal height.Active management of the third stage of labor, which involves prompt umbilical cord clamping and cutting, administration of an oxytocic agent, and gentle umbilical cord traction, reduces maternal blood loss and the frequency of postpartum hemorrhage, and lessens the risk that the third stage will be prolonged.# Cord clamping is part of management of 2nd stage of labour.# Cord traction should be used only against fundally applied counter-traction to lessen the potential for uterine inversion and catastrophic hemorrhage. If at any time heavy bleeding occurs during the third stage of labor or if the placenta is not delivered within 30 minutes of the birth, the placenta should be manually removed.# General anesthesia may be required for women who have no regional anesthesia, and curettage may be necessary if the placenta does not readily separate from the uterine wall.# Manual removal is accomplished by developing a cleavage plane with the intrauterine hand between the maternal surface of the placenta and the uterine wall, while simultaneously fixing the uterus with the abdominal hand, and progressively peeling the placenta free.# If any portion of the placenta or the membranes is missing, the uterine cavity should be manually explored. Some advocate routine exploration of the uterine cavity to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding from retained placental fragments. In most women, especially those without regional anesthesia, the benefit of manual exploration is outweighed by the discomfort it causes, as well as the increased risk for uterine infection.# The uterus should be frequently palpated following delivery of the placenta to ensure that it remains well contracted. Oxytocin, 10 to 20 U administered intramuscularly or as a dilute intravenous solution, has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. The birth canal, including the cervix,vagina, and perineum should be inspected for lacerations requiring repair.",D

Prostaglandin (PGE2) gel is placed into the vagina, and electronic fetal hea rate monitoring is continueD. In approximately 60 minutes, the fetal hea rate falls to the 90s, as the tocodynamometer shows the uterus to be contracting every 1 minute with essentially no rest in between contractions. Which of the following was most likely the cause of the uterine hyper stimulation?",Infection,IV fluids,Postdates pregnancy,Prostaglandin (PGE2) gel,"Prostaglandin (PGE2) gel is widely used for labor induction. In simple terms, it is used ""to soften"" an unorable cervix, to make the cervix more orable for induction. It has been shown to lead to an improvement in the Bishop's score, a shoer duration of labor, and deliveries. PGE2 gel can also cause uterine contractions. One of the major side effects with PGE2 gel is uterine hyper stimulation. This occurs when uterine contractions come one right after the other, or when there is a tetanic contraction. In this setting, the fetus can become hypoxic with a resultant bradycardia. This patient had the gel placed and 60 minutes later had uterine hyperstimulation. Infection has not been shown to cause uterine hyperstimulation. This patient's group B Streptococcus colonization is likely noncontributory. IV fluids do not cause uterine hyperstimulation. Postdates pregnancy is the reason for this patient's induction and not likely the direct cause of her uterine hyperstimulation. Vaginal examination with a cervical examination can be used for fetal scalp stimulation-rubbing the baby's head to provoke an acceleration of the fetal hea rate.

Most common time of Mother To Child transmission is–at the time of delivery
About 50% women with HSV is first trimister abort while infection in second half can lead to IUGR, preterm labor.
ACOG does not recommend a routine screening for HSV
Viral isolation is the defective means of diagnosis for HSV infection
Specimens are obtained from any active lesions as well as from cervix and vagina
PCR can also be done
DOC during pregnancy-Acyclovir (safe in lactation also) × 7–10 days
ACOG recommends daily viral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks for women who have recurrences during pregnancy as it decreases the outbreaks at term and so decreased need for cesarean Cesarean section is indicated for women with active genital lesions or in patients having prodromal symptoms of herpes viz genital pain and tingling (ans 22). Cesarean is not indicated in women with a h/o HSV infection but no active genital tract lesion/prodromal symptoms at the time of delivery.

Best indicator of Ovarian reserve :,AMH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH Ratio,"None of the ovarian reserve tests currently in use are accurate predictors for pregnancy With current methods, basal FSH concentration is simplest and most widely used to test ovarian reserve. Levels greater than 10 IU/L (10-20 IU/L) have high specificity (80-100%) for predicting poor ovarian response to ovulation. Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4). Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test. AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0.2-0.7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).

Granulosa cell tumour and theca cell tumour are feminizing tumours that originate from sex cord stroma. Remember Both these tumors cause endometrial hyperplasia and so, risk of carcinoma endometrium is increased.deg Both these tumors can become luteinized to form a luteoma, they may then produce progesterone as well as oestrogen and conve the endometrium to a secretory one.

The vulval carcinoma will metastasize commonly into :,Para-aoic group of lymph nodes,Internal iliac group of lymph nodes,External iliac group of lymph nodes,Superficial inguinal group of lymph nodes,"Spread of the vulval Tumour : The tumour proliferates mainly by direct spread to the adjacent organs and by the lymphatics; blood-borne metastases are rare. Parry Jones was the first to describe the lymphatic spread that occurs in a systematic manner. At first, the superficial inguinal nodes are involved through lymphatic emboli, but later lymphatic channel permeation occurs causing lymphatic blockage and leg oedema. The malignancy spreads to deep nodes and the gland of Cloquet (uppermost of the femoral or the lowermost of the external iliac gland) to the external iliac glands, obturator and common iliac nodes in the advanced stages. Laterally placed tumours rarely spread to the contralateral inguinal glands, but centrally located lesion involves the lymph nodes of the opposite side in 25% cases and this is because of crossing of lymphatics in the midline. Lymph nodes not clinically suspicious may show metastasis in about 25% cases. Inguinal lymph nodes are involved in 10% in Stage I, 30% in Stage II, 70% in Stage III and 100% cases in Stage IV. Lymphatics of the clitoris drain directly into the pelvic lymph nodes. The regional lymph nodes are assessed by MRI and PET. The involvement of the lymph nodes depends upon the site of the lesion, its size and depth of invasion. Reference : Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition page no 479",D

Recurrence of gestational trophoblastic tumor can be associated with all except,Enlarged uterus,Persistent lutein cysts in ovaries,Plateau of hCG,Sub urethral nodule,"Ans. is c i.e. Plateau of hCG (most probably) The examiner here is asking about recurrence of gestational trophoblastic tumor & not about occurrence of gestational trophoblastic tumor post evacuation of H. mole. In most of the books the criteria for diagosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic tumor is given - Criteria for diagnosis of post molar gestational trophoblastic tumor as prescribed by FIGO oncology committee in 2002 Relapsed (Recurrent), high risk disease is defined by rising hCG after complete serological response to EMA/CO chemotherapy i.e. having atleast 6 weeks of normal hCG values post chemotherapy. Resistant, or refractory, cases are those that have a rising or plateaued hCG while on EMA/CO So by definition Plateau of hCG is seen in resistent and not relapsed cases hence I am chosing it as the option of choice Also know: Management of Recurrent Gestational Trohoblastic neoplasia Diagnosis Careful radiological assessment should be done in such patients to identify the sites of potentially resectable disease FDG -- PET may be used to locate sites of disease in cases showing serological relapse without visible abnormality on conventional imaging. Treatment Treatment is usually surgical resection followed by postoperative chemotherapy. If no site of relapse is identified. hysterectomy should be done as the most likely site of relapse is uterus . The most effective second line chemotherapy is EMA/EP i.e. Etoposide, actinomycins & methotrexate alternating weekly with etoposide and cisplatin This regimen is toxic but has a repoed remission rate of >80% An emerging less toxic alternative is fonightly regimen of paclitaxel + cisplatin alternating with paclitaxel + Etoposide.",C

Which is most significant finding in cardiotoco-graphy for detection of fetal hypoxia:,Late deceleration,Variable deceleration,Sinusoidal deceleration,Early deceleration,"It is one of those questions where if we keep searching for reference, we get more and more confused whereas the answer lies is front of our eyes and we all know it.
All of you know — contraction stress test
“The contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions, with the premise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened. This results in late decelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10 minutes, a positive or abnormal test is when late decelerations occur with more than half of the contractions, suspicious with any late decelerations, and negative with no late decelerations.”
COGDT 10/e, p 255
So here is our answer, the most significant finding for hypoxia is late deceleration.
Our answer is further supported by COGDT 10/e, p 257.
“Late decelerations are smooth falls in the FHR begining after the contractions has started and ending after the contractions has ended. They are associated with fetal hypoxemia and potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, vary in timing with the contractions, and usually represents cord compression.”
As far as sinusoidal pattern is concerned - Williams Obs. 23/e, p 420 says “Intrapartum sinusoidal fetal heart patterns were not generally associated with fetal compromise”.",A

Following change occurs in pregnancy :,Plasmin level decreases,Fibrinolytic activity decreases,Hemodilution does not occur,Fibrinogen level increases,"Ans. is d i.e. Fibrinogen level increases Lets see each option separately : Option -a"" Plasmin activity decreases : it is incorrect as COGDT clearly says : ""Plasminogen levels increase Concomitantly with fibrinogen levels, causing an equilibration of clotting and lytic activity."" Option ""b"" Fibrinolytic activity decreases : This is still a debatable issue studies are going on, Williams says? ""Studies of the fibrinolytic system in pregnancy have produced conflicting results, although the majority of evidence suggests that fibrinolytic activityis actually reduced in normal preg? nancy."" So option 'b' can be kept in +/- status, if we don't have a better option, it can be our answer of choice. Option ""c"" Hemodilution does not occur : ""The dispropotionate increases in plasma and RBC volume produces a state of hemodilution during pregnancV"" So, option ""c is incorrect. As far as option `d' is concerned : We have studied time and again that fibrinogen level is raised by 50% in pregnancy. Therefore, option Tr is absolutely correct and is our answer of choice.",D

"A 40 year old primiparous woman suspected to be suffering from endometriosis is subjected to diagnostic laparoscopy. Findings indicate uterus normal, both the ovaries show presence of chocolate cysts; endometriotic deposits are seen on the round ligament right side, both the fallopian tubes and the pouch of Douglas; moderately dense adhesions are present between the fallopian tubes and the pouch of Douglas. The treatment of choice in this case is:",Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,Danazol therapy,Progesterone therapy,Fulguration of endometriotic deposits,"In the question it is given, dense adhesions and chocolate cyst are present which cannot be fully treated by medical therapy and so, some form of surgery is required.
Main question is whether we would like to go for conservative surgery or radical surgery (i.e. TAH with BSO)
Remember: mostly in endometriosis conservative surgery is done.
Conservative surgery: The clinical situations involving conservative surgery include ovarian endometrioma, pelvic adhesions, peritoneal implants and deep infiltrative rectovaginal septum disease. In addition, laser laparoscopy can be used in order to perform uterine nerve ablation.
“Hysterectomy with bilateral oopherectomy should be reserved for women who have completed childbearing and recognise the risk of premature hypoestrogenism including possible osteoporosis and decrease libido.”

"A 16 years old female with normal pubic hairs and breast presented with primary amenorrhea. On examination, there was blind vagina and absent uterus. Diagnosis is:","47, XYY",Gonadal dysgenesis,Mullerian agenesis,"45, XO","Ans. c. Mullerian agenesis (Ref: Shows 14/e p81-83)A 16 years old female with normal pubic hairs and breast presented with primary amenorrhea, with blind vagina and absent uterus. Diagnosis in this case is Mullerian agenesis.Evaluation of Primary Amenorrhea:Primary amenorrhea is evaluated most efficiently by focusing on the presence or absence of:1. Breast Development: It is a marker of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovary2. Presence or absence of uterus: As determined by ultrasound or in more complex cases by MRIEvaluation of Primary AmenorrheaBreast Development:Breast development and other secondary sexual characters are markers of estrogen action and therefore function of the ovaryPresence of breast and other secondary sexual features indicate normal estrogen level and normally functioning ovaryAbsence of Breast:Absence of breast indicates reduced estrogen levelThe cause of reduced estrogen level is then determined by measuring FSHIncreased serum FSH and absent breast indicates primary ovarian failure. This is mostly caused by 'Gondal Dysgenesis' (Turner's syndrome). Elevated FSH is due to absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles leading to reduction in negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibins A and B.Absent breast with decreased serum FSH indicates primary amenorrhea due to hypothalamic or pituitary causes.Presence or absence of uterusFurther testing for a women with primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination in particular whether mullerian structures are present or absent (Mullerian structures: Cervix, uterus, vagina, ovarian tube)The single most important step in the evaluation of primary amenorrhea depends upon the findings on physical examination or ultrasonography, whether there are any anatomic abnormalities of the vagina, cervix or uterus.Absence of Uterus:Absence of uterus usually means that Mullerian inhibitory substance was secreted at the time of Wolffian duct development.Mullerian inhibiting substance is usually secreted from the sertoli cells of the testis and it inhibits the development. Wolffian duct or Mullerian duct structures.Absence of uterus suggests presence of MIS and is likely evidence of the presence of testis.For those with absence of the uterus, further evaluation should include a karyotype measurement and measurement of serum testosterone.These tests allow the clinician to distinguish between abnormal Mullerian development and androgen insensitivity syndrome.Absence of Uterus:For patients with normal Mullerian structures and no evidence of an imperforate hymen, vaginal septum, or congenital absence of vagina, an endocrine evaluation should be performed.This includes measurement of serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin to exclude pregnancy and of serum FSH and other hormones.A high serum FSH concentration is indicative of primary ovarian failure.A karyotype is then required to detect the presence of Turner's syndromeTurner's syndrome is characterized by the complete or partial deletion of X chromosome.In addition, evaluation for other diseases associated with specific type of ovarian failure should be performed.Low or normal FSH suggests functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, congenital GnPH deficiency or other disorders of hypothalamic pituitary axis.Serum prolactin is measured if galactorrhoea is present.If there are signs of hyperandrogenism, serum ketosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) should be measured.",C

Fetal hemopoiesis first occurs in :,Yolk sac,Liver,Spleen,Bone marrow,"Ans. is a i.e. Yolk sac In the very early embryo, hemopoiesis is first demonstrable in the yolk sac. (It begins between the 10th"" to 14th day of gestation, k/a mesoblastic period). The next major site is the dvei (Begins by 6-8 weeks of gestation and completely replaces yolk sac by 10-12 weeks and remain predominant till 20-24 weeks called as hepatic punuu of heinopoeiss) followed by the bone marrow (It stas taking over the liver by the second trimester called as myeloid period Erythropoiesis is regulated primarily by erythropoietin which increases along with gestational age. Extra Edge When hemopoiesis occurs in yolk sac - Hemoglobins Gower I, Gower 2 and Poland are made. Erythropoiesis in the liver, produces hemoglobin F Finally when hemopoiesis moves to bone marrow, normal hemoglobin A appears in fetal red cells and is present in progressively greater amounts as the fetus matures After 8th gestational week HbF is the predominant Hb. At 24 weeks of gestation it constitutes 90% of the fetal hemoglobin. At bih HbF is 70% of total hemoglobin and HbA is 30%. At bih HbA2 is less than 1% is seen but by 12 month of age the normal level of 2.0-3-4% is attained. Throughout life, the normal ratio of HbA to A. is about 30 : 1. Clotting factors in fetus : Fetal fibrinogen appears as early as 5 weeks of gestation. All the rest clotting factors are produced by 12 weeks of gestation. Factors low in cord blood are : Factor II, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and fibrinogens.

Indications being the same as for surgery.deg Some specific indications for Hysterectomy : In patients > 40 years of age.deg Multiparous women.deg If fibroid is associated with malignancy.deg During myomectomy if their is uncontrolled hemorrhage or other surgical difficulty.deg If the size of uterus is < 12 weeks vaginal hysterectomy can be done.deg Myomectomy is the enucleation of myomata from the uterus leaving behind a potentially functioning organ capable of future reproduction.deg Prerequisites : Anemia should be corrected.deg - All other causes of infeility should be excluded.deg - Male factor infeility should be ruled out.deg - Diagnostic D and C should be performed in case of irregular cycles, to detect any polyp and to rule out endometrial cancer.deg - Hysteroscopy or HSG : To detect a fibroid encroaching the uterine cavity or a polyp or tubal block.deg Myomectomy is specifically indicated in an infeile woman or woman desirous of bearing child and wishing to retain the uterus.deg Time of myomectomy : It should be performed in preovulatory menstrual phase to reduce blood loss during surgery.deg It should not be performed during pregnancy and at the time of cesarean section.deg Contraindications : Big broad ligament fibroid : (as many large vessels are present which can cause uncontrollable bleeding and thus the need to abandon myomectomy and do hysterectomy.deg Multiple tiny fibroids scattered through the uterine wall.deg Instrument used to decrease blood loss during myomectomy : bonney's myomectomy clamp.deg Myomectomy operation should always be followed by shoening of round ligament to prevent retroversion.deg Bonney's hood technique : is done in interstitial fibroid on the fundal posterior wall.deg Results (Impoant) : Pregnancy rate following myomectomy : 40%deg Aboion rates if woman conceive : 25%deg Myomectomy : Low grade postoperative pyrexia is a rule and should not be treated by antibiotics (pyrexia is d/t slight extravasation of blood in uterine wall or peritoneal cavity and settles spontaneously in 7-14 days). Recurrence rate : 5-10%deg Persisting menorrhagia 1-5%deg Reason for persisting menorrhagia is either myoma was not responsible for the complain or an intrauterine polyp or fibroid was overlooked during surgery. 20 - 25% women subjected to myomectomy : ultimately come for hysterectomy. Routes of myomectomy Abdominal Vaginal myomectomy Myomectomy Done in case of submucosal pedunculated fibroid Hysteroscopic myomectomy Submucosal fibroiddeg which cannot be removed by simple vaginal route can be removed with the help of hysteroscope Laparoscopic Myomectomy Indicated for pedunculated Subserosal fibroids (<10cms in size) Intramural fibroids can also be removed by laparoscope but it is very time consuming Myolysis or myoma coagulation using laser In this procedure lasers are used to drill holes into the substance of intramural myoma",D

Which of the following does not conduct spermatozoa?,Ampulla of the ductus deferens,Duct of the seminal vesicle,Epididymis,Prostatic Urethra,"The duct of the seminal vesicle carries seminal fluid, a basic fluid containing fructose. The contents of the seminal fluid buffers the acid in the vagina and provides nutrients for sperm. The duct of the seminal vesicle joins with the ampulla of the ductus deferens (which is carrying sperm) to form the ejaculatory duct. This is the first place where seminal fluid mixes with sperm. Sperms are first formed in the seminiferous tubules. They then travel from the head to the tail of the epididymis, through the ductus deferens, into the ejaculatory duct where they mix with seminal fluid, into the prostatic urethra, through the rest of the urethra, and then out the penis.

Metropathica hemorrhagica is best treated by :,Curettage of uterus,Progestogen,Estrogen,Clomiphene,"Metropathia hemorrhagica is a type of DUB, Anovulatory bleeding seen in premenopausal women. The basic fault may lie in the ovaries or may be due to disturbance of the rhythmic secretion of the gonadotropin. There is slow rise in secretion of estrogen but no negative feedback inhibition of FSH. The net effect is gradual rise in the level of estrogen with concomitant phase of amenorrhea for about 6-8wks. As there is no ovulation, endometrium is under the influence of estrogen without being opposed by growth limiting progesterone for prolonged period. After the variable period, estrogen level falls resulting in endometrail shedding with heavy bleeding. First line of treatment is medical therapy.progesterone are the main hormones used in DUB in all age groups. Common preparations used are Norethisterone and medoxyprogesterone acetate.

"After first meiotic division, the primary oocyte remains arrested in ?",Diplotene stage,Pachytene stage,Metaphase,Telophase,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Diplotene stage Oogenesis refers to the process of formation of ova from the primitive germ cells. Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at pubey), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation. The sequence of events in oogenesis are : The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid cells). Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both X' chromosomes are active. The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",A

A 22-year-old woman with Turner syndrome has a 2.5-centimeter mass in the right adnexa. An abdominal radiograph reveals focal areas of calcification in the mass. The patient has a,Cystic teratoma,Dysgerminoma,Fibroma,Gonadoblastoma,"The patient most likely has a gonadoblastoma, which is sometimes associated with ceain types of Turner syndrome.Turner syndrome is characterized by an XO genotype (~ 60%) without any Barr body. Approximately, 40% of patients are mosaics with an XX/XO, a 45 XO/46 XX, or an XO/46 XY karyotype. The presence of a Y chromosome poses an increased risk for germ cell tumors of the streak gonads (ovary without eggs). Dysgerminomas and gonadoblastomas (germ cell plus sex cord stromal tumor) are the two most common tumors associated with this abnormality. Both of these tumors are also seen in ceain types of gonadal dysgenesis where there is female pseudohermaphroditism, that is, genotypic females with male appearing external genitalia. Gonadoblastomas, unlike dysgerminomas, frequently contain foci of calcification that are visible on abdominal films, as in this patient. Other primary ovarian tumors that frequently produce visible calcifications on abdominal films are cystic teratomas (bone and teeth) and fibromas.Dysgerminomas of the ovary are the female counterpa of seminomas of the testicle and pinealomas in the central nervous system. They are the most common malignant germ cell tumor of the ovary, whereas cystic teratomas are the most common benign germ cell tumor. Dysgerminomas are bilateral in 10% of cases. They are solid tumors that contain large, anaplastic cells with prominent nucleoli intermixed with a benign lymphoid infiltrate. Dysgerminomas, like seminomas, are extremely radiosensitive tumors and have an excellent 5 year survival rate.Cystic teratomas, fibromas, and Brenner tumors of the ovary are not associated with Turner syndrome.",D

Which of the following parameters are not increased during pregnancy :,Vital capacity,Blood volume,Extracellular fluid,Weight,"RESPIRATORY SYSTEM: With the enlargement of the uterus, specially in the later months, there is elevation of the diaphragm by 4 cm. Total lung capacity is reduced by 5% due to this elevation. Diaphragmatic excursion is increased by 1-2 cm and breathing becomes diaphragmatic. Total pulmonary resistance is reduced due to progesterone effect. The subcostal angle increases from 68deg to 103deg, the transverse diameter of the chest expands by 2 cm and the chest circumference increases by 5-7 cm. The mucosa of the nasopharynx becomes hyperemic and edematous. This may cause nasal stuffiness and rarely epistaxis. Hyperventilation occurs during pregnancy leading to increase in tidal volume and therefore respiratory minute volume by 40%. It is probably due to progesterone acting on the respiratory center and also to increase in sensitivity of the center to carbon dioxide. The woman feels shoness of breath.

She thinks that she may be pregnant because she has not gotten her period yet and is very anxious to find out because she has a history of a previous ectopic pregnancy and wants to be sure to get early prenatal care. Which of the following evaluation methods is most sensitive in diagnosing pregnancy?",No evaluation to determine pregnancy is needed because the patient is asymptomatic and therefore cannot be pregnant,Serum pregnancy test,Detection of fetal heart tones by Doppler equipment,Abdominal ultrasound,"Nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, and urinary frequency are all common symptoms of pregnancy, but their presence cannot definitively make the diagnosis of pregnancy because they are nonspecific symptoms that are not consistently found in early pregnancy. On physical exam, the pregnant uterus enlarges and becomes boggier and softer, but these changes are not usually apparent until after 6 weeks gestational age. In addition, other conditions such as adenomyosis, fibroids, or previous pregnancies can result in an enlarged uterus being palpated on physical exam. Abdominal ultrasound will not demonstrate a gestational sac until a gestational age of 5 to 6 weeks is reached. A Doppler instrument will detect fetal cardiac action usually no sooner than 10 weeks. A sensitive serum pregnancy test can detect placental HCG levels by 8 to 9 days post-ovulation, and it is therefore the most sensitive modality for detecting and diagnosing pregnancy.",B

Drug contraindicated in patient with rheumatic heart disease in PPH is,Oxytocin infusion,Methyl ergometrine,Misoprostol,Carboprost,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Methyl ergometrine Cardiac patients should not receive ergotamine because these agents cause significant vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure which can be deleterious to the patientAlso know,In healthy women, an intravenous bolus of 10 units of oxytocin caused a transient but marked fall in arterial blood pressure that was followed by an abrupt increase in cardiac output.These hemodynamic changes could be dangerous to women already hypovolemic from hemorrhage or who had cardiac disease that limited cardiac output.The same danger is present for women with right to left cardiac shunts because the decrease in systemic resistance would further increase the shunt.So, - Oxytocin should not be given intravenously as a large bolus, but rather as a much more dilute solution by continuous intravenous infusion or as an intramuscular infection.Management of cardiac patient during pregnancy Antepartum Bed restThe most important measure for attenuating the impact of pregnancy on diseased heart is bed rest.Bed rest increases the venous return to the heart, improves renal perfusion, induces diuresis and promotes elimination of water.Dietary salt restrictionIt helps to prevent excess retention of sodium and water.DiureticsIt should be given to cardiac pregnant patient if moderate restriction in sodium intake is insufficient to limit the normal intravascular volume expansion that occurs during gestation.Prophylactic digitalizationIt is commonly used in patients with severe heart disease who are not in overt congestive failure.During labour and deliveryThe pregnant cardiac patient should always labor and deliver in lateral supine position to avoid hemodynamic impairment caused by dorsal decubitus position.Effective pain relief during labour with morphine.Continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry.Restriction of i.v. fluids to 75 ml/hr (Almost all cardiac patients in labour should be kept on the dry side).Antibiotic prophylaxis (This is given in patients with congenital or acquired heart lesions).Thrombosis prophylaxis.Patient should be placed in sitting position after delivery. This is done to avoid pulmonary edema (sitting will increase venous pooling in the lower extremities and decrease the venous return to the heart).",B

Macrosomia:

Fetal macrosomia is defined by ACOG as fetal birth weight is > 4500 g.
Macrosomic fetuses have extensive fat deposits on the shoulder and trunk which is associated with increased incidence of shoulder dystocia.
Organ which is not affected in macrosomia is brain.
Control of postparandial blood sugar levels is very important for preventing macrosomia.
For diagnosing macrosomia: USG is performed every 4 weeks, starting at 20 weeks of gestation.
First sign of developing macrosomia is: increase in abdominal circumference more than other measurements.
Management : If wt of fetus is > 4.5 kg in diabetic mothers or > 5 kg in non diabetic mothers–section is recommended.",A

After 20 weeks - Cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and the amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.The fluid in the amniotic fluid is completely changed and replaced in every 3 hours.Causes of increase in amniotic fluid (Polyhydramnios)Because the fetus normally swallows the amniotic fluid and excretes it through urine it has been assumed that this mechanism is one of the ways by which the volume is controlled.Thus renal agenesis will lead to oligohydramnios not polyhydramnios.Anencephaly causes polyhydramnios because of transudation from exposed meninges and absence of fetal swallowing reflex.Open spina bifida leads to polyhydramnios because of transudation of meninges.Causes of polyhydramnios MaternalPh isoimmunisationDiabetes PlacentalPlacental chrioangiomaCircumvallate placenta syndrome FetalMultiple pregnancyFetal anomaliesCNS abnormalities (Anencephaly)G.L abnormalities (Oesophageal or duodenal atresia)G.

If the AFP level was elevated, then an assay for acetylcholinesterase was done. These tests were considered diagnostic for fetal NTD. Today however nearly 100% of NTDs are identified by ultrasonography used alone.”
Diagnosis of Anencephaly/NTD in brief:

Best screening test for NTD: Maternal serum alpha protein (between 14 and 22 weeks, best at 16 weeks).
Best marker for NTD/Open spina bifida/ Anencephaly is Acetylcholinesterase.

Most common cause of Hirsutism :,Polycystic ovary disease,Arrhenoblastoma,Cushing syndrome,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,"Ans. is a i.e. Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) Hirsutism is defined as excessive growth of androgen dependant sexual hair or male distribution of hair in a female. ""The most common cause of hirsutism is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome."" ""Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 70 - 80% of cases of hirsutism, with idiopathic hirsutism being the second most frequent cause."" Pathophysiology of Hirsutism : Figure showing effect of androgen on pilosebaceous unit Ted androgen leads to Ted sebum production acne formation. It conves vellus follicles to terminal follicles leading to hirsutism. Under the influence of androgens, terminal hairs that were previously not dependent on androgens reve to a vellus form and balding results. Elevated androgen levels play a major role in determining the type and distribution of hair. Within a hair follicle, testosterone is conveed by the enzyme 5a reductase to dihydrotestosterone (active metabolite). DHT conves sho, soft vellus hair to coarse terminal hair. This conversion is irreversible. Only hairs in androgen - sensitive areas are changed in this manner to terminal hairs. The sites affected are : upper hp - chin side burns - chest lines alba of the lower abdomen Ethinicity and familial tendency also influence hirsutism. Causes of Hirsutism : Remember : Hirsutism is associated with excess androgen production (either from ovaries or adrenals), so any cause which increases androgens causes hirsutism. Most of the testosterone is bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and is considered biologically inactive. Testosterone which is not bound to SHBG is considered biologically active, therefore any factor which decreases",A

Most vulnerable period for teratogenicity during fetal development is,1st and 2nd week post feilization,3rd to 8th week post feilization,10th to 12th week post feilization,18th to 20th week post feilization,"The preimplantation period is the 2 weeks from feilisation to implantation and is known as the ""all or none"" period. As the zygote undergoes cleavage, an insult damaging a large number of cells typically causes embryonic death.However if few cells are injured compensation may be possible, with normal development. The embryonic period is from the 2nd -8th week post feilisation, encompasses organogenesis and is thus the most critical period with regard to structural malformations. The fetal period, which is beyound 8 weeks, is characterised by continued maturition and functional development and during this time, ceain organs remain vulnerable.

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the contraceptive effect of birth control pills that contain both synthetic estrogen and progestin?,Direct inhibition of oocyte maturation,Inhibition of ovulation,Production of uterine secretions that are toxic to developing embryos,Impairment of implantation hyperplastic changes of the endometrium,"The marked effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill, which contains a synthetic estrogen and a progestin, is related to its multiple antifertility actions. The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic (not hyperplastic) changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. In addition, the cervical mucus, which at ovulation is thin and watery, is changed by the influence of progestational agents to a tenacious compound that severely limits sperm motility. Some evidence indicates that progestational agents may change ovum and sperm migration patterns within the reproductive system. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in birth control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses. Oral contraceptives have no direct effect on oocyte maturation and do not cause uterotubal obstruction.",B

During the formation of the reproductive system, the paramesonephric ducts are formed just lateral to the mesonephric ducts in both female and male embryos 6 weeks after feilization. During this time primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac to the gonadal ridge; a region of mesenchyme arising from and running parallel with the mesonephros. The paramesonephric ducts are formed by the craniocaudal invagination of a ribbon of thickened coelomic epithelium that extends from the third thoracic segment caudally to the posterior wall of the urogenital sinus.

Cord cutting should be delayed in which condition: September 2009,IUGR,Sever anemia,Rh incompatibility,Asphyxia,"Ans. B: Sever Anemia Delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates for a minimum of 2 minutes following bih is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia.This is beneficial only in full term mature baby and may be deleterious to a preterm or low bih baby due to hypervolemia. Negative effects of delayed cord clamping include an increased risk of polycythemia. Early clamping should be done in cases of Rh-incompatibility (to prevent antibody transfer from the mother to the baby) or babies born to asphyxiated or one of a diabetic mother.",B

Estradiol is the major secretory product of the ovary. Although some estrone is produced in the ovary, most estrone and estriol are formed in the liver from estradiol or in peripheral tissues from androstenedione and other androgens. During the first pa of the menstrual cycle estrogens are produced in the ovarian follicle by the theca and granulosa cells. After ovulation, the estrogens as well as progesterone are synthesized by the luteinized granulosa and theca cells of the corpus luteum, and the pathways of biosynthesis are slightly different.

Which of the following is dangerous placenta?,Type I,Type II anterior,Type II posterior,Type III,"Ans: c (Type II posterior) Ref:Dutta, 6th ed, p. 245Dangerous placenta is the name given to Type II posterior placenta praevia. In type II posterior placenta praevia the major thickness of placenta overlies the sacral promontory, thereby diminishing the anteroposterior diameter of inlet and prevents engagement of the presenting part. This hinders effective compression of the separated placenta to stop bleeding.Different types of placenta praeviaType 1 (low lying) - major part of placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the lower margin encroaches on to the lower segment but not upto the os.Type 2 (marginal) - The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it. It is divided into anterior and posterior.Type 3 (incomplete or partial centre) - placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the internal os) when the os is closed but does not entirely do when fully dilated.Type 4 (central or total) - placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated.For clinical purpose placenta praevia are graded into mild degree which includes Type I and Type II anterior and major degree which include Type II posterior. Type III and Type IV.Stallworthy sign:Slowing of fetal heart rate on pressing the head down into the pelvis which soon recovers promptly as the pressure is released is suggestive of low lying placenta specially posterior typeDangerous placenta previa-Type IIBAt 20 wks - 30% of placenta are low lyingAt term - only 2% of placenta are low lyingPlacenta praeviaSymptoms- Painless bleeding Warning haemorrhagesO/E- Malpresentation- Floating head- FHS present - Stall Worthy signInvestigationUSG- (TVS)- Colour Doppler- MRIClinical confirmation - Double setup examination.

How many oocytes are present at birth in female gonads?,2 million,400,4 million,200,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 2 million o In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia.o The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million.o While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the cortex of the ovary.o At birth, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase.o Total number of primary oocytes at birth is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until puberty is reached.o At puberty, some 400,000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",A

Dysmenorehea : ... Williams Gyane. 1/e, p 230 ""Cyclical pain with menstruation is noted commonly in women with endometriosis. Typically. endometriosis associated dysmenorrhea preceedes menses by 24 to 48 hours and is less responsive to NSAID and combination oral contraceptives. This pain is thought to be more severe in comparison with primary dysmenorrhea and Crammer and associates demonstrated a positive correlation between the severity of dysmenorrhea and the risk of endometriosis. Fuhermore, deeply infiltrating endometriosis, that is disease that extends > 5 mm under the peritoneal surface, also appears to have positive correlation to the severity of dysmenorrhea.""

What is not done in third stage of labour as pa of 'Active management of third stage' protocol ?,Oxytocin injection,Gentle massage of uterus,Controlled cord traction,Ergometrine injection,"Third stage of labor The placenta usually is delivered within 5 minutes of the delivery of the infant. - Signs of placental separation o The uterus becomes globular and firm. o There often is a sudden gush of blood. o The uterus rises in the abdomen because the placenta, having separated, passes down into the lower uterine segment and vagina, where its bulk pushes the uterus upward. o The umbilical cord protrudes faher out of the vagina, indicating that the placenta has descended. - Uterine hemostasis. The mechanism by which hemostasis is achieved at the placental site is vasoconstriction, produced by a well contracted myometrium. Intravenous or intramuscular oxytocin (10 U intramuscularly or 20 U in a 1000-mL intravenous bottle), ergonovine (0.2 mg intramuscularly or intravenously), or prostaglandin F2I+- (0.25 mg intramuscularly and repeated if necessary at 15- to 90-minute intervals up to a maximum of eight doses) helps the uterus contract and decreases blood loss.

The physical exam reveals the following: diffuse abdominal or pelvic pain of variable location, nodular thickening and tenderness along the uterosacral ligaments, on the posterior surface of the uterus, and in the posterior cul-de-sac, scarring and narrowing of the posterior vaginal fornix, and adnexal enlargement and tenderness. What is your diagnosis?",Endometriosis,Ectopic pregnancy,Adnexal mass,Pelvic relaxation,"Endometriosis is the growth of tissue outside the uterus. The ectopic endometrial tissue can proliferate, and infiltrate, and spread to remote sites elsewhere in the body. Sites that endometriosis is most often found are, ovarian, pelvic peritoneum, anterior and posterior cul-de-sac, uterosacral, round, and broad ligaments, and fallopian tubes. An ectopic pregnancy is one that develops at any site other than the endometrium. Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are abdominal pain possible a missed period, abnormal bleeding at the time of presentation is not uncommon. Physical characteristics of an adnexal mass that may give a presumptive diagnosis: consistency (cystic, solid or both), size (in centimeters) morphology and surface contour (smooth, nodular, vague or sharp borders), location around the uterus, mobility (free or fixed to adjacent structures) tenderness, unilateral or bilateral.

At which week intravenous heparin is introduced in a primigravida with mechanical hea valves?,32,36,40,At the time of labour,"As soon as pregnancy is diagnosed, oral anticoagulants should be discontinued and subcutaneous heparin should be initiated. In the second trimester, warfarin is the treatment of choice, with INR monitoring. Warfarin should be given only after the 12th gestational week and should be stopped before delivery around 35th week. At the 36th week of gestation, intravenous heparin should be initiated. To avoid the risk of bleeding during labor and delivery, heparin should be discontinued 24 hours prior. Anticoagulation should then be resumed 4 hours after delivery. Must know: Warfarin has been associated with fetal wastage due to spontaneous aboion and stillbihs, optic nerve atrophy and blindness, microcephaly, mental retardation, and even death due to intracranial hemorrhage. Its use in the first trimester is associated with warfarin embryopathy in 4-10% of newborns, a syndrome comprising nasal bone hypoplasia and epiphyseal stippling. Breast-feeding women can be prescribed warfarin because it is not secreted in the breast milk. Complications of heparin administration include abdominal wall hematoma or abscess, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, and osteoporosis. Low-dose aspirin has been safely used in pregnancy.

It was concluded that no benefit has been demonstrated other than in pregnancies with suspected fetal growth restriction. No benefit has been demonstrated for velocimetry for other conditions, such as post-term pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Similarly, velocimetry has not proved of value as a screening test for detecting fetal compromise in the general obstetrical population”.

Most common site for fibroids in uterus is:,Subserous,Intramural,Submucous,Cervical,"Ans: (b) Intramural Ref: Shaw s Textbook of Gynaecology 15th Edition Pg 352.Explanation:Uterine FibroidsFibroids are the most common benign solid tumours in femalesMost common tumour of uterus.Fibroids are estrogen dependent for growthProgesterone inhibits their growth.GnRH shrinks size of fibroidIncreases in size during pregnancy and OCP intakeDecreases in size after menopauseThe presence of myoma causes hyperplasia of the myometrial wall.The cavity of the uterus is often distorted and enlarged.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia.The ovaries at times are enlarged, cystic and hyperaemic with evidence of salpingo- oophoritis in about 15% cases.Distribution of fibroid in the body of uterus:Intramural 75%Submucus 15%Subserous 10%Most common site is body of uterusA typical myoma is a w ell-circumscribed tumour with a pseudocapsuleThe vessels which supply blood to the tumour lie in the capsule and send radial branches into the tumour. Because of this arrangement of blood supply, the central portion of the tumour receives the least blood supply, and degeneration is noticeable early and most often in this part of the tumour. On the other hand, calcification begins at the periphery and spreads inwards along the vessels.Microscopically, the tumour consists of bundles of plain muscle cells, separated by varying amount of fibrous strands. Areas of embryonic muscle tissue may be present in a myoma.The endometrium tends to be thicker due to endometrial hyperplasia.

Treatment for 32 years old multipara with dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is :,Progesterone,Danazol,Prostaglandins,Endometrial ablation,"Ans. is a i.e. Progesterones Guys, It is very impoant to clear your facts on Management of DUB and Polymenorrhea in different age groups. You must read the question very carefully as management of Polymenorrhea and DUB is different. First lets understand the basics regarding Polymenorrhea and DUB. Polymenorrhea : It is cyclical bleeding which is normal in amount but occurs at frequent intervals (< 21 days). Polymenorrhea occurs in ovulatory bleeding where the ovary goes through its normal cycle but does it more quickly. The acceleration mainly affects the follicular phase of menstrual cycle. Physiological Following menarche Preceeding menopause Pathological Chronic congestion of ovaries as in : chronic salpingo-oophiritis DUB : DUB is defined as a state of abnormal uterine bleeding without any clinically detectable organic pelvic pathology. It is mostly anovulatory (80%) i.e., there is deficeincy of progesteron,.so it can be treated successfully with progesterone, Also know : In anovulatory cycles : If progesterone is commenced during an episode of heavy bleeding -- Progesterone of choice is Norethisterone acetatedeg as it has better hemostatic action whereas for cyclical maintenance therapy dydrogesterone or medroxy progesterone acetate is preferred.",A

A woman presents with a fluctuant non tender swelling at the introitus. The best treatment is,Marsupilisation,Incision and drainage,Surgical resection,Aspiration,"Ans. is a i.e. Marsupilisation Fluctuant non tender swelling at the introitus suggests a diagnosis of baholins cyst. Baholins cyst 7 It is the commonest cyst of vulva. Baholins cyst are produced from accumulation of secretions of Baholins gland. The cyst may develop either in the duct (more common) or in the gland Aetiology : cyst formation occurs due to the obstruction of the main duct or opening of an acinus. The cause of obstruction is usually fibrosis which follows either infection or trauma. It was formerly believed that the infection was invarialy gonococcal but almost any orgnaism can be responsible. Left Baholins gland is more often affected than the right. Presentation : Usually presents as a unilateral swelling that bulges across the vaginal introitus. Size of the cyst rarely exceeds hens egg. Swelling is present characteristically on the inner side of the junction of the anterior 2/3rd with posterior 1/3rd of the labium majus. The swelling is fluctuant and usually non tender. May present with discomfo, dyspareunia or infection. Treatment of choice is Marsupialization : Marsupialization is the gratifying surgery for Baholins cyst.

Which among the following is definitive indicator for start of Active labour?,Rupture of membranes,Cervical dilatation > 3 cm,Leaking,Show,"Ans. B. Cervical dilatation > 3 cm. (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/ Ch. 17)CHARACTERISTICS OF NORMAL LABOR# The strict definition of labor-uterine contractions that bring about demonstrable effacement and dilatation of the cervix-docs not easily aid the clinician in determining when labor has actually begun, because this diagnosis is confirmed only retrospectively.# Several methods may be used to define its start - One quantifies onset as the clock time when painful contractions become regular. Unfortunately, uterine activity that causes discomfort, but that does not represent true labor, may develop at any time during pregnancy. A second method defines the onset of labor as beginning at the time of admission to the labor unit. Criteria at term require painful uterine contractions accompanied by one of the following:1) ruptured membranes,2) bloody ""show"",3) complete cervical effacement.FIRST STAGE OF LABOR - Friedman developed the concept of three functional divisions of labor:# Although the cervix dilates little during the preparatory division, the connective tissue components of the cervix change considerably. Sedation and conduction analgesia are capable of arresting this division of labor. The dilatational division, during which time dilatation proceeds at its most rapid rate, is unaffected by sedation or conduction analgesia. The pelvic division commences with the deceleration phase of cervical dilatation. The classical mechanisms of labor that involve the cardinal fetal movements of the cephalic presentation-engagement, flexion, descent, internal rotation, extension, and external rotation-take place principally during the pelvic division.- Two phases of cervical dilatation are defined.# The latent phase corresponds to the preparatory division and# The active phase to the dilatational division. Friedman subdivided the active phase into: the acceleration phase, the phase of maximum slope, and deceleration phase.Latent Phase:# The onset of latent labor, as defined by Friedman (1972), is the point at which the mother perceives regular contractions. The latent phase for most women ends at between 3 and 5 cm of dilatation.# Friedman and Sachtleben (1963) defined a prolonged latent phase as bein$ greater than 20 hours in the nullipara and 14 hours in the multipara. These are the 95th percentiles.# Factors that affect duration of the latent phase include:- excessive sedation or epidural analgesia;- unfavorable cervical condition, that is, thick, uneffaced, or undilated; and- false labor.Active Labor:# Cervical dilatation of 3 to 5 cm or more, in the presence of uterine contractions, can be taken to reliably represent the threshold for active labor.# Turning again to Friedman (1955), the mean duration of active-phase labor in nulliparas was 4.9 hours. Indeed, rates of cervical dilatation ranged from a minimum of 1.2 up to 6.8 cm/hr.# Friedman (1972) also found that multiparas progress somewhat faster in active-phase labor, with a minimum normal rate of 1.5 cm/hr.# Descent begins in the later stage of active dilatation, commencing at about 7 to 8 cm in nulliparas and becoming most rapid after 8 cm.# Active-labor phase abnormalities are quite common, reported in 25 percent of nulliparous and 15 percent of multigravidas.# Friedman (1972) subdivided active-phase problems into protraction and arrest disorders.- He defined protraction as a slow rate of cervical dilatation or descent, which for nulliparas was less than 1.2 cm dilatation per hour or less than 1 cm descent per hour. For multiparas, protraction was defined as less than 1.5 cm dilatation per hour or less than 2 cm descent per hour. He defined arrest as a complete cessation of dilatation or descent.- Arrest of dilatation was defined as 2 hours with no cervical change, and arrest of descent as 1 hour without fetal descentSECOND STAGE OF LABOR# This stage begins when cervical dilatation is complete and ends with fetal delivery.# The median duration is about 50 minutes for nulliparas and about 20 minutes for multiparas.DURATION OF LABOR# It is reported that the mean length of first- and second-stage labor was approximately 9 hours in nulliparous women without regional analgesia, and that the 95th percentile upper limit was 18.5 hours. Corresponding times for multiparous women were a mean of about 6 hours with a 95th percentile maximum of 13.5 hours.",B

The most common lesion of a mature placenta with no much clinical significance is:,Infarct,Hyperophic villous lesions,Marginal hematoma,Breus mole,"Chorionic villi receive oxygen solely from maternal circulation through the uteroplacental vessels, which jet blood into the intervillous space. Uteroplacental diseases that diminish or obstruct this connection can lead to villous infarction. Although these are common lesions in mature placentas, if they are numerous, placental insufficiency may develop. When they are thick, centrally located, and randomly distributed, they may be associated with preeclampsia or lupus anticoagulant. Striking enlargement of the chorionic villi is commonly seen in association with severe erythroblastosis and fetal hydrops. It also has been described in maternal diabetes, fetal congestive hea failure, and maternal-fetal syphilis. Large retroplacental, marginal, and subchorial hematoma (also known as Breus mole) have been associated with higher rates of miscarriage, abruption, fetal-growth restriction, preterm delivery, and adherent placenta.

Lactational amenorrhea is due to:,Prolactin induced inhibition of GnRH,Prolactin induced inhibition of FSH,Oxytocin induced inhibition of GnRH,None of the above,"In breastfeeding females, prolactin levels are increased in response to suckling stimulus of breast feeding.
Besides prolactin, FSH concentration are normal and LH concentration are low.
Despite the presence of gonadotropin the ovary during lactation hyperprolactinemia dose not display follicular development and dose not secrete estrogen
These observations suggest that high concentrations of prolactin can work at both central levels(by inhibiting pulsatile secretion of GnrH) and peripheral level i.e. ovarian sites to produce lactational amenorrhea and anovulation
The principle pf GnrH suppression by prolactin is reinforced by the demonstration that treatment of amenorrheic, lactating women with pulsatile GrrH , fully restores pituitary secretion and normal ovarian cyclic activity",A

Normal size but non functioning uterus is usually associated with:,Stenosis of the external os,Uterine synechiae,Partial agenesis of the vagina,Complete absence of vagina,"Lets have a look at each option:
Option a: Stenosis of external os would result in hematometra, i.e. uterus would be large and non functioning (hence ruled out).
Option c: Partial agenesis of vagina 
In parital agenesis of vagina a segment of vagina may be atretic in the upper-third. It is often associated with hypoplasia or even absence of cervix. Uterus may be normal and functioning or malformed.
Option d: Complete absence of vagina is almost always associated with absence of uterus.
Hence by exclusion our answer is b i.e. uterine synechiae (Asherman syndrome)
In Uterine syechiae–the uterus does not function normally due to presence of adhesions size of uterus is normal.",B
Best test to quantify' feto-maternal haemorrhage in Rh isoimmunisation is -,LPT,DCT,Kleinhauser test,Indirect coombs,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Kleinhauser test Kleiheaur betke testo It is quantitative test which is used to calculate the approx volume of the fetal blood entering into the maternal circulation. Based on the principle of acid elution technique and is done by using citric acid phosphate buffer. Fetal red cells (dark refractile bodies) are calculated as per 50 low power fields. If there are 80fetal erythrocytes in 50 low power fields in maternal peripheral blood films, it is estimated as transplacental haemorrhage to the extent of 4 ml of fetal blood.o Though more accurate tests are flow cytometry and immunofluorescence.o Apt test (Singer alkali denaturation test) is another test by which is used to detect the presence of fetal blood in maternal blood. But it is qualitative test. It uses KOH as reagent and is based on alkali denaturation.o Bubble test (shake test) is a bedside test to detect the fetal lung maturity.",C

Investigation of choice in cholestasis of pregnancy ?,Serum bilirubin levels,Serum bile acids levels,Serum alkaline phosphatase levels,Serum glutathiones transferase levels,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Serum bile acid levels Obstetric cholestasis (also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy or cholestasis of pregnancy) is a liver disease unique to pregnancy which presents with pruritus.Clinical featuresObstetric cholestasis most commonly presents in the third trimester (80% develop symptoms after 1st week).The pruritus is often severe and typically the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved but the legs, thighs arms, backs, breasts and abdomen are also reported.The disease tends to recur in every pregnancy and so a part history of the condition is important.The disease is more common among multiple gestations.Other signs and symptoms of liver disease are not observed. Additional symptoms which may be reported in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine.Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasisThe most common abnormalities in liver function are:Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases)Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases)Increase in bile acids (seen in 92%) cases)Elevated bilirubin (22%) of cases)Increased GGT (39% cases)Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy.Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy.The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions.Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis: -Liver biopsy demonstrates: -Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi.Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease.Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasisBiochemical abnormalities and pruritics in obsteric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs.Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week.Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks.Complications of obstetric cholestasisMeconium stained liquorPremature deliveryFetal distressPost-partum hemorrhageTreatment of obstetric cholestasis: -AntihistaminesChlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus.Topical treatmentsIf the skin is well moisturized pruritus may be relieved.Ursodeoxycholic acidS-Adenosyl methionineDexamethasoneDexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT.Vitamin KIn obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K. This will increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.Vitamin K injection is given to reduce the risk of PPH.",B
38 weeks primi in early labour with transverse presentation. TOC is,Allow for cervical dilatation,Internal podalic version,LSCS,Forceps,"Ans. is c i.e. LSCS When a patient with transverse lie is seen in labour, it is managed as follows according to Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 397. Early labor ECV - provided there is good amount of liquor amnii and there is no contraindication. ECV should be tried in all cases. LSCS - is the preferred method of delivery if version fails or is contraindicated. ate labor Baby alive - If the baby is mature and fetal condition is good, it is preferable to do LSCS in all cases. Baby dead - LSCS even in such cases, is much safer in the hands of those who are not conversant with destructive operation. If the obstetrician is conversant with destructive operation, decapitation or evisceration is to be done. Following destructive operation, the uterine cavity is to be explored to exclude rupture of uterus. Internal version should not be done. According to Onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudnal lie by abdominal manipulation are likely to be unsuccessful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are woh trying in absence of other complications that indicate cesarean section. In the given question 38 weeks primi is presenting in Early labour so external cephalic version could have been tried. but it is not given in the option, so our answer is LSCS. Note : While doing LSCS--a transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficult fetal extraction. Therefore a veical incision is typically indicated.",C

(SELECT 1 DAY)",Day 3,Day 8,Day 14,Day 21,"The diagnostic evaluation of an infertile couple should be thorough and completed as rapidly as possible. The primary diagnostic steps in the workup of the infertile couple include (1) documentation of ovulation by measurement of basal body temperature (BBT) or mid-luteal phase serum progesterone; (2) semen analysis; (3) postcoital test; (4) hysterosalpingogram; and (5) endometrial biopsy. Women should record their BBT for evidence of ovulation. In addition, serial serum progesterone levels may be helpful to confirm ovulation. Serum progesterone values should be obtained 7 days after ovulation and may also be helpful in evaluating inadequate luteal phase. An endometrial biopsy may also provide valuable information regarding the status of the luteal phase. The biopsy is obtained 12 days after the thermogenic shift, or 2 to 3 days before the expected onset of menses, on about day 26 of a 28-day cycle. A postcoital test is an in vivo test that evaluates the interaction of sperm and cervical mucus. It is performed during the periovulatory period up to 12 h after coitus. The cervical mucus is obtained, and its quantity and quality as well as its interaction with the sperm are evaluated. The hysterosalpingogram is performed in the mid follicular phase in order to evaluate the fallopian tubes and the contour of the uterine cavity; it should not be done while the patient is menstruating or after ovulation has occurred. Although gonadotropin levels are not routinely evaluated, they should be obtained in the early follicular phase when testing is indicated, e.g., in cases where there is a history of oligoovulation.",A

Oxytocin should be discontinued if the number of uterine contractions persists with frequency more than,5 per 10 minutes,5 per 15 minutes,5 per 20 minutes,Any of the above,"Ans. a (5 per 10 minutes) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 22)Oxytocin is a nanopeptide, synthesized in hypothalamus (Paraventricular nucleus) but stored and released by posterior pituitary. Its half life of 3-4 minutes. Alcohol inhibits its release. Uses: Stimulates labor, uterine contractions, milk let-down; controls uterine hemorrhage. Oxytocin when used for stimulation of labour should be discontinued if the number of contractions persists with a frequency > 5 in a 10-min period or 7 in a 15-min period or with a persistent nonreassuring FHR pattern.INTRAVENOUS OXYTOCIN ADMINISTRATION for stimulation of labour# The goal of induction or augmentation is to effect uterine activity sufficiently to produce cervical change and fetal descent while avoiding development of a nonreassuring fetal status.# Discontinuation of oxytocin nearly always rapidly decreases the frequency of contractions.# When oxytocin is stopped, its concentration in plasma rapidly falls because the mean half-life is approximately 5 min.# It is found that a uterine response occurs within 3 to 5 minutes of beginning an oxytocin infusion and that a plasma steady state is reached in 40 minutes.# Response depends on -- preexisting uterine activity,- cervical status,- pregnancy duration, and- individual biological differences.# The uterine response to oxytocin increases from 20 to 30 weeks and increases rapidly at termEducational point:# Maximal Dosage of oxytocin- The maximal effective dose of oxytocin to achieve adequate contractions in all cases is not known.- Wen and colleagues found that the likelihood of progression to a vaginal delivery decreases at and beyond an oxytocin dosage of 36 mU/min.- At a dosage of 72 mU/min, however, half of the nulliparas were delivered vaginally.- Thus, if contractions are not adequate--less than 200 Montevideo units--and if the fetal status is reassuring andlabor has arrested, an oxytocin infusion dose greater than 48 mU/min has no apparent risks.Hypothalamic/pituitary drugs DRUGCLINICAL USE1.GHGH deficiency, Turner syndrome.2.Somatostatin (octreotide)Acromegaly, carcinoid, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, esophageal varices.3.OxytocinStimulates labor, uterine contractions, milk let-down; controls uterine hemorrhage.4.ADH (DDAVP)Pituitary (central, not nephrogenic) Dl.",A
GnRH analogue may be given in all of the following except,Prostate Ca,Endometrium Ca,Fibromyoma - uterus,Precocious pubey,"Ans. is b i.e Endometrial Ca GnRH agonist : Mechanism of action : GnRH agonist bind to GnRH receptors in the pituitary, and cause competitive inhibition of endogenous GnRH. Initially there is a supraphysiological release of FSH and LH from pituitary (Flare) followed by decrease in the synthesis and release of both FSH and LH. Preparations of GnRH : * Buserelin * Leuprorelin Nafarelin * Gosserelin Triptorelin * Historelin Method of administration : Subcutaneous/intramuscular injections or as nasal sprays. Indications : In females : (In all those conditions where there is increased estrogen, GnRH analogues are useful). Mnemonic : A - F and HIP. A = Adenomyosis B = Irritable Bowel Syndrome (under Trial) C = Ca Breast (Tamoxifen + GnRH agonist give good result) D = DUB E = Endometriosis F = Fibromyoma uterus. H = Hirsutism I = Infeility P = Precocious Pubey. In males : Cryptorchidism : sho term intranasal nafarelin is used. Carcinoma prostrate : GnRH agonist are as effective as orchidectomy in Ca prostrate but if there are neurological symptoms or life threatening metastatic disease - androgens should first be staed followed by GnRH agonist. BPH : Daily administration of leuprorelin or nafarelin decreases obstructive urinary symptoms in 1-6 months time. Adverse effects of GnRH : Local allergic reaction may occur at injection site. They cause menopause like Symptoms -- Hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headache, joint and muscle stiffness, depression, osteoporosis and irregular vaginal bleeding. GnRH antagonist : Acts immediately to stop Gonadotropin secretion (without any flare) eg : Cetrirelix, Ganirelix, Nal-glu. They have been superceeded by GnRH agonist in clinical practice except for their potential role in Contraception. Nal-glu given for 3 weeks inhibits spermatogenesis",B

What is the treatment of choice of unrupturece tubal pergnancy with serum b-hCG titre 20001 U1 ml:,Single dose of methotrexate,Vairable dose of methotrexate,Expectant management,Laparoscopic salpingostomy,"Ans. is a i.e Single dose of methotrexate The lady in the question is presenting with unruptured ectopic pregnancy with BhCG levels - 2000IU/L. So there is not doubt we can manage the patient medically (i.e. option d - ruled out) Expectant management as explained earlier is not better than medical management as it carries the risk of rupture of ectopic pregnancy (i.e. option C ruled out) and also it is done when riFICG levels are < 1000 IUL Now - The question arises whether we should give single dose MTx or multidose methotrexate treatment. In the trials which have been conducted - No difference was found in treatment duration, phCG levels and side effects in single dose vs multidose methotrexate therapy. Single dose therapy is more commonly used becasue of simplicity. It is less expensive, requires less invasive post therapy monitoring and does not require leucovorin supplementation. One trial has shown that multidose therapy has greater chance of success than single dose but this is not suppoed by any other trial so, single dose methotrexate is being used commonly. (So, it is our option of choice.) Also know : Single dose Medical treatment protocol for ectopic pregnancy. Day 0 / Day I = Measure serum r3hCG, TLC, DLC, Liver Function Test and Renal Function Test Day 2 = Single dose Methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IM given Day 4 = S.

Select the antibiotic most frequently associated with the Fetal high-tone hearing loss (SELECT 1 ANTIBIOTIC),Tetracycline,Streptomycin,Nitrofurantoin,Chloramphenicol,"Fetal exposure to an antibiotic depends on many factors such as gestational age, protein binding, lipid solubility, pH, molecular weight, degree of ionization, and concentration gradient. Some antibiotics are even concentrated in the fetal compartment. Tetracycline is contraindicated in all three trimesters. It has been associated with skeletal abnormalities, staining and hypoplasia of budding fetal teeth, bone hypoplasia, and fatal maternal liver decompensation. Sulfonamides are associated with kernicterus in the newborn. They compete with bilirubin for binding sites on albumin, thereby leaving more bilirubin free for diffusion into tissues. Sulfonamides should be withheld during the last 2 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. With prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy, streptomycin has been associated with fetal hearing loss. Its use is restricted to complicated cases of TB. Nitrofurantoin can cause maternal and fetal hemolytic anemia if glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is present. Chloramphenicol is noted for causing the gray baby syndrome. Infants are unable to properly metabolize the drug, which reaches toxic levels in about 4 days and can lead to neonatal death within 1 to 2 days.",B
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she thinks that she may be pregnant. She missed her last two periods and feels ""different."" A urine pregnancy test is positive and an ltrasound reveals a 12-week fetus. The patient is very concerned because she received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine four months ago and was told to wait 3 months before attempting conception. The pregnancy is desired. The patient asks if she should have a termination of pregnancy because she was vaccinated sholy before becoming pregnant. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",There is no vaccine risk and termination is completely inappropriate,The vaccine risk is low and is not in itself a reason to terminate,The vaccine risk is moderate and termination should be considered,The vaccine risk is high and termination should be strongly considered,"Women that acquire rubella during pregnancy are at risk of developing fetal infection and congenital rubella syndrome. If the mother is infected during the first trimester the malformation rate in the fetus is approximately 50%. These malformations include microcephaly, mental retardation, cataracts, deafness, and congenital hea diseasealthough all organs may be affecteD. Therefore, all women need to be vaccinated with the rubella vaccine-most often given as pa of the MMR series of vaccines. However, because the MMR vaccine is a live-virus vaccine, there is a concern that administration Of the vaccine within 3 months of conception, or during the pregnancy, could result in bih defects or illness. Yet, this concern is more theoretical than real as studies performed on women given the rubella vaccine sholy before becoming pregnant or during pregnancy have failed to show any increase in the risk of malformations compared to the general background risk in the population. To state that there is no vaccine risk and termination is completely inappropriate (choice A) is incorrect. Although the risk of the MMR vaccine appears more theoretical than real, one cannot state that there is no risk. To state that the vaccine risk is moderate and termination should be considered (choice C) or that the vaccine risk is high and termination should be strongly considered (choice D) is incorrect. As stated above, the risk of the MMR vaccine-associated defects is so small as to be considered negligible.",B

Fetal heart starts contracting at,10-12 days,10-12 weeks,3-5 weeks,3- 5 month,"(C) 3-5 weeks[?]The Beginning:The human heart begins to beat and pump blood through the embryo around day 22 of gestation.The electric stimulus that triggers contractions in the myocardium arise spontaneously within the myocardium itself, and propagate from cell to cell. Input from the central nervous system can modify the heart rate (the frequency of heart beats), but it does not initiate beats.The ability of cardiac myocytes to beat is an intrinsic property of these cells. It has been found that myocytes removed from the early heart and grown in culture will beat sporadically, and if they become connected to each other, will then begin to beat rhythmically, in unison.As a functional organ, the heart begins to beat very early, even before it has assumed its final form.Interestingly, the heart begins to beat even before structures such as valves and septa (singular: septum; the muscular walls that divide the chambers) have formed. The initial contractions are peristaltic - that is, they proceed in a wave like fashion along the length of the heart.

The most common association of renal failure in obstetrics is?,PIH,Sepsis,Abruptio placentae,HELLP syndrome,"Ans. A. PIH. (Ref Williams Obstetrics. 22nd ed. Chapter 48; pg. 1255-1258; Table 48-6).Today, renal failure is most often associated with severe preeclampsia - eclampsia [with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) developed renal failure).Obstetrical hemorrhage, notably placental abruption, when it develops either alone or in concert with severe preeclampsia, is strongly linked to severe renal failure. ""Abruption placentae, with either overt or concealed hemorrhage, appears to be the most common antecedent event causing ARF.""# Management- Oliguria is an important sign of acutely impaired renal function. In obstetrical cases, both prerenal and intrarenal factors are commonly operative. For example, with total placental abruption, severe hypovolemia is common from massive hemorrhage.- Superimposed preeclampsia may cause oliguria. Intense consumptive coagulopathy commonly triggered by an abruption might impede intrarenal microcirculation.- When azotemia is evident and severe oliguria persists, hemodialysis should be initiated before marked deterioration of general well-being occurs.- Early dialysis appears to reduce appreciably the mortality and may enhance the extent of recovery of renal function. With time, renal function usually returns to normal or near normal.Additional Educational points:# PLACENTAL ABRUPTION is the most common cause of severe consumptive coagulopathy in obstetrics.# Nulliparity, episiotomy, and forceps delivery are the most commonly associated risk factors with PUERPERAL HEMATOMAS# The most common cause of uterine rupture is separation of a previous cesarean hysterotomy scar.# The most commonly implicated contaminant of red cells in transfusion blood components is Yersinia enterocolitica.",A

Increase seen in plasma volume in pregnancy: March 2010,10-20%,20-30%,30-40%,40-50%,"Ans. D: 40-50% The most striking maternal physiologic alteration occuring during pregnancy is the increase in the blood volume. The magnitude of the increases varies according to the size of woman, the number of pregnancies she has had, the number of infants she has delivered, and whether there is one or multiple fetuses. The increases in blood volume progress until term; the average increase in volume at term is 45-50%. The increase is needed for extra blood flow to the uterus, extra metabolic needs of fetus and increased perfusion of others organs, especially kidneys. Extra volume also compensate for maternal blood loss delivery. Plasma volume increases during pregnancy. The rate of increase almost parallels to that of blood volume but the maximum is reached to the extent of 50%.Total plasma volume increases to the extent of 1.25 litres.",D

Sometimes this supplemental estrogen stimulates the uterine lining to grow. When the lining is shed, postmenopausal bleeding occurs. Most women on HRT usually take the hormone progesterone with the estrogen, and may have monthly withdrawal bleeding. This is a normal side-effect.MENORRHAGIA# Menorrhagia is defined quantitatively as a loss of >80 cc of blood per cycle, based on blood loss required to produce iron-deficiency anemia.# Predictors of menorrhagia include bleeding resulting in iron-deficiency anemia or a need for blood transfusion, excessive pad or tampon use, menses lasting longer than 8 days, passage of clots, bleeding through protection, or flooding at night.",C

A 23-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a 7-month history of amenorrhea. Examination discloses bilateral galactorrhea and normal breast and pelvic examinations. Pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following classes of medication is a possible cause of her condition?,Antiestrogens,Gonadotropins,Phenothiazines,Prostaglandins,"Amenorrhea and galactorrhea may be seen when something causes an increase in prolactin secretion or action. The differential diagnosis involves several possible causes. Excessive estrogens, such as with birth control pills, can reduce prolactin- inhibiting factor, thus raising serum prolactin level. Similarly, intensive suckling (during lactation and associated with sexual foreplay) can activate the reflex arc that results in hyperprolactinemia. Many antipsychotic medications, especially the phenothiazines, are also known to have mammotropic properties. Hypothyroidism appears to cause galactorrhea secondary to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation of prolactin release. When prolactin levels are persistently elevated without obvious cause (e.g., in breast-feeding), evaluation for pituitary adenoma becomes necessary.",C

Shoulder dystocia results in the following except: March 2007,Erb's palsy,Klumpke's palsy,Sternomastoid swelling,Anencephaly,"Ans. D: Anencephaly Shoulder dystocia is a specific case of dystocia whereby after the delivery of the head, the anterior shoulder of the infant cannot pass below the pubic symphysis, or requires significant manipulation to pass below the pubic symphysis. It is diagnosed when the shoulders fail to deliver sholy after the fetal head. In shoulder dystocia, it is the chin that presses against the walls of the perineum Although the definition is imprecise, it occurs in approximately 1% of vaginal bihs. Despite appropriate obstetric management, fetal injury such as brachial plexus injury, fetal asphyxia, fracture humerus, sternomastoid haematoma or even fetal death can be a complication of this obstetric emergency.",D

It can lead to male factor infeility due to diminished sperm motility in males. As far as female infeility is concerned- patients with kaageners can conceive because motility of the cilia of fallopian tube is distoed and not totally absent. Cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, eustachian tube-middle ear) do not beat. A poor sense of smell accompanies high mucus production in the sinuses.",C

"A 40-year-old P3L3 woman complains of urgency and hesitancy. Fuher some- times she gets the urge to void, but passes urine before reaching washroom. She had three normal spontaneous vaginal deliveries of infants weighing between 3.5 and 3.8 kg. Urine examination is normal. All of the following are appropriate treatments in the management of this patient Except",Kegel exercises,Bladder training,Biofeedback,Antidepressants,"This patient's presentation is most consistent with urge incontinence. Urge incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Most urge incontinence is caused by detrusor or bladder dyssynergia in which there is an involuntary contraction of the bladder during distension with urine. The management of urge incontinence includes bladder training, biofeedback, or medical therapy. Treatment with anticholinergic drugs (oxybutynin chloride), b-sympathomimetic agonists (metaproterenol sulfate), Valium, antidepressants (imipramine hydrochloride), and dopamine agonists (Parlodel) has been successful. These pharmacologic agents will relax the detrusor muscle. In postmenopausal women who are not on estrogen replacement therapy, estrogen therapy may improve urinary control. Kegel exercises may strengthen the pelvic musculature and improve bladder control in women with stress urinary incontinence.",A

"While performing a vaginal delivery for a nulliparous woman, after successful delivery of the baby and placenta, you observe that a perineal laceration has extended to involve the external anal sphincter. All are true regarding this except?",It could have been avoided had you practiced a routine episiotomy,Lack of proper perineal support could be the reason,Repair is done in the OT under anaesthesia by senior,Torn anal sphincter is sutured using end to end anastomosis,"Ans. A. It could have been avoided had you practiced a routine episiotomyPerineal injury during delivery can be prevented by proper perineal support, slow delivery of head in between contractions. Alternatively, if expulsive efforts are inadequate or expeditious delivery is needed, the modified Ritgen maneuver may be employed. With this, gloved fingers beneath a draped towel exert forward pressure on the fetal chin through the perineum just in front of the coccyx. Concurrently, the other hand presses superiorly against the occiput, this allows controlled fetal head delivery. It also favors neck extension so that the head passes through the introitus and over the perineum with its smallest diameters.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has concluded that restricted use of episiotomy is preferred to routine use and episiotomy should be considered for indications such as shoulder dystocia, breech delivery, macrosomic fetuses, operative vaginal deliveries, persistent occiput posterior positions, and other instances in which failure to perform an episiotomy will result in significant perineal rupture.Repair of 3rd and 4th degree perineal tear is performed in OT under proper relaxation and anaesthesia, light and position by a senior obstetrician for best results. Torn anal sphincter is sutured using end to end anastomosis. Overlapping technique is an alternative method. Data based on randomized controlled trials do not support that this method yields superior anatomical or functional results compared with those of the traditional end-to-end method.",A

All of the following are TRUE about late deceleration, EXCEPT:",Head compression,FHR begins to slow down,Suggestive of placental insufficiency,Occurs after apex of contraction,"Late Deceleration: The fetal hea rate response to uterine contractions can be an index of either uterine perfusion or placental function. A late deceleration is a smooth, gradual, symmetrical decrease in fetal hea rate beginning at or after the peak of the contraction and returning to baseline only after the contraction has ended. In most cases, the onset, nadir, and recovery of the deceleration occur after the beginning, peak, and ending of the contraction, respectively. The magnitude of late decelerations is rarely more than 30 to 40 beats/min below baseline and typically not more than 10 to 20 beats/min.

The tissues are often intewined, resulting in obstruction or non patency of the vas deferens or other pas of the male excretory ducts. Ovotestis is seen in true hermaphroditism. Both ovaries and testis are present. There is ambiguity of external genitalia. The internal structures depend on degree of differentiation of the gonads. Mixed gonadal dysgenesis: 45X/46XY is the most common karyotype seen. A wide variety of phenotypes is seen ranging from ambiguous genitalia to normal feile males or normal female phenotype with bilateral streak gonads. The usual gonadal pattern is streak gonad on one side and a dysgenetic or normal testis on other side. Mullerian and Wolffian duct development correlates with the character of the ipsilateral gonad. Persons with FSH receptor mutation have either Wolffian duct (males) or Mullerian duct derivatives (females). Never both. FSH receptor mutation causes infeility or subfeility in males or females.",C

This blockade increases GnRH pulsatility, leading to increased pituitary secretion of gonadotropins, which promote ovarian follicular development.Treatment should be limited to 6 ovulatory cycles or 12 total cycles.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",B

Coalescence of these spaces forms the antrum, and the follicle is termed a secondary (vesicular, Graafian) follicle.|Initially, the antrum is crescent shaped, but with time, it enlarges. Granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte remain intact and form the cumulus oophorus. At maturity, the secondary follicle may be 25 mm or more in diameter. It is surrounded by the theca interna.|With each ovarian cycle, a number of follicles begin to develop, but usually only one reaches full maturity. The others degenerate and become atretic. When the secondary follicle is mature, a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) induces thepreovulatory growth phase.|Meiosis 1 is completed, resulting in formation of two daughter cells of unequal size, each with 23 doublestructured chromosomes. One cell, the secondary oocyte, receives most of the cytoplasm; the other, the first polar body, receives practically none.|Meiosis II is completed only if the oocyte is fertilized; otherwise, the cell degenerates approximately 24 hours after ovulation.",B

In Breastfeeding Females
For lactating mothers, contraceptive should be chosen in such a way that in addition to providing effective contraception, they do not adversely affect the success of lactation or the health of the infant. Barriers have a high failure rate of 4–14% and not reliable for long-term control.
As estrogens decrease the quality and quantity of milk, COC pills are absolutely contraindicated in lactating mothers.
Lactation Amenorrhea Method (LAM)
• Excessive secretion of prolactin, which controls lactation, inhibits the pituitary. Prolactin inhibits luteinizing hormone (LH) but has no effect on follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). However, it partially inhibits ovarian respons to both of these gonadotropins. As a result, while the prolactin level remains high, the ovary produces little estrogen and no progesterone. Hence, ovulation and menstruation are affected.
• LAM is effective only till 6 months postpartum. Beyond this, it is not a reliable method.
• Even for the 6 months, it is effective only if there is exclusive breastfeeding.
• It any time in the first 6 months the menses starts, then it cannot be used as birth control.

Which of the following is the least likely physiological change in pregnancy,Increase in intravascular volume,Increase in cardiac output,Increase in stroke volume,Increase in peripheral vascular resistance,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. increase in peripheral vascular resistance Hemodynamic changes during pregnancyThe most important point to remember about cardiovascular changes during pregnancy is that in normal pregnant patients, circulation is hyperdynamic and that a high cardiac output is present.The increase in cardiac output starts about 10 weeks into the pregnancy reaches the maximum at about 24-28 weeks and remains elevated until parturition.The rise in cardiac output is initially determined by increase in stroke volume and later on as the pregnancy advances the heart rate also increases.An increase in intravascular volume is one of the main determinants of the increased cardiac output of pregnancy.There is an increase in both red cell volume and plasma volume.A good clinical marker of the presence of an expanded I. V. volume during pregnancy is the presence of grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.This physiologic murmur appears at about 10-12 weeks into the pregnancy and disappears in the beginning of the postpartum period.The increase in the intravascular volume fulfills the needs of the developing uteroplacental circulation and protects the mother against the potentially harmful effects of the blood loss that occurs at parturition.The increase in blood volume of pregnancy does not alter the central venous pressure (CVP), which is the same as in the nonpregnant women.Another important hemodynamic change in pregnancy is decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR).PVR decreases during pregnancy on the arterial side and the venous side of the circulation. The cause of this change is not well understood, but is most likely a direct effect of placental hormones or vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclins) on blood vessels.The decreased peripheral vascular resistance is manifested clinically by a decrease in both mean and diastolic blood pressure. This decrease is clearly observed during second trimester.Because most of the intravascular volume is contained in the capacitance vessels, the decrease in venous resistance represents the adaptation of the vascular tree to the blood volume expansion. If this adaptation does not occur, thev. volume will not expand, thereby seriously compromising the uteroplacental circulation.Hemodynamic changes in normal pregnancy*Cardiac output- Increased*Heart rate- Increased*Systemic vascular resistance- Increased*Pulmonary vascular resistance- Increased*Mean arterial pressure- Increased*Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure- Increased*Central venous pressure- Normal*Left ventricular stroke volume- IncreasedAlso knowThere are several periods during pregnancy when the danger of cardiac decompensation is especially great.First is between 12 and 32 weeks of gestation, a time during which hemodynamic changes of pregnancy develops.The most critical period is between 28-32 weeks of gestation, when the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy peak and cardiac demands are maximum.The other dangerous time for pregnant cardiac patient is during labour and delivery.During labour every uterine contractions injects blood from the uteroplacental circulation into the maternal blood stream increasing the cardiac output by approximately 15% to 20%.This continuous demand on the heart may trigger congestive heart failure,During the second stage of labour, maternal pushing further compromises the venous return to the heart causing a decrease in cardiac output that may be critical for some cardiac patients.The final dangerous time for the pregnant cardiac patient is 4-5 days after delivery.Patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome, Aortic stenosis and cyanotic heart disease may be able to go through pregnancy and labour and delivery without major complications.However, sudden death in the early postpartum period may occur. Decreased peripheral resistance with right to left shunting and pulmonary embolization from silent iliofemoral thrombus are two problems occurring at this time.",D

An elderly multiparous woman with intrauterine foetal death was admitted with strong labour pains. The patient suddenly goes in shock with cyanosis respiratory disturbances and pulmonary oedema. The most likely clinical diagnosis is:,Rupture of uterus,Congestive heart failure,Amniotic fluid embolism,Concealed accidental hemorrhage,"In the question, the female is :

Multiparous
Advanced maternal age
Fetus is dead.

The patient is having strong uterine contractions and suddenly goes in shock with cyanosis, respiratory disturbance and pulmonary edema. All these favour the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism.
Amniotic fluid embolism : It is characterised by an abrupt onset of respiratory distress and coagulopathy.

Amniotic fluid enters the circulation and sets up a disseminated intravascular coagulation, leading to consumptive coagulopathy.
Classically a woman in late labour or immediate postpartum gasps for air, has bronchospasm, becomes cyanotic and undergoes immediate collapse and cardiorespiratory arrest, usually accompanied by hemorrhage. Sudden death is usual.
It is diagnosed clinically.

Shoulder dystocia is seen predominantly in: March 2007,Transverse lie,Cord around neck,Anencephaly,Hand prolapse,"Ans. C: Anencephaly There are well-recognised risk factors, such as diabetes, fetal macrosomia,post maturity, multiparity, anencephaly, fetal ascites and maternal obesity, but it is often difficult to predict. A number of obstetrical maneuvers are sequentially performed in attempt to facilitate delivery at this point,including : Gaskin maneuver involves moving the mother to an all fours position with the back arched, widening the pelvic outlet. McRobe's maneuver; Woods' screw maneuver which leads to turning the anterior shoulder to the posterior and vice versa. Jacquemier's maneuver, or delivery of the posterior shoulder first, in which the forearm and hand are identified in the bih canal, and gently pulled. More drastic maneuvers include Zavanelli's maneuver involves pushing the fetal head back in with performing a cesarean section. Intentional clavicular fracture, which reduces the diameter of the shoulder girdle that requires to pass through the bih canal. Symphisiotomy, which makes the opening of the bih canal laxer by breaking the connective tissue between the two pubes bones facilitating the passage of the shoulders.

A patient at 30 weeks gestation presents with complaints of vaginal bleeding. She is admitted to a labor room for evaluation. Fetal hea rate is 130 bpm with no accelerations or decelerations. Ultrasonography reveals a placenta covering a poion of the internal cervical os. She currently shows no active vaginal bleeding. The best management of this patient involves which of the following?,Cesarean delivery,Resuscitation and observation in high risk ward,Amniocentesis to assess fetal lung maturity and plan delivery,Gentle cervical examination to assess dilatation and amnionic membrane status,"For the management, we follow McAfee Johnson Regime, the aim is to continue pregnancy for fetal maturity without compromising the maternal health. If the duration of pregnancy is <37 weeks, active vaginal bleeding is absent, mother and fetal well being is assured then resuscitation and observation in high risk ward is expected. Steroid therapy is indicated when the duration of pregnancy is less than 34 weeks.",B
Which test differentiate maternal and fetal blood CellaEUR',Apt test,Kleihauer-Betke test,Bubblin test,Osmotic fragility test,"Apt test Both Apt test and Kleihaur-betke test can be used to detect the presence of fetal blood within a sample. Apt Test -Is used to detect the presence or absence of fetal blood (qualitative) in a vaginal discharge to rule out vasa pre late in pregnancy or to detect the origin of a neonatal bloody, vomiting whether it's a genuine upper GI hemorrhage/hemoptysis or simply a swallowed maternal blood during delivery or from cracked nipple. Kleihauer-Betke Test -The sample is maternal peripheral smear and is used to see how much of fetal blood (quantitative) has been transfused into the maternal serum in order to assess the risk of isoimmunization and then the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Both of them relies on the fact that HbF is resistant to alkali (Apt) and acids (Kleihauer) and so the HbA containing RBCs (maternal) will be hemolyzed but not the fetal RBCs as they contain the HbF. In simple words When fetal blood needs to be differentiated from adult (maternal) blood Apt test is used --> (qualitative estimation). When the amount of fetal bleeding needs to estimated Kleihauer Betke test is used --4 (quantitative estimation). The question has asked about the test used to differentiate between maternal and *fetal blood therefore the answer should he Apt test. Apt test Kleihaur Betke test Source of sample Maternal or neonatal Maternal How it works Adding 1% NaOH destroys adult HbA but not fetal HbF Adding acid destroys adult HbA but not fetal HbF Assessement type Qualitative Quantitative Result Positive means blood is of fetal origin Repoed in estimated 'inr s of fetal blood",A

Uterine blood flow at term is?,800-1200 ml/min,50-70 ml/min,175-200 ml/min,500-750 ml/min,"The massively increased uterine blood flow necessary to maintain pregnancy is made possible by significant hyperophy and remodeling of all pelvic vessels. After delivery, their caliber diminishes to approximately the size of the pre pregnant state. Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 ml/min in non pregnant states to about 750 ml near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of utero-placental an feto-placental vasodilation. The vasodilation is due to smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, oestrogen, nitric oxide, prostaglandins and ANP.

Decreased ovulation / impaired ovulation casued by :,Minipill (prgesterone only pill),IUCD,Norplant,All,"Ans.is D.)All i.e: Minipill (progesterone only pill); IUCD; and Norplant Norplant offers long-term contraception through the use of subdermal capsules filled with levonorgestrel. The six capsules are implanted in the inside pa of the upper arm. The levonorgestrel is released from the capsules gradually, providing contraception for about 5 years. The primary mechanism of action of Norplant is suppression of ovulation. IUCDs primarily work by preventing feilization.The progestogen released from the hormonal IUDs may prevent ovulation from occurring but only paially.The hormone also thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm cannot reach the fallopian tubes. Copper IUDs contain no hormones, but the copper ions in the cervical mucus are toxic to sperm. They also cause the uterus and fallopian tubes to produce a fluid that contains white blood cells, copper ions, enzymes, and prostaglandins, a combination that is also toxic to sperm. Mechanism of Action of Mini pill(Progesterone Containing pill):Progestin-only oral contraceptives - Mechanisms of action include (1) suppression of ovulation; (2) a variable dampening effect on the midcycle peaks of LH and FSH; (3) an increase in cervical mucus viscosity; (4) a reduction in the number and size of endometrial glands; and (5) a reduction in cilia motility in the fallopian tube",D

"All of these are considered procedures for the purpose of female sterilisation, EXCEPT?",Mini lap tubal ligation,Laparoscopic tubal ligation,Laparoscopic Puerperal Sterlisation,hysteroscopic tubal occlusion,"Laparotomy, minilaparotmy and laparoscopy are commonly done for female sterilisation. Hysteroscopic method of ligation, ESSURE is another upcoming method, where a Nitinol alloy made spring like device is introduced hysteroscopically into both tubes to cause occlusion with fibrosis. This fibrosis takes place almost over 3 months after which a Confirmatory HSG is done to check the occlusion. Laparoscopic tubal sterilisation in pureprium is known cause for failure of procedure since the rings are known to 'Slip-out' of the oedematous puerperal tubes. Also, the chances of uterine injury are higher. Puerperal sterilisation is done by a mini-lap incision and laparoscopy is not done in these patients A sub-total or a total Hysterectomy is no longer considered for the sole purpose of sterilisation because morbidity and moality are too high compared to tubal sterilisation methods, unless there is uterine pathology requiring a hysterectomy.",C

Cervical length considered as cut off for preterm labour is?,1.0 cm,1.5 cm,2.5 cm,3.5 cm,"REF: Manual Of Obstretics 3rd ed by Daftary page 250, Textbook of Basic Nursing by Caroline Bunker Rosdahl, Mary T. Kowalski 9th ed page 906 ""At the time of onset of labour the cervix is 1-2 cm in length"" The traditional criteria of onset of labour is persistent uterine contraction accompanied by effacement of cervix or dilatation of cervix or both, are reasonably accurate when frequency is 6 or more contractions per hour, cervical dilatation is 3 cm or more, effacement is 80% or more and membrane ruptures or bleeding occurs. EFFACEMENT OF CERVIX: Effacement or taking up is a process by which the cervix is thinned out and gradually pulled up to be incorporated in the lower segment, thereby causing shortening of the cervical length on vaginal examination. The cervix dilates from above downwards, becoming shorter until only the external os remains as a rim. The cervical projection can no longer be felt. The effacement is caused by the contraction and retraction of the upper uterine segment Normally in a primigravida the effacement precedes cervical dilatation, but in most multigravida both occurs at the same time. The cervix is thus significantly effaced before the onset of labour, particularly in nulliparous. Prior to the onset of labour, the cervix is approximately 4 cm long by digital examination. As the cervix shortens with labour, the effacement is described as a percentage of the remaining length. So if the cervix shortens from 4 cm to 3 cm it is 25% effaced, 2 cm is 50% effaced, 100% or completely effaced cervix is paper thin. When the cervix is 100 percent effaced and 10 cm dilated, the first stage of labor is said to be complete",C

Which one of the following perinatal infections has the highest risk of fetal infection in the first trimester?,Hepatitis B virus,Syphilis,Toxoplasmosis,Rubella,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Rubella * Rubella is one of the most teratogenic agents known. Eighty percent of women with rubella infection and a history of rash during the first 12 weeks have a fetus with congenital infection. At 13-14 weeks, the incidence is about 54%, and it is 25% by the end of the second trimester. As the duration of pregnancy increases, fetal infections are less likely to cause congenital malformations.* In order to prevent rubella during pregnancy and congenital rubella syndrome, ACOG recommends that the MMR vaccine should be offered to women of childbearing age who do not have evidence of immunity whenever they make contact with the health-care system. Vaccination of susceptible women should-1) Be part of routine general medical and gynecological care, including college health services.2) Take place in all family planning settings.3) Be provided routinely to unimmunized women immediately after hospitalization, childbirth, or abortion, unless there are specific contraindications.* Vaccination of all susceptible hospital personnel who might be exposed to patients with rubella or who might have contact with pregnant women is recommended. Rubella vaccination should be avoided 1 month before or during pregnancy because the vaccine contains attenuated live virus.* In toxoplasmosis, the incidence and severity of congenital infection depend on the gestational age of the fetus at the time of maternal primary infection. Infection increases with duration of pregnancy, with the risk the fetal infection rising from 6% at 13 weeks to 72% at 36 weeks. Fetal infection is more virulent the earlier the infection is acquired. Treatment of pregnant women is thought to prevent and reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of congenital infection. Spiramycin, used alone, is thought to reduce the risk of congenital infection but not to treat established fetal infection. When fetal infection in diagnosed by prenatal testing, pyrimethamine, sulfonamides and folinic acid are added to spiramycin to eradicate parasites in the placenta and fetus.* Transmission of syphilis from a syphilitic mother to her fetus across the placenta may occur at any stage of pregnancy, but the lesions of congenital syphilis generally develop after the fourth month of gestation, when fetal immunologic competence begins to develop.* Perinatal transmission of hepatitis B occurs primarily in infants born to HbsAg carrier mothers or mothers with acute hepatitis B during the third trimester of pregnancy or during the early postpartum period. Most infections occur approximately at the time of delivery and are not related to breast feeding.",D

Withdrawal bleeding following administration of progestogen in a case of secondary amenorrhoea indicates all except :,Absence of pregnancy,Production of endogenous estrogen,Endometrium is responsive to estrogen,Defect in pituitary gonadal axis,Positive Progesterone Challenge Test :This test depends on the presence of oestrogen-primed endometrium in the uterine cavity. The test is considered positive if the patient responds to the administration of oral tablet medroxyprogesterone (Provera/Modus/Deviry) 10 mg daily for 5 days or injection progesterone in oil 100 mg intramuscularly or primolut-N 5 mg three times a day for 3 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs within 2-7 days. A positive test indicates amenorrhoea secondary to anovulation. The common underlying causes are hypothalamic dysfunction and polycystic ovary syndrome. Negative test requires giving oestradiol 0.02 mg or conjugated oestrogen 1.25 mg for 25 days and progestogen from 16th to 25th day.

Raja Devi 45 yrs old women present with history of polymenorrhea for last six months. The first line of management is :,Hysterectomy,Progesterone for 3 cycles,Dilatation & curettage,Oral contraceptive for 3 cycles,"Ans. is c i.e. Dilatation and curettage Friends. I have given these questions (36 and 37) together, so that you understand the difference between the two. Question 36 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - first line of management. Whereas question 37 asks : Polymenorrhea in a 45 years old woman for 6 months - best line of management. Another thing which I want to point out here is : Question is on ""Polymenorrhea' and not DUB (Which generally refers to anovulatory DUB). As far as first line of management is concerned definately I would investigate the patient to rule out endometrial cancer. In this process I would perform diagnostic D & C . ""In the later reproductive years, even more care must be given to exclude pathological cause because of the possibility of endometrial cancer. Aspiration, curettage or both should clearly establish anovulatory or dyssynchronous cycles as the cause before hormone therapy is staed."" As far as medical therapy is concerned : In ovulatory cycles - combined oral pills for 3 cycles is given. But staing OCP's in a perimenopausal female without prior investigations is not recommended. Now comes the -tricky"" pa : Best line of management in such cases. As far as D & C is concerned : ""Therapeutic curettage is of no value in the treatment of polymenorrhea."" So, now we are left with 2 options either medical management with OCP's or hysterectomy. The place of surgery in the treatment of excessive bleeding without an organic basis varies with the age of the patient; it should be a last reso in young girls but may be considered earlier in women above the age of 40 years. Neveheless, in the latter group it is good practice to exclude organic disease by ultrasound and endometrial aspiration, to try medical therapy and proceed to hysterectomy if the response is inadequate or not sustained. When the patient is above 40 years of age, and when the hemorrhage fails to respond to simpler measure, hysterectomy is indicated. It is the treatment of choice in all cases of persistent or recurrent postmenopausal bleeding for which there is no obvious cause. Therefore, hysterectomy is the last reso, first medical management is tried. Hysterectomy personally I feel is not the best treatment as it is a major surgery, has its own complications and high rate of morbidity. I will not advise hysterectomy to all patients who come to me with complain of polymenorrhea of 6 months duration. But it is a dicy question. You will have to decide for yourself.",C

Now let’s see what Ghai 6/e, p 164, 331, 177 has to say on the rest of options.
Option “a” i.e. Necrotizing enterocolitis
“Almost all patients of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are artificially fed prior to the onset of illness. Breast milk is protective for NEC.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 164
Option “b” i.e. Otitis media
“Otitis media is one of the most common infections of early childhood. Anatomic features which make this age group particularly susceptible to ear infection include shorter, more horizontally
placed and compliant eustachian tube, which permits reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle year. A high incidence of bacterial carriage in the adenoids may also contribute to the frequency of otitis media in children. Other risk factors include exposure to cigarette smoke, over crowding, bottle feeding, cleft palate, allergic rhinitis, Down’s syndrome and disorders of mucocilliary transport.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 331
Option “c” i.e. Hypocalcemia
“In the neonatal period there is transient hypoparathyroidism. As a result, less phosphate is excreted in the urine. Human milk is low in phosphate, but cow’s milk is rich in phosphate. Immature parathyroid in the neonates can not easily cope with excess phosphate in cow’s milk leading to hypocalcemia in top fed babies”.

Gartner's cyst seen on,Vagina,Cervix,Body of uterus,Fallopian tube,"(A) Vagina# Gartner's duct cysts (mesonephric cysts) are simple cysts of the vagina that are usually asymptomatic, and are often noted incidentally during a routine pelvic exam.> The embryologic structure from which Gartner's duct cysts arise is known as the remnant of the mesonephric duct (or wolffian duct) which courses along the outer edge of the vagina.> During embryologic development in both the male and female, there are initially two pairs of ducts. In females the Mullerian ducts (also known as the paramesonephric ducts) persist and go on to form major parts of the female genital tract including the fallopian tubes, uterus, and part of the vagina. The wolffian ducts (also known as the mesonephric ducts) regress and eventually almost completely disappear. In males the wolffian ducts persist and form parts of the male genital tract, while the Mullerian ducts regress. In the female, the mesonephric ducts lie parallel to the Mullerian ducts.> Gartner's duct cysts are usually found alongside the mesonephric ducts. Occasionally these cysts may enlarge and ultimately require excision (surgical removal). Although these cystic structures may be found anywhere along the tract of the duct, their location is most commonly in the vaginal area.",A

After a full term normal delivery patient went into shock. Most probable cause is aEUR',Inversion of uterus,PPH,Amniotic fluid embolism,Eclapsia,"Inversion of uterus ?? 'c' i.e., Amniotic fluid embolism The patient went into unexplained shock after postpaum. Both uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism can cause unexplained shock. Uterine inversion is more common and impoant cause of unexplained shock than amniotic fluid embolism. Munrokerr's operative obstetrics says ""In all cases of unexplained shock after delivery make a careful vaginal examination to exclude the possibility of occult rupture of the uterus, paial uterine inversion or pelvic hematonza"". Munrokerr fuher adds Uterine inversion is the most impoant cause of unexplained shock Three degrees of inversion are generally described. i) Where the inveed .fundus reaches the internal os ii) Where the whole body of the uterus is inveed upto the internal os. iii) Where uterus, cervix and vagina are completely inveed Symptoms of uterine inversion Symptoms of uterine inversion are not always well defined. If however the inversion occurs quickly or is of severe degree there is .feelling of something coming down and pain followed by collapse and hemorrhage of variable severity. When the inversion is of lesser degree and is contained within the vagina or when the .fundus does not come beyond the os externum, only pain and hemorrhage may be present. Inversion is also the most impoant cause of unexplained shock - In these cases the shock is not primarily due to loss of blood or trauma but is really of neurogenic origin. - In this connection it has been suggested by several authors that as one or both ovaries may be pulled into the invagination, pressure on them may be responsible for shock. - The traction on the infundibulopelvic ligaments, peritoneum and broad ligaments stimulate the ""parasympathetic system"" producing shock. Amniotic fluid embolism may also cause unexplained shock -Amniotic fluid embolism is brought about by the uterine contractions forcing the liquor amni with its contained paicles of meconium, lanugo, and vernix caseosa into a patent uterine sinus from where it is carried into the lungs. - We have opted for uterine inversion as it is the more common cause for unexplained shock. Postpaum collapse from Ian Donald 6/e edited by Renu Mishra Postpaum maternal collapse is serious obstetric complication Majority of these cases occur as hemorrhage that is revealed. But a small minority of cases of collapse after deliver occur without obvious vaginal bleeding but these are the ones that pose a greater challenge .for diagnosis and management. The conzmon causes of postpaum collapse without bleeding are -Eclampsia - Uterine rupture - Vasovagal .syncope - Pulmonary embolism (Amniotic fluid embolism) - Septic shock - Uterine inversion Renu Mishra fuher adds - ""Acute inversion of the uterus should be one of the first possibilities to cross the obstetricians mind in case of unexplained shock"" Amniotic fluid embolism It is a life threatening complication of pregnancy with an extremely high moality rate. 300 The pathogenesis of the condition is not clear. Amniotic fluid probably enter the maternal venous circulation through a breach in the barrier b/w the maternal vasculature and the amniotic fluid most likely from the placental site or at the site of a uterine trauma after the membranes have ruptured. Classically amniotic fluid embolism presents during labour or immediately after the delivery with sudden onset maternal collapse associated with tachyapnea, cyanosis, hypotension, altered mental DIC. So, there is nothing to differentiate between uterine inversion and amniotic fluid embolism in terms of clinical presentation. We have opted for uterine inversion as it seems to be the more impoant and more common cause of unexplained shock. But we are still not sure - A patient with amniotic fluid embolism will always present in this manner i.e., unexplained death following normal de livery . - On the other hand uterine inversion commonly present as life threatening post paum hemorrhage. - It may present as unexplained shock but this is not its usual presentation. - If there is a case of postpaum collapse and no other significant findings are present the first diagnosis that comes to the mind is embolism. - All other causes of postpaum collapse will have some clinical .feature which would point towards to cause. Clinically most of the obstetricianl would suspect amniotic fluid embolism if any other abnormality is absent in case post paum collapse.",A

Maximum cardiac output is seen in which week of pregnancy?,24 weeks,20 weeks,28 weeks,22 weeks,"Ans. c. 28 weeks (Ref: Dutta 6/e p52, 53)Maximum cardiac output among the given options is seen in 28th week of pregnancy. Though, maximum increase in cardiac output is seen in 32nd week of pregnancy (not given in the option).'Cardiac output increases from the fifth week of pregnancy and reaches its maximum levels at approximately 32 weeks, after which there is only a slight increase until labor, delivery, and the postpartum period.'- Miller Anesthesia 7th/chapter 69Physiological Changes in the Cardiovascular System During PregnancyPeripheral vasodilation leading to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance is thought to be the first cardiovascular change associated with pregnancy (induced by progesterone).Cardiac output increases in response to this, by 20% at 8 weeks gestation and by up to 40-50% at 20-28 weeks gestation.This is achieved predominantly via an increase in stroke volume (due to an increase in ventricular end-diastolic volume, wall muscle mass, and contractility) but also by an increase in heart rate.Labour leads to further increases in cardiac output by 15% in the first stage and 50% in the second stage due to the combination of auto-transfusion of 300-500 ml of blood back into the circulation with each uterine contraction, and sympathetic stimulation caused by pain and anxiety.Cardiac output increases again immediately after delivery due to auto-transfusion of blood via uterine contraction and relief of aortocaval compression. This may increase cardiac output by as much as 60-80%, followed by a rapid decline to pre-labour values within 1 hour.",C

Montevideo units for measurement of uterine activity include:,Increased is uterine pressure (mm of Hg) x number of contractions every 10 minutes,Increase in uterine pressure (mm of water) x number of contractions every 10 minutes,Increased in uterine pressure (cm of water) x number of contractions every 10 minutes,Increase in uterine pressure (cm of H20) x number of contractions every 20 minutes,"Ans. a (Ref. Danforth's Obstetrics and Gynecology, 9th/01.9)UTERINE ACTIVITY# The normal frequency of uterine contractions during labor is every 2 to 3 minutes; however, cervical change may result from contractions occurring less frequently. In most cases, five to seven uterine contractions within a 15-minute period reflect adequate uterine activity. Increased contraction frequency is termed uterine tachysystole and is defined by six or more uterine contractions within a 10-minute window for two consecutive windows.# The duration is assessed by calculating the length of the contraction, the fine vertical lines represent 10-second intervals, and heavy lines denote 1-minute intervals (run at 3 cm per minute). Normal uterine contractions last approximately 40 to 60 seconds.Prolonged contractions may result from ""coupling"" of contractions, uterine hyperstimulation, or acute complications such as placental abruption or uterine rupture.# The strength of the contractions can only be assessed with the direct Intrauterine Pressure Catheters (IUPC). The normal baseline uterine pressure between contractions is approximately 10 mm Hg.# Abnormally high baseline pressures in excess of 20 mm Hg may result from hyperstimulation or occasionally from overdistention of the uterus by excessive amnioinfusion, polyhydramnios, or fetal macrosomia. During contractions, normal uterine pressure ranges from 30 to 80 mm Hg, although pressures in excess of 80 mm Hg may be observed during the second stage of labor.The Montevideo unit = The Average intensity of the uterine contractions multiplied by the number of contractions over a 10-minute period (expressed as mm Hg/10 min).# Montevideo units in excess of 180 to 200 usually are considered to reflect adequate uterine activity to effect cervical change in labor.# A total of 200 Montevideo units indicates that there is adequate uterine contractility to effect labor progress.",A
A 16-year-old female has not yet staed having menstrual cycles. Her secondary sex characteristics appear normal as does external examination of her genitalia. She is given an intramuscular injection of progesterone and 5 days later she has her first period. The mechanism responsible for the delay in menses is :-,Hypoestronism,Hypopituitarism,An end-organ abnormality,A normal constitutional delay in menarche,"The patient has primary amenorrhea. Her secondary sex characteristics are normal, indicating an adequate exposure to estrogen, hence ruling out hypoestrogenism and hypopituitarism. Although her external genitalia examination is normal, the proof of the lack of an end-organ abnormality ( such as Imperforate hymen / transverse vaginal septum/ unresponsive endometrium) is that she was able to bleed after being given progesterone. This also proves that her endometrial mucosa was primed with estrogen.",D

A 26-year old primigravida with severe rheumatic heart disease (mitral stenosis with mitral regurgitation) is in early labour. The obstetrician wants to try a normal labour. Which of the following is the ideal intervention for labour analgesia?,Parenteral opioids,Neuraxial analgesia,Inhalational analgesia,Spinal anaesthesia,"Ans. is Neuraxial analgesia Pain and anxiety during labour and delivery provoke catecholamine surge resulting in tachycardia, hypertension increased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance.This may prove to be catastrophic for patients with heart disease who may develop ischemia or heart failure.* This can be prevented by providing adequate labour analgesia.Earlier spinal neuraxial blockade was used for this purpose.It was believed that sympathetic neuraxial blockade will provide adequate analgesia. However, sympathetic blockade caused by standard neuraxial techniques can produce dramatic cardiovascular changes with decrease in cardiac output secondary to a reduction in preload following sympathetic blockade.Standard spinal blockade is considered a cardiovascular risk due to the sympathetic blockade that decreases cardiac preload by causing arteriolar dilatation. Arteriolar dilatation will reduce systemic vascular resistance and may cause reflex tachycardia.Standard spinal block may produce following changes: -Low systemic vascular resistance can reverse the pressure gradient across a left to right intracardiac shunt, leading to catastrophic decrease in pulmonary blood flow.These changes are usually more severe with a single shot spinal anaesthesia compared with central neuraxial blockade. However, in the last few years, neuraxial blockade has benefitted from important technical and pharmacological improvements that allow it to be tailored to the patients' needs and obstetric course.Safe neuraxial techniques avoid standard techniques with fixed doses and instead should tailor the anaesthetic to the patient.Single shot spinal anaesthesia is not recommended for the cardiac pregnant patient, in contrast a well-controlled epidural or spinal anaesthesia is beneficial even for the most severe cardiac disease.If a rapid decrease in preload and afterload are likely to compromise cardiac status then local anaesthetic is eliminated from the intrathecal portion of the spinal epidural (CSE) and only intrathecal opioid is administered.In these patients the epidural should be dosed slowly with local anaesthetic to maintain stable hemodynamics and adequate uteroplacental blood flow.The technique carries the risk of potential delay in the discovery of poorly placed epidural catheter after a combined spinal epidural (CSE): however, epidural catheters placed during a CSE are less likely to fail.If neuraxial analgesia is not an option for a high-risk cardiac patient, then the advisability of vaginal delivery may need to be considered.Although patient controlled analgesia (PCA) via intravascular opioid infusion with remifantil or fentanyl is performed in many patients, this may not be good alternative for the cardiac patient.Pain control is typically suboptimal leading to increased catecholamine release. Furthermore to achieve, even moderately effective analgesia, the dose of opioid required could suppress ventilation. The resultant carbon di-oxide retention can cause respiratory acidosis, further catecholamine release and increase pulmonary hypertension leading to arrhythmias, ischemia, or heart, failure.Mitral stenosisThe main goal of anaesthetic technique is to avoid ""tachycardia"" as the time required for left ventricular diastolic filling is prolonged.Segmental epidural anaesthesia is recommended early during labour, avoiding significant decrease in systemic vascular resistance with reflex tachycardia.Cesarean section is also managed with segmental epidural anaesthesia.Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice.Patients with prominent symptoms are at significant risk in peripartum period and should receive peripheral and pulmonary artery catheter monitoring continued for a minimum of 24 hour after delivery since tolerance to postpartum fluid shifts may be poor.Mitral regurgitationMitral insufficiency as well as mitral value prolapsed are well tolerated by the pregnant patient since a decrease in SVR will reduce the regurgitant flow.Atrial arrhythmias and risk of embolism from atrial thrombi are important complications.Pain will automatically increase systemic vascular resistance and adequate labour analgesia should minimize peripheral vasoconstriction and thus avoid an increase in left ventricular after load associated with labour pain.Additional sympathetic blockade further decreases systemic vascular resistance.Neuraxial techniques are indicated for labour, vaginal delivery and cesarean section.",B

"If zygote divides between 4-8 days post feilization, following twinning occurs",Dichorionic Diamniotic,Monochorionic Diamniotic,Monochorionic Monoamniotic,Conjoined twins,"The outcome of the monozygotic twinning process depends on when division occurs.At 0 to 4 days postfeilization, an early conceptus may divide into two. Division at this early stage creates two chorions and two amnions (dichorionic, diamniotic). Placentas may be separate or fused. Division between 4 to 8 days leads to formation of a blastocyst with two separate embryoblast (inner cell masses). Each embryoblast will form its own amnion within a shared chorion (monochorionic, diamniotic).Between 8 and 12 days, the amnion and amnionic cavity from above the germinal disc.

Because most of the vagina does not develop from the Mullerian duct, instead developing from the urogenital sinus along with the bladder and urethra, it is present even when the Mullerian duct is completely absent. Ovaries are normal Hormonal levels are normal",A
Most impoant pa of post operative management of vesico vaginal fistula is: September 2009,Complete bed rest,Acidification of urine,Continuous bladder drainage,Antibiotic,"Ans. C: Continuous bladder drainage Postoperative details Bladder drainage: continuous bladder drainage postoperatively is vital for successful vesicovaginal repair. A large-caliber catheter minimizes the potential for catheter blockage by blood clots, mucus, and calcaneus deposits. - Type and duration of catheter drainage: For fistulas involving the lower poion of the bladder trigone, bladder neck, or urethra, transurethral bladder catheters should not be used. A large suprapubic catheter is preferable to minimize excess tension on the suture line and to ensure nonobstructed continuous drainage. In posthysterectomy VVF repairs, both transurethral and suprapubic catheters may be placed.Surgeries to repair pelvic radiotherapy-associated VVFs require longer periods of drainage. Acidification of urine to diminish risks of cystitis, mucus production, and formation of bladder calculi is a consideration for patients with an indwelling catheter. Vitamin C or methenamine mandelate can be used. Estrogen replacement therapy in the postmenopausal patient may assist with optimizing tissue vascularization and healing. Control of postoperative bladder spasms: Urised iseffective for control of postoperative bladder spasms. It is a combination of antiseptics (methenamine, methylene blue, phenyl salicylate, and benzoic acid) and parasympatholytics (tropine sulfate, and hyoscyamine sulfate). Antibiotic therapy: Close follow-up and prompt evaluation for any urinary tract infections and antibiotic therapy, when indicated, are mandatory. Minimizing Valsalva maneuvers: Stool softeners and a high-fiber diet postoperatively minimize Valsalva maneuvers in the patient. Examinations: Avoid pelvic and speculum vaginal examinations during the first 3 months. Pelvic rest: Prohibit coitus and tampon use for a minimum of 3 months.",C

Since her breast and public hair both are well developed- this means her secondary sexual characteristics are well developed.This means in this female amount of estrogen is adequate, which means she has normally functioning ovaries.Thus, options XYY (presence of Y Chromosome means- gonads are testis), Klienfelter's syndrome (genotype = 47XXY- again since Y chromosome is present, gonads are testes i.e. they are males) are ruled out and in gonadal dysgenesis- gonads are incompletely formed and are streak gonads, M/c example is Turner's syndrome - genotype 45XO. Since gonads are streak, therefore estrogen is insufficient so secondary sexual characteristics are not well developed. In Turners thus by exclusion, our answer is option b- i.e. Mayer Rokitansky kuster hauser syndrome.""Patients with mullerian agenesis, typically present in late adolescence or as young adults, well after menarche was expected, with primary amenorrhea as their only complaint.

Which of the following condition does not present with both mullerian and wolffian duct structures?,Antimullerian hormone deficiency,FSH receptor mutation,Ovotesticular syndrome,Mixed gonadal dysgenesis,"Karyotype is 46 XY
Since Y chromosome is present gonads are testis, i.e. they are males. In this syndrome, in males - Sertoli cells fail to secrete Mullerian inhibiting substance and the Mullerian duct is present.
Since Leyding cell is also present, they secrete testosterone normally, thus Wolffian duct is also present. So in anti-Mullerian hormone deficiency, both Mullerian and Wolffian ducts are present.
Ovotestis: It is seen in true hermaphroditism. Both ovaries and testis are present. There is the ambiguity of external genitalia. The internal structures depend on the degree of differentiation of the gonads.
Mixed Gonadal dysgenesis Karyotype = 45XO/46XY.
In this situation, the gonadal pattern on one side is streak gonad ovary (corresponding to karyotype 45 XO) and a normal testis on the other side (corresponding to karyotype 46 XY)

A pelvis characterized by an anteroposterior diameter of the inlet greater than the transverse diameter is classified as:,Gynecoid,Android,Anthropoid,Platypelloid,"Ans. C. AnthropoidBy tradition, pelvis are classified as belonging to one of four major groups. The gynecoid pelvis is the classic female pelvis with a posterior sagittal diameter of the inlet only slightly shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter. In the android pelvis, the posterior sagittal diameter at the inlet is much shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter, limiting the use of the posterior space by the fetal head. In the anthropoid pelvis, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the inlet is greater than the transverse diameter, resulting in an oval with large sacrosciatic notches and convergent side walls. Ischial spines are likely to be prominent. The platypelloid pelvis is flattened with a short AP and wide transverse diameter. Wide sacrosciatic notches are common.

A diabetic female at 40 wks of gestation delivered a baby by elective cesarean section. Soon after bih the baby developed respiratory distress. The diagnosis is,Transient tachypnea of the new born,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Tracheo oesophageal fistula,Hyaline membrane disease,"Ans. is a i.e. Transient tachypnea of the new born Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books. Let's see what they have said. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) RDS almost always occurs in nreterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation. It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate. According to Ghai -- RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question). Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn : Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress. Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure. Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory suppo is necessary and prognosis is good. But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. Neonatal complications : RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics. Respiratory distress : ""Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than ove diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues. 1990b)"". So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress. In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer can not be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i.e. option 'a is correct).",A

Hence, in case of post menopausal bleeding, ruling out both endometrial and cervical cancer is always a priority. Hence, a fractional curettage is the right choice.

Investigation of choice in cholestasis of pregnancy,Serum biliruhin levels,Serum bile acids levels,Serum alkaline phosphatase levels,Serum glutathiones transferase levels,"Serum bile acid levels Obstetric cholestasis (also known as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy or cholestasis of pregancy) is a liver disease unique to pregnancy which presents with pruritus. Clinical features Obstetric cholestasis most commonly presents in the third trimester (80% develop symptoms after 1st week). The pruritus is often severe and typically the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet are involved but the legs, thighs arms, backs, breasts and abdomen are also repoed. The diseaes tends to recur in every pregnancy and so a pa history of the condition is impoant. The disease is more common among multiple gestations. Other signs and symptoms of liver disease are not observed. Additional symptoms which may be repoed in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine. Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasis The most common abnormalities in liver function are - Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases) - Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases) - Increase in bile acids (seen in 92% cases) - Elevated bilirubin (22% of cases) - Increased GGT (39% cases) Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy. Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy. The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions. Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis: ? Liver biopsy demonstrates: ? - Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi. Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease. Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasis - Biochemical abnormalities and pruritius in obsetric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs. - Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week. - Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks. Complications of obstetric cholestasis - Meconium stained liquor - Premature delivery - Fetal distress - Post paum hemorrhage Treatment of obstetric cholestasis : - i) Antihistamines - Chlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus. ii) Topical treatments - If the skin is well moistured pruritus may be relieved. iii) Ursodeoxycholic acid iv) S-Adenosyl methiomine v) Dexamethasone - Dexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT. vi) Vitamin K - In obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K. This will increase the risk of postpaum hemorrhage. - Vitamin K injection is given to reduce the risk of PPH.",B

A hypeensive woman has come for preconception counseling. Which of the following antihypeensive is advised to continue once she becomes pregnant?,Enalapril,Chlohiazide,Nifedipine,Losaan,"Women with chronic hypeension are ideally counseled before pregnancy. The duration of hypeension, degree of blood pressure control, and current therapy are asceained. Those women who require multiple medications for control or those who are poorly controlled carry greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Tell women who take antihypeensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs or chlorothiazide that the limited evidence available has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such treatments.Angiotensin-Conveing Enzyme InhibitorsThese drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters. These include oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria, and renal dysfunction Some studies also suggest teratogenic effects, and because of this, they are not recommended at any time during pregnancy.Angiotensin - receptor blockers act in a similar manner. But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin-II, they inhibit binding to its receptor.They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition; Chapter 50; Chronic Hypeension",C

By convention, assisted reproductive techniques are those at some point require extraction and isolation of an oocyte. In IVF: Mature oocytes from stimulated ovaries are retrieved transvaginally with sonographic guidance. Sperm and ova are then combined in vitro to prompt feilization, and if successful embryos are transferred transcervically into the endometrial cavity using sonographic guidance. In GIFT: Eggs and sperm are placed catheter through the fimbria and deposited directly into the oviduct. In ZIFT: Zygote is transferred into the fallopian tube at laparoscopy. ZIFT currently is considered most appropriate in rare case in which transcervical transfer during IVF is technically not feasible. Ref: Williams Gynecology, 2e, chapter 20",D

Defined by the presence of virilizing signs in girls. Select the type of sexual precocity with which it is most likely to be associated (SELECT 1 PRECOCITY),True sexual precocity,Incomplete sexual precocity,Isosexual precocious pseudopuberty,Heterosexual precocious pseudopuberty,"True sexual precocity in girls is characterized by normal gonadotropin levels (as opposed to expected low prepubertal gonadotropin levels) and a normal ovulatory pattern. It represents premature activation of a normally operating hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Although it is usually idiopathic, true sexual precocity can arise from cerebral causes such as tumors or a history of encephalitis or meningitis, as well as from hypothyroidism, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, neurofibromatosis, and other disorders. In girls who have precocious pseudo puberty, the endocrine glands, usually under neoplastic influences, produce elevated amounts of estrogens (isosexual precocious pseudo puberty) or androgens (heterosexual precocious pseudo puberty). Ovarian tumors appear to be the most common cause of isosexual precocious pseudo puberty; some ovarian tumors, including dysgerminomas and choriocarcinomas, can produce so much gonadotropin that pregnancy tests are positive. Incomplete sexual precocity, which is usually idiopathic, is characterized by only partial sexual maturity, such as premature thelarche or premature adrenarche (pubarche). Incomplete sexual precocity can be accompanied by abnormal function of the central nervous system (e.g., mental deficiency). Gonadotropin levels are frequently normal in these patients. In gonadotropin-producing tumors, high levels of gonadotropins such as FSH are produced with subsequent production of estrogen. Examples of these rare tumors are hepatoma, chorioepithelioma, and presacral tumors.",D

Drug of choice for preventing Fetal Toxoplasmosis infection during pregnancy is -,Pyrimethamine,Sulfadiazine,Spiramycin,Pyrimethamine + Sulfadiazine,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Spiramycin * Classic congenital toxoplasmosis is characterized by the tetrad described by Sabin in 1942: chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial calcification and convulsion.Signs such as intracranial calcification, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and severe intrauterine growth restriction strongly suggest in utero infection in the presence of documented maternal infection.* Maternal-fetal transmission occurs between 1 and 4 months following placental colonization by tachyzoites* There are 2 goals of drug therapy for toxoplasmosis, depending on whether or not fetal infection has occurred. If maternal infection has occurred but the fetus is not infected, Spiramycin is used for fetal prophylaxis (to prevent spread of organisms across the placenta from mother to fetus). Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is concentrated in but does not readily cross the placenta, and therefore is not reliable for treatment of fetal infection. Use is aimed at preventing vertical transmission of the parasite to the fetus, and it is indicated only before fetal infection* It is given at a dose of 1 g (3 million U) orally every 8 hours.lt will be prescribed for the duration of the pregnancy if the amniotic fluid polymerase chain reaction is reported negative for T. gondii.* If fetal infection has been confirmed or is highly suspected, pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for treatment. Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist that acts synergistically with sulfonamides. This drug should not be used in the first trimester because it is potentially teratogenic. It produces a reversible, dose related depression of the bone marrow and therefore must be combined with folinic acid. The combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine results in a significant decrease in disease severity.",C

"At bih, oocytes are in which stage of development:",Prophase of 1st meiotic division,Oogonia,Telophase of 2nd meiotic division,Resting phase between prophase and metaphase of 1st meiotic division,"Ans:D.)Resting phase between prophase and metaphase of 1st meiotic division. OOGENESIS The process involved in the development of a mature ovum is called oogenesis. The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400,000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period.",D

The production of cervical mucus is predominantly stimulated by which of the following hormone?,Progesterone,Estradiol,Estriol,Pregnenolone,"Cervical mucus is a complex heterogenous secretion produced by the glands of the endocervix. Estrogen mainly estradiol (the most potent estrogen), stimulates cervical mucus production and as its levels rise during the follicular phase mucus become more abundant, watery and less cellular. Progesterone inhibits cervical mucus production and makes it opaque, viscid and impenetrable. Cervical mucus: It is composed of 92-98% water, and 1% inorganic salts mainly sodium chloride. It also contains simple sugars, polysaccharides, proteins and glycoproteins. Its pH is usually alkaline ranging from 6.5 to 9.0. Ferning is a method used to estimate hormone levels. Ferning refers to the characteristic microscopic pattern that results from the crystallization of the inorganic salts in the cervical mucus when it is dried. As the level of estrogen increases, dried mucus begin to demonstrate ferning in the later pa of follicular phase. Absence of ferning indicates inadequate estrogen stimulation of endocervical glands or inhibition of endocervical glands by increased secretion of progesterone.

P57KIP2 immunostaining is helpful in diagnosing,Ectopic pregnancy,Normal pregnancy,Complete molar pregnancy,Missed aboion,"In pregnancies before 10 weeks, classic molar changes may not be apparent because villi may not be enlarged and molar stroma may not yet be edematous and avascularOne takes advantage of the differing ploidy to distinguish paial (triploid) moles from diploid entities. Another technique involves histological immunostaining to identify the p57KIP2 nuclear protein. Because the gene that expresses p57KIP2 is paternally imprinted, only maternally donated genes are expressed. Because complete moles contain only paternal genetic material, they cannot express this gene; do not produce p57KIP2; and thus, do not pick up this immunostain. In contrast, this nuclear protein is strongly expressed in paial moles and in non-molar pregnancies with hydropic change. As a result, the combined use of ploidy analysis and p57KIP2 immunostaining can be used to differentiate: (1) a complete mole (diploid/p57KIP2-negative), (2) a paial mole (triploid/p57KIP2-positive), and spontaneous aboion with hydropic placental degeneration (diploid/p57KIP2-positive).Reference: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition, chapter 20; Gestational trophoblastic diseases",C

During the cystometrogram, a normal first sensation is of fullness felt at 100 mL. Urge is felt at approximately 350 mL, with maximum capacity at 450 mL. The primary reason to perform a cystometrogram is to rule out uninhibited detrusor contractions. The cystometrogram is a urodynamic test, and it cannot determine whether ureterovesical reflux exists. The degree of reflux can be evaluated with the voiding cystogram, a radiologic test.",D

Quintero staging is used for:,Twin to twin transfusion syndrome,Twin reversed arterial perfusion,Discordant twins,Monoamniotic twins,"Ans. A. Twin to twin transfusion syndromeTwin Twin Transfusion Syndrome: TttsOccurs in monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation resulting from unidirectional flow through deep arteriovenous anastomoses in the shared placenta. In this syndrome blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor may eventually become anemic and its growth may be restricted. In contrast, the recipient becomes plethoric, develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops, polycythemic, may develop hyperviscosity and Occlusive thrombosis is another concern. Finally, polycythemia in the recipient twin may lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus.TTTS is diagnosed based on two criteria:(1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy(2) hydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 8cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 2cm in the other twin.TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero (1999) staging system:Stage I--urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin.Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder.Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin.Stage V--demise of either fetus.Treatment - laser ablation of the vascular anastomoses",A

Most common cause of pyelonephritis in pregnancy is -,E.coli,Staphylococcus aureus,Gardnella vaginalis,B. fragilis,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., E. coli Pyelonephritis in pregnancyo There is increased chance of urinary tract infection in females as compared to males.o The overall incidence of pyelonephritis in pregnancy is between 1% and 3%.o It is more common in primigravidae than multiparae. Previous history of urinary tract infection increases the chance by 50%. Presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases the chance by 25%. Abnormality in the renal tract is found in about 25%.o Physiologic changes responsible for acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy are: (1) low ureteral peristalsis due to high progesterone levels. (2) Dextrorotation of gravid uterus causing compression of right ureter. Pyelonephritis occurs more on the right side (70-80%) compared the left (10-15%).o Predisposing /actors-Dilatation of the ureters and renal pelvis and stasis of the urine in the bladder and ureters are the normal physiological changes during pregnancy.o The organisms responsible are E. coli (70%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus aureus group.

Funneling in cervicogram is seen in -,In labour,Cervical incompetence,Cervical ectopic,During TVS,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cervical incompetence o Cervicogram is done for diagnosis of cervical incompetence. In other conditions, cervicogram is not done.Diagnosis of cervical incompetence:o Diagnosis in pregnant state:1) History : Painless second trimester abortion in previous gestation.2) Shirodkar's digital palpation test:# In suspected cases (those with a previous abortion), do a weekly per vaginal examination. A finger introduced upto the internal os and if found open pass it a little beyond and withdraw the finger. While withdrawing feel for the sphincter - like tone of the internal os; if the os tends to close down with sphincter like or snapping action, the os is considered competent and no cerclage is necessary. This is a highly subjective test.3) Cervical sonography:# Funelling of the cervix with changes in the form of Y, V, U.# Cervical length < 2.5 cm.# Funnelling of the internal os > 1 cm# Speculum examination: Detection of dilatation of internal os with herniation of the membranes.# Cervical index = (Funnel length + 1) / (endocervical length).# The ""+1"" allows an index to be calculated when funelling is absent.o Predictors of preterm birth:# Cervical index >0.52.# Cervical length < 18 mm# Funnel length > 9 mm.# Funnel width > 6 mm.o Diagnosis in non - pregnant state:1) Passage without resistance and pain of No. 8 Hegarrs dilator.2) Cervicogram : shows funnel shaped cervix.3) Intracervical balloon studies: Pass a balloon (e.g. Foley's) into cervical canal and inflate it with a radio - opaque dye and then take x - rays after applying due traction. Pear shaped shadow of balloon due to funneling of cervical canal indicates incompetent os.4) Traction studies : Pass foley's catheter through internal os of cervix and inflate it with 5 - 10 ml and apply traction. If traction of 600 gm or less is enough to pull out the bulb through the os, then the diagnosis is certain.5) Bromen papaine test : This dye selectively dilates the cervico - uterine junction.

Bartholin's cyst is caused by:,Candida,Anaerobes,Gonococcus,Trichomonas,"Fluctuant non-tender swelling at the introitus suggests a diagnosis of bartholins cyst.
Bartholin's cyst:

It is the most common cyst of the vulva.
Bartholin's' cyst are produced from the accumulation of secretions of Bartholin's gland.
The cyst may develop either in the duct (more common) or in the gland
Etiology: Cyst formation occurs due to the obstruction of the main duct or opening of an acinus.
The cause of obstruction is usually fibrosis which follows either infection or trauma.
It was formerly believed that the infection was invariably gonococcal but almost any organism can be responsible.
Left Bartholin' gland is more often affected than the right.

Presentation

Usually presents as a unilateral swelling that bulges across the vaginal introitus.
Size of the cyst rarely exceeds hen's egg.


Swelling is present characteristically on the inner side of the junction of the anterior 2/3rd with posterior 1/3rd of the labium majus.
The swelling is fluctuant and usually non-tender.


The patient may present with discomfort, dyspareunia, or infection.

Which type of Degeneration of fibroid leads to formation of womb stone?,Fatty,Calcific,Red,Cystic,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Calcific Degenerations of fibroidsHyaline degenerationo The most common (65%) type of degeneration affecting all sizes of fibroids except the tiny one.o It is common specially in tumors having more connective tissues. The central part of the tumor which is least vascular is the common site.o The feel becomes soft elastic in contrast to firm feel of the tumor.o Naked eye examination on the cut surface shows irregular homogenous areas with loss of whorl-like appearanceo Microscopic examination reveals hyaline changes of both the muscles and fibrous tissues.Cystic degenerationo Usually occurs following menopause and is common in interstitial fibroidso It is formed by liquefaction of the areas with hyaline changes.Fatty degenerationo Usually found at or after menopause. Fat globules are deposited mainly in the muscle cells.Calcific degeneration (10%)o Usually involves the subserous fibroids with small pedicle or myomas of postmenopausal women. It is usually preceded by fatty degeneration.o There is precipitation of calcium carbonate or phosphate within the tumor. When whole of the tumor is converted into a calcified mass, it is called ""womb stone"".Red degeneration (carneous degeneration)o Occurs in a large fibroid mainly during second half of pregnancy and puerperium. Partial recovery is possible and as such called necrobiosis. The cause is not known but is probably vascular in origin. Infection does not play any part.o Naked eye - raw-beef appearance often containing cystic spaceso The odor is often fishy due to fatty acids.o Color is due to the presence of hemolysed red cells and hemoglobin.o Microscopically, evidences of necrosis are present.

Likely diagnosis is :,XYY,Mullerian agenesis,Gonadal dysgenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Developmental defect of the Mullerian ducts resulting in the condition described as the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRHK) syndrome. The MRHK syndrome occurs in 1:5000-1:20,000 women at bih, and is diagnosed in approximately 1:1500 gynaecologic admissions. The clinical features include primary amenorrhoea, paial or complete absence of vagina, a wide array of uterine abnormalities, skeletal/renal and other associated abnormalities, a normal female appearance and secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46 XX karyotype. The ovaries are anatomically and functionally normal. These patients seek medical consultation because of primary amenorrhoea or in case of presence of functional uterus (1:10 cases)--because of cyclic abdominal pain occurring as a result of occult menstruation. Pelvic ultrasonography/MRI and laparoscopy help to establish the diagnosis.

Recruitment of follicles to form primordial follicle is done by:,Estrogen,HCG,Follicle stimulating hormone,LH,"Ans: c (Follicle stimulating hormone) Ref: Shaw, 13th ed,p. 28Development of a primordial follicle into a graffian follicle is under the control of follicle stimulating hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary.FSH produces grow'th and development of ovarian follicles during the first 14 days after menses.This leads to gradual increase in estradiol production from granulosa cells of the ovary. This rise in estrogen suppresses FSF1 secretion initially (negative feedback).But then above a certain level, estradiol stimulates an increase in both the frequency and amplitude of GnRH pulses resulting in marked increase in LH secretion (positive feedback).i.e. minimum estradiol causes decrease in FSH high level of estradiol causes increase in LH secretionThis mid cycle peak of LH i.e.. LH surge induces ovulation. Thus in late proliferative phase of menstrual cycle. LH surge is triggered by an estradiol peak which exerts a positive feedback on LH secretion.Exogenously administered estrogen causes negative feedback on LH secretion.ProgesteroneIt maintains the uterus in quiescent stage during pregnancy by relaxing the myometrium.Corpus luteum is the major source of progesterone during first 10 week of gestation.After 12 weeks placenta is the major source of production of progesterone.The major substrate for progesterone is maternal cholesterol.Plasma progesterone level rises during pregnancy till term and falls rapidly after delivery, undetectable after 24 hrs post partum.Fetal synthesis contributes little to maternal level, therefore progesterone level will remain high even after fetal demise.Note:Corpus luteum is maintained by - lutenizing hormoneFern pattern is due to - estrogenAria- Stella reaction in ectopic pregnancy is due to - progesterone",C
Increased gonadal production of estrogen is characteristic of,Testicular feminization,Polycycstic ovarian disease,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Third trimester of pregnancy,"In persons with testicular feminization, estradiol secretion by the testes is markedly increased (but not to the level produced by normal ovaries); the mechanism is lack of suppression of LH by testosterone and consequently increased stimulation of gonadal testosterone and estradiol secretion. Ovaries containing follicle cysts may be a source of increased estrogen production, paicularly during the postmenopausal years, when gonadotropin levels are very high. The increase in estrogen production that is characteristic of PCOD is the consequence of the peripheral conversion of androstenedione to estrogen, not of direct gonadal production. During the third trimester of pregnancy estrogen production is increased because of the formation of estrogen by the placenta rather than by the ovary. Arrhenoblastoma is a virilizing ovarian tumor and does not secrete estrogen. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia causes virilization due to the increased adrenal output of androgens.",A

"To diagnosis foetal wellbeing of foetus, most reliable method -(UPSC 97)",L:S ratio,HPL levels,Kick test,Ultrasound,"To get started, sit with your feet up or lie on your side. Count each of your baby'smovements as one kick, and count until you reach 10 kicks or movements. Most of the time it will take less than a half-hour, but it could take as long as two hours. Log your recorded times into a Count the Kicks chart. The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (aka L-S or L/S ratio) is a test of fetal amniotic fluid to assess for fetal lung immaturity. Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. Human placental lactogen (hPL), also called human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS), is a polypeptide placentalhormone, the human form of placental lactogen (chorionic somatomammotropin). Its structure and function are similar to those of human growth hormone. It modifies the metabolic state of the mother during pregnancy to facilitate the energy supply of the fetus. hPL has anti-insulin properties. hPL is a hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast during pregnancy. Like human growth hormone, hPL is encoded by genes on chromosome 17q22-24. HPL is present only during pregnancy, with maternal serum levels rising in relation to the growth of the fetus and placenta. Maximum levels are reached near term, typically to 5-7 mg/L. Higher levels are noted in patients with multiple gestation. Little hPL enters the fetal circulation. Its biological half-life is 15 minutes.",D

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute endometritis,Adenomyosis,Chronic endometritis,Endometriosis,"This benign condition is endometriosis, rather than metastatic endometrial cancer. Endometriosis is defined as a benign growth of endometrium at sites at which it does not normally occur (excluding the myometrium, at which site it is called adenomyosis). Endometriosis is common and is a significant cause of both pain and pelvic scarring. Most of the problems occur because the abnormally located endometrium responds to hormonal control and may menstruate, producing a very irritating fluid. Endometriosis may apparently be staed either by seeding of menstrual cells in the pelvis (entering through the open end of the fallopian tubes) or by metaplasia of mesothelial or other cells (accounting for rare, well-documented cases of endometriosis of bizarre sites such as nasal mucosa or lungs). Acute endometritis is acute inflammation of the endometrium. Adenomyosis is characterized by foci of endometrium deep in the myometrium. Chronic endometritis is chronic inflammation of the endometrium. Ref: Hoffman B.L., Schorge J.O., Schaffer J.I., Halvorson L.M., Bradshaw K.D., Cunningham F.G., Calver L.E. (2012). Chapter 10.

The drug that is never advised in pregnancy is:,Methotrexate,Cyclosporine,Chloroquine,Pyrazinamid,"Methotrexate is a analogue of folic acid and it prevents the synthesis of DNA by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. It has been extensively used in medical termination of pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease and placenta accreta. It has been included in the ""Category X"" of the FDA risk categories classification. The commonly repoed side effects are leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, ulcerative stomatitis, hemorrhagic enteritis, elevated liver enzymes, alopecia, pneumonitis and diarrhea. It produces cranio-facial abnormalities in the fetus though it is not teratogenic. It is better to be avoided in women who are pregnant or in those who are planning for a pregnancy in the near future. Cyclosporine is a immunosuppressant that can be safely used in pregnancy. It is used in conditions like SLE, Multiple Sclerosis and renal transplant (associated with pregnancy). The other immunosuppressants that can be used in pregnancy are cyclophosphamide, prednisone and azathioprine. As malaria is a life threatening infection in pregnancy, the benefits obtained outweighs the risks that evolve from the use of anti-malarials.

The embryo should be visible transvaginally once the mean sac diameter has reached 20 mm-- otherwise the gestation is anembryonic. Cardiac motion is usually visible with transvaginal imaging when the embryo length has reached 5 mm.

A female with recurrent aboion and isolated prolonged APTT is most likely associated with,>Lupus anticoagulant,>DIC,>Von wilebrand disease,>Hemophilia,"Lupus anticoagulant They have asked about antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies account for 3% to 5% of patients with repetitive pregnancy losses. The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L.A.C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L.A.C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",A

Ovulation occurs because of surge of -,LH,FSH,Progesterone,TSH,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., LH * Ovulation occurs because of luteinizing hormone (LH) surgeHormonal regulation of the menstrual cycle* Menstrual cycle involves the interplay of ovarian, pituitary and hypothalamic hormones.* At the beginning of the cycle, the estrogen level is very low and progesterone level is negligible.* Therefore, the pituitary and hypothalamus are free from the negative feedback effect of estrogen and progesterone.* Hence the hypothalamus secretes GnRH and the anterior pituitary secretes FSH and some LH.* FSH stimulates follicular development.* Ovarian follicles secrete estrogen.* Estrogen tends to suppress FSH secretion, but progressive follicular development ensures a rise in estrogen level.* Around day 11 of the cycle, the estrogen level crosses a certain threshold.* Above this threshold level, estrogen has a positive feedback effect on LH secretion, and to some extent also on FSH secretion.* This leads to LH and FSH surge.* The LH surge is essential for ovulation.* After ovulation has taken place on day 14, the corpus luteum starts developing under the influence of LH.* Corpus luteum secretes estrogen, progesterone and inhibin.* The combined effect of these hormones is to suppress the secretion of FSH and LH by negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary, and to a lesser extent also on the hypothalamic GnRH secretion.* Absence of support from FSH and LH leads to regression of the corpus luteum.* Regression of the corpus luteum leads to a sharp decline in estrogen and progesterone levels.* Withdrawal of support from estrogen and progesterone leads to menstrual bleeding.* Thus one cycle ends and the next cycle begins.",A

"Regarding adenocarcinoma in situ, all are true, except:",Invasive cancer cannot be ruled out without diagnostic excisional procedures,Hysterectomy is preferred for women who have completed childbearing,Frequently extends into the endocervical canal,Negative margins on excised specimen ensures complete resection of the disease.,"Ans. D. Negative margins on excised specimen ensures complete resection of the disease.a. Adenocarcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix is a premalignant glandular condition. Adenocarcinoma in situ is the only known precursor to cervical adenocarcinoma, and appropriate management can prevent the occurrence of invasive disease in many cases. The usual interval between clinically detectable adenocarcinoma in situ and early invasion appears to be at least five years, suggesting ample opportunity for screening and intervention.b. Glandular neoplasia of the uterine cervix is less common than squamous neoplasia, comprising one quarter of all annual cervical cancers diagnoses in the United States. Over the past few decades, however, the incidence of adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma has increased.c. Treatment for CIN 1, which is mild dysplasia, is not recommended if it lasts fewer than 2 years. Usually when a biopsy detects CIN 1 the woman has an HPV infection which may clear on its own within 12 months, and thus it is instead followed for later testing rather than treated.d. Treatment for higher grade CIN involves removal or destruction of the neoplastic cervical cells by cryocautery, electrocautery, laser cautery, loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP), or conization. Surgical treatment of CIN lesions is associated with an increased risk of infertility or subfertility, with an odds ratio of approximately 2 according to a case-control study.e. The treatment of CIN during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth.",D

A patient in shock diagnosed of having ectopic pregnancy in right fallopian tube. The cause of fetal death in ectopic pregnancy is postulated as:,Vascular accident,Nutritional adequacy,Endocrine insufficiency,Immune response of mother,"Lack of a submucosal layer within the fallopian tube provides easy access for the feilized ovum to burrow through the epithelium and allow implantation within the muscular wall. As the rapidly proliferating trophoblasts erode the subjacent muscularis layer, maternal blood pours into the spaces within the trophoblastic or the adjacent tissue. The fallopian tube cannot sustain the growing pregnancy. This causes rupture and bleeding which expels the implantation out of the tubal end as tubal aboion.

Which of the following is LEAST likely to occur in leiomyoma of uterus?,Red degeneration,Sarcomatous change,Fatty generation,Hyaline generation,"Mitotic activity in leiomyomas is rare and is a key point in their differentiation from leiomyosarcoma. The typical appearance of leiomyomas may change if normal muscle tissue is replaced with various degenerative substances following hemorrhage and necrosis. This process is collectively termed degeneration, and the replacement substances dictate the naming of these degenerative types. Forms include hyaline, calcific, cystic, myxoid, carneous or red, and fatty. These gross changes should be recognized as common variants.

These vessels supply the skin and subcutaneous layers of the anterior abdominal wall and mons pubis. Of surgicalimpoance, the superficial epigastric vessels, from their origin, course diagonally toward the umbilicus. With a low transverse skin incision, these vessels can usually be identified at a depth halfway between the skin and the anterior rectus sheath, above Scarpa fascia, and several centimeters from the midline.The inferior ""deep"" epigastric vessels and deep circumflex iliac vessels are branches of the external iliac vessels. They supply the muscles and the fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. When a Maylard incision is used for cesarean delivery, the inferior epigastric aery may be lacerated lateral tothe rectus belly during muscle transection.

The risk to the fetus is greatest during the first trimester. In most instances, congenital infection results from transplacental transmission of the virus during maternal viremia. In addition, perinatal infection may result from acquisition of virus by passage of the infant through a contaminated birth canal. Cytomegalovirus, rubella, and varicella are well established as teratogens. Congenital disease may range from mild symptoms to major congenital defects to asymptomatic disease with late sequelae. Hepatitis B is only rarely transmitted in utero-more usually at the time of birth and may cause a mild to severe hepatitis in infancy or, more commonly, result in a carrier state.

Which of the following is NOT an assisted reproduction technique,ZIFT,GIFT,IVF and embryonal transfer,Artificial insemination into the uterus,"Ans. D. Artificial insemination into the uterusAssisted reproductive technologiesa. Couples who have failed to respond to traditional infertility treatments, including those with tubal disease, severe endometriosis, oligospermia, immunologic or unexplained infertility, may benefit from in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intrafallopian transfer (ZIFT)b. All of the procedures involve ovarian stimulation to produce multiple oocytesc. GIFT - involves the placement of sperm and eggs in the uterine tube by laparoscopy or minilaparotomy and is more invasive than IVFd. GIFT is not appropriate for women with severe tubal disease and is less successful than IVF ZIFT - fertilization occurs in vitro, and the early development of the embryo occurs in the uterine tube after transfer by laparoscopy or minilaparotomye. A recent development is intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) which allow fertilization with a single sperm, this provides the opportunity for men with severe oligospermia or obstructive azoospermia to father children.f. Artificial insemination in Azoospermia - If azoospermia is present, artificial insemination by a donor usually result in pregnancy, assuming female function is normal.g. Artificial insemination isn't an assisted reproductive technique as it doesn't require any stimulation to ovaries or testicles. It is simply transfer of sperms to female reproductive tract artificially in a viable state.",D

Option “a”: Radiotherapy is helpful in all stages. ... Correct
Option “b”: Prognosis of surgery is good if done in early stages. ... Correct
Option “c”: When radiotherapy is given para aortic LN should be included. It is incorrect as routine radiotherapy for cancer cervix does not include para aortic lymphnodes. If para aortic lymph nodes are involved then only extended field radiotherapy should be given.
“The routine use of extended field radiation for prophylactic para aortic radiation without documentation of distant metastasis to para aortic nodes was evaluated and is not practiced because of increased enteric morbidity associated with this treatment modality.”
Note:
• IOC to know whether para-aortic lymph nodes are evolved is PET/CT imaging studies.
• Radiotherapy for para aortic lymph nodes leads to bowel complications and to avoid these complications, extra peritoneal dissection of para aortic nodes is recommended and the dose of radiation should be reduced to 5000 cGy or less. When this approach is used, post radiotherapy bowel complications occur in < 5% patients and 5 year survival rate is 15—26% in patients with positive para aortic nodes.
Option “d”: Chemotherapy is reserved for last stages. ... Correct
Option “e”: From stage 1B onwards same prognosis with surgery and RT.

Dysmenorrhoea is due to?,Ovulation,Decreased progesterone,Increased progesterone,Secretory epithelium,"ANSWER: (B) Decreased progesteroneREF: Shaw 15th ed page 294-296DYSMENORRHOEADefinition: Dysmenorrhoea means painful cramping pain accompanying menstruationEtiological types: Dysmenorrhoea in ovulatory cycle is due to prostaglandins released by progesterone in the endometrium.Primary dysmenorrhoea refers to one that is not associated with any identifiable pelvic pathology. It is now clear that the pathogenesis of pain is attributable to a biochemical derangement. It affects more than 50% of postpubescent women in the age groups of 18-25 years.Secondary dysmenorrhoea refers to the one associated with the presence of organic pelvic pathology, i.e. fibroids, adenomyosis, PID, endometriosis. Unilateral dysmenorrhoea occurs in a rudimentary horn of a bicornuate uterus.Differentiating features of primary- and secondary dysmenorrhoeaDifferentiatingfeaturesPrimarySecondaryOnsetWithin 2 y-ears of menarche20-30 years, may be pre- and postmenstrualDescriptionCramping-hypogastriurn, back, inner thighsVariable dull acheSymptomatologyNausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and fatigueDyspareunia, infertility, menstrual disordersPelvic findingsNormalVariable, depending on causeAetiology-Excessive my-ometrial contraction, ischaemia, excessive prostaglandin productionEndometriosis, PID, adenomyosis, fibroids, pelvic vein congestionManagementReassurance, analgesics, NSAIDs, antispasmodics, OC pills, rarely surgery -Cotte's operation or laparoscopic uterosacrai division (LUNA)Treatment directed to thecauseClinical types:Spasmodic dysmenorrhoea is the most prevalent and manifests as cramping pains, generally most pronounced on the first and second day of menstruation.Congestive dysmenorrhoea manifests as increasing pelvic discomfort and pelvic pain a few days before menses begin. Thereafter, the patient rapidly experiences relief in her symptoms. This variety is commonly seen in PID or pelvic endometriosis and fibroids.Membranous dysmenorrhoea is a special group in which the endometrium is shed as a cast at the time of menstruation. The passage of the cast is accompanied by painful uterine cramps.Investigations: In women suffering from secondary dysmenorrhoea, tests to confirm theclinical diagnosis and unravel the extent and type of underlying pathology should be carried out. These commonly include the following:Pelvic sonography followed by CT scan or MRI scan if indicated.Diagnostic hysterosalpingogram/sonosalpingography.Endoscopy-diagnostic hysteroscopy/laparoscopy.Medical management:1. Analgesics like paracetamol 500 mg tid/piroxicam 20 mgdaidAntispasmodics like hyoscine (Buscopan) compounds tid/Camylofin (Anafortan) tid/ drotaverine (Drotin) tid.Prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors or cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like mefenamic acid 250-500 mg/qid provide relief in 80-90% cases. Indomethacin 25 mg three to six times daily provides relief in 70% cases. Naproxen 275 mg/tid relieves about 80% cases/ketoprofen 50 mg/tid is successful in 90% cases. The advantage of the above regimes is that medication is restricted to the symptom days alone, and it does not interfere with ovulation. Meloxicam has no gastric side effects.Glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerine), a nitric oxide donor, relieves pain by relaxing smooth muscle.Progestogen containing IUCD (Mirena, Progestasert) relieves pain in addition to providing contraceptive measures and reducing bleeding.OCD administered cyclically suppress ovulation and are useful in relieving dysmenorrhoea. The advantages of regularity of periods, modest bleeding and desired contraception make this the treatment of choice in many young women. The drugs also cure mittelschmerz pain.Pelvic endometriosis may be treated with increasing doses of danazol/OCs/GnRH antagonists (leuprolide, buserelin, nafarelin).Vitamin E 200 mg bid starting 2 days before and 3 days during period claims to reduce dysmenorrhoea.Surgery is indicated if medical measures fail to provide relief and in women with secondary dysmenorrhoea to treat the underlying pelvic pathology. Surgical interventions may be diagnostic to begin wdth followed by definitive treatment based on severity of symptoms, patient's age, desire for childbearing, menstrual functions and the patient's perception of her problem. Surgical interventions include the following:Diagnostic hysteroscopy followed by D8fC, excision of polyp or uterine septum.Diagnostic laparoscopy followed by lysis of pelvic adhesions, myomectomy, draining of chocolate cyst, cautery or laser vaporization of islands of endometriosis, excision of adnexal masses, LUNA (laser-assisted uterosacral nerve ablation) for spasmodic dysmenorrhoea.Laparotomy followed by excision of chocolate cysts, eradication of endometriosis, myomectomy, excision of localized adenomyoma, presacral neurectomy (Cotte's operation),Hysterectomy in the elderly woman is the last resort.Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is effective in 45% cases.",B

Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space via lymphatics of the diaphragm.* Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumor size is >6cms.* Tumors producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30-40 years.* Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumor.Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome:* Tumor must be ovarian, solid and benign.* Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present.* Removal of the tumor must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure.Pseudomeig syndrome:* Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumor.* Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis.* Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumor.",D

Specifically, women with an abrupt onset, typically within several months, or sudden worsening of virilizing signs should prompt concern for a hormone producing ovarian or adrenal tumor. Symptoms may include deepening of voice, frontal balding, severe acne or hirsutism or both, increased muscle mass and clitoromegaly. Accordingly, serum testosterone levels may be used to exclude these tumors. Free testosterone levels are more sensitive than total testosterone levels as an indicator of hyperandrogenism. Although improving, current five testosterone assays lack a uniform laboratory standard. For this reason, total testostrerone levels remain the best approach for excluding a tumor. Threshold values beyond 200ng/dl of total testosterone warrant evaluation for an ovarian leison."" - Williams Gynae 1st/ed, p391Testosterone estimation is the best investigation in case of rapid onset hirsutism and amennorhea.Lines of Leon Speroff further support the answer --""A serum testosterone concentration greater than 150mg/dl identifies almost all woman with a potential androgen producing tumor.

Shortest anteroposterior diameter of pelvic inlet is,Obstetric conjugate,Diagonal conjugate,Anatomic conjugate,All are equal,"Pelvic Inlet

Also called the superior strait
Pelvic inlet is also the superior plane of the true pelvis
Bounded posteriorly by the promontory and alae of the sacrum, laterally by the linea terminalis, and anteriorly by the horizontal pubic rami and the symphysis pubis
During labour, fetal head engagement is defined by the fetal head’s biparietal diameter passing through this plane
Four diameters of the pelvic inlet are usually described: anteroposterior, transverse, and two oblique diameters
Distinct anteroposterior diameters have been described using specific landmarks


Most cephalad, the anteroposterior diameter, termed the true conjugate, extends from the uppermost margin of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory
The clinically important obstetrical conjugate is the shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis pubis. Normally, this measures 10 cm or more, but it cannot be measured directly with examining fingers. Thus, for clinical purposes, the obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1.5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest  margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory

       7. The transverse diameter is constructed at right angles to the obstetrical conjugate and represents the greatest distance between the linea terminalis on either side. It usually intersects the obstetrical conjugate at a point                                 approximately 5 cm in front of the promontory and measures approximately 13 cm
       8. Each of the two oblique diameters extends from one sacroiliac synchondrosis to the contralateral iliopubic eminence. Each eminence is a minor elevation that marks the union site of the ilium and pubis. These oblique diameters                   average less than 13 cm",A

Characteristic feature of carcinoma fallopian tube :,Watery discharge P/N,Hemorrhage,Pain,Sepsis,"Ans. is a i.e. Watery discharge PN Fallopian Tube Carcinoma accounts for 0.3% of all cancers of female genital tract. *Most common site is the ampulla of the tube Most common type is adenocarcinoma. The fallopian tube is frequently involved in secondary to carcinoma of ovary, endometrium, gastrointestinal tract, breast and peritoneum. Women with mutation in BRCA I and BRCA II have higher risk of developing fallopian tube carcinoma (therefore, a prophylactic surgery in these women should include a complete removal of both tubes along with the ovaries). Most common symptom is Vaginal discharge Went watery vaginal discharge called as Hvdrop, Later due to ulceration - watery discharge becomes blood stained and may take the form of perimenopausal/ postmenopausal bleeding. Always remember : In perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with unusual, unexplained or persistent vaginal discharge, even in absence of bleeding, the clinician should always keep the possibility of occult tubal cancer in mind. Triad of : - Vaginal discharge 1 - Pelvic pain } is seen in 15% of patients - Pelvic mass 1 On examination : pelvic mass may be felt.

Risk of preterm delivery is increased if cervical length is :,2.5 cm,3.0 cm,3.5 cm,4.0 cm,"Ans. is a i.e. 2.5 cm Preterm labour (PTL) : Preterm labour is defined as labour (regular , painful frequent uterine contractions causing progressive effacement and dilatation of cervix) occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation. ""Risk of preterm bih increases markedly when the cervix is less than 2.5 cms. This measurement has been widely accepted as the threshold to define the risk of premature bih. The possibility of preterm delivery when the cervix is < 25 mm is 17.8%. This risk is significantly greater than the normal risk, and hence these women require additional diagnostic tests and special care."" Also know : Most common cause of preterm labour is chorioamnionitis. Most common organisms responsible for preterm labour : -- Ureoplasma urealyticum and Gardenerella vaginum causing bacterial vaginosis. Predictors of preterm labour -- Symptoms of Preterm labour -- Uterine contraction > 4 per hour -- Cervical length < 2.5 cm -- Presence of fibronectin in, the cervicovaginal discharge between 24-34 weeks -- Bishop's score > 4 -- Cervical dilatation > 2 cm and effacement 80% -- Vaginal bleeding -- Prior preterm bih.

Most common complication of dermoid cyst is -,Cyst Rupture,Torsion,Malignant degeneration,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Torsion Complications of dermoid cyst:o Torsion is the most common complication occurring in Dermoid cyst. Because of the fat content of the cyst, it is lighter than other ovarian tumors and therefore easily torsioned. Almost 15% of dermoid cysts undergo torsion.o Malignant transformation develops only in 1 to 3% of cases, typically in women older than age 40. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer occurring in dermoid cysts.o Cyst rupture is rare. If cysts do rupture acute peritonitis is common, attributed to the sebum and hair contents of these cysts. Alternatively, chronic leakage of teratoma contents can lead to granulomatous peritonitis that may often initially be visually misinterpreted as widespread malignancy.",B

16years old girl presents with rapid onset of hirsutism and amenorrhea . Best investigation is _____________,Testosterone estimation,Dihydroepiandrosterone,Adrenocoicoids,LH and FSH estimation,"Testosterone estimation: Assays of testosterone are impoant in the diagnosis and management of a number of clinical conditions in females including precocious pubey, androgen-secreting tumors, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) . There are several limitations to their use, and there is currently no standardized assay in the United States. Moreover, most testosterone assays have poor sensitivity and accuracy in the female ranges (normal range, 20-60 ng/dl), which, even when elevated in conditions such as PCOS, tend to be well below normal male ranges (300-1000 ng/dl) Circulating levels in females vary according to reproductive maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, time of day, and also feeding . There are no age and gender normal ranges, and in fact there is no testosterone standard on which to base an assay . Other steroids with similar configuration may cross-react with the antibody used in immunoassay. Measurement of total testosterone by mass spectrometry (MS) has been recommended as a possible solution to these problems. This is usually performed after extraction and purification by chromatography and is thought to be highly accurate, although gas chromatography (GC) (which is more difficult and costly) appears to be more precise than liquid chromatography (LC) Ref Dutta 4/e p 524 ; speroff 7/e p 502- 511",A

Information obtained by lateral plate X-ray pelvimentry are all except :,Sacral curve,True conjugate,Bispinous diameter,Inclination of the pelvis,"X-ray pelvimetry is of limited value in the diagnosis of pelvic contraction or cephalopelvic dispropoion.X-ray pelvimetry is a poor predictor of pelvic adequacy and success of vaginal delivery. However, X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the impoant diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination (see below). Techniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken -- anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter. Limitations of X-ray pelvimetry: The following are the prognostic significances of the successful outcome of labor: (1) Size and shape of the pelvis; (2) Presentation and position of the head; (3) Size of the head; (4) Moulding of the head; (5) Give way of the pelvis; and (6) Force of uterine contractions. Out of these many unknown factors, X-ray pelvimetry can only identify one factor, i.e. size and shape of the pelvis. Thus, it can only supplement the clinical assessment of pelvis but cannot replace the clinical examination. Otherwise it is true that satisfactory progress of labor is the best indicator of pelvic adequacy. Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad. So it is restricted to selected cases only. Diagnostic range of radiation exposure (less than 5 rads) is not associated with any significant congenital malformation either in human or in animal.

"A 31-year-old woman comes to the emergency depament because of abdominal pain and vaginal spotting. She states that the pain began 2 days ago and has been worsening since. The spotting occurred this morning. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She has no medical problems. She takes no medications and has no known drug allergies. Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, pulse is 110/minute, and respirations are 14/minute. Abdominal examination reveals significant lower abdominal tenderness. Speculum examination shows scant blood in the vagina with a closed cervical os. Bimanual examination demonstrates significant left adnexal tenderness. Urine hCG is positive. Serum hCG is 5,000 mIU/mL. Pelvic ultrasound shows a normal uterus with a left adnexal mass surrounded by free fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Appendicitis,Ectopic pregnancy,Ovarian cancer,Pelvic inflammatory disease,"This patient has a presentation that is most consistent with ectopic pregnancy. The most common presenting symptoms of patients with ectopic pregnancy are abdominal or pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. However, many patients have ectopic pregnancies and are asymptomatic until they are discovered incidentally on ultrasound or until they rupture. Examination of a patient with ectopic pregnancy often demonstrates tenderness on the side of the ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, a mass can be appreciated on that side. The keys to the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy are the serum hCG value and the ultrasound. This patient has a serum hCG level of 5,000 mIU/mL. At this hCG level, a pregnancy would be visualized if it were, in fact, in the uterus. This patient has an ultrasound showing nothing in the uterus with a mass in the left adnexa. This constellation of symptoms and findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Appendicitis can also present with abdominal pain. However, the pain and findings are most often on the right side of the patient's abdomen and this patient has a mass and tenderness on the left side. Fuhermore, vaginal bleeding and elevated hCG levels are not associated with appendicitis. Occasionally, a patient with ovarian cancer will have an hCG-secreting tumor. However, when a woman of childbearing age presents with abdominal pain and vaginal spotting and has a positive hCG value, the diagnosis is almost always pregnancy-related (either ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine pregnancy, or spontaneous aboion) and not ovarian cancer. Pelvic inflammatory disease is rare, but does sometime occur during pregnancy. This patient, however, has findings more consistent with ectopic pregnancy than pelvic inflammatory disease.",B

Presence of yolk sac or fetal pole within the gestation sac confirms pregnancy. True gestational sac size increases 1 mm/ day. Pseudogestational sac or pseudosac : is irregular in outline, usually centrally located in the uterus, has no double decidua sign and the sac remains empty.

"A 19-year-old female comes to the physician because of left lower quadrant pain for 2 months. She states that she first noticed the pain 2 months ago but now it seems to be growing worse. She has had no changes in bowel or bladder function. She has no fevers or chills and no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The pain is intermittent and sometimes feels like a dull pressure. Pelvic examination is significant for a left adnexal mass that is mildly tender. Urine hCG is negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 6 cm complex left adnexal mass with features consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Repeat pelvic examination in 1 year,Repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weeks,Prescribe the oral contraceptive pill,Perform Laparotomy,"This patient has a presentation and findings that are most consistent with a benign cystic teratoma. Dermoids are a type of ovarian germ cell tumor. Germ cell tumors are the most common type of ovarian neoplasm in females under the age of 20 and dermoids are the most common benign ovarian neoplasm.Dermoids can range in size from small masses that are noted ncidentally on ultrasound and cause no symptoms, to large cysts that cause pain and pressure, as this patient has. Laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because, as adnexal masses enlarge--especially when they become greater than 5 cm--the risk of ovarian torsion increases. Thus, laparotomy withremoval of the dermoid is indicated to prevent torsion. Also, this patient's mass is causing her symptoms of pain and pressure and, on that basis, should be removeD. Finally, while the mass most likely is a dermoid, this is not ceain without pathologic diagnosis and, therefore, the cyst should be removed and evaluated by a pathologist. At the time of surgery, close examination should be made of the other ovary because dermoids may be found bilaterally in more than 10% of cases. To repeat pelvic examination in 1 year (Choice A)would not be correct management. This patient is symptomatic with a 6 cm ovarian mass that is at risk for torsion. She should, therefore, be managed surgically. To repeat pelvic ultrasound in 6 weekschoice B. is appropriate for some adnexal masses. For example, in a young woman with a small complex cyst that appears consistent with a corpus luteum, it may be most prudent to recheck an ultrasound in 6 weeks to see if the cyst has resolveD. This patient, however, is symptomatic with a 6 cm cyst that appears to be adermoid, which will not resolve spontaneously. She, therefore, requires surgery. To prescribe the oral contraceptive pill (Choice C) may help to prevent future ovarian cysts but it will not resolve this cyst, which requires surgical management.",D

Teenage pregnancy is associated with all except:,Caesarean Section is more common,Eclampsia more common,Post dated pregnancy,| Maternal moality rate,"Ans. is c i.e. Post dated pregnancy Friends- Teenage pregnancy is not only a new topic for PGME exams but has envolved as an emerging problem in our daily OPD'S Hence I am giving in detail about Teenage pregnancy. Defination Teenage pregnancy is defined as pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 19. It can be divided into two groups. (i) the 17-19 group and (ii) the below 17 group. All the complications are more in the later group. Incidence Teenage pregnancy accounts for about 10-12% of all bihs. There are two categories of teenage pregnancies, the unwed mothers and the married teenagers. The increasing incidence of the first category is due to changing social norms, permissive attitudes of society, influence of the media and poor access to contraception. The fast breaking down of the joint family system, increase in drug addiction and premarital sex are all responsible for the increase in unwed mothers in our society. However, another large contributing factor for teen pregnancies is child marriage, which still prevails in many Indian states like Rajasthan and Bihar. Complications Maternal In general , maternal moality and morbidity are more among teenage pregnancies especially in the below 15 group and the unwed mothers because there is lack of antenatal care and a tendency to conceal the pregnancy in many cases. Criminal and septic aboions are more in these girls in spite of aboion being liberalized in India. Antepaum complications like anaemia. malnutrition and pre- eclampsia are also much more in teenage pregnancy. Obstetric complications are also increased like, preterm labour, fetal prematurity and IUGR. Cephalopelvic dispropoion may be a problem in the very young teenagers. as they may not have attained complete skeletal maturity. Therefore. the incidence of caesarean section may be more in this group. Other labour complications are also increased if they present for the first time in labour, with out proper antenatal care. 4. Psychological problems. Pregnancy in a teenager is usually unplanned and the girl is undergoing severe mental and emotional trauma. Added to that , she may not be getting adequate family suppo. Depressive disorders and suicidal attempts are common in pregnancy. Even after delivery, maternal- fetal bonding may not be satisfactory. They are more prone to depressive problems and postpaum psychosis after delivery. Long-Term consequences Physical. Induced aboions may increase the risk of recurrent miscarriage, preterm labour and low bih weight babies in the subsequent pregnancy. There is also a higher chance of infeility later on due to infection and blocked tubes. Early age of onset of sexual intercourse and first pregnancy increases the risk of cancer cervix and preinvasive lesions of the cervix. There is also an increased chance of sexually transmitted diseases in unmarried mothers. Psychological - High suicide rates and depressive illness are common. Guilt feelings about a previous aboion or having given the baby for adoption, may occur, sometimes even years later. Social and educational problems. The girl may have to face social outracism which would definitely affect her life. Problems of child These mothers our not emotionally equipped to handle the responsibilities of motherhood. Hence there is poor maternal - child relationship, baby battering & behavioural disturbances in children of such mothers.",C

A dietary deficiency of which of the following is most strongly associated with this type of lesion?,Calcium,Folate,Iron,Vitamin C,"The lesion is a neural tube defect, probably a meningomyelocele, in which both meninges and spinal cord herniate through a bony veebral defect. These defects most commonly occur in the lumbosacral region, typically resulting in motor and sensory deficits in the lower extremities, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. This condition is now known to be associated with low maternal folate during the first three to four weeks of pregnancy, a time when many women may be unaware of their pregnancy. It is now recommended that all women of childbearing age consume at least 400 mg of folic acid daily. Calcium deficiency can cause osteoporosis and osteopenia. Iron deficiency can cause iron deficiency anemia. Vitamin C deficiency can cause scurvy. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 13.

The probable source of relaxin is:,Ovary,Adrenal cortex,Liver,Bartholins gland,"• Relaxin is a peptide hormone. It is produced by the ovary to be specific by the corpus luteum of pregnancy If corpus
luteum is in options, it should be the answer of choice. It has also been identified in :
– placenta
– decidua
– chorion
• It is not detected in men and non pregnant women.
• Levels of Relaxin rise during 1st trimester when corpus luteum is dominant and declines in the second trimester. This
suggests a role in maintaining early pregnancy.
• In animals, relaxin softens the cervix, inhibits uterine contractions and relaxes public symphysis.
• It has no effect on prolactin secretion but enhances growth hormone secretion by the pituitary.",A

Laboratory Testing In addition to a pregnancy test, laboratory testing should include a complete blood count with platelets, coagulation studies, and bleeding time. Thyroid studies also may be appropriate. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate if the patient has been sexually active, is having severe pain, or an anomaly is suspected. Cultures for gonorrhea and testing for chlamydia infection are appropriate if the patient has been sexually active. Some young teens who have a history that is classic for anovulation, who deny sexual activity, and who agree to return for follow-up evaluation may be managed with a limited gynecologic examination and pelvic ultrasonography Imaging Studies If the pregnancy test is positive, pelvic imaging using ultrasonography may be necessary to confirm a ble intrauterine pregnancy and rule out a spontaneous aboion or ectopic pregnancy. If a pelvic mass is suspected on examination, or if the examination is inadequate (more likely to be the case in an adolescent than an older woman) and additional information is required, pelvic ultrasonography may be helpful Management Management of bleeding abnormalities related to pregnancy, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic abnormalities, hematologic abnormalities, or androgen excess syndromes should be directed to treating the underlying condition. Oral contraceptives can be extremely helpful in managing androgen excess syndromes.

Which of the following condition is associated with polycystic ovaries?,Pheochromocytoma,Adrenal hyperplasia,Pancreatic overactivity,Thyroid hypofunction,"Women with Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting adrenal tumors also tend to have high circulating androgen levels and anovulation with polycystic ovaries. In this late-onset form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the enzyme deficiency leads to a relative coisol deficiency. In response, adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are increased to normalize coisol production. Adrenal hyperplasia and elevated androgens results as a consequence of this accommodation. Thus, symptoms of late-onset CAH reflect accumulation of precursor C19 steroid hormones. These precursors are conveed to dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. Thus, signs of virilization predominate. Ref: Hoffman B.L., Schorge J.O., Schaffer J.I., Halvorson L.M., Bradshaw K.D., Cunningham F.G., Calver L.E. (2012). Chapter 17.

"A girl present with primary amenorrhea, sho stature ,widely spaced nipples. Karyotype of the girl would be :",45 xo,46 xxy,46 xy,46 xx,"Turner's syndrome In this syndrome, either the sho arm of X chromosome is deleted or the nucleus possesses only 45 chromosomes, i.e. XO. The absence of Y chromosome resembles the female, but these patients are, like males, chromatin negative, i.e. their nuclei contain no nuclear satellite body and no drumsticks in the neutrophils. It has also been called ovarian agenesis or gonadal dysgenesis because at laparotomy the gonad is found to consist of undifferentiated stroma with absence of sex cells, a mere strip of fibrous tissue attached to the back of the broad ligament like a pale strip, the so-called streak gonad. The follicles grow up to 20th week of fetal life but become atretic due to absence of one X sex chromosome. In some, germ cells fail to migrate to the genital ridge from the yolk sac. These ovaries do not contain Graafian follicles, so oestrogen is not produced. The patients are clinically of sho stature though not actual dwarfs, the trunk is muscular, the neck is sho and webbed, cubitus valgus is notable. The breasts are not developed and pubic, and axillary hair is scanty or absent. Exaggerated epicanthic folds may be present, one of the obvious defects first noticeable on examining the patient. The vagina and uterus, if present, are underdeveloped. Other gross congenital abnormalities are present such as coarctation of the aoa. Deformities of the digits are also seen. Other stigma of Turner's syndromes includes shield chest, high palate, low-set ears, lymphoedema of the extremities at bih and deafness. The stigma is due to chromosomal deficiency in the sho arm of X chromosome and is not always present (seen in 20%-30%), and the percentage of stigma depends on the percentage of abnormal X chromosome. The classical picture of Turner's syndrome as described should have a chromosomal pattern of XO. However, there are variants in which mosaicism of XO/XX or even XO/XY produce less clear-cut syndromes, e.g. a normal appearing female apa from gonadal dysgenesis. The young girl with Turner's syndrome presents with primary amenorrhoea. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is above 40 mIU/mL and E2 is below 25 pg/mL. Oestrogen therapy with intermittent progesterone is advised to prevent osteoporosis. Aificial vagina may be needed at a later date for sexual function. Administration of growth hormone 0.05 mg daily for 5 years near pubey will improve the height. A pregnancy can occur with the donor egg in IVF programme if the uterus is present. If few follicles persist after pubey, menstruation and pregnancy is possible (15%). Incidence of Turner's syndrome is 1:2000 to 1:5000 live born girls. About 70%-90% of pregnancies with XO chromosome abo in early weeks of gestation. Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th editon page 145,146",A

Who has born at least one child Has normal menstrual periods Is willing to check IUCD tail Has access to follow up and t/t of potential problems Is in a monogamous relationship. Also know : Absolute contraindication of lUCD : Please Don't Ever Put Condom Pregnancy - Suspected / confirmed. DUB H/O ectopic pregnancy (Friends here I want you to know that according to Newer criteria a woman with a previous ectopic pregnancy can use IUCD.' PID (untreated acute cervicitis, vaginitis including bacterial vaginosis until infection is controlled) Cancer cervix. Mnemonic - Please Don't ever put condom. Relative contra indication are : Anaemiadeg Menorrhagiadeg Purulent cervical dischargedeg Distoions of the uterine cavity due to congenital malformations, fibroidsdeg Unmotivated persondeg Postpaum endometritis or infective aboion in the past 3 months. Multiple sex paners of woman or her husband. Genital actinomycosis. Extra Edge : Some impoant points from 'Leon Speroff' on patient selection for IUD. Age and parity are not critical factors in selection, the risk factors for STI's are the most impoant considerations Contraception of choice in patients with current recent or recurrent PID is Hormonal or Barrier method: Patients with heavy menstrual periods should be cautioned regarding the increase in menstrual bleeding associated with copper IUD. Women who are anticoagulated or have bleeding disorder are obviously not good candidates for copper IUCD, but might benefit from progestin IUCD. - Women who have abnormalities of uterus like bicornuate uterus are not good candidates for IUD inseion.deg - Patients with Wilson disease are not recommended copper containing IUCD as contraceptive - Immunosuppressed individuals should not use IUCD. Patients at risk for endocarditis should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics at the inseion and removal of IUCD. According to Speroff : cervical dysplasias are not contraindication for use of IUCD'sdeg but in patients with cervical stenosis it may be difficult to inse IUCD. No increase in adverse events has been observed with copper containing IUCD in women with either insulin dependent or non insulin dependent diabetes. Intact Cu containing IUCD's can be the ideal choice for a woman with diabetes especially if vascular disease is present.",C

A woman with Hio recurrent aboions presents with isolated increase in APTT is:,Lupus anticoagulant,Factor VII,Von willebrand's disease,Hemophilia A,"Ans. is a i.e. Lupus anticoagulant Anti Russel Viper Venom Antibody is the diagnostic test for antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which is an impoant cause of recurrent aboion. Friends, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is an impoant and emerging topic for PGME exams. It is one of the least touched topic at undergraduate level. Therefore, I am explaining it in detail. Do go through it : Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome : It is a treatable, autoimune disorder associated with recurrent second trimester pregnancy loss.deg Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired antibodies targeted against a phospholipid. They can be IgM, IgG or IgA isotopes. Most impoant antiphospholipid antibodies are : Lupus anticoagulant (LAC) -- It was named so because it was first found in patients with SLE & prolonged paial thromboplastin time -- But the name is a misomer as though it increases PTT (i.e., similar to anticoagulant) but functions as a procoagulant & causes thrombosis Anticardiolipin antibody - It is most commonly seen in patients with repetitive early pregnancy loss BFP - ST i.e. antibody which causes biologically false positive syphilis test -- Less common antiphospholipid antibody - Both anticardio lipin & BFPST antibodies measure the antibody against cardiotipin but they are not same. Diagnosis For diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome there should be two positive tests 6 weeks apa for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody. Mqrpclerrient 7 Treatment as proposed by ACOG is a combination of low dose aspirin (81 mg) daily and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in prophylactic doses (e.g. dalteparin 5000 units S/C twice daily), staed as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. Aspirin can be initiated preconceptionaly and is usually discontinued at 36 weeks. LMWH is continued up to term and for 5 days postpaum. Women with previous history of thrombosis will usually already be on maintenance therapy with warfarin. In such cases as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, warfarin is changed to LMWH and aspirin. Although this treatment improves overall pregnancy success, these women remain at high risk for preterm labor, PROM. IUGR. preeclampsia and placental abruption. In question 10 Patient is presenting with recurrent aboions with isolated increase in APTT which leaves no doubt that lupus anticoagulant is the cause.",A

Mifepristone - misoprostol sequential oral administration is safe & effective method for termination of pregnancy up to what gestational age?,12 weeks,10 weeks,9 weeks,7 weeks,"Ans. D 7 weeks . (Ref. Text book of Obstetrics by DC Dutta 7th/pg. 174; KDT 6th/pg. 310) MIFEPRISTONE (RU 486) # It is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. # Single dose 600 mg or 25 mg bd for 4 days if amenorrhea is of > 48 hours. # Mifepristone (RU 486/progesterone receptor antagonist) is effective in inducing therapeutic abortion upto 63 days of gestation, but is most effective when used within 49 days of gestation. # It does not prevent fertilization, but by blocking action of progesterone on endomertium, causes sloughing and shedding of deciduas and brings about abortion. # However, emptying is incomplete and surgical evacuation is needed. # Adding PG (Misoprostol) on last day improves the rate of complete abortion Uses of Mifepristone (anti-progestin): A Postcoital contraceptive Mifepristone 600 mg given within 72 hrs of intercourse interferes with implantation and is highly effective method of emergency contraception. The menstrual cycle is however disturbed. B. Termination of pregnancy * Up to 7 weeks: 600 mg as single dose causes complete abortion in 60-85% cases. * To improve the success rate, current recommendation is to follow up 48 hrs later by a single 400 mg oral dose of misoprostol. This achieves > 90% success rate and is the accepted nonsurgical method of early first trimester abortion. * In place of oral Misoprostol, a 1 mg geneprost pessary can be inserted intravaginally. Mifepristone administered within 10 days of missed period results in an apparent late heavy period in upto 90% cases. * Anorexia, nausea, tiredness, abdominal discomfort, uterine crapms, loose motions are the side effects, apart from problems like prolonged bleeding and failed abortion in some cases. C. Cervical ripening 24-30 hrs before attempting surgical abortion or induction of labour, mifepristone 600 mg results in softening of cervix. D. Once a month contraceptive A single 200 mg dose of mifepristone given 2 days after the midcycle each month prevents conception on most occasions. E. Induction of labour By blocking the relaxant action of progesterone on uterus of late pregnancy, mifepristone can induce labour. It may be tried in cases with IUD and to deliver abnormal fetuses. F. Cushing's syndrome Mifepristone has palliative effect due to glucocorticoid receptor blocking property. May be used for inoperable cases.",D

HRT is useful in all except,Flushing,Osteoporosis,Vaginal atrophy,Coronary heart disease,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. Coronary artery disease HRT refers to the use of oestrogen treatment in order to reverse or prevent problems due to the loss of ovarian hormone secretion after the menopause, whether physiological or induced.The tissues sensitive to estrogen include brain, bone, skin cardiovascular and genitourinary tissues.Consequently the two aims of hormone replacement therapy are:To reduce the everyday symptoms of oestrogen loss; hot flushes, sleeplessness, lethargy, depression and vaginal dryness. All types of HRT (oestrogen with or without progesterone) are effective in reducing the hot flushes experienced by more than 50% of postmenopausal women.The benefit is most during the first year of treatment when 80% of women report a reduced likelihood of flushes.The other major use from HRT is the relief of vaginal dryness.Vaginal administration is the most effective route for treatment of dyspareunia and related symptoms.To prevent fracturesEstrogen prevents osteoporotic fracturesEffect of HRT on coronary artery diseaseUntil recently it was believed that beneficial effect of estrogen on lipids, decrease the risk of coronary artery disease in women on hormone replacement therapy.However two recent landmark clinical trials ""Heart and Estrogen progestin replacement study (HERS)"" and ""women health initiative (WHI)"" have radically altered the approach of HRT.* According to these trials, the benefits and harms of these therapy are:",D

Patient diagnosed as squamous cell intraepithelial lesion which of the following has the highest risk for progression to carcinoma :,Low grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia,High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia,Squamous intraepithelial associated with HPV 16,Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HIV,"Ans. is b i.e. High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia There are various nomenclatures / classification systems for repoing of Pap smear. The one which is classically used is by WHO, which uses the terms CIN-I, CIN-II and CIN-III (as discussed in chapter on CIN). Another system is devised Bethesda. It classifies cytological abnormalities of premalignant leisons into three categories : Atypical squmous cells of undetermined signifcance (ASCUS). Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance : The most common cytologic abnormality is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). which indicates cells that are suggestive of, but do not fulfill the criteria for, SIL. The risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-III approximates only 5% and cancer is found in only 1 to 2 per thousands instances. The evaluation of ASC-US should not be overly aggressive, paicularly in adolescents who are at low risk of cervical cancer. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2006a: Moscicki, 2005). There are three options for evaluation of ASC-US - HPV DNA testing. Colposcopy. or Repeat cytologies at 6 and 12 months, with referral to colposcopy if either of these is abnormal. Low-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion : This cytology result indicates the likely presence of HPV infection or low-grade neoplasia. Low-grade SIL encompasses the cytologic features of HPV infection and CIN-I and carries a 15 to 30 percent risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-Ill. Therefore, colposocpy is indicated for most. High-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion and Glandular Abnormalities : High grade SIL, should all be evaluated by prompt colposcopic evaluation. High-grade SIL cytology encompasses features of CIN-II and CIN-III and carries a high risk of underlying histologic CIN-II or CIN-Ill (at least 70%). or invasive cancer (1 to 2%). Alternative management of HSIL cytology in women age 21 years and older includes immediate diagnostic loop excision because colposcopy may miss a high-grade lesion and most HSIL cytologies evenatually result in excision for diagnosis or treatment.",B

Billing method is -,Maneuver for delivery of head of fetus,Method of contraception,Ethical guidelines for better doctor - patient relationship,Assessing KAP in society,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Method of contraception Natural methods of contraceptiono These methods are :A) Safe period (rhythm method)# This is also knwon as calendar method first described by Ogino. Its calculations are dependent on length of menstural cycle. The method is based on the fact that ovulation occurs from 12 to 16 days before the onset of mensturation.# Calculation is as followso The shortest cycle minus 18 days gives the first day of the fertile period.o The longest cycle minus 10 days gives the last day of fertile period.o For example, if a woman's menstural cycle varies from 26-31 days, the fertile period during which she should not have intercourse would be from the 8th day to 21st day of the menstural cycle, counting day one as the first day of the menstural period.B) Basal body temperature (BBT) method# It is based on the principle that there is rise BBT at or just before ovulation.C) Cervical mucus method (Billings method or ovulation method)# It is based on the observation that at the time of ovulation cervical mucus becomes watery clear resembling raw egg white, smooth, slippery and profuse.D) Symptothermic method# This method combines temperature, cervical mucus and safe period (calender method) methods.E) Abstinence# There is complete abstinence from sexual intercourse. It is not used and can hardly be considered as a method of contraception to be advocated to the masses.F) Coitus interruptus# It is the oldest method of voluntary fertility control. The male withdraws before ejaculation, and thereby tries to prevent deposition of semen into vagina. Failure rate is very high 25%",B

The lesion is nearly always bilateral. It sometimes appears as multiple burnt match head spots on the surface of the ovary and sometimes as the typical tarry cysts in a disorganised organ surrounded by dense adhesisions.”
Chocolate cysts of ovary:
• They are true cysts
• The cysts enlarge with cyclic bleeding. The serum gets absorbed in between periods and the content inside becomes chocolate, tarry brown in color.
• Histology
– Lining epithelium is columnar epithelium.
– Beneath the epithelium are large macrophages called as pseudoxanthoma cells which have brown cytoplasm due to ingested blood pigments like hemosiderin.
• Treatment of chocolate cyst/endometrioma.
Laparoscopic management is the preferred management
Before concluding lets rule out other options.
• Adenomyosis is associated with endometriosis but vice versa is not true; similarly fibroid uterus is associated with endometriosis but vice versa is not true (Ruling out options “b” and “c”).
• Multiple luteal cysts in the ovary are seen in case of

Endometrial Biopsy
• OPD procedure for hormonal evaluation in case of infertility / DUB/TB.
• Usually performed in pre–menstrual phase from the lateral wall of vagina.
• Interpretation:
Presence of secretory endometrium → Progesterone phase (cycles has been ovulatory)
Presence of proliferative endometrium → Estrogen phase (cycles has been anovulatory)
• Luteal phase defect can also be diagnosed by endometrial biopsy (which shows a lag of 2 – 3 days between calendar and histological dating of specimen. Note: For the diagnosis of luteal phase defect endometrial biopsy is done between day 24-26 of the menstrual cycle or 2 to 4 days before anticipated menstruation.

"A 28 yrs old lady, is suspected to have polycystic ovarian disease ,sample for testing LH and FSH are best taken on the following days of menstrual cycle",4-Jan,10-Aug,13-15,24-26,"In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries . These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3:1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.

The smallest anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet is called the?,Interspinous diameter,True conjugate,Obstetric conjugate,Diagonal conjugate,"The obstetric conjugate is the shoest distance between the promontory of the sacrum and the symphysis pubis. It generally measures 10.5 cm. Because the obstetric conjugate cannot be clinically measured, it is estimated by subtracting 1.5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is the distance from the lower margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory. The true conjugate is measured from the top of the symphysis to the sacral promontory. The interspinous diameter is the transverse measurement of the midplane and generally is the smallest diameter of the pelvis.

Maximum level of beta HCG is seen on which day of gestation?,6 weeks,9 weeks,28 weeks,36 weeks,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 9 weeks o Maximum levels of beta HCG occur on 66th day of pregnancy, i.e. 9 weeks 3 days.Human Chorionic Gonadotropino Produced almost exclusively in placenta, low levels in fetal kidneyo Molecular weight - 36000 - 40000 Da.o Highest carbohydrate content of any hormone - 30 percent.o It has a long half life - 36 hours as against only 2 hours of LH; as the carbohydrate component, and especially the terminal sialic acid, protects the molecule from catabolismo Alpha subunit of LH, FSH, TSH and HCG are structurally related to each other. Recombination of alpha and beta subunits of these four hormones gives a molecule with biological activity characteristic of the hormone from which the beta subunit was derivedo Principal form in plasma - Intact hCGo Principal form in urine - beta core fragment (terminal hCG degradation product).Functionsa) Maintainence of corpus luteum till 6 weeks of pregnancy.b) Stimulation of fetal testicular testosterone secretion which is maximum approximately when hCG levels peak. Thus at a critical time in male sexual differentiation, hCG enters fetal plasma from the syncytiotrophoblast. In the fetus, it acts as an LH surrogate to stimulate Leydig cell replication and testosterone synthesis to promote male sexual differentiation. Before approximately 110 days, there is no vascularization of the fetal anterior pituitary from the hypothalamus. Thus, pituitary LH secretion is minimal,and hCG acts as LH before this time. Thereafter as hCG levels fall, pituitary LH maintains modest testicular stimulation.c) Immunosuppressive activity, inhibits maternal processes of immunorejection of the fetus as a homograft.d) Stimulates maternal thyroid (thyrotropic action).e) Promotes relaxin secretion from corpus luteum.o Choriocarcinoma is associated with increased secretion of beta - hCG that is glycosylated to a greater degree, so called hyperglycosylated hCG, sometimes called invasive trophoblast antigen.",B

Cervical smear fixation is done by :,Ethyl alcohol,Acetone,Xyline,Formalin,"Ethyl alcohol Pap smear is the most effective method of screening for cervical cancer. Technique of preparing pap smear : A speculum is introduced in the vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayer's spatula. Whole of the squamocolumnar junction has to be scrapped i.e. rotate the spatula through 360deg and spread it on a slide (1s1 slide) and material is also collected from posterior wall of vagina (2"" slide) which acts as a control. The glass slide is not air rie as it gets damaged. The slide is fixed using ethyl alcohol. The main problem with conventional pap smears are that they are of variable thickness and may get obscured by mucus, blood and other debris. This results in cell and nuclear overlap, causing problems with detection and interpretation. To overcome this problem - Liquid based cytology has been developed. Liquid based cytology : Advantages ? They decrease the number of false negative results. They decrease the number of inadequate smear collection. Can also be used for HPV typing and testing. Method : From Gynaecology for PG and Practitioners 2/e, p 620 - A plastic sampling device is used to collect the cells in the usual manner but instead of smearing it on a glass slide, the device is rinsed in a buffered methanol solution for transfer to the laboratory.

Urinary bacterial count is < 105/m1 is insignificant in all except :,Pregnancy,Healthy ambulatory male,In a setting of antibiotics treatment,Mid stream clean catch sample.,"Ans. is c i.e. In a setting of antibiotic treatment The concept of significant bacteriuria is given by Kass. Significant bacteriuria refers to bacterial count more than 105/ml of urine Prerequisite for collection of urine for culture. Clean voided mid stream samples of urine are employed for culture. Normal urine is sterile but during voiding may become contaminated with genital commensals. Even under ideal conditions (urine collected by catheterisation), rate of urinary infection is 296. In men. it is sufficient, if mid stream urine is collected after the prepuce is retracted and the glans penis cleaned with wet cotton. In women, anogenital toilet is more impoant and should consist of careful cleaning with soap and water. Results : - When bacterial count are more than 1051mi of urine, it is called Significant bacteriuria. Counts of 104/ml of urine are due to contamination during voiding and are of no significance. - In a patient on antibiotic treatment with some bacteria like staph. aureus. even low counts i.e. < 105/m1 may be significant.",C

What should be the nest step in the management of this patient ?,Histopathology,Hysterectomy,Progesterone,OCP,"Ans. is a i.e. Histopathology A 45 years old lady is presenting with DUB Chances of endometrial hyperplasia / neoplasia are high. TVS findings show thickness of endometrium as 8 mm. First lets understand what does this signify -Endometrial thickness has been correlated with endometrial cancer risk in pe and post menopausal women. In postmenopausal females with : Atrophic endometrium Endometrial hyperplasia Endometrial cancer Endometrial thickness is 3.4 + 1.2 mm It is 9.7 + 2.5 mm It is 18.2 + 6.2 mm Sensitvities of 95 - 97% have been repoed using a measurement of < 4 mm for exclusion of endometrial cancer. Women with endometrial thickness > 5 mm warrant additional evaluation with saline infusion sonography (515), or hysteroscopy or endometrial biopsy. Also know : Diagnostic alongrithim to identify endometrial pathology in patient with abnormal uterine bleeding and with no risk factors for endometrial cancer. Figure : Diagnostic algorithm to identify endometrial pathology in paients with abnormal uterine bleeding D&C - dilatation & curettage; EMB=endometrial biopsy; SS = saline-infusion sonography; TVS = transyaginal sonography. 'Endometrium bilayer thickness measurements are used for posmenopausal women. bSIS or hysteroscopy per physician preference. Adequate diagnosis and clinical management should follow.

D&C = dilatation and curettage; EMB = endometrial biopsy; SIS = saline-infusion sonography; TVS = transvaginai sonography. 'TVS or EMB per physican preference. 'Endometrium bilayer > 5 mm (in postmenopausal women) or obvious pathology seen. 'SIS or hysteroscopy per physican preference. 'Adequate diagnosis and clinical management should follow. Extra Edge : Clear cut endometrial thickness giudelines have not been established for premenopausal females. It is generally seen that normal endometrial thickness in premenopausal women does not exceed 4 mm on day 4 of menstrual cycle and 8 mm by day 8. A persistent finding of endometrial thickness > 12 mm independant of cycle day should prompt fuher evaluation in these women, especially in those with risk factors for endometrial carcinoma. Summary of diagnostic procedures in case of DUB if endometrial neoplasia is suspected : - There is is no clear sequence to the use of endometrial biopsy, TVS, SIS and hysteroscopy when evaluating abnormal uterine bleeding. - TVS - as it is well tolerated, cost effective and requires minimal technical skill is the first logical step. It addition TVS can determine whether a lesion is diffuse or focal - If endometrial hyperplasia / neoplasia is suspected - then endometrial biopsy is done. If there is a focal leison - either hysteroscopy or SIS is done.",A

Red degeneration in uterine fibroid is most common in :,Second trimester,Third trimester,Puerperium,First trimester,"Ans. is a i.e. Second trimester Friends, answer to this question was quite obvious as each one of us have mugged it up; but finding an appropriate reference was a difficult task. Read for yourself whatDutta Obs. 6/e, p 309 has to say? ""Red Degeneration; It predominantly occurs in a large fibroid during the second half of pregnancy or puerperium."" From the above statement answer could be second trimester, third trimester or puerperium. ""Red degeneration; manifests typically about midpregnancy when the leiomyoma suddenly become acutely painful, enlarged and tender."" This clears the doubts and confirms our answer i.e Red degeneration is most common during second trimester (midpregnancy). Friends you should also keep in mind the following impoant points regarding - Fibroids and pregnancy. Effects of Fibroid on pregnancy : Infeility - Leiomyomas are a sole cause of infeility in less than 30/0 of cases.deg - It causes infeility by : Hindering the ascent of the spermatozoa by distoing the uterus and tubes. By disturbances in ovulation and By interfering with implantation of the feilized ovum. - Pregnancy rate following myomectomy = 40%deg Aboiondeg, Placental abruptiondeg and Premature labourdeg. Occurs when fibroid interferes with enlargement of uterus, initiates abnormal uterine contractions or prevents efficient placentation, Ma!positiondeg and Malpresentationdeg of Fetus : occur as fibroid can prevent engagement of head. Obstructed labour : It can be caused by cervicaldeg and broad ligament tumoursdeg which are fixed in the pelvis and by pedunculated subserous leiomyomas which become trapped in the pouch of Douglas. During labour - If fibroid is situated above the presenting pa - uneventful vaginal delivery. - If fibroid is situated below the presenting pa spontaneous vaginal delivery may occur; otherwise caesarean section is done. Thus chances of cesarean section are increased.deg Post Paum Hemorrhagedeg /Delayed Involutiondeg can occur if placenta is implanteddeg over the leiomyoma.

Most commonly performed type of tubal ligation in current practice:,Pomeroy's method,Irwing's operation,Yoon ring application,Madlener procedure,"Ans. a (Pomeroy's method). (Ref. Textbook of Gynecology by Shaw 13th ed. 236)TUBAL STERILIZATIONOperationa) Pomeroys technique: This technique involves grasping and elevating a 2-cm midsegment of tube, ligating the tubal loop with a 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then excising the distal portion of the loop,b) Parkland method: opening created in mesosalpinx and prox portion of tube is cut.c) Irving procedure: Begins similarly to the Parkland method. However, after the knot on the proximal tubal segment is secured, the ties are left longd) Uchida method : Tubal serosa is first separated from the muscularis by a subserosal injection of a dilute saline solution of epinephrine (1:100,000). A longitudinal incision is made in the ballooned serosa on its surface opposite the mesosalpinx. The serosal peritoneum then is grasped and dissected away from the underlying tubal muscularis. Following this dissection, a 5- cm midsegment of dissected fallopian tube is ligated proximally and distally with 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then resected. The raw serosal edges are reapproximated, burying the proximal cut tubal end within the leaves of the broad ligament and exteriorizing the distal end from the broad ligamentLaparoscopic# Tubal ligation and resection (removal) of a portion of the fallopian tube is the most frequent method of blocking the tubes.# This involves tying a segment of tube and removing it.# There are many variations of this technique.# The tubal ligation procedure described by Dr. Ralph Pomeroy a century ago is most commonly used today.Steps: With the Pomeroy method of tubal ligation, part of the tube is elevated to create a loop or knuckle. An absorbable ligature is tied around the base of the elevated segment, and the tubal segment is cut out.Within a few days, the peritoneum (tissue that lines the organs of the abdominal cavity) grows over and covers the cut ends of the tubal segments. The cut ends of the fallopian tube separate as the ligature dissolves. The peritoneal covering and separation of the remaining tubal segments prevent them from re-attaching to each other.The Pomeroy method of tubal ligation is good if tubal reversal surgery is to be considered later. Approximately two- thirds of women with a Pomeroy tubal ligation become pregnant following tubal ligation reversal.Laparoscopic tubal sterilization methods:# Unipolar coagulation (First method of LTD to achieve widespread use)# Bipolar coagulation (Least failure rate)# Silicone rubber bands (Yoon's clip)# Spring clips (Hulka's clip)# Filshie clipModified Pomeroy Method. Many modifications of the Pomeroy technique have been described. One technique creates an avascular window in the mesosalpinx at a midpoint along the tube. Through this window, suture similar to that used for the Pomeroy method is passed. The portion of tube that lies proximal to this window is ligated first. The long ends of this suture then are tied around the entire tubal loop, as in the Pomeroy method. The distal portion of the loop is excised.",A

"A woman with a known latex allergy seeking contraception, select the method that is medically contraindicated for that patient (SELECT 1 METHOD)",Oral contraceptives,IUD,Condoms,Laparoscopic tubal ligation,"Oral contraceptives are the contraceptive method of choice in the motivated, healthy, monogamous young woman. If the pill is properly used, the failure rate for users is the lowest among women using a reversible method of contraception. However, the use of oral contraceptives is contraindicated in patients with a history of thrombophlebitis. Both condoms and the diaphragm, used in conjunction with spermicides, are effective contraceptives that are also effective in preventing sexually transmitted diseases and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The diaphragm should carefully fit in the vagina and is therefore not applicable to women with anatomic distortion of the vagina. Latex condoms should not be used in women with a known latex allergy. IUDs are associated with increased risk of salpingitis and ectopic pregnancy, and therefore should be avoided in patients with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), multiple sexual partners, or ectopic conception. Although tubal ligation may be considered in the patient with chronic obstructive lung disease, the risk of general anesthesia and surgical intervention in this patient is probably high enough to indicate a more conservative approach, such as the use of an IUD.",C

How many weeks are required approximately for complete uterine involution during puerperium?,4,6,12,20,"Uterine involution is nearly complete by 6 weeks, at which time the organ weighs less than 100 g. Myometrial contractions, or afterpains, assist in involution. These contractions occur during the first 2-3 days of the puerperium and produce more discomfo in multiparas than in primiparas. Such pains are accentuated during nursing as a result of oxytocin release from the posterior pituitary. During the first 12 hours postpaum, uterine contractions are regular, strong, and coordinated. In case of abnormal uterine involution, infection and retained products of conception should be ruled out. Ref: Pessel C., Tsai M.C. (2013). Chapter 10. The Normal Puerperium. In A.H. DeCherney, L.

They cause bronchodilatation, vasodilatation and uterine relaxation, without producing significant cardiac stimulation. b2 selectivity is only relative. Salbutamol has b2:bj action ratio of about 10. They are primarily used in bronchial asthma. Other uses are:# As uterine relaxant to delay premature labour. Ritodrine is the preferred drug;# In hyperkalemic familial periodic paralysis - benefit by enhancing K+ uptake into muscles a lowering plasma K+ levels.The most important side effect is muscle tremor; tachycardia and arrhythmias are less likely.THERAPEUTIC CLASSIFICATION OF ADRENERGIC DRUGSI.Pressor agentsNoradrenalineMethoxaminePhenylephrineDopamineeEphedrineMephentermineII.Cardiac stimulantsAdrenalineeDobutamineeIsoprenalineeIII.BronchodilatorsAdrenalineSalmeterolTerbutalineSalbutamoleIsoprenalineFormoterolIV.Nasal decongestantsPhenylephrineePseudoephedrineNaphazolineOxymetazolineXylometazolinePhenylpropanolamineV.CNS stimulantsAmphetamineMethamphetamineDexamphetamineVI.AnorecticsFenfluramineSibutramineDexfenfluramineVII.Uterine relaxant and vasodilatorsRitodrineSalbutamol IsoxsuprineeTerbutalineeTocolytic drugsSr. no.Tocolytic AgentsComments1Isosuprine (DUVADILAN)It is an orally effective long acting selective b receptor stimulant, which has direct smooth muscle relaxant property as well. It has been used as uterine relaxant for threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is poor.Side effects: nausea, tachycardia, flushing, dizziness, and tremor. Isoxsuprine has been used in threatened abortion and dysmenorrhoea, but efficacy is doubtful.2Ritodrine (Selective b2 stimulants)infused i.v. have been successfully used to postpone labour but maternal morbidity and mortality may be increased due to their cardiac and metabolic actions and incidents of pulmonary edema.3Atosiban & nifedipineAlthough atosiban and nifedipine seem equally effective in delaying preterm labour, there is increasing concern in twin pregnancies about the adverse CVS effects of nifedipine. Nifedipine should not be used in multiple pregnancies due to fear of pul edema. However, atosiban, which is principally an AVP receptor antagonists is oxytocin receptor antagonist, used for the treatment of preterm labour.4Magnesium sulphateAlso acts as a tocolytic agent. With the withdrawal of sympathomimetic drugs and the failure of atosiban, an oxytocinantagonist, to obtain FDA approval, magnesium sulphate is therefore in commonly used tocolytic drug.Educational points:# Tolterodine is being developed as a vasicoselective antimuscarinic.# Tiotropiumbromide Congener of ipratropium bromide, which binds very tightly to bronchial M1/M3 muscarinic receptors producing long lasting bronchodilatation. Binding to M2 receptors is less tight confering relative M1/M3 selectivity. Like ipratropium, it is not absorbed from respiratory and g. i. mucosa and has exhibited high bronchial selectivity of action.",B

Organism causing cervical carcinoma is?,HPV,HAV,HBV,HCV,"ANSWER: (A) HPVREF: Shaw 15th ed page 400Aetiology, epidemiology and predisposing risk factors of cervical cancer:Average age 35-45 years. Precancerous lesions occur 10-15 years earlier (Figure 29.8).Coitus before the age of 18 years.Multiple sexual partners.Delivery of the first baby before the age of 20 years.Multiparity with poor birth spacing between pregnancies.Poor personal hygiene.Poor socioeconomic status.At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised partners was considered an important factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst the Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives.Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13 fold).Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection (16, 18, 31, 33) or condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is nowr considered the most important cause. Most HPV infection 16,18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases.Immunosuppressed individuals (following transplant surgery).Women with preinvasive lesions.Women wTho do not come for regular health check-up and Pap tests.COC and progestogens use over 8-year period can cause adenocarcinoma of the endocervix (double the risk).Five per cent women exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero developed carcinoma of vagina and cervix.

Vulval carcinoma metastasizes to which lymph group :,Para aoic nodes,Superficial inguinal nodes,Internal iliac nodes,External iliac nodes,"Ans. is b i.e. Superficial inguinal lymph nodes Vulvar cancer spreads by the following routes : Direct extension, to involve adjacent structures such as the vagina, urethra, and anus Hematogenous spread to distant sites, including the lungs, liver, and bone Lymphatic embolization : At first the superficial inguinal nodes are involved through lymphatic emboli, but later lymphatic channel permeation is seen. The malignancy spreads to deep nodes. and gland of Cloquet to the external iliac glands, obturator and common iliac nodes, in the late stages. Thus inguinal, femoral and pelvic lymph nodes are involved in vulvar cancer. But most impoant amongst these are inguinal-femoral nodes.

These findings confirm the diagnosis of placenta pre (In abruptio-bleeding is accompanied by pain, uterus is tense, tender and rigid). The gestational age of patient is 39 weeks i.e., fetal maturity is attained and pregnancy has to be terminated either vaginally or by cesarean section. Before termination of pregnancy, vaginal examination should be done in OT (keeping everything ready for cesarean section) to know : -- The degree of placenta pre To assess whether vaginal delivery is possible or not. Remember Vaginal examination should not be done outside the operation theatre as it can provoke fuher separation of placenta with torrential bleeding which may be fatal.

"A 19-year-old patient presents to your office with primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast and pubic hair development, but the uterus and vagina are absent. Diagnostic possibility includes:",Testicular feminization syndrome,Gonadal dysgenesis,Mullerian agenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Mullerian agenesis * Since this patient has other signs of pubertal development that are sex steroid- dependent, we can conclude that some ovarian function is present. This excludes conditions such as gonadal dysgenesis and hypothalamic pituitary failure as possible causes of her primary amenorrhea. Mullerian defects are the only plausible cause, and the diagnostic evaluation in this patient would be directed toward both confirmation of this diagnosis and establishment of the exact nature of the Mullerian defect. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky- Kuster-Hauser syndrome, presents as amenorrhea with absence of a vagina. The incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 female births. The karyotype is 46 XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, and external genitalia. There are associated urinary tract (33%) and skeletal (12%) anomalies.* Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46 X Y. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased/absent.* Patients with gonadal dysgenesis present with lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have a karyotype of 47 XXY and a male phenotype.Note: In patients of Mullerian agenesis (RMKH syndrome) ovary is present and it functions normally",C

If there is a delay of more than 30 minutes, interference should be done..

But there are some conditions in which urgent delivery of the second baby is required – Indications of urgent delivery of the second baby: (1) Severe (intrapartum) vaginal bleeding (2) Cord prolapse of the second baby (3) Inadvertent use of intravenous ergometrine with the delivery of the anterior shoulder of the first baby (4) First baby delivered under general anesthesia (5) Appearance of fetal distress.
Management: In all these conditions, the baby should be delivered quickly. A rational scheme is given below which depends on the lie, presentation and station of the head.

Head

–– If low down, delivery by forceps
–– If high up, delivery by internal version under general anesthesia.

Breech should be delivered by breech extraction
Transverse lie—internal podatic version followed by breech extraction under general anesthesia.

If, however, the patient bleeds heavily following the birth of the first baby, immediate low rupture of the membranes usually succeeds in controlling the blood loss.
Remember:
The only indication for internal podatic version these days is:

Thus, the benefits of birth control pills must be weighed carefully against the added risks in patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or liver disease. The pill modestly increases HDL cholesterol levels, but should have no direct effect on hemoglobin concentration. In fact, since bleeding volume is generally diminished in birth control pill users, hemoglobin concentration often increases in these patients.",A

Indicators of impending uterine rupture durine labour include all of the following except :,Fetal distress,Hematuria,Fresh bleeding per vaginum,Passage of meconium,"Ans. is d i.e. Passage of meconium Features of Rupture uterus Impending rupture : Abdominal pain Slight vaginal bleeding Fetal distress as evidenced by abnormal FHR, bradycardia and variable and late declerations. Tenderness in uterine palpation Complete rupture : Sense of something giving away Collapse, shock, dehydration Absent FHS Palpation of superficial pas Shoening of cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic of uterine rupture. So it is clear that fetal distress and vaginal bleeding may be seen in impending uterine rupture. Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium ""There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs hpfnre labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive"" ...COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus. hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture. it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment. Most common sign of uterine rupture is non reassuring FHR pattern with variable hea rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations.

Fewer than 5% of all ovarian tumours are germ cell in origin. They include : - Teratonia - Dysgerminoma - Endodermal sinus tumour (yolk sac tumour) - Embryonal carcinoma The unique characteristics of germ cell tumours are : - They generally occur in younger women - They display an unusual aggressive natural history and are commonly cured with less extensive nonsterlizing surgery and chemotherapy. The germ cell neoplasmas can be divided into three groups. (i) Benign tumour (usually dermoid cyst) (ii) Malignant tumours that arise from dermoid cyst (iii) Primitive malignant germ cell tumours including dysgerminoma, yolk sac tumours, immature teratomas embryonal carcinoma choriocarcinoma. Clinical features of malignant germ cell tumours - Malignant germ cell tumours are usually large - Bilateral disease is rare, except in dysgerminoma (10-15% are bilateral) - Abdominal or pelvic pain in young women is the usual presenting symptom. - Serum human chorionic gonadotropicin ((3-hCG) and a fetoprotein levels are useful in diagnosis and management. - Most of the malignant germ cell tumours are managed with chemotherapy after surgery. - Dysgerminoma is the ovarian counterpa of testicular carcinoma.

Hormone responsible for decidual reaction and Arias stella reaction in ectopic pregnancy is :,Oestrogen,Progesterone,HCG,HPL,"Arias stella reaction

Arias stella reaction is characterized by adenomatous change of the endometrial glands.
Cells loose their polarity, have hyperchromatic nucleus, vacuolated cytoplasm and occasional mitosis.
The reaction is seen in ectopic pregnancy (in 10 – 15% cases) and indicates blightening of conceptus be it intrauterine or extrauterine. (therfore it is not specific for ectopic pregnancy)
It occurs under the influence of progesterone.

Decidual reaction :

Decidua is the specialised highly modified endometrium of pregnancy.
Decidual reaction/decidualisation is the conversion of secretory endometrium into decidua and is dependant on estrogen and progesterone.
Decidual reaction is completed only with blastocyst implantation.

So, hormone which is common to both Arias stella reaction and decidual reaction is progesterone which is our answer of choice.",B

"A 17 year old girl in the 4th month of pregnancy presents with vaginal bleeding, accompanied by passage of grapelike tissue fragments. Plasma human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is very high.Following ultrasound evaluation, dilatation and curettage is performed. Histologic examination shows diffuse trophoblastic proliferation and edema in all chorionic villi. Cytogenetic studies demonstrate 46, XY karyotype. Clinical studies show that this condition progresses to choriocarcinoma at a rate of?",0.20%,2%,20%,50%,"The condition described is a complete hydatidiform mole. Hydatidiform mole is a spectrum of conditions due to abnormal proliferation of trophoblast and ranging from entirely benign conditions (complete and paial mole) to very aggressive neoplasms (choriocarcinoma). Paial moles have a triploid karyotype (69,XXY) and derive from feilization of an ovum with one or two sperm; fetal pas are frequently seen. Complete moles have a diploid karyotype (46,XX or 46,XY) and derive from feilization of an empty ovum by a single sperm (androgenesis); no fetal pas are found. Ten percent of moles acquire a more aggressive behavior and invade deeper pas of the myometrium, degenerating into invasive moles. Two percent of complete moles may transform into choriocarcinoma, a very aggressive neoplasm that spreads rapidly through the bloodstream. Founately, choriocarcinomas of placental origin are highly responsive to chemotherapy, affording up to 100% cure or remission. Nongestational choriocarcinoma, in contrast, is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Remember the following impoant points: Complete mole, usually diploid karyotype: results from androgenesis (sperm feilization of an empty egg), no fetal pas are identified, 2% progress to choriocarcinoma. Paial mole, usually triploid karyotype: results from feilization of normal egg by one or two sperm; fetal pas are often identified; rarely progresses to choriocarcinoma.

A 58-year-old postmenopausal woman on estrogen replacement complains of recent onset of spotting. A bimanual pelvic examination is unremarkable. Most likely diagnosis?,Cervical carcinoma,Cervical polyp,Dysfunctional uterine bleeding,Endometrial hyperplasia,"Any postmenopausal woman who has been on unopposed estrogen and who is now experiencing vaginal bleeding is suspect for either endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia is the end result of prolonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrial mucosa. Morphologic forms of hyperplasia include cystic, adenomatous, and atypical hyperplasia. In cystic hyperplasia (simple hyperplasia), there are large, dilated glands lined by actively mitosing epithelial cells. Adenomatous hyperplasia refers to branching of the glands with papillary infolding or outpouchings (sometimes referred to as complex hyperplasia). Atypical hyperplasia has more glandular crowding and nuclear atypia than the latter condition and has the highest risk for progressing into carcinoma in situ and endometrial carcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma is the most common invasive cancer of the female genital tract. As with endometrial hyperplasia, the risk factors for endometrial cancer primarily relate to hyperestrinism and include obesity, nulliparity, diabetes, hypeension, infeility, breast cancer, low fiber/high fat diet, early menarche or late menopause, and tamoxifen. The most common clinical presentation is vaginal bleeding (90%) in a postmenopausal woman.",D

A 6-week pregnant lady is diagnosed with sputum positive TB. Best management is -,Wait for 2nd trimester to start ATT,Start Category I ATT in first trimester,Start Category II ATT in first trimester,Start Category III ATT in second trimester,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Start Category I ATT in first trimester * Tuberculosis during pregnancy should be diagnosed promptly and as early as possible. Late diagnosis and care is associated with 4-fold increase in obstetric morbidity and 9-fold increase in preterm labor.* Poor nutritional states, hypoproteinemia, anemia and associated medical conditions add to maternal morbidity and mortality.* True congenital TB is believed to be rare. A fetus can get TB infection either by hematogenous spread through umbilical vein or by ingestion or aspiration of infected amniotic fluid. The risk to neonate of getting TB infection shortly after birth is greater.* ATT should be started as soon as possible, as untreated disease is a hazard to the mother and fetus.* The regimens recommended for use in pregnancy are same as for the nonpregnant state except for withholding of streptomycin. Currently, an intermittent regimen (thrice weekly on alternate days) under the DOTS strategyof RNTCP is being increasingly used worldwide for pregnant women having TB.* None of the AKT drugs are teratogenic and AKT should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made.

C: Hypoplasia of Placental Tissue Several hypotheses regarding the pathophysiologic events that lead to fetal hydrops have been suggested. The basic mechanism for the formation of fetal hydrops is an imbalance of interstitial fluid production and the lymphatic return. The fetus is paicularly susceptible to interstitial fluid accumulation because of its greater capillary permeability, compliant interstitial compaments, and vulnerability to venous pressure on lymphatic return. In Rh hemolytic disease, there is excessive destruction of RBC's leading to anemia, tissue anoxemia and metabolic acidosis. There is hyperplasia of placental tissue in an effo to increase the transfer of oxygen. As a result of anoxemai there is damage to liver resulting in hypoproteinemia.

To test for her ovarian reserve, the following is measured:",LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"The concept of ovarian reserve represents the remaining follicular pool of the ovaries. As ovarian reserve decreases, the ovaries' responsiveness to gonadotropins decreases, necessitating higher amounts of FSH to achieve follicular growth and maturation. In women over age 35, evaluation of ovarian reserve should be assessed. A markedly elevated FSH (>15-20 international units/L) on day 3 of the menstrual cycle suggests inadequate ovarian reserve.

The tissues sensitive to estrogen include brain, bone, skin cardiovascular and genitourinary tissues. Consequently the two aims of hormone replacement therapy are: (i) To reduce time everyday symptoms of oestrogen loss ; hot flushes, sleeplessness, lethargy, depression and vaginal dryness. All types of H (oestrogen with or without progesterone) are effective in reducing the hot flushes experienced by more than 50% of postmenopausal women. The benefit is most during the first year of treatment when 80% of women repo a reduced likelihood of flushes. The other major use from H is the relief of vaginal dryness. Vaginal administration is the most effective route for treatment of dyspareunia and related symptoms.

In order to rule out an intestinal obstruction, an upright or lateral decubitus abdominal x-ray should be done to identify the presence of distended loops of bowel and air-fluid levels, which confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of bowel rest, intravenous hydration, and nasogastric suction; patients who do not respond to conservative therapy may require surgery. Bowel stimulants such as laxatives or enemas should not be administered. Pregnant women are predisposed to constipation secondary to decreased bowel motility induced by elevated levels of progesterone. The symptoms of nausea and emesis in this patient and the presence of a low-grade fever prompt further workup because her presentation is not consistent with uncomplicated constipation. In pregnancy, constipation can be treated with hydration, increased fiber in the diet, and the use of stool softeners. The patient's sudden onset of emesis and abdominal pain is not consistent with the normal presentation of hyperemesis gravidarum. Hyperemesis typically has an onset in the early part of the first trimester and usually resolves by 16 weeks. It is characterized by intractable vomiting causing severe weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. The ingestion of spicy foods during pregnancy can cause or exacerbate gastric reflux or ""heartburn"" but would not cause the severity of the symptoms described in this patient's presentation. Dyspepsia during pregnancy can be treated with antacids. The patient with gastric reflux in pregnancy should also be counseled to eat smaller, more frequent meals and bland food.",D
A 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation experienced faintness and nausea in lying down and recovers after turning on her side or getting up. These symptoms can be attributed to which of the following,Reduced placental flow,Increased intragastric pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Inferior vena caval compression,"Ans. d. Inferior vena caval compression Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression. ""Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs offetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension) During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position.Q This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to hea is seriously cuailed.Q This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.Q Turning patient to lateral position quickly restores the normal blood pressureQ. Can cause severe fetal distressQ The augmentation of venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labourQ.",D

In placenta pre conservative treatment is not done in case of :,Active labour,Anencephaly,Dead baby and Severe placenta pre both,All of these,"Ans. is a, b and c i.e. Active labour; Anencephaly; Dead baby; and Severe placenta pre Well friends, there is no need to ""rattoo"" the conditions where expectant management is required and where active management. For a while - forget all the lists and just think you are a gynae casualty medical officer and a pregnant female with vaginal bleeding in the late months of pregnancy comes to you (suspected case of placenta pre). How will you manage if : a. She is in active labour Obviously you will either do cesarean section or if bleeding is not much and no other adverse circumstances are present, proceed with vaginal delivery but you will never think of arresting her labour and managing conservatively b. If the patient is diagnosed of carrying anencephalic fetus. The aim of conservative management is to continue pregnancy for attaining fetal maturity without compromising the maternal health. But in this case when fetus is anencephalic there is no point in continuing pregnancy i.e active management / termination should be done. c. If fetus is dead Same is the case with dead fetus, there is no point in continuing pregnancy i.e. active management should be done d. Severe placenta pre Remember always A gynaecologists first aim should be to save the life of mother. If fetus can be saved nothing like it, but in order to save the fetus, mother's life should not be put at risk. So, in this case expectant management (conservative management) should not be done. Immediate termination of pregnancy by cesarean section is the correct management. e. Premature fetus If maternal condition is good. and fetus is premature. patient can be kept under observation. Betamethasone (to hasten fetal lung maturity) and blood transfusion (to raise mother's hernatocrit), shoud be given i.e in this case conservative management can be done. If fetus is dead",D

The chromosomal complement in persons with Klinefelter's syndrome is: March 2011,"45, XO","47, XXX","46, XY","47, XXY","Ans. D: 47, XXY Genetic analysis reveals the karyotype of klinefelter's syndrome to be 47 XXY Klinefelter syndrome/ 46 or 47, XXY/ XXY syndrome It is a condition with an extra X chromosome. Because of the extra chromosome, individuals with the condition are usually referred to as ""XXY Males"", or ""47, XXY Males"" Klinefelter syndrome is the most common sex chromosome disorder in males and the second most common condition caused by the presence of extra chromosomes. The condition exists in roughly 1 out of every 500-650 males but many of these people may not show symptoms. Principal effects include hypogonadism and reduced feility. Turner syndrome/Ullrich-Turner syndrome/Gonadal dysgenesis It encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common. It is a chromosomal abnormality in which all or pa of one of the sex chromosomes is absent (unaffected humans have 46 chromosomes, of which two are sex chromosomes). Normal females have two X chromosomes, but in Turner syndrome, one of those sex chromosomes is missing or has other abnormalities. In some cases, the chromosome is missing in some cells but not others, a condition referred to as mosaicism or 'Turner mosaicism'. Occurring in 1 in 2000 -1 in 5000 phenotypic females. There are characteristic physical abnormalities, such as Sho stature, Broad chest, - Low hairline, - Low-set ears, and - Webbed necks. Girls with Turner syndrome typically experience gonadal dysfunction (non-working ovaries), which results in amenorrhea (absence of menstrual cycle) and sterility. Concurrent health concerns are also frequently present, including congenital hea disease, hypothyroidism, diabetes, vision problems, hearing concerns, and many autoimmune diseases. Finally, a specific pattern of cognitive deficits is often observed, with paicular difficulties in visuospatial, mathematical, and memory areas Down syndrome/trisomy 21 Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of an extra copy of genetic material on the 21st chromosome, either in whole (trisomy 21) or pa (such as due to translocations). The incidence of Down syndrome is estimated at 1 per 733 bihs It is statistically more common with older parents due to increased mutagenic exposures upon some older parents' reproductive cells. Down syndrome is associated with some impairment of cognitive ability and physical growth, and a paicular set of facial characteristics. Individuals with Down syndrome tend to have a lower-than-average cognitive ability, often ranging from mild to moderate disabilities. The average IQ of children with Down syndrome is around 50, compared to normal children with an IQ of 100. A small number have a severe to high degree of intellectual disability Individuals with Down syndrome may have some or all of the following physical characteristics: - Microgenia (an abnormally small chin), - An unusually round face, macroglossia (protruding or oversized tongue), - An almond shape to the eyes caused by an epicanthic fold of the eyelid, Upslanting palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids), Shoer limbs, - A single transverse palmar crease (a single instead of a double crease across one or both palms), - Poor muscle tone, and - A larger than normal space between the big and second toes. Health concerns for individuals with Down syndrome include a higher risk for congenital hea defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear infections that may lead to hearing loss, obstructive sleep apnea, thyroid dysfunctions, and obesity.",D
During pregnancy HIV transmission occurs mostly during,1st trimester,2nd trimester,3rd trimester,During labour,"Ans. is 'd' i.e. during labour HIV can be transmitted from an infected mother to the fetus during pregnancy, during delivery or by breastfeeding.HIV can be transmitted to the fetus as early as the first and second trimester of pregnancy.The transmission during birth (intrapartum) and the immediate period thereafter (peripartum) is considered to be the most common.In the absence of prophylactic antiretroviral therapy of the mother during pregnancy, labor and delivery and to the fetus following birth, the probability of transmission of HIV from mother to infant ranges from 15-25% in industrialized countries and 25-35% in developing countries.Higher risk of transmission is associated with high maternal viral load.Low CD4 count is also considered a risk factor.A prolonged interval between membrane rupture and delivery is another well documented risk factor for transmission.Other conditions that are potential risk factors but which have not been consistently demonstrated are:Presence of chorioamnionitis at deliverySTD's during pregnancyHard drug use during pregnancyCigarette smokingPreterm deliveryObstetrics procedures such as amniocentesis, amnioscopy fetal scalp electrodes, episiotomy.There is significant decrease in the risk of HIV transmission with elective cesarean.LSCS reduces the risk because during this procedure, the intrapartum period which accounts for significant proportion of transmission is by passed.",D
"A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 35 weeks gestation is in the obstetrical (OB) triage area with spontaneous rupture of membranes. The fetal hea rate baseline is 150 bpm with normal variability. There are accelerations seen, and numerous late decelerations noted. In an effo to improve oxygenation to the fetus, which of the following maneuvers would most likely help in this circumstance",Supine position,Epidural anesthesia,Stop the oxytocin,Morphine sulfate,"The supine position causes uterine compression on the vena cava, which decreases the venous return of blood to the hea, leading to supine hypotension. One impoant maneuver when encountering fetal hea rate abnormalities is a positional change, such as the lateral decubitus position. Oxytocin and epidural anesthesia both can decrease oxygen delivery to the placental bed. Oxytocin may hyperstimulate the uterus and cause frequent contractions; this then results in frequent vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels which decreases the amount of blood arriving to the placenta and fetus over time. Thus, stopping the oxytocin may help improve oxygenation. An epidural can cause hypotension in the mother which may then lead to fetal bradycardia by also decreasing the amount of blood profusing the fetus per given time. Morphine sulfate can cause respiratory depression in the fetus, so it would not be a method of choice for increasing delivery of oxygen to the fetus.",C

True about H mole:a) Always associated with raised uterine size for gestational ageb) Raised hCGc) Hysterectomy in selected casesd) Chemotherapy is the treatment of choicee) Thyrotoxicosis rare,ab,bc,bce,ace,"Lets have a look at each option separately -
Option ‘a’: Always asociated with raised uterine size for gestational age.
This statement is incorrect as :
“The size of the uterus is more than that expected for the period of amenorrhea in 70%, corresponds with the period of amenorrhea in 20% and smaller than the period of amenorrhea in 10%.”
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 193
Option ‘b’: Raised hCG - H. mole is characterised by raised levels of hCG (levels > 105 MIU/ml)
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 193
Option ‘c’: Hysterectomy in selected cases :
Management of H.mole :

TOC in H. mole – Suction evacuation followed by gentle but thorough currettage.
Hysterectomy – It is indicated only in case of :

                                  – Female has completed her family

Hysterotomy – Indicated in cases complicated by haemorrhage.

So, option ‘c’ i.e. hysterectomy is done in selected cases is correct whereas option ‘d’ i.e. chemotherapy is the TOC is incorrect.
Option ‘e’:
As far as thyrotoxicosis is concerned :
It is seen in only 2% cases of H.mole. It is rare (so, option ‘e’ is correct).
“Clinically apparent thyrotoxicosis is unusual.”

Cause of vaginal bleeding in an ectopic pregnancy is shedding of the endometrium. This endometrium is known as:,Decidua vera,Decidua basalis,Decidua capsularis,Decidua rubra,"Decidua directly beneath blastocyst implantation becomes the deciduas basalis. The decidua capsularis overlies the enlarging blastocyst and initially separates the conceptus from the rest of the uterine cavity. The remainder of the uterus is lined by deciduas parietalis. By 14 to 16 weeks' gestation, the expanding sac has enlarged to completely fill the uterine cavity. The resulting apposition of the decidua capsularis and parietalis creates the decidua vera, and the uterine cavity is functionally obliterated.",B

Milk ejection is due to which hormone -,Oxytocin,Progesterone,Estrogen,Prolactin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Oxytocin Physiology of Lactation* 500-800 ml of milk is produced by a healthy mother per day which requires 700 kcal/day.* Physiological basis consists of 4 phases:1. Mammogenesis : Growth of both ductal and lobuloalveolar systems occurs in pregnancy2. Lactogenesis : Colostrum secretion is noted during pregnancy and immediately post delivery. Milk secretion starts around the third postpartum day. Despite high prolactin levels in pregnancy, milk is not secreted as the high levels of estrogen and progesterone make the breast tissue unresponsive. With withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone levels post delivery, prolactin acts on the breast tissue. Growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin also increase secretory activity.3. Galactokinesis: Milk is discharged due to the infant's suckling efforts and also a contractile mechanism which expresses milk from the alveoli into the ducts. Oxytocin is a major galactokinetic hormone.# Milk ejection reflex: Reflex by which milk is forced down into the ampulla of the lactiferous duct, where it can be sucked out by the baby.4. Galactopoeisis : The most important hormone is prolactin. Suckling is essential for effective and continuous lactation. Periodic feeding is essential to relieve the pressure which then maintains the secretion.",A

""After molar evacuation, patients should be monitored with weekly determinations of 0-subunit HCG levels until these levels are normal for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by monthly determinations until the levels are normal for 6 consecutive months. The average time to achieve the first normal HCG level after evacuation is about 9 weeks. At the completion of follow-up, pregnancy may be undeaken. After a patient achieves a nondetectable HCG level, the risk of developing tumour relapse is very low and may approach zero."" Besides Serum Beta HCG at follow up following investigations are done : Pelvic examination -- To rule out any vulval and vaginal metastasis. -- To see the size of the uterus. -- To note the presence of any ovarian cysts and their sizes. It should be repeated every four weeks in the observation period. unest X-ray To detect lung metastasis Repeated at four weeks till spontaneous remission occurs and then at 3 months interval in the observation period. Pelvic Ultrasound : To detect any residual or locally invasive tumour and presence of ovarian cysts. Also Know : Patients are encouraged to use effective contraception during the entire interval of HCG follow up (i.e. atleast for 1 year). Choice of contraception : IUCD : should not be used because of the potential risk of uterine perforation and IUCDs cause irregular uterine bleeding which can be confused with persistent trophoblastic disease. Progestin pills : cause irregular bleeding therefore should not be used. OCP's : Earlier it was believed that OCP's should not be used till HCG values return to normal. But now it is said - ""OCP's may be used safely after molar evacuation during the entire interval of hormonal follow up"". ""Oral contraceptives are found to be superior to Barrier method or use of IUCD in decreasing the risk of developing gestational trophoblastic neoplasia"".

Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy,Transvaginal USG,Culdocentesis,MRI,Serial monitoring of (-HCG,"Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

As a consequence warfarin is contraindicated in the first 6-12 weeks of pregnancy. Warfarin can be administered after this period. But they also add that - Warfarin should be replaced by heparin before the anticipated date of delivery as :? - Warfarin produces anticoagulant effect in the fetus that can cause bleeding.

Treatment of the lutein cyst in hydatiform mole is:,Ovarian cystectomy,Ovariectomy,Suction evacuation,Ovariotomy,"Management of theca lutein cysts:
Theca lutein cysts are seen in H. mole due to high circulating levels of hCG.
As such they donot need any separate treatment. Suction evacuation of H. mole results in diminishing hCG titre, which leads to spontaneous regression of theca lutein cysts.
“Because theca lutein cysts regress following suction evacuation, expectant management is preferred”.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is most useful for which of the following gynecological malignancies:,Carcinoma endometrium,Carcinoma cervix,Carcinoma vulva,Carcinoma vagina,"Ans. C. Carcinoma vulvaVulvar carcinoma is the most promising site for sentinel lymph node biopsy strategy. Studies suggest that a sentinel node can be identified in most patients. Sentinel node is always located in the groin making vulva an ideal site for sentinel node biopsy'. 'The detection of SLN is currently a standard component of the surgical treatment of malignant melanoma, breast cancer and is a promising staging technique for patients with vulvar cancer. In cervical cancer SLN mapping is more recent and preliminary studies indicate that it may be a feasible technique' - 'Trends in Cervical Cancer' by Varaj Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) Biopsy for Gynaecological Malignanciesa. The sentinel lymph node is defined as the first draining lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from the tumor site. A negative sentinel lymph node would thus predict the absence of lymph node metastasis in the entire draining basin.b. Sentinel lymph node evaluation in female genital tract cancers is relatively new and a number of promising studies are under evaluation.c. The concept has shown most promising results in vulvar cancer followed by cervical cancer.d. (SLN is however not yet accepted as a standard procedure for either of these). For endometrial cancer the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been studied by small studies and requires further larger studies.

Lactiferous duct of breast contraction is due to:,Progesterone,Estrogen,Oxytocin,Prolactin,"Ans. C. Oxytocin* Oxytocin primarily results in stimulation of two specific types of muscular contraction:* Uterine muscular contraction during parturition* Breast lactiferous duct myoepithelial contraction during milk let down reflex.A Brief on Breast Functional Anatomy* The areola is central, pigmented portion of breast with a diameter of about 2.5cm.* Accessory glands located around the periphery of the areola are Montgomery glands (they can secrete milk).* The nipple accommodates about 15-20 lactiferous ducts and their openings.* Each milk duct (lactiferous duct) dilates to form lactiferous sinus at about 5-10mm away from its opening in the nipple. Lactiferous sinus acts as reservoir of milk.* The lining epithelium of the duct near the opening is stratified squamous. Each alveolus is lined by columnar epithelium where milk secretion occurs.* Myoepithelial cells are the network of branching longitudinal striated cells which surround the alveoli and the smaller ducts. There is a dense network of capillaries surrounding the alveoli. These are situated between the basement membrane and epithelial lining.* Contraction of these cells (in response to oxytocin) squeezes the alveoli and ejects the milk into the larger duct",C

Which is associated with Ted risk of Thromboembolism in a normal pregnancy :,|ed progesterone level,|ed production of clotting factors by liver,Change in blood viscosity,|ed antithrombin III,"Ans. is b i.e. |ed production of clotting factors by liver Pulmonary thromboembolism is a rare complication of pregnancy but is a significant cause of maternal morbidity and moality. All of us have studied in surgery - Virchow's Traid i.e. factors associated with thromboembolism viz : Endothelial injury Stasis Increased coagulobility. All the elements of Virchow's triad are present during pregnancy viz : i. Endothelial injury ? It may occur during traumatic vaginal delivery or cesarean section. ii. Stasis ? Pregnancy is associated with venous stasis, especially in lower extremities because the enlarging uterus reduces blood return to the inferior vena cava by direct mechanical effect. Hormonal factors also contribute to venodilatation and stasis during pregnancy. Stasis secondary to prolonged bed rest for medical or obstetrical complications also predispose a pregnant woman to increased venous stasis and formation of vascular thrombi. iii. Increased coagulability ? The maternal circulation becomes hypercoagulable as production of clotting factors like fibrinogen and factors VII. VIII, IX and X increase during pregnancy These changes are also associated with decreased fibrinolytic activity. Remember : * Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state. Levels of fibrinogen are increased in pregnancy. All factors except XI and XIII increase during pregnancy ESR T's during pregnancy. Fibrinolytic activity during pregnancy.

Classification Most endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas Endometrial carcinomas can be classified into two pathogenetic groups: Type I: These cancers occur most commonly in pre- and peri-menopausal women, often with a history of unopposed estrogen exposure and/or endometrial hyperplasia. They are often minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall, are of the low-grade endometrioid type, and carry a good prognosis. Type II: These cancers occur in older, post-menopausal women, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen. They are typically of the high-grade endometrioid, papillary serous or clear cell types, and carry a generally poor prognosis Risk factors High levels of estrogen Endometrial hyperplasia Polycystic ovary syndrome Nulliparity Infeility Early menarche Late menopause Endometrial polyps or other benign growths of the uterine lining Tamoxifen Hyperplasia Pelvic radiation therapy Breast cancer Ovarian cancer Clinical evaluation A Pap smear may be either normal or show abnormal cellular changes. Endometrial curettage is the traditional diagnostic method. If endometrial curettage does not yield sufficient diagnostic material, a dilation and curettage (D and C) is necessary for diagnosing the cancer. Endometrial biopsy or aspiration may assist the diagnosis. Transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal Pathology The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. Fuher evaluation Colonoscopy is recommended due to the etiologic factors common to both endometrial cancer and colon cancer. Staging Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the FIGO cancer staging system. i a. Stage IA: tumor is limited to the endometrium i b. Stage IB: invasion of less than half the myometrium i c. Stage IC: invasion of more than half the myometrium ii a. Stage IIA: endocervical glandular involvement only ii b.

Which of the following is present normally in the urine of a pregnant women in the third trimester -,Glucose,Lactose,Galactose,Fructose,"Glucose Presence of glucose in urine wizen blood sugar level is within normal limits is called renal glycosuria and is thought to be secondary to low threshold for elimination of glucose by kidneys. ""Renal glycosuria occurs frequently during pregnancy"" Renal threshold for glucose - During pregnancy --) 155 +- 17 - Non pregnant patients 197 +- 6.5 During pregnancy glycosuria can occur at blood sugar levels as low as 70-100 mg/dl. More on renal glycosuria during pregnancy Renal glycosuria during pregnancy is not completely benign and these women are at risk for preterm delivery and for the development of fetal macrosomia. Most pregnant patients with renal glycosuria have normal kidney and the abnormality disappears after delivery. In some cases renal glycosuria during pregnancy is a manifestation of renal tubular damage secondary to chronic pyelonephritis. These patients frequently develop UTI. Management of Renal Glycosuria during pregnancy a) Perform frequent urine testing to detect asymptomatic bacteriuria 1)) Instructing the patient to have several small meals per day, rather than three large meals to avoid postprandial elevation in blood sugar and glycosuria c) Staying ale for early signs and symptoms of preterm labour Patiens with renal glycosuria loose as much as 100g/day of glucose in the urine. Such large doses decrease the amount of glucose available for their caloric needs and lipolysis is activated to maximum. This causes production of ketones and tendency towards ketoacidosis.

Q-Tip Test: If a urethra is poorly suppoed, it may display hypermobility during increases in intraabdominal pressures. To assess mobility, a clinician places the soft end of a cotton swab into the urethra to the urethrovesical junction. Failure to inse the swab to this depth typically leads to errors in assessment of urethrovesical junction suppo. Following local anaesthesia, a Valsalva maneuver is prompted, and the swab-excursion angle at rest and with Valsalva maneuver is measured with a goniometer or standard protractor. An excursion angle from rest and with Valsalva maneuver that measures >30 degrees above the horizontal plane indicates urethral hypermobility.

In MOST cases, the disease process of this patient affects which of the following anatomic structures?",Cervix,Fallopian tube,Ovary,Peritoneal cavity,"Approximately 98% of the time, ectopic pregnancies are located in the fallopian tube. It is believed that improper transpo of the feilized ovum through the fallopian tube is the most common pathophysiology leading to ectopic pregnancy. Several risk factors are associated with such improper transpo, including pelvic inflammatory disease and prior tubal surgery. Pelvic inflammatory disease and prior tubal surgery result in intraperitoneal scarring and adhesions that can alter the finely tuned transpo mechanisms in the fallopian tubes that are responsible for ensuring that the feilized ovum makes it to the endometrial cavity. Occasionally an ectopic pregnancy can be located in the cervix but this is very uncommon. The cervix is one of the three segments of the uterus (the other two being the body and the fundus). An ectopic pregnancy in this location can be difficult to address surgically. Some ectopic pregnancies are located on or near the ovary. The ovary lies near the fallopian tube in the broad ligament. Ectopic pregnancies on the ovary are also very uncommon. Very rarely an ectopic pregnancy will be located in the peritoneal cavity where it may attach to the surrounding intestines. There are case repos of some of these pregnancies making it to term, although this is extremely rare.",B

The following statements are related to rupture uterus except:,Lower segment scar rarely ruptures during pregnancy,In incomplete rupture the peritoneal coat remains intact,Classical caesarean scar often rupture during late pregnancy,Risk of lower segment scar rupture is high compared to classical scar rupture,"Rupture Uterus
Disruption in the continuity of the all uterine layers (endometrium, myometrium and serosa) any time beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy is called rupture of the uterus.
The causes of rupture of the uterus are broadly divided into:

Spontaneous
Scar rupture
Iatrogenic

SPONTANEOUS
During pregnancy: It is rare for an apparently uninjured uterus to give way during pregnancy.
The causes are: 
(1) Previous damage to the uterine walls following dilatation and curettage operation or manual removal of placenta
(2) Grand multiparae ( due to weak uterine walls)
(3) Congenital malformation of the uterus (bicornuate variety)
(4) In Couvelaire uterus.
Spontaneous rupture during pregnancy is usually complete, involves the upper segment and usually occurs in later months of pregnancy.
During labor: Spontaneous rupture which occurs predominantly in an otherwise intact uterus during labor. It is due to:

Obstructive rupture—This is the end result of an obstructed labor. The rupture involves the lower segment and usually extends through one lateral side of the uterus to the upper segment.
Non-obstructive rupture—Grand multiparae are usually affected and rupture usually occurs in early labor. The rupture usually involves the fundal area and is complete.

SCAR RUPTURE: The incidence of lower segment scar rupture is about 1–2%, while that following classical one is 5–10 times higher. Uterine scar, following operation on the nonpregnant uterus such as myomectomy or metroplasty hardly rupture. Uterine scar following hysterotomy behaves like that of a classical scar. During pregnancy: Classical cesarean or hysterotomy scar is likely to give way during later months of pregnancy. Lower segment scar rarely ruptures during pregnancy.",D
Microscopical appearance of cervical mucus after ovulation is:,Shows pattern on drying,Is thick,Is thin and cellular,Is thin and alkaline,"The fern test can determine the presence or absence of ovulation or the time of ovulation. When cervical mucus is spread on a clean, dry slide and allowed to dry in air, it may or may not assume a frondlike pattern when viewed under the microscope. The fern frond pattern indicates an estrogenic effect on the mucus without the influence of progesterone; thus, a non-frondlike pattern can be interpreted as showing that ovulation has occurred. Progesterone makes the mucus thick and cellular. Ref: Kawada C., Hochner-Celnikier D. (2013). Chapter 35. Gynecologic History, Examination, & Diagnostic Procedures. In A.H. DeCherney, L. Nathan, N.

Obstructive azoospermia is characterized by?,FSH & LH levels normal,Increased FSH and Low LH,Increased LH and Low FSH,"Both, FSH and LH low","Ans. A. FSH and LH levels are normalA normal testicular biopsy in an azoospermic man with a normal FSH level suggests obstruction of the vas.Obstruction (Obstructive Azoospermia)Approximately 6% of men have blockages in the genital tract that prevent the passage of sperm between the testes to the penis and result in absence of sperm in the semen.There are three major groups of causes of male genital tract blockages:a. Disorders of development of the epididymis, vas and seminal vesicles,b. Scarring from inflammation (especially Gonorrhoea) andc. Vasectomy.The function of the testes is dependent upon hormones from the pituitary gland, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The blood levels of these hormones rise during the early stages of puberty and stimulate testicular development. LH controls production of the male sex hormone testosterone which in turn is responsible for the growth that occurs at puberty: development of the genitals, beard and body hair, prostate and seminal vesicles, and also development of bone and muscle and other aspects of masculine physique. If LH and FSH are deficient, the tests do not develop or function properly. In contrast, if the testes are damaged directly, the levels of these hormones in the blood rise.",A

"True about hCG :a) α subunit identical to LH, FSH and TSHb) Causes involution of corpus luteumc) Doubles in 7-10 daysd) Max. level seen at 60-70 days of gestatione) Detected in serum and urine 8-9 days after ovulation.",b,ad,ac,ab,"hCG

hCG is a glycoprotein
It is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta.
hCG has 2 subunits :

– α - biologically similar in LH, FSH and TSH. (i.e nonspecific)
– β subunit - unique to hCG. (i.e specific)

Structurally it is similar to - FSH, LH, TSH but functionally it is similar to LH ( i.e luteotropic), i.e. helps in maintaining corpus luteum. So, the main hormone which maintains activity of corpus luteum during pregnancy is hCG and in non pregnant state is LH.
The half life of hCG is 36 hours.
In early pregnancy the doubling time of hCG is 1.4-2 days.
It can be detected in maternal serum as early as 8 days following fertilisation/day 22 of menstrual cycle/5 days before missed period by immuno assay.
The level is 100 IU/L or mIU/mL around the time of the expected menses.
The levels progressively rise and reach maximum levels by about 8-10 weeks/70 days/1st trimester. It then falls until about 16 weeks and remains at low level up to term.
hCG disappears from circulation by 2 weeks following delivery.

Action:

Sustains the corpus luteum and thereby maintains the hormonal support to the pregnancy in early weeks.
Stimulates the Leydig cells of the male fetus to produce testosterone and thereby induces development of the male external genitalia.
Immunosuppressive action which helps in the maintenance of pregnancy.

Note: In 19, I have not included option ‘c’ as correct answer, i.e. detected in serum and urine 8-9 days after ovulation
because it is detected in serum 8-9 days after ovulation but not in urine.

Colposcope is a binocular microscope. In colposcopy after visualising the suspected area on cervix with naked eyes, acetic acid (3 - 5%) is applied for better visualization.deg Principle : Application of acetic acid to normal glycogen producing epithelium of cervix does not produce any effect and it appears pink during colposcopy. But when acetic acid is applied to dysplastic epithelium which have large nuclei with abnormally large amounts of chromatin (i.e. wtein) acetic acid coagulates the proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm, making the proteins opaque and whitethus dysplastic cells and cancerous cells appear white (called as Aceto white) (i.e. option ""13- and ""d""are correctleck The immature metaplaIfcells have larger nuclei and also show some effects of the acetic acid. Since, metaplastic epithelium is very thin, it does not appear while but instead appears grey and filmy (i.e. option 'a'ts correct). Cervical polyp can be diagnosed by direct visualization and does not need a colposcope to diagnose it.",C

Besides the above mentioned therapeutic indications it can be used for diagnosis of:

Renal agenesis
PROM (Premature rupture of membrane)

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 94
“Amnioinfusion in patients with oligohydramnios is not a simple procedure. The needle should be advanced slowly with continuous ultrasound visualization and when its tip has reached the interface between the fetus and the membranes warmed saline solution should be infused.
In majority of cases, 250-350 ml of saline solution will be necessary to achieve optimal ultrasound transmission and perform a careful level II examination. A normal fetus will swallow the infused fluid, and its bladder will be easily seen with ultrasound after 20 minutes. The bladder will not be seen in fetuses with renal agenesis.
Before ending the amnioinfusion, 1 ml of indigo carmine is injected inside the amniotic sac. The patient is instructed to wear a tampon for a few hours following the procedure and observe for evidence of blue discoloration. This finding will confirm the presence of PROM.”

Among the various methods of assessing the smears, the following are most commonly used: the maturation index consists of a differential count of 3 types of squamous cells--parabasal cells, intermediate cells, and superficial cells, in that order--expressed as percentages (eg, 10/85/5); a greater percentage of parabasal cells reflects a greater degree of atrophy. The cornification count is the percentage of pre cornified and cornified cells among total squamous cells counted. This is actually a simplified maturation index, because this percentage is essentially the same as that of the superficial cells. Ref: Nathan L. (2013). Chapter 59. Menopause & Postmenopause. In A.H.

In Ca cervix lymphatic spread involve which of the following lymph node / nodes :,Obturator LN,External iliac LN,Hypogastric LN,All,"Ans. is a, b and c i.e. Obturator LN; External iliac LN; and Hypogastric LN Cervix has rich supply of lymphatics which follows the course of the uterine aery. Ca cervix follows orderly progression i.e. involves initially primary nodes in pelvis and then paraaoic nodes. Lymphatic channels of cervix drain principally into paracervical and parametrial lymph nodes. The lymphatics passing through the cardinal ligament empty into the ureteric node, which lies just lateral to the junction of the uterine aery. From the parametrial and paracervical nodes, lymph subsequently flows into the obturator lymph nodes and into the internal, external, and common iliac lymph nodes. In contrast, lymphatic channels from the posterior cervix course through the rectal pillars and the uterosacral ligaments to the rectal lymph nodes. These nodes are encountered during radical hysterectomy and removed with the uterosacral ligaments. Now some of you are going to ask -- How is hypogastric LN the correct option.

Supine hypotension is characteristic of the following trimester of pregnancy:,First trimester of pregnancy,2nd trimester of pregnancy,3rd trimester of pregnancy,Twin pregnancy,"During late pregnancy with the woman in the supine position, the large pregnant uterus rather consistently compresses venous return from the lower body. In about 10 percent of women, this supine compression of the great vessels by the uterus causes significant aerial hypotension, sometimes referred to as the supine hypotensive syndrome. Also when supine, uterine aerial pressure--and thus blood flow--is significantly lower than that in the brachial aery. This may directly affect fetal hea rate patterns. This also occurs with hemorrhage or with spinal analgesia. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 5. Maternal Physiology. In F.G.

All are true about pre eclampsia except:,Cerebral hemorrhage,Pulmonary edema,ARF,DVT,"Severe complications of Preeclampsia:

Pulmonary edema


It is a common complication of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia affecting ~3% of patients.
Most cases are a result of aggressive use of crystalloid solutions, for intravascular volume expansion
It usually occurs in the post partum period and is characterized by profound respiratory distress, severe hypoxemia and diffuse rales.

Treatment:

Administering oxygen by nasal prongs.
Restriction of I/V or oral fluids.
Furosemide 20-40 mg l/v every 6 hours.


Acute renal Failure:


Oliguria is common in patients with severe preeclampsia
It is mostly prerenal in origin.


Intracranial bleeding: It is the leading cause of death in preeclampsia. It is seen that main connection of this event is with systolic BP and not with diastolic B/P.
Visual disorder: Blindness may occur in patients with severe preeclampsia and eclampsia and may persist for several days, although quick recovery after delivery is the rule.

As far as DVT is concerned – I know some of you may think that DIC is a result of preeclampsia which in turn can lead to DVT – But –
DIC is a complication of eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, perse preeclampsia does not lead to DIC. Only if preeclampsia is associated with abruption of placenta it leads to DIC,
Read the following lines from COGDT 10/e, p 997
“Eclampsia is associated with DIC 11% of the time, with HELLP syndrome this increases to 15%. Peeclampsia together with placental abruption also significantly increases this association.”",D

The mechanism of action of emergency contraception includes the following except:,By Causing early ovulation,Degeneration of corpus leutum,Inhibition of fertilization,Prevention of implantation of fertilized egg.,"Ans. A. By Causing early ovulation.Methods of emergency contraceptionThere are two methods of emergency contraception:# emergency contraception pills (ECPs)# copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs).When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception available.The emergency contraceptive pill regimen recommended by WHO is one dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg, taken within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse.1. Emergency contraception pills# WHO recommends levonorgestrel for emergency contraceptive pill use. Ideally, this progestogen-only method should be taken as a single dose (1.5 mg) within five days (120 hours) of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, a woman can take the levonorgestrel in two doses (0.75 mg each; 12 hours apart).# Mode of action :Levonorgestrel emergency pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation. They may also prevent fertilization of an egg by affecting the cervical mucus or the ability of sperm to bind to the egg. They are not effective once the process of implantation has begun.# Effectiveness :levonorgestrel regimen is 52-94% effective in preventing pregnancy. The regimen is more effective the sooner after intercourse it is taken.2. Copper-bearing intrauterine devices (IUDs)# WHO recommends that a copper-bearing IUD, as an emergency contraceptive, be inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse. This may be an ideal emergency contraceptive for a woman who is hoping for an ongoing, highly effective contraceptive method.# Mode of action : As emergency contraception, the copper-bearing IUD primarily prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change that damages sperm and egg before they can meet.# Effectiveness: When inserted within five days of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. This is the most effective form of emergency contraception available. Once inserted, she can continue to use the IUD as an ongoing method of contraception.# Postcoital contraceptivesDrugsDosePregnancy rate (%)Levonorgestrel0.75 mg stat and after 12 hours0-1Ethinyl estradiol 50 mg + Norgestrel 0.25 mg2 tab stat and 2 after 12 hrs0-2Conjugated estrogen15 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Ethinyl estradiol2.5 mg BD x 5 days0-0.6Mifepristone10 mg single dose0-0.6Copper IUDsInsertion within 5 days0-0.1",A

The mode of transmission of tuberculosis to the endometrium is ___________,Hematogenous,Lymphatic spread,Retrograde spread,Local spread,"Endometrial tuberculosis is most commonly accquired by direct spread from the fallopian tubes. Genital Tuberculosis: Female genital tuberculosis is an impoant cause of significant morbidity, sho and long-term sequelae especially infeility. Genital tuberculosis usually occurs secondary to pulmonary (commonest) or Extrapulmonary TB like gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, skeleta; system, meninges, and miliary TB. However, Primary genital TB can rarely occur in women whose male paners have active genitourinary TB (e.g., tuberculosis epididymis) by transmission through infected semen Most common site involved in secondary genital TB is Fallopian tube (90-100%) > Endometrium (50-80%) > Ovaries (20-30%) > Cervix (5-15%) > Vulva The most common symptom of genital TB is infeility Causes of infeility in Genital TB : Tubal blockage If tubes are patent, then also infeility occurs due to loss of tubal function Tubercular endometritis causes uterine scarring resulting in the destruction of the endometrium Ovarian damage with poor ovarian reserve and volume Hematogenous spread is thought to be the process by which the tubercle bacillii implant into the mucosa of the fallopian tubes and subsequently affect the endometrium by direct extension. A laparoscopy and dye hydrotubation (lap and dye test) is the most reliable tool to diagnose genital TB, especially for the tubal, ovarian and peritoneal disease. The test can be combined with hysteroscopy. Multiple drug therapy (ATT regimen provided by DOTS) in adequate doses and for sufficient duration is the mainstay in the treatment of TB including genital tuberculosis.

All are true regarding dystocia except:,Dystocia is difficult labor,It is the M/C indication for primary cesarean delivery,ACOG recommends the cervix should be atleast 2 cms dilated for diagnosis of dystocia,"Dystocia can be due to abnormality in power, passage and passenger","Dystocia literally means difficult labor and is characterized by abnormally slow labor progress.
It arises from four distinct abnormalities that may exist singly or in combination:

– Abnormalities of the expulsive forces. Uterine contractions maybe insufficiently strong or inappropriately coordinated to efface and dilate the cervix–uterine dysfunction. Also, there may be inadequate voluntary maternal muscle effort during second-stage labor.
– Abnormalities of presentation, position, or development of the fetus.
– Abnormalities of the maternal bony pelvis–that is, pelvic contraction.
– Abnormalities of soft tissues of the reproductive tract that form an obstacle to fetal descent.
Common clinical findings in women with ineffective labor
Inadequate cervical dilation or fetal descent:

Protracted labor–slow progress
Arrested labor–no progress
Inadequate expulsive effort–ineffective pushing.
Fetopelvic disproportion:
Excessive fetal size
Inadequate pelvic capacity

Malpresentation or position of the fetus

Ruptured membranes without labor.
Dystocia is the most common current indication for primary cesarean delivery.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecology recommend (1995a) that the cervix be dilated to 4 cm or more before dystocia is diagnosed, thus, the diagnosis often is made before active labor, and therefore before an adequate trial of labor which leads to unnecessary cesarean section.",C

Blighted ovum is :,Synaptic knobs,Avascular villi,Intervillous hemorrhage,None,"Ans. is b i.e. Avascular villi According to the clinical and echographic findings, it is possible to separate early pregnancy losses into two groups : alighted ova : Those early pregnancy losses in which foetal development is not observed with ultrasound (so that only a gestational sac is present with or without a yolk sac) and fetal tissue is absent on histologic examination of the products of conception. * Early Fetal demise Those early pregnancy losses in which fetal development is clearly observed by ultrasound and feta! tissue is found on the histologic examination. The difference between these two types of aboion is of fundamental impoance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of aboions of genetic origin. In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies. Therefore, the patients with blighted ova do not require extensive work up, whereas patients who have aboed cytogenetically normal fetuses need an extensive search for non genetic factors responsible for the pregnancy loss.",B

The pa of the internal lining of the uterus which is not shed during menstruation is the?,Endometrium,Myometrium,Mesometrium,Cervical mucosa,"This question is phrased in a slightly tricky way, so it's impoant to break it down before looking at the answers. There are two things to think about here First, you need to decide if a structure is pa of the uterus. If it is pa of the uterus, then you need to decide if it is shed during menstruation. The correct answer will be a structure that is pa of the uterus but is not shed during menstruation. Answers about structures that are not shed during menstruation because they are not pa of the uterine wall are incorrect. The myometrium is our correct answer. It is the middle muscular component of the uterine wall and it is not shed during menstruation. The endometrium is the inner mucosal coat of the uterus. It is shed during menstruation and exhibits many characteristic changes during the menstrual cycle. The mesometrium is the mesentary of the uterus which forms the major pa of the broad ligament of the uterus. It is not even pa of the internal lining of the uterus, so it's not the answer to look for. Cervical mucosa lines the cervix, which is the inferior poion of the uterus. This mucosa is shed during menstruation. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 6. Paurition. In F.G. Cunningham, K.J. Leveno, S.L.

Which of the following statement regarding Clomiphene citrate is true?,Enclomiphene is anti-estrogenic,Increases pregnancy rate 3 times as compared to placebo,Incidence of twin pregnancy is 5-6%,It has been shown to increase feility in oligospermic males in randomized controlled trials,"Clomiphene citrate is a racemic mixture of enclomiphene & zuclomiphene. Clomiphene citrate is a triphenylethylene; its two isomers, zuclomiphene (cis-clomiphene) and enclomiphene (trans-clomiphene), are a weak estrogen agonist and a potent antagonist, respectively. The incidence of multiple pregnancies is approximately 10%. Although clomiphene is effective in inducing ovulation in perhaps 75% of women, successful pregnancy ensues in only 40-50% of those who ovulate. Clomiphene also may be used to evaluate the male reproductive system because testosterone feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary is mediated to a large degree by estrogens formed from aromatization of the androgen. Enclomiphene is a more potent anti-oestrogenic isomer and the one primarily responsible for the ovulation-inducing actions of clomiphene citrate. Intrauterine insemination and clomiphene citrate increase pregnancy rate 3 times as compared to placebo. Incidence of twin pregnancy following clomiphene citrate ovulation induction is 10%, while that of triplets is 1%. A randomized control study showed that use of clomiphene has improved sperm motility and percent of normal forms but has not established an increased feility. Indications of clomiphene: Ovulation induction To aid invitro feilization when given with gonadotrophins In oligozoospermia: it increases gonadotrophin secretion and promotes spermatogenesis and testosterone secretion Adverse effects of clomiphene: Polycystic ovaries Multiple pregnancy Hot flushes Gastric upset Increased risk of ovarian tumor",A

TRUE about 'Capacitation' of sperm:,Can be induced in IN-Vitro,Acrosomal reaction is capacitation,Its same as Zona reaction,Capacitation takes place in testis,"Both capacitation and the acrosome reaction can be induced in vitro. So in IVF, following semen collection and sperm processing sperm are incubated in media for 3 to 4 hours to promote sperm capacitation and the acrosome reaction. The process of capacitation involves removal of inhibitory mediators such as cholesterol from the sperm surface, tyrosine phosphorylation, and calcium ion influx. The spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes, where they slow down and undergo capacitation. Near the time that the egg enters the ampulla of the tube, sperm initiate the capacitationprocess and are released from the oviduct epitheliumin a hyperactivated state This fuher maturation process involves two components: Increasing the motility of the spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. Capacitation is not an essential step though, since feilisation can also happen in 'Vitro'.",A

Following may be used in treatment of hirsutism, EXCEPT:",Spironolactone,Flutamide,Cyproterone,Mifepristone,"Mifepristone does not used for hirsutism. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. It possesses anti androgenic propeies and exes its peripheral antiandrogenic effects in the hair follicle by competing for androgenic receptors and displacing dihydrotestosterone at both nuclear and cytosol receptors. Flutamide is a potent, highly specific, nonsteroidal antiandrogen with no intrinsic hormonal or anti gonadotropic activity. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it competitively inhibits target tissue androgen receptor sites. Cyproterone acetate is the an androgen receptor antagonist. Antiandrogenic effects result from competitive displacement of dihydrotestosterone from its receptor and reduction of 5-reductase activity in the skin.

"During pregnancy, maximum urinary HCG level is reached in: March 2007",30 days,50 days,70 days,90 days,"Ans. C: 70 days Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is made by the embryo soon after conception and later by the syncytiotrophoblast. It can be detected as early as 8-9 days following ovulation, doubles every 2 days in pregnancy and maximum levels are reached between 60-70 days of pregnancy (100-200 IU/ ml) Its role is to prevent the disintegration of the corpus luteum of the ovary and thereby maintain progesterone production that is critical for a pregnancy in humans. Early pregnancy testing, in general, is based on the detection or measurement of hCG. It is an impoant tumor marker. The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin is secreted also by choriocarcinoma, germ cell tumors, teratoma and islet cell tumor. The lack of a visible fetus on vaginal ultrasound after the beta hCG levels have reached 1500 IU/ ml is strongly indicative of an ectopic pregnancy. Gestational trophoblastic disease like Hydatidiform moles (""molar pregnancy"") or Chroiocarcinoma may produce high levels of beta hCG (due to the presence of syncytialtrophoblasts- pa of the villi that make up the placenta) despite the absence of an embryo.",C

"One of the risks of the endometrial biopsy that was performed on this patient is perforation of the uterus. The endometrial biopsy device is placed through the cervix and into the endometrial cavity. If complete perforation occurs, what is the sequence of layers that the biopsy device would penetrate prior to entering the peritoneal cavity?","Endometrium, myometrium, serosa","Ovary, fallopian tube, broad ligament","Round ligament, cardinal ligament, uterosacral ligament","Serosa, myometrium, endometrium","The uterus is a hollow, muscular organ that lies between the bladder and the rectum in the true pelvis. The uterus can be divided into three major segments: the uterine fundus, the uterine corpus (or body), and the cervix. The fallopian tubes enter the uterine fundus laterally in the region called the cornua. Moving from the inside (or hollow) poion of the uterus to the peritoneal cavity, the layers that would be penetrated are the endometrium, the myometrium, and the serosa. The endometrium is the poion of the uterus that proliferates during the menstrual cycle and sheds (the menses) if pregnancy does not occur, or suppos the pregnancy if conception and implantation take place. The myometrium is comprised of three layers: an inner layer of longitudinal smooth muscle, a middle layer of circular smooth muscle (the stratum vasculare), and an outer layer of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle (the stratum supervascularae). The final layer is the uterine serosa. The ovary, fallopian tube, and broad ligament are found posterolateral to the uterus. A biopsy device that perforated the uterus could also injure these structures, but the direct path of perforation is through the endometrium, myometrium, and serosa. Note: The round ligament, cardinal ligament, and uterosacral ligament are suppoing structures attached to the uterus. Again, while a perforating biopsy instrument could possibly involve these structures, this would not be the direct path of perforation. The serosa, myometrium, and endometrium are the correct structures that would be perforated, but they are in the wrong order. Staing within the uterus, the first layer is the endometrium, next is the myometrium and finally the serosa. Ref: Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology, 13th Ed Page 7-10",A

Which of the following statements is true regarding menorrhagia?,Heavy and regularly timed episodes of bleeding,Heavy and irregularly timed episodes of bleeding,Amount of bleeding greater than 50 ml,Duration of bleeding greater than 3 days,"Menorrhagia is defined as heavy but regular menstrual bleeding. Menorrhagia denotes regularly timed episodes of bleeding that are excessive in amount (>80mL) and/or duration of flow (>7 days) According to the recent update, the term heavy menstrual bleeding has replaced menorrhagia. Hemoglobin concentration below 12 g/dL increase the chance of identifying women with heavy menstrual bleeding. A normal level, however, doesnot exclude heavy menstrual bleeding, as many women with clinically significant bleeding have normal values. All patients should undergo a pelvic examination and, if the menstrual pattern has changed substantially or if anemia is present, a vaginal sonography should be carried out as the most impoant supplemental examination. Vaginal sonography combined with an endometrial biopsy is a reliable method for diagnosing endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, but it is insufficient for diagnosing endometrial polyps and fibroids; these can be diagnosed more reliably by sonohysterography or hysteroscopy. Appropriate treatment considerably improves the quality of life of the patients. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid reduce menstrual blood loss by 20-60% Drug treatment should be used and evaluated before surgical interventions are considered.

Post-evacuation surveillance of molar pregnancy is done using,AFP,b-hCG,LDH,CA 125,"Close biochemical surveillance for persistent gestational neoplasia should follow hydatidiform mole evacuation.Trophoblast produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), thus the measurement of this peptide hormone in serum is essential for GTD diagnosis, management, and surveillance. The initial b-hCG level is obtained within 48 hours after evacuation. This serves as the baseline, which is compared with b-hCG quantification done thereafter every 1 to 2 weeks until levels progressively decline to become undetectable.The median time for such resolution is 7 weeks for paial moles and 9 weeks for complete molesOnce b-hCG is undetectable, this is confirmed with monthly determinations for another 6 months.Reference: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition, chapter 20; Gestational trophoblastic diseases",B

It typically occurs during 2nd trimester (20-22) weeks of pregnancy.During red degeneration, the myomas become tense, tender and causes severe abdominal pain with constitutional upset and fever.Although the patient is febrile with moderate Leucocytosis and raised E.S.R., the condition is an aseptic one.It needs to be differentiated from appendicitis, twisted ovarian cyst, pyelitis and accidental hemorrhage.During the red degeneration, the tumour itself assumes a peculiar purple red colour and develops a fishy odour. If the tumour is carefully examined, some of the large veins in the capsule and the small vessels in the substance of the tumour will be found thrombosed. The discoloration is possibly caused by diffusion of blood pigments from thrombosed vessels.Conservative treatment with analgesia, reassurance and supportive therapy is almost always adequate.Also knowAnother complication of myoma which is seen during pregnancy is torsion of the myoma.Torsion of the myoma is also characterized by acute abdominal pain with point tenderness over the site of leiomyoma.Conservative t/t is adequate.",B

Lady with infertility with B/L tubal block at cornua. Best method of management is :,Laparoscopy & Hysteroscopy,Hydrotubation,IVF,Tuboplasty,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Laparoscopy and hysteroscopy There is no treatment of choice or best treatment for proximal tubal obstruction (PTO) without proper evaluation of the tube because although proximal tubal obstruction is a frequent finding on hysterosalpingography (HSG) approximately 213rd of PTO reveals an absence of luminal obstruction.False positive diagnosis of PTO ranges from 16-40% and can be as high as 50%.Therefore careful evaluation of the fallopian tube prior to therapy is an absolute requirement.The distinction b/w true pathological occlusion, spasm or plugging and abnormality of the mucosa is crucial in determining therapy.Conventional HSG does not differentiate cornual spasm or other temporary causes from true obstruction.Selection of patients with tubal disease for future therapeutic management is based on tubal lesion including the state of tubal mucosa and tuboperitoneal assessment and the severity of tubal damage is key in determining the outcome.Proximal tubal occlusion is most treatable since it often occurs because of the accumulation of mucus or debris which forms an impacted plug in the interstitial or proximal isthumic portion of the tube.Until recently the treatment of PTO was a domain of microsurgery or I.V.F., but now days, tubal recanalization also plays an important role in the management of proximal tubal occlusion.In patients with documented tubal disease, options for management includes.Expectant managementMicrosurgeryI.V.F.Until recently, the management of proximal tubal obstruction was the domain of either microsurgery or I.V.F.Since microsurgery was technically very difficult and did not yield good results. So PTO's were frequently referred for I.V.F.Now day's Proximal tube recanalisation (PTR) with catheters or guidewires has gained wide application in treatment and diagnosis of proximal tube obstruction Proximal tube recanalisation is a non invasive method for the diagnosis and treatment of proximal tubal obstruction.Now IVF is required only in cases where the tubal mucosa is severely damaged and the obstruction is distal eg.Poor mucosal healthObi iterative fibrosisDistal tube obstructionBipolar tube damage The safety, efficacy. noninvasiveness reduced risk, costs and morbidity and encouraging results with fallopian tube recansalisation in the treatment and evaluation of proximal tubal obstruction makes them an excellent alternative to surgical invasive procedure and should be offered as the initial treatment in all patients with PTO.Hysteroscopy and LaparoscopyHysteroscopic tubal catherization in patients with PTO can be used both as a diagnostic and considerably effective therapeutic method.With laparoscopy, the hysteroscopic approach enables tubales cannulation and evaluation of the entire pelvic.Treatment of additional problems affecting the fallopian tubes particularly adhesion and endometriosis is possible.While laparoscopy helps monitor the procedure and visual assessment of tubal patency, the ability to observe theUTJ's directly by hysteroscopy provides an excellent approach for tubal cannulation.Laparoscopic hysteroscopic tubal cannulation with or without guidewire cannulation has yielded an average recanalization success rate as high as 39%.Combined laparoscopy and hysteroscopic cannulation is a patients with proximal tubal obstruction.",A

In a girl with sexual infantilism and defective smell sensation which of the following is the likely diagnosis transmitted by sex chromosome?,Kallman's syndrome,Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauster syndrome,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,McCune-Albright syndrome,"Ans. a (Kallman's syndrome) (Ref. H -18th/Ch. 339).Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic GnRH synthesis and is associated with anosmia or hyposmia due to olfactory bulb agenesis or hypoplasia. The syndrome also may be associated with color blindness, optic atrophy, nerve deafness, cleft palate, renal abnormalities, cryptorchidism, and neurologic abnormalities such as mirror movements. Defects in the X-linked KAL gene impair embryonic migration of GnRH neurons from the hypothalamic olfactory placode to the hypothalamus. Autosomal recessive (i.e., GPR54, K1SS1) and dominant (i.e., FGFR1) modes of transmission have been described. Males present with delayed puberty and pronounced hypogonadal features, including micropenis, probably the result of low testosterone levels during infancy. Females present with primary amenorrhea and failure of secondary sexual development.Kallmann syndrome and other causes of congenital GnRH deficiency are characterized by low LH and FSH levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol).Long-term Rx of men with hCG or testosterone restores pubertal development and secondary sex characteristics; women can be treated with cyclic estrogen and progestin. Fertility also may be restored by the administration of gonadotropins or by using a infusion pump to deliver subcutaneous, pulsatile GnRH.Kallmann's syndromeis an X-linked disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which is associated with anosmia. It more commonly affects men than women.McCune-Albright syndromeis characterized by patchy cutaneous hyperpigmentation, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and several endocrine disorders including toxic multinodular goiter.Testicular feminization syndrome (complete androgen insensitivity syndrome)A genetic disorder that makes XY fetuses insensitive to androgens (male hormones)Instead, they are born looking externally like normal girls. Internally, there is a short blind-pouch vagina and no uterus, fallopian tubes or ovaries. There are testes in the abdomen or the inguinal canal.Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster- Hauster syndromeCongenital absence of the uterus is usually associated with absent vagina.

Spermicidal agent among the following is :,Nonoxynol,Menfegol,Octoxynol,All of the above,"Spermicidal Agents: The spermicidal agents kill the sperms before the latter gain access to the cervical canal. These chemical contraceptive agents contain surfactants, such as nonoxynol-9, octoxynol and menfegol and enzyme-inhibiting agents, and are available as foam tablets, soluble pessaries,creams, jellies, or as films along with other contraceptives such as the diaphragm, occlusive cervical cap and condom. Used alone, failure rate is high, approximately 30 per 100 woman years. When used in conjunction with a mechanical barrier, they give a reliable contraceptive effect. The spermicidal agent remains effective for 1-2 h after the application. By causing irritation and abrasions in chronic use, they can cause vaginal ulceration and perhaps increase the risk of HIV spread rather than prevent it. Therefore, the spermicidal agents should not be recommended to HIV couples. A new spermicidal cream, Tenofovir, prevents viral attachment to the vaginal mucosa and is nonirritant and is under development. The use of condoms with spermicidal agents and postcoital agents as back-up technique is effective in avoiding pregnancy.

Gynaecomastia is seen in all except: September 2007,Spironolactone,Hypothyroidism,Klinefelters syndrome,Cirrhotic liver diseases,"Ans. B: Hypothyroidism Gynecomastia results from an imbalance in hormone levels in which levels of estrogen are increased relative to levels of androgens. Gynecomastia that occurs in normally-growing infant and pubeal boys that resolves on its own with time is known as physiologic gynecomastia. A number of medical conditions may also result in gynecomastia: Malnutrition and re-feeding (recovery from malnutrition) have both been shown to create a hormonal environment that may lead to gynecomastia. Similarly, cirrhosis of the liver alters normal hormone metabolism and may lead to gynecomastia. Disorders of the male sex organs (testes) can result in decreased testosterone production and relatively high estrogen levels, leading to gynecomastia. These disorders may be genetic, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, or acquired due to trauma, infection, reduced blood flow, or aging. Testicular cancers may also secrete hormones that cause gynecomastia. Other conditions that are associated with an altered hormonal environment in the body and may be associated with gynecomastia are chronic renal failure and hypehyroidism. Gynecomastia can also be a side effect of a number of medications. Examples of drugs that can be associated with gynecomastia are listed below: -- Spironolactone- it has anti-androgenic activity; - Calcium channel blockers used to treat hypeension (such as nifedipine); - ACE inhibitor drugs for hypeension (captopril, enalapril); - Some antibiotics (for example, isoniazid, ketoconazole, and metronidazole); - Anti-ulcer drugs (such as ranitidine, cimetidine, and omeprazole); - Anti-androgen or estrogen therapies for prostate cancer; - Methyldopa; - Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAA) for HIV disease, which may cause fat redistribution leading to Pseudogynecomastia or, in some cases, true gynecomastia; - Digitoxin; - Diazepam",B

Pain that increases upon extension of the foot is referred to as Homans' sign. Pregnancy, paicularly during the third trimester, induces a hypercoagulable blood state (possibly to limit the chance of fatal hemorrhage during delivery), which can manifest as DVT.

"All of the following are associated with placental abruption, EXCEPT:",Cocaine abuse,Cigarette smoking,Hypotension,Pre-eclampsia,"Placental abruption occurs when a previously normally implanted placenta separates from the endometrial wall. This can occur secondarily to vascular changes or mechanical sheer forces. Both cocaine and cigarette smoking result in vascular constriction which results in acute vasospasm, elevated total peripheral resistance, and an acute increase in maternal blood pressure. These phenomena are believed to be associated with an increased rate of placental abruption. Hypeension, not hypotension, is associated with abruption. Acute hypotension can, however, cause fetal distress if untreated and may result in a similar fetal hea rate tracing to that associated with an abruption. Similarly, pre-eclampsia with elevated blood pressures is associated with abruptions. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 35.

Head delivery by flexion occurs in:,Brow presentation,Face presentation,OP vertex presentation,OA Vertex presentation,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Face presentation * Flexion: is the movement by which the head is delivered in mentoanterior position when the submental region hinges below the symphysis. The vulva is much distended by the submento-vertical diameter 11.5 cm.* Following internal rotation, the mentum is below the maternal symphysis, and delivery occurs by flexion of the fetal neck. As the face descends onto the perineum, the anterior fetal chin passes under the symphysis and flexion of the head occurs, making delivery possible with maternal expulsive forces. The above mechanisms of labor in the term infant can occur only if the mentum is anterior and at term, only the mentum anterior face presentation is likely to deliver vaginally. If the mentum is posterior or transverse, the fetal neck is too short to span the length of the maternal sacrum and is already at the point of maximal extension. The head cannot deliver as it cannot extend any further through the symphysis and cesarean delivery is the safest route of delivery.* Option (a) persistent brow presentation , vaginal delivery is not possible 8c will require LSCS* Option (b) as the head is extented, delivery occurs by flexion.# In mento anterior face, a vaginal delivery is possible.# Mento posterior face, vaginal delivery is not possible 8c requires LSCS* Option (c) & (d): in both the head is flexed 8c delivery takes place by extension.",B

Treatment of choice of the pregnant lady with appendicitis is:,Surgery at earliest,Abortion with appendectomy,Surgery after delivery,Continue pregnancy with medical Rx,"Ans: A (Surgery at earliest) Acute Appendicitis During Pregnancy Dutta obstetrics 6th/ 304Incidence is about 1 in 2000 pregnancies.Diagnosis is difficult in pregnancy because of:1. Nausea and vomiting common in normal pregnancy are also the common symptoms of appendicitis2. Leucocytosis is common in normal pregnancy, (c) Appendix moves upwards and outwards as the uterus enlarges. So pain and tenderness may not be located in the right iliac fossa, (d) Diagnosis is often confused with disturbed ectopic pregnancy, pyelonephritis, twisted ovarian cyst, abruption placenta and red degeneration of afibroid.Effect of appendicitis on pregnancy- may lead to abortion, premature delivery, increased perinatal mortality and maternal mortality.Effect of pregnancy on appendicitis is not so good. This is because of (a) late diagnosis, (b) failure of localization due to displacement of the position and as such (c) peritonitis is more common, specially, in last trimester.Treatment consists of laparotomy at the earliest opportunity. Once the diagnosis is suspected it is better to operate rather than to wait until generalised peritonitis has developed. The incision should be made at the point of maximum tenderness. For the approach to the site, evacuation of the uterus may be required",A
Definition of recurrent pregnancy loss classically is,Two or more consecutive pregnancy losses < 20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight <500 g,Three or more consecutive pregnancy losses < 20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight <500 g,Four or more consecutive pregnancy losses < 20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight <500 g,Five or more consecutive pregnancy losses < 20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight <500 g,"Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is classically defined as three or more consecutive pregnancy losses <20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight <500 g.

Which complication you would expect during internal podalic version in case of transverse lie,Uterine rupture,Cervical laceration,Uterine atony,Vaginal laceration,"Uterine rupture Internal podalic version:- This nzaneouvre is currently used only for the delivery of a second twin. It consists of the inseion of a hand into the uterine cavity to turn the fetus manually. With this maneuver the fetus is turned to a breech presentation. After this the obstetrician grasps the fetal head to affect delivery by breech extraction. This operation is associated with high incidence of uterine rupture. Munrokar's operative Gynae states ""The practice of this operation has been greatly reduced because of the high fetal moality and because of the danger to the mother of uterine rupture. Earlier it was used in impacted shoulder presentation, placenta pre and cord prolapse, but because of the dangers attached (i.e. uterine rupture) it is now used only for transverse lie encountered with the second fetus of a twin delivery.""

All of the following changes are seen in pregnancy except :,Increased stroke volume,Increased cardiac output,Increased Intravascular volume,Increased peripheral vascular resistance,"CARDIAC OUTPUT: Increases from 5th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak 40-50% at about 30-34 weeks. Thereafter the CO remains static till term. CO is lowest in the sitting or supine position and highest in the right or left lateral or knee chest position. Cardiac output increases fuher during labor (+50%) and immediately following delivery (+70%) over the pre-labor values. MAP also rises. There is squeezing out of blood from the uterus into the maternal circulation (auto transfusion) during labor and in the immediate postpaum. CO returns to pre-labor values by one hour following delivery and to the pre-pregnant level by another 4 weeks time. The increase in CO is caused by: (1) Increased blood volume (2) To meet the additional O2 required due to increased metabolic activity during pregnancy. The increase in CO is chiefly affected by increase in stroke volume and increase in pulse rate to about 15 per minute. BLOOD PRESSURE: Systemic vascular resistance(SVR) decreases (-21%) due to the smooth muscle relaxing effect of progesterone, NO, prostaglandins or ANP.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein normally produced by a developing fetus. Regarding Alpha Fetoprotein TRUE statement is:,Major source of late fetal life is yolk sac,Commonly elevated in Wilms tumor,Level increases after 20th week,Half-life 5-7 days,"This glycoprotein is synthesized early in gestation by the fetal yolk sac and later by the fetal gastrointestinal tract and liver. Its concentration increases steadily in both fetal serum and amniotic fluid until 13 weeks, after which, levels rapidly decrease. Conversely, AFP is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks. Half-life is 5-7 days. An elevated level of AFP suggests the presence of either primary liver cancer or a germ cell tumor of the ovary or testicle. Other conditions which cause elevated AFP are, gastric cancer, cirrhosis, hepatic necrosis, acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

Which of the following strategy has been recommended to reduce the heredity risk for ovarian cancer in women with BRCA -1 and BRCA - 2 mutations :,Use of oral contraceptive pills,Screening with transvaginal ultrasound,Screening with CA - 125,Prophylactic oophorectomy,"Ans. is d i.e. Prophylactic oophorectomy BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumour suppressor genes. BRCA-1 is located on chromosome 17 and BRCA-2 on chromosome 13. Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant. Lifetime risk of Ovarian Ca in individual with these mutation - 25% Lifetime risk of Breast Ca in individual with these mutation - 50% BRCA-1 - (20-40% life time risk of ovarian cancer). BRCA-2 - (10-20% life time risk of ovarian cancer). Men in these families have an increased risk of prostate cancer. Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology. Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations. Prophylactic oophorectomy : ""The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oopherectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (B50) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%."" Additional benefit of prophylactic oopherectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%. Oral contraceptive pills : Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oralcontraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is sho term increased risk of developing breastcancer.

It is produced by the Granulosa cells of preantral, and small antral follicles and inhibits the initiation of primordial follicle growth. The serum levels of MIS in women with normal cycles declines with age and becomes undetectable by the time of menopause. As the ovarian primordial follicle count decreases, the serum MIS concentration also decreases, making this hormone an ideal candidate for the early detection of ovarian reserve depletion.",B

A female with recurrent abortion and isolated prolonged APTT is most likely associated with,Lupus anticoagulant,DIC,Von wilebrand disease,Hemophilia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Lupus anticoagulant They have asked about antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.Antiphospholipid antibodies account for 3% to 5% of patients with repetitive pregnancy losses.The frequency of fetal death and recurrent abortion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%.* There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are:The lupus anticoagulant (LAC),The anticardiolipin antibody andThe antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the partial thromboplastin time (PTT).This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation.In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly.It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time.Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT.Unfortunately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PTT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russell viper venom time should be performed.It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent abortions have elevated values of serum IgM.Other antiphospholipid antibodiesThe anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anticardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L.A.C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L.A.C.Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test.BFP-STIt is the less common antiphospholipid antibody.Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same.Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies.* The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated withRecurrent early pregnancy losses.Episodes of venous and arterial thrombosisSevere preeclampsiaChorea gravidarumH/o ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches.Postpartum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms.Abortions in antiphospholipid antibody syndromeTypically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or abortion occurs.The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks.Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",A

So, lets read the question once again and rule out each option one by one.The lady in our question is of 150 cm height ( 5 feet).""While an arbitrary measurement of 5 ft. is considered as short stature in western countries, it is 4' 7"" in India considered the low average height"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 98So, the lady is not constitutionally small, i.e. options 'b' is ruled out.Her Hb is 11 gm%.""According to the standards laid down by WHO. anemia in pregnancy is present when the hemoglobin concentration in the peripheral blood is 11gm% or less"". --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 262So, according to the WHO standard 11gm% is borderline for anemia.Anemia leads to IUGR when it is moderately severe i.e. Hb<8 gm% or if it is sickle cell anemia (Fernando arias, 3/e, p 41)So, option 'e' is ruled out.Her BP is 160/110 mm HgHypertension is an absolute rise of BP of at least 140/90 mm Hg, if the previous BP is not known. So, there is no doubt that the patient is hypertensive.Prolonged hypertension leads to placental insufficiency which ultimately results in IUGR.So, option 'c' is correct.Her weight gain is 12 kg.""Ideally weight gain should depend on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) level. Weight gain for a woman with normal BMI (20-26) is 11 to 16 kg"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 51So, the weight gain comes under normal range, option 'd' ruled out.Though maternal infection during pregnancy also causes IUGR, here in our question no such history has been mentioned.So, option 'a' is also ruled out. Hence the answer of this question is, IUGR is due to hypertension.",C

"When treating urinary tract infection (UTI) in the third trimester, the antibiotic of choice should be",Cephalosporin,Tetracycline,Sulfonamide,Nitrofurantoin,"Although quite effective, sulfonamides should be avoided during the last few weeks of pregnancy because they competitively inhibit the binding of bilirubin to albumin, which increases the risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Nitrofurantoin may not be tolerated in pregnancy because of the effect of nausea. It should also be avoided in late pregnancy because of the risk of hemolysis due to deficiency of erythrocyte phosphate dehydrogenase in the newborn. Tetracyclines are contraindicated during pregnancy because of dental staining in the fetus. Thus, the drugs of choice for treatment of UTI in pregnancy are ampicillin and the cephalosporins.",A

Paget's is associated with which other cancer:,Vulva,Vagina,Cervix,Uterus,"Ans. a. VulvaRef: Shaw's Textbook of Gynecology 16th Ed; Page No-475A variety of developmental, trophic, inflammatory, allergic and neoplastic disorders can occur in the vulvar skin and its appendages. The common vulvar disorders affecting its various constituents are:Epidermis and dermis: Common dermatological disorders, allergies, infections, naevi, dystrophies, ulcers and new growths.Skin appendages. Folliculitis, sebaceous cysts, hidradenomas, Bartholin's cyst or abscess and Paget's disease.Adjacent structures: Lipomas, fibromas, haemangiomas, varicosities, carcinomas, sarcomas and endometriosis.Developmental: Vulvovaginal cysts, intact hymen, vulval anus and intersex problems.Hormonal: Vulval atrophy in menopausal women.CANCER OFTHEVULVACancer of the vulva is a rare entity and accounts for 1-5% of all genital cancers.In developing countries, incidence is 50% lower.Malignant tumours of the vulva are grouped as follows:Pre-invasive lesions--intraepithelial cancer VIN I, II, IIIBowen disease }Intraepithelial carcinomasPaeet's diseaseMicroinvasiveMelanoma in situInvasive lesionsSquamous cell carcinoma--Most common 90%Melanoma 1-5%Adenocarcinoma 1%Sarcoma 2%Rodent ulcer or basal cell carcinoma 1%.The vulva can also occasionally be the site of metastatic cancer. Cancer of the vulva and the cervix may coexist in case it is caused by papilloma virus. Most of these malignant lesions are located on the labia majora. In 5%, the lesions are multifocal, and are seen in younger women below 40 years.",A
Beta HCG is secreted by:,Yolk sac,Liver,Syncytiotrophoblast,Umbilical cord,"Chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein with biological activity similar to that of LH Both LH and HCG act the same LH-hCG receptor. hCG has with a molecular weight of 36,000 to 40,000 Da It has the highest carbohydrate content of any human hormone--30 percent. The 36-hour plasma half-life of intact hCG is much longer than the 2 hours for LH. The hCG molecule is composed of two dissimilar subunits termed a and b subunits. hCG is produced almost exclusively in the placenta, but low levels are synthesized in the fetal kidney. The hCG hormone is structurally related to three other glycoprotein hormones --LH, FSH, and TSH. All four glycoproteins share a common a-subunit.However, each of their b-subunits, although sharing ceain similarities, is characterized by a distinctly different amino acid sequence. A single gene located on chromosome 6 encodes the a-subunit. Seven genes on chromosome 19 encode for the b-hCG-b-LH family of subunits. Six genes code for b-hCG and one for b-LH Before 5 weeks of pegnancy, hCG is expressed both in the syncytiotrophoblast and in cytotrophoblasts. Later, in the first trimester when maternal serum levels peak, hCG is produced almost solely in the syncytiotrophoblast The combined hCG molecule is detectable in plasma of pregnant women 7 to 9 days after the midcycle surge of LH that precedes ovulation. Thus, hCG likely enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Plasma levels riserapidly, doubling every 2 days in the first trimester Peak maternal plasma levels reach approximately 50,000 to 100,000 mIU/mL between the 60th and 80th days after menses. At 10 to 12 weeks' gestation, plasma levels begin to decline, and a nadir is reached by approximately 16 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the remainder of pregnancy. The principal urinary form is the terminal product of hCG degradation, namely, the b-core fragment. Concentrations of this fragment follow the same general pattern as that in maternal plasma, peaking at approximately 10weeks' gestation. The best-known biological function of hCG is the so-called rescue and maintenance of corpus luteum function--that is, continued progesterone production. Other hCG functions include promotion of relaxin secretion by the corpus luteum",C

This process is collectively termed degeneration, and the replacement substances dictate the naming of these degenerative types. Forms include hyaline, calcified, cystic, myxoid, carneous or red, and fatty. Hyaline degeneration is the most common form of degeneration that can occur in a uterine leiomyoma. It is thought to occur in up to 60% of uterine leiomyomas. As with many other types of degeneration, it happens when fibroids outgrow their blood supply. Hyaline degeneration involves the presence of homogeneous eosinophilic bands or plaques in the extracellular space, which represent accumulation of proteinaceous tissue.

In the first trimester, this ultrasound measurement is accurate to within 3 to 5 days. Estimating the uterine size on physical exam can result in an error of 1 to 2 weeks in the first trimester. Quantification of serum HCG cannot be used to determine gestational age because at any gestational age the HCG number can vary widely in normal pregnancies. A single serum progesterone level cannot be used to date a pregnancy; however, it can be used to establish that an early pregnancy is developing normally. Serum progesterone levels less than 5 ng/mL usually indicate a nonviable pregnancy, while levels greater than 25 ng/mL indicate a normal intrauterine pregnancy. Progesterone levels in conjunction with quantitative HCG levels are often used to determine the presence of an ectopic pregnancy.",C

A woman treated for infertility presents with 6-week amenorrhea with urinary retention. The most likely etiology is:,Retroverted uterus,Pelvic hematocoele,Impacted Cervical Fibroid,Carcinoma Cervix,"The patient in the question:

Was being treated for infertility.
Now H/O 6 weeks of amenorrhea.
Presents with urinary retention.
The first diagnosis which comes in our mind is the retroverted gravid uterus.
Points which favour the diagnosis are: The woman is pregnant and has complained of urinary retention.
But friends, here it is important to understand that retroverted gravid uterus causes urinary retention at 14-15 weeks of gestation (not 6 weeks).                                                                                                                                                  

So Option ""a"" is ruled out
Option ""b"" Pelvic hematocele

""Pelvic hematocele is formed in a patient complaining of 6 weeks amenorrhea in case of ectopic pregnancy."" Though pelvic hematocele causes urine retention but then other symptoms (pain) and signs of ectopic pregnancy should be present.

Option ""c"" Impacted cervical fibroid

""A cervical fibroid impacted in the pouch of Douglas can cause retention of urine. The onset of retention is acute and usually occurs immediately before menstruation when the uterus is further enlarged by congestion or during early pregnancy.""
The fibroid is associated with infertility.
Thus, an impacted cervical fibroid can explain all features seen this woman and is our option of choice.",C
"According to MTP Act, 2 doctor's opinion is required when pregnancy is :",10 weeks,6 weeks,> 12 weeks,> 20 weeks,"Ans. is c i.e. > 12 weeks Medical termination of Pregnancy act passed in 1971deg is an impoant topic.

THE MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY ACT, 1971 In India. the MTP act was passed in August 1971 and came into effect from April 1972. In extends to the whole of India except in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Indications : A. Therapeutic : When the continuation of pregnancy endangers the life of woman or may cause serious injury to her physical or mental health. B. Eugenic : When there is risk of the child being born with serious physical or mental abnormalities. This may occur. If the pregnant woman in the first three months suffers from : -- German measles, (incidence of congenital defects 10 to 12%). -- Smallpox or chicken pox. -- Toxoplasmosis. -- Viral hepatitis. Any severe viral infection. If the pregnant woman is treated with drugs like thalidomide, coisone, aminopterin, antimitotic drugs, or if she consumes hallucinogens or antidepressants. Mother is treated by X-rays or radioisotopes. Insanity of the parents. Humanitarian : When pregnancy has been caused by rape.deg Social : When pregnancy has resulted from the failure of contraceptive methods in case of a marrieddeg woman, which is likely to cause serious injury to her mental health. When social or economic environment, actual or reasonably expected can injure the mother's health. Rules : Only a qualified registered medical practitionerdeg possessing prescribed experience can terminate pregnancy. Chief Medical Officer of the district is empowered to ceify that a doctor has the necessary training to do aboions. A medical practitioner can qualify if he has assisted in performance of twenty-five cases ofdeg M. TR in a recognised hospital. The pregnancy should be terminated in Government hospitalsdeg, or in the hospitals recognised by the Governme: . Is No novemmental institutions may take up aboion if they obtain a licence from Chief Medical Officer of the district.deg The consent of the womandeg is required before conducting aboion. Written consent of the guardian is required if the woman is a minor (<18 years)degor a mentally ill person.deg Consent of husband is not necessary. Aboion cannot be performed on the request of the husband, if the woman herself is not willing. The woman need not produce proof of her age. The statement of the woman that she is over eighteen years of age is accepted. It is enough for the woman to state that she was raped, and it is not necessary that a complaint was lodged with the police. Professional secrecy has to be maintained. The Admission Register for the termination of pregnancies is secret document, and the information contained therein should not be disclosed to any person. If the period of pregnancy is below 12 weeks, it can be terminated on the opinion of a single doctor.deg // the period of pregnancy is between 12 and 20 weeks, two doctors must agree that there is an indication.deg Once the opinion is formed, the termination can be done by any one doctor. Termination is permitted upto 20 weeks of pregnancy.deg In an emergency, pregnancy can be terminated by a single doctor, even without required training (even after twenty weeks). without consulting a second doctor, in a private hospital which is not recognised. The termination of pregnancy by a person who is not registered medical practitioner (person concerned), or in an unrecognised hospital (the administrative head) shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a terra which shall not be less than two years, but which may extend to seven years.",C

Spinbarkeit is basically a test for assessing ovulation :At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and so profuse that the patient may notice a clear discharge, (called Normal ovulatory cascade). This ovulatory mucus has the propey of great elasticity and will withstand stretching up to a distance of over 10 cm. This phenomenon is called SPINBARKEIT, or thread test for oestrogen activity. Under the influence of progesterone after ovulation mucus becomes thick and opaque and breaks on stretching i.e. hostile for sperms Therefore, indirectly Spinbarkeit test can also detect cervical hostility.",D

With anovulatory cycles, the corpus luteum does not form and progesterone levels remain low. Fuhermore, with anovulatory cycles, the characteristic surge of LH and FSH at midcycle is absent and menses are usually painless. Irregular estrogen breakthrough bleeding that occurs with anovulatory cycles is the consequence of persistent ovarian estradiol secretion and an absence of luteal-phase progesterone secretion.",D
Causes of prolonged first stage of labor are all except: March 2009,Weak uterine contractions,CPD,Rigid perineum,Transverse presentation,"Ans. C: Rigid Perineum The first stage stas with uterine contractions leading to complete cervical dilation and is divided into latent and active phases. In the latent phase, irregular uterine contractions occur with slow and gradual cervical effacement and dilation. The active phase is demonstrated by an increased rate of cervical dilation and fetal descent. The active phase usually stas at 3-4 cm cervical dilation and is subdivided into the acceleration, maximum slope, and deceleration phases. The second stage of labor is defined as complete dilation of the cervix to the delivery of the infant. The third stage of labor involves delivery of the placenta. Prolonged first stage of labour Latent phase: Diagnosis of abnormal labor during the latent phase is uncommon and likely an incorrect diagnosis. Active phase: Around the time uterine contractions cause the cervix to become 3-4 cm dilated, the patient usually enters the active phase of the first stage of labor. There may be abnormalities of cervical dilation (protracted dilation and arrest of dilation) or descent abnormalities (protracted descent and arrest of descent). In general, abnormal labor is the result of problems with one of the 3 P' s.

In this situation since BP is not much raised falling in the category of mild preeclampsia and gestational age is 35 weeks, no need to induce labor (labor should be induced at 37 weeks in mild preeclampsia) i.e option ‘b’ ruled out.
I/V Furosemide and hydralazine again are not justified in mild preeclampsia patients (Role of antihypertensives is controversial in the setting of mild preeclampsia) i.e. option ‘a’ and ‘c’ ruled out.

Most impoant manifestation of ureterovaginal fistula is: September 2009,Hydronephrosis,Overflow incontinence,Stress incontinence,Continuous incontenence,"Ans. D: Continuous Incontenence The uncontrolled leakage of urine into the vagina is the hallmark symptom of patients with vesicovaginal fistulas. Patients may complain of urinary incontinence or an increase in vaginal discharge following pelvic surgery or pelvic radiotherapy with or without antecedent surgery. The drainage may be continuous; however, in the presence of a very small vesicovaginal fistula, it may be intermittent. Recurrent cystitis or pyelonephritis, abnormal urinary stream, and hematuria also should initiate a workup for vesicovaginal fistula. The time from initial insult to clinical presentation depends on the etiology of the vesicovaginal fistula. A vesicovaginal fistula secondary to a bladder laceration typically presents immediately. Approximately 90% of genitourinary fistulas associated with pelvic surgery are symptomatic within 7-30 days postoperatively. An a:lterior vaginal wall laceration associated with obstetric fistulas typically (75%) presents in the first 24 hours of delivery. In contrast, radiation-induced UGFs are associated with slowly progressive devascularization necrosis and may present 30 days to 30 years later. Patients with radiation-induced VVFs initially present with symptoms of radiation cystitis, hematuria, and bladder contracture.",D

She needs fertility sparing surgery.There haven't been enough successful trials on fertility sparing surgery in ovarian carcinoma.Currently two surgical options are available in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who desires to retain the fertility.Simple unilateral salpingooophorectomyStaging procedure (unilateral salpingooophorectomy, bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy and multiple biopsies).Simple unilateral salpingooophorectomy is done in patients with early stage disease whereas staging procedure is done in patients with advanced disease.Stage of the cancer is not mentioned in the question. But, staging procedure is not mentioned as an option. Thus, the answer is obvious i.e., unilateral salpingooophorectomy.Management of epithelial ovarian tumour.The initial management of patient with epithelial ovarian tumour is surgery.* Surgery is almost always performed in women suspected of epithelial ovarian cancer. The procedure is necessary to: -Obtain tissue at diagnosisAssess the extent of the diseaseAttempt optimal cyto reduction which is crucial for successful treatment.Treatment in patients with early stage diseasePatients with stage I or II disease (Tumour confined to the ovary and pelvis).These patients require -B/L salpingooophorectomy with hysterectomy.For management purpose early stage disease can be divided into two categories: - Patients with low risk.Patients with early stage disease and well differentiated encapsulated tumour - - They don't need any further t/t after surgery.Patients with high riskPatients with early stage disease with poorly differentiated tumours, those with pelvic extension, capsular rupture or involvement ascites or high grade lesions.These patients require Surgery with postoperative chemotherapyPatients with advanced disease (stage III or IV) (Distant metastasis, peritoneal implants).In these patients surgery is not enough.

"30-year-old G3P2 patient visits an antenatal clinic at 20 weeks. She reveals during history that her first baby was 4.6 kg delivered by cesarean section, second baby was 4-8 kg delivered by c/section. Gynaecologists suspects gestational diabetes and orders a GCT. The blood sugar levels after 50 gms of oral glucose are 206 mg/dl and the patient is thus confirmed as a case of gestational diabetes. All of the following are known complications of this condition except:",Susceptibility for infection,Fetal hyperglycemia,Congenital malformations in fetus,Neonatal hypoglycemia,"In the question, patient is presenting to the antenatal clinic at 20 weeks and is diagnosed as a case of gestational diabetes.
Note: Patients blood sugar levels after 50 gms of glucose i.e. after glucose challenge test are 206 mg/dl. Recall that if, after GCT blood sugar values are ≥ 200 mg/dl, there is no need for further testing by GTT and patient is diagnosed as a case of gestational diabetes.
As discussed in the text – in gestational diabetes, blood sugar levels are raised beyond 20-24 weeks of pregnancy, due to insulin resistance and hence free radicals (responsible for causing congenital malformations) are formed after 20-24 weeks and therefore it does not lead to congenital malformation as organogenesis is already complete by this age. Rest all options are complications of diabetes.",C

Primi patient with Rh negative blood group
She is 37 years old-elderly primi (>30 years) and has risk of Down syndrome (>35 years)
She is concerned about the risk of having a down syndrome baby at this age and so insists on having amniocentesis done.

Option a: Advise against amniocentesis as it will increase the risk of isoimmunisation –although the risk of isoimmunisation will definitely be increased but still I will not advise her against amniocentesis seeing her age and her concern.
Option b: Follow Rh titres carefully and give Anti D if evidence of isoimmunisation is present. Come on in the theory I have explained that Anti d should be given only if evidence of isoimmunisationt is absent. If isoimmunisation is present it means antibodies are already formed, hence no need for giving Anti D. Thus this statement is absolutely wrong.
Option c: Give Anti D at 28 weeks of pregnancy and after delivery if baby is Rh negative. If baby is Rh negative, no need to give Anti D.
Option d: Give Anti D prior to her amniocentesis: This is the most logical step which should be done in this case.
Option e: Give rubella vaccine as she is Rubella non immune: Now I don’t need to explain that Rubella vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy.",D

Diagnosis is,Ovarian Ca,Endometrioma,Tuberculosis,Borderline ovarian tumor,"Endometrioma Another clinical based question with insufficient information to make any confirm diagnosis. At the best we can try to make the most probable diagnosis. Let's first see CA-125. CA-125 This is a non-specific tumor marker. Cut off level of CA-125 is < 35 U/ml. Ca 125 levels, as described above, can be raised in all the four options, so not very helpful in reaching a diagnosis. But if we weigh CA-125 level in terms of significance then it is least significant in tuberculosis as it is neither used for diagnosis nor for follow-up in tuberculosis. Palpable mass may be present in all the four conditions. Infeility is a feature of both endometriosis and tuberculosis. But for ovarian cancers infeility is a risk factor, not a feature or presenting symptom. Coming to Age: Patient is 35 yrs old. Age of 35 yrs ours endometrioma most. Peak incidence of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (most common ovarian cancer) is at 56-60 yrs of age and for border line tumor average age is 46 yrs approximately (Novak). Patients with tuberculosis are in their twenties commonly, the maximum age incidence at diagnosis being 28 yrs.

In which of the following organ 'Peg Cells' are characteristically seen?,Vagina,Vulva,Ovary,Tubes,"The mucosa of uterine tubes or fallopian tubes is composed of a simple columnar epithelium on a lamina propria of loose connective tissue. The epithelium contains two interspersed, functionally impoant cell types: ciliated cells and darker staining secretory cells, or peg cells, whose apical ends typically bulge into the lumen. The cilia beat toward the uterus, causing movement of the viscous liquid film that covers the epithelial surface and contains glycoproteins and nutritive components produced by the secretory cells. Triggered primarily by estrogens, the cilia elongate and both cell types undergo hyperophy during the follicular growth phase of the ovarian cycle and undergo atrophy with loss of cilia during the late luteal phase.

Isotretinoin (Accutane) is a powerful drug for acne that has enormous potential for producing congenital anomalies when ingested in early pregnancy; it should never be used in pregnancy. Tetracyclines interfere with development of bone and can lead to stained teeth in children. Progesterone have been implicated in multiple birth defects, but controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a significant association with increased risk.

The recipient may suffer thromboses secondary to hyper-transfusion and subsequent hemoconcentration. Although the donor placenta is usually pale and somewhat atrophied, that of the recipient is congested and enlarged. Hydramnios can develop in either twin but is more frequent in the recipient because of circulatory overload. When hydramnios occurs in the donor, it is due to congestive heart failure caused by severe anemia.",B

True about instrumental vaginal delivery:,Full cervical dilatation is the only prerequisite,Forceps are used in all cases of breech delivery,"Forceps may be used, if ventouse fails",Ventouse cannot be used in rotational occipito- transverse/posterior delivery,"Ans. is b, i.e. Forceps are used in all cases of breech deliveryRef. Dutta Obs. 9/e, p 533; COGDT 10/e. p 468Conditions (Criteria) to be fulfilled prior to forceps operationFetal and uteroplacental criteriaMaternal criteria* The fetal head must be engaged* The cervix must be fully dilated* The membranes must be ruptured* The position and station of the fetal head must be known with certainty* No major cephalopelvic disproportion by clinical pelvimetry* Bladder must be emptied* Adequate analgesiaThus, fully dilated cervix is not the only prerequisite (Option ""a"" is incorrect).Option ""b"" i.e. Forceps are used in all cases of breech deliveryThe most commonly used method in breech presentation is the assisted breech delivery where Burns Marshall technique is used for the aftercoming head which does not involve the use of forceps but,Dutta 9/e, p 360 says ""Forceps can be used as a routine"".Sheila Balakrishnan p 454 says ""Forceps for the aftercoming head, Piper's forceps or any straight forceps can be used. This is the best method of delivery of the head.""COGDT 10/e, p 347 says ""Piper forceps may be used electively or when the Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver fails to deliver the aftercoming head"".So, forceps can be used routinely in breech deliveries but it is not a common practice. So, option 'b' can be kept in +/- status.Earlier we have studied that ventouse is used in unrotated/malrotated occipitotransverse/posterior deliveries (option 'd' incorrect).As far as option 'c' is concerned, i.e. Forceps may be used if ventouse fails.COGDT 10/e, p 468 says ""Under no circumstances should the operator switch from vacuum to forceps or vice versa. An excellent study examining neonatal injury clearly demonstrated that the greatest incidence of neonatal injury occurred in babies in whom both vacuum and forceps were used.""So, amongst all the options given, option 'b' is partially correct. We are taking it as the answer of choice here.",B

""Hematuria is not a feature of impending scar rupture"". How would an impending scar produce hematuria??? Hentaturia indicates bladder involvement - In some cases of uterine rupture, bladder rupture can also occur. These cases of utrine rupture presents with hematuria. ""So hematuria in a case of uterine rupture indicates that rupture has actually taken place, it is not impending"". ""Hematuria only occurs in uterine rupture when rupture has actually occurred and involved bladder too"". A common cause of hematuria during labour is obstructed labour. ""In obstructed labour the bladder becomes an abdominal organ and due to compression of urethra between the presenting pa and symphysis pubis, the patient .fails to empty the bladder. The transverse depression at the junction of the superior border of the bladder and the distended lower segment is often confused with the Bandls's ring. The bladder wall gets traumatized which may lead to blood stained urine, a common finding in obstructed labour"". Clinical features of impending scar rupture: ?

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the contraceptive effect of bih control pills that contain both synthetic estrogen and progestin?,Direct inhibition of oocyte maturation,Inhibition of ovulation,Production of uterine secretions that are toxic to developing embryos,Impairment of implantation hyperplastic changes of the endometrium,"The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Thus, the Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in bih control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses.",B

The foetal blood is separated from syncytiotrophoblast with all except :,Fetal blood capillary membrane,Mesenchyme of intervillous blood space,Cytotrophoblast,Decidua parietalis,"Ans. is d i.e. Decidua parietalis Friends, once again we will have to peep into embryology to answer this question. Formation of placenta : Placenta is formed by the trophoblast. The trophoblast is made up of a single layer of cells. Cells of trophoblast multiply to form distinct layers. The cells that are near to the decidua lose their cell boundaries to form syncytium. This layer of the trophoblast is known as the syncytiotrophoblast. Deep to the syncytium, the cells of the trophobiast retain their cell walls and form the second layer called as the cyto trophoblast. The cyto trophobiast rests on the mesoderm. Small cavities appear in the syncytiotrophoblast called as Lacunae. The lacunae are separated from one another by paitions of syncytium called as trabeculae. The syncytiotrophoblast grows into the endometrium (Decidua). As the endometrium is eroded. some of the maternal blood vessels are opened up and blood from them fills the lacunar space. So. lacunae have maternal blood. Each trabeculas is, initially made up entirely of syncytiotrophoblast. Later cells of cytotrophoblast begin to multiply and grow into each trabeculas. This is called as Primary Extra embryonic mesoderm then invades the centre of each primary villus. This is now called as secondary villus. Soon thereafter. fetal blood vessels can be seen in the mesoderm forming the core of each villus. The villus is called as Teiary villus. Thus the maternal blood in the lacuna is never in direct contact with fetal blood. They are separated by 1. Syncytiotrophoblast 1 2. Cytotrophoblast Together k/a 3. Basement membrane placental 4.

Which one of the following is the most common problem associated with the use of condom:,Increased monilial infection of vagina,Premature ejaculation,Contact dermatitis,Retention of urine,"Directions for use of condom

The condom should be put on by unrolling it over the erect penis after pulling back the foreskin, before there is any contact between the male and female organs. An airfree space should be left by squeezing the tip and holding it up, till it is unrolled fully for better collection of semen.
It should be used only once.
It should not be inflated for testing.
Vaseline oils, skin lotions, cold creams, should not be used as they increase the chance of rupture. If lubrication is needed, glycerine, K-Y jelly or spermicidal jelly can be used.
Soon after discharge, the male should withdraw the penis holding the condom firmly against his body
To increase the effectiveness, a dose of spermicidal jelly or foam tablet may be used at the same time. In case of breakage, slippage, or defective use, women should report or use emergency contraceptive within 72 hours and a spermicidal agent should be quicldy inserted into the vagina.

Advantages of condom

Condoms gives very good protection against STDs. These includes syphilis gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, moniliasis, nongonococcal urethritis, and infection with Chlamydia and Herpes virus.
They are the only contraceptives to protect against HIV and against sexually transmitted hepatitis B Virus.
Condoms reduce the chances of developing cervical dysplasia and cancer cervix (by preventing HPV infection)

Has central placenta pre Type IV i.e. vaginal delivery is contraindicated. cesarean section has to be done. Patient is having heavy bleeding. According to r-ernando Arias ""In patients with heavy bleeding an efficient management plan including life suppo measures and immediate operative intervention is the only way to avoid a maternal death."" it fuher says- -Patients witn placenta pre and severe bleeding should be delivered by cesarean section irrespective of the type of placenta pre."" So from above discussion it is very much clear that in this patient immediate cesarean section is the best reso. Friends here I want to point out, that this patient has central placenta pre so cesarean section has to be done, but even if heavy bleeding with minor degrees of placenta pre i.e. type I, Type II Anterior is there then too the answer would have been cesarean section and not vaginal delivery.

Ideal contraceptive for lactating mothers is aEUR',Barrier method,Combined OCP,Lactational amenorrhoea,Progesterone only pill,"Lactational amenorrhoea An almost similar question was asked previously in 'All India' examination. Note that previously 'Most effective' contraceptive was asked. Now the question is different -Ideal' contraceptive is asked. Practically, there are no ideal contraceptives (neither for lactating women, nor for non-lactating women). An Ideal contraceptive is one which is - 100% effective, 100% safe, reversible with no side effects, and minimal effect on lactation. The Barrier methods and Combined OCPs can be easily ruled out; as barrier methods have high failure rates if used alone, while combined OCPs have a negative effect on breast milk production. Lactational amenorrhoea is the most ideal contraceptive for a lactating women, as it has viually no side effects, rather it has plethora of benefits for both mother and child. About effectiveness, it is almost equally effective to Progesterone only pills (POPs) when used perfectly. (see the below table) Failure rates: Contraceptive method Typical use Perfect use LAM (6 months only) 2.0 0.5 IUD 0.8 0.6 POP 'mini pill' 8.0 0.5 Combined oral contraceptive 6-8 0.1 Barrier method 14 3.0 Lactational amenorrhoea (LAM) is a natural, safe and effective contraceptive method which can be used upto 6 months post paum if the following conditions are met. (Note that LAM is not pure simple exclusive breast feeding; following conditions need to be fulfilled) I. The mother should not experience vaginal bleeding after the 8 weeks postpaum. The baby is less than 6 months old. The baby is exclusively breastfed. Breast feeding is done at least every 4 hrs. during the day and every 6 hrs during night. If the above conditions are fulfilled then LAM can give more than 98% protection from pregnancy. It has the added benefit of promoting exclusive breast feeding which is the ideal nutrition for infants. Lactational Amenorrhoea Advantages Disadvantages * Very effective if used perfectly * Can be used only for a sho period * Has no side effects (6 months post paum) * Promotes exclusive breast feeding, and therefore enhances maternal and infant health. * Does not require inseion of any device at the time of sexual intercourse * Can be initiated immediately postpaum * Is economical and requires no commodities or supplies * Reduces mother's lifetime risk of breast cancer. Physiology of LAM: Infant's suckling is the stimulus that initiates the state of lactational amenorrhea for breastfeeding women. The act of suckling elevates prolactin levels, and reduces GnRH from the hypothalamus. This reduces LH release thus inhibiting .follicular maturation. This prevents ovulation. But, even with continued nursing, ovulation eventually returns after 6 months, so another method of contraception should be used 6 months postpaum, or sooner if the menses resume. Ovalation has been seen to resume even earlier in some patients, so some books advice 'Rule of 3' i.e. - another contraceptive method should be use along with LAM beginning from the 3rd postpaum month. - and if the women is paially breastfeeding or not breastfeeding, the contraceptive should begin by the 3rd postpaum week. Progesterone only pills are the most effective contraceptive during lactation amongst the options provided. They have drawbacks like: - Have to be taken regularly at the same time - Cause spotting or irregular bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, headache, nausea, acne, hirsuitism and weight gain",C

"Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by all of the following mechanisms, except :",Delaying / inhibiting ovulation,inhibiting feilization,preventing implantation of the feilized egg,Interrupting an early pregnancy,"Postcoital Contraception (Interceptives): interferes with postovulatory events leading to pregnancy and is therefore known as interceptive. It is also known as 'emergency contraception' method used to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of a condom during coitus taking place around ovulation. It is used in misplaced IUCD and missed pill. These postcoital methods should be used mainly as 'back-up' methods The preparations available include: -Two tablets of relatively high doses of combined pill (Ovran/Eugynon 50), containing 100 mcg EE2 and 1 mg norethisterone, or 500 mcg LNG, taken within 72 h of intercourse followed by two tablets taken 12 h later (Yuzpe and Lancee, 1977). Failure rate--3.2 per 100 woman years. Mode of action: The hormones may delay ovulation if taken soon after intercourse, cause corpus luteolysis, and bring about cervical mucus changes and endometrial atrophy. -Levonorgestrel (LNG). Prostinar tablet contains 0.75 mg LNG. One tablet should be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse and another 12 h later. Alternately, two tablets can be taken as a single dose. The failure rate is 1.1%. The tablets can be offered up to 120 h but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital-drug interval. LNG prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency). The period may come earlier or delayed. Side effects are those of progestogens. The hormone is not teratogenic in case pregnancy does occur but risk of ectopic pregnancy remains.Advantages: It has no oestrogen and its associated side effects, It can be offered to hypeensive, cardiac and diabetic woman,It can be offered to a lactating woman,It can be given as late as 120 h after the unprotected intercourse,Single-dose therapy is an advantage.Contraindicated in liver disease, contains lactate, so allergy to galactose. The drug is also contraindicated in a woman with history of thrombophlebitis and migraine. -RU 486 (Mifepristone) : RU 486 is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It does not prevent feilization but by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium, it causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and prevents implantation. It is not teratogenic. A single dose of 25-50 mg is effective in preventing pregnancy in 99.1% cases (failure rate 0.9%). It causes delayed menstruation. Ectopic pregnancy is not avoided. The drug is expensive as compared to LNG. -Ulipristal. Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, attaches to progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, prevents implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. Two per cent pregnancy rate is repoed. Side effects are headache and mood changes. -Centchroman. Two tablets (60 mg) taken twice in 24 h within 24 h of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% women. -GnRH Agonists. Daily administration of GnRH agonist (buserelin) prevents ovulation. The drug is on trial for its contraceptive effect. Very expensive--has to be given by subcutaneous injection. -Prostaglandin : Self-administered vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin following an unprotected intercourse, by viue of its luteolytic effect on the ovary and its increased motility effect on fallopian tubes and the uterus, prevents implantation and brings about menstruation. Its specific role as contraceptive is however yet to be established. -Copper T IUCD. Inseed within 5 days of intercourse can prevent implantation of a feilized ovum. Advantages of Copper T as emergency contraception are: It can be inseed as late as 5 days after the unprotected intercourse. It is cheap. Failure rate is 0.1%. It can remain as ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years. Reference : page 280 Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition",D

Cervical metaplasia :The cervix is composed of columnar epithelium which lines the Endocervix and squamous epithelium which covers the Ectocervix. The point at which they meet is known as squamo-columnar junction. This squamo-columnar junction is at the level of external os.deg Under the influence of hormones the sub columnar cells transform into squamous cells. This changing of one type of epithelium into the other is called as Metaplasia. Metaplastic cells are : Normal cells.deg No Nuclear atypia.deg Do not transform into malignant cells.deg Squamous metaplasia is a normal process and occurs most actively immediately adjacent to the original SCJ, creating a zone of metaplastic epithelium termed as Transformation zone between the original SCJ and columnar epithelium. ii. Dysplasia : Represents a change in which there is alteration in cell morphology and disorderly arrangement of the cells of the stratified squamous epithelium. It is a premalignant lesion. Characteristics of Dysplastic cell : Vary in sizedeg, shapedeg and polaritydeg.

Survival of twins after delivery depends upon various factors. What is the commonest cause of perinatal moality in twins?,Preterm,Infection,Head injury,Malnutrition,"Prematurity is the main cause of increased moality and morbidity in twins.

False about OHSS?,Associated with massive stromal oedema of the ovary,The enlarged ovaries may be prone to torsion,Patients with OHSS usually have enlarged ovaries (>10 cm) that may contain several hypoechoic areas,The symptoms associated with OHSS usually begin 15-20d after hCG is given,"Ans. D. The symptoms associated with OHSS usually begin 15-20d after hCG is givenOvulation induction promotes follicle maturation and oocyte release utilizing pharmacological agents. The most commonly used agent is Clomiphene citrate, which increases follicle-stimulating hormone release at the level of the hypothalamus. It is usually given for 5d during the mid-follicular phase and ovulation occurs l-10d following the final dose. Alternative ovulation induction agents include metformin and gonadotrophins.Transvaginal US is used to track the development of follicles and the endometrial thickness so that the dose of the agent can be titrated and intercourse or insemination can be correctly timed to coincide with ovulation. Although the maturity of the oocyte can only be indirectly inferred from the size of the follicle, the US information can be coupled with oestradiol values to provide an accurate assessment of the presence or absence and number of mature follicles. It is important to look for the complications of ovulation induction such as hyperstimulation. This occurs most commonly in gonadotrophin-induced cycles. The ovary becomes enlarged, sometimes massively so, and oedematous, containing multiple immature follicles. Abdominal ascites may also be demonstrated. The hyper stimulated ovaries are prone to torsion. The signs and symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation disorder are variable, ranging from mild abdominal discomfort, probably due to the distension of the ovarian capsule, to severe circulatory compromise and electrolyte imbalance. The more severe form, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), is usually associated with massive stromal oedema of the ovary. The enlarged ovaries may be prone to torsion. On US, patients with OHSS usually have enlarged ovaries (>10cm) that may contain several hypoechoic areas. The hypoechoic areas may correspond to atretic follicles or to regions of hemorrhage within the ovary. The symptoms associated with OHSS usually begin 5-8d after hCG is given, but they can be most severe in patients who actually achieve pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that hyperstimulation is unlikely in women whose ovaries contain several large (>15mm) follicles, and tends to occur when there are several small or intermediate-sized follicles. With supportive therapy, this syndrome usually regresses spontaneously.",D

A pathologist is examining five placentas from five different bihs. He notes the following characteristics in the five placentas: Patient A: fused dichorionic diamniotic Patient B: dichorionic diamniotic Patient C: circumvallate placenta Patient D: monochorionic diamniotic Which of the patients unquestionably gave bih to identical twins?,Patient A,Patient B,Patient C,Patient D,"Patient D is the lucky mother of identical (monozygotic) twins. The chorion forms before the amnion, so the possible combinations are monoamniotic and monochorionic; diamniotic and monochorionic; and diamniotic and dichorionic (either fused or separated). The first two of these possibilities are seen only in identical twins. However, the latter can be seen either in fraternal or identical twins. Exactly what happens in the case of identical twins depends on the precise point at which twinning occurs: very early separation produces completely separate membranes with duplication of both chorion and amnion; somewhat later separation produces one chorion and two amnions; and very late separation produces one chorion and one amnion. A dichorionic, diamniotic placenta develops if splitting occurs early after feilization, before the chorion forms. This type of placenta may occur with either monozygotic or dizygotic twins. Thus, we are unable to determine whether Patient A or Patient B had identical twins from the examination of the placentas. Patient C did not have a twin pregnancy. A circumvallate placenta has an extrachorial poion outside the inseion of the amniotic membranes, creating a circumferential groove (vallum in Latin). A bipaite placenta is composed of two equal segments. Circumvallate and bipaite placentas are examples of placental abnormalities that usually have no clinical significance.

Which of the following genes has been MOST closely associated with familial cases of ovarian cancer?,BRCA1,WT1,NF2,VHL,"Roughly 5-10% of cases of ovarian cancer occur in individuals who are a member of a cancer family. In familial cases of ovarian cancer, the cancers tend to appear at a younger age, but are thought to possibly have, on an average, a slightly better prognosis than do isolated cases. Families with multiple cases of breast cancer due to genetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also have an increased incidence of ovarian cancers. The BRCA1 mutation is paicularly virulent, and up to 30-40% of women with this mutation develop ovarian cancer. (There are also families in which the women have a BRCA1 mutation and develop ovarian, but not breast cancer at an increased rate). Another cancer syndrome, the Lynch II syndrome (also known as the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome), is also associated with ovarian cancer (and cancers of the uterus, breast, stomach, and pancreas). In both the breast cancer families and the Lynch II families, the genetic pattern seen is usually autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Prophylactic oophorectomy is often offered women in cancer families who have reached the age of 35 and have had their children. Note: NF2 is associated with neurofibromatosis type II, acoustic neuromas, and meningiomas. VHL is associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.

Fetal blood loss in abnormal cord inseion is seen in :,Vasa pre,Placenta pre,Battledore placenta,Succenturiate placenta,"Vasa Pre is usually associated with velamentous inseion when some of the fetal vessels in the membranes cross the region of cervical os and are below the presenting pa. Sometimes this can also occur with the succenturiate lobed placenta or with the marginal inseion of cord. This may be the cause for antepaum hemorrhage when with rupture of membranes, tearing of a fetal vessel may lead to fatal bleeding, fetal distress, and fetal death if not delivered immediately.

The Anti D binds to antigen sites on the fetal red cells so that these cells do not mount an immune response, provided the baby is Rh negative and direct coombs test done on baby is negative. If mother's IUT is positive or fetus has positive direct coombs test, it means mother is already immunised. In such cases their is no point in giving anti D.

If the UTZ demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is very unlikely.* On the other hand, if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries.* Beta-HCG also helps in diagnosis of pregnancy. It is positive in virtually 100% of ectopic pregnancies.* A positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine (ectopic).* In normal pregnancy beta-HCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of beta HCG is slow.CULDOCENTESIS* Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen.* This procedure will reveal non-clotted blood if intra- abdominal bleeding has occurred.* Clotted bloods signify ruptured ectopic pregnancy.* If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately.",A

The working intra-abdominal pressure used in gynecological laparoscopy:,10-15 mm Hg,15-20 mm Hg,20-30 mm Hg,30-50 mm Hg,"The amount of gas transmitted into the peritoneal cavity should depend on the measured intraperitoneal pressure, not the volume of gas inflated. Intraperitoneal volume capacity varies significantly between individuals. Most prefer to insufflate to 25 to 30 mm Hg for positioning the cannulas. This means that enough CO2 is insufflated to increase the pressure of the system to 25-30 mm hg with which there is extra volume and enough counter pressure against the peritoneum, facilitating introduction of the cannula and potentially reducing the chance of bowel or posterior abdominal wall and vessel trauma. After placement of the cannulas, the pressure should be dropped to 10 to 15 mm Hg, essentially eliminates hypercarbia or decreased venous return of blood to the hea 10-15 is essentially the 'Working pressures' in laparoscopic surgery.",A

Although estrogen has been repoed to decrease urgency, frequency, and nocturia in menopausal women, its effect on correction of stress urinary incontinence or vesicle instability is unclear. In the elderly population there are also many transient causes of incontinence that the physician should consider. These include dementia, medications (especially a-adrenergic blockers), decreased patient mobility, endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypothyroidism), stool impaction, and urinary tract infections.",D

The first step in the management of hirsutism due to stein leventhal syndrome is :,OCP,HMG,Spironolactone,Bromocriptine,"Ans. is a i.e. OCP Friends, all the options given in the question are used for treatment of PCOS but only OCP and spironolactone are used for managing hirsutism. The first step done in general practise in OPD's when a patient of PCOS comes is : Advise : Weight reduction. 'Weight reduction in obese patients is the initial recommendation because it reduces insulin, SHBG and androgen levels (mainly calculated or bioavailable testosterone) and may restore ovulation either alone or combined with ovulation induction agents."" Drug therapy If a patient has hirsutism primary goal is lowering androgen levels to halt futher conversion of vellus hairs to terminal ones. Drugs used are : i. OCP's ? ""Combination OC's decrease adrenal and ovarian steroid production and reduce hair growth in nearly two - third of hirsute patients."" ""Combined oral contraceptive - COC's are effective in establishing regular menses and lowering ovarian androgen production. As an additional effect, the estrogen component of these pills leads to increased SHBG levels. With higher SHBG levels, a greater amount of free testosterone is bound and thus becomes biologically unavailable at the hair follicle."" Gonadotropin releasing horomone agonists - ""GnRH agonists effectively lower Gonadotropin levels over time, and in turn subsequently lower androgen levels. Despite their effectiveness in treating hirsutism, administration of these agents is not a preferred long term treatment method due to associated bone loss. high cost and menopausal side effects."" iii Androgne receptor antagonists - like spirono lactone, cyproterone acetate and flut amide. These antiandrogens are competitive inhibitors of androgen binding to the androgen receptor. ""Although these agents are effective in the treatment of hirsutism, they carry a risk of several side effects. Metrorrhagia may frequently develop. In addition, as antiandrogens, these drugs bear a theoretical risk of pseudo hermaphroditism in male fetuses of women using such medication in early pregnancy. None of these antiandrogen agents are approved by the FDA for treatment of hyperandrogenism and thus are used off-label."" iv. 5 a reductase inhibitor : Conversion of testosterone to dihydro testosterone can be decreased by 5 a reductase inhibitor, Finasteride. It is modestly effective in treating hirsutism and similar to other antiandrogens the risk of male fetus teratogenecity is present. So, friends after such a detailed discussion on the management of hirsutism. You can very well understand that the first line therapy for management of hirsutism are combined oral contraceptive pills. Also know Other methods of treating hirsutism : Eflornithine hydrochloride cream : It is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase enzyme. This enzyme is necessary for hair follicle cell division and function, and its inhibition results in slower hair growth. Its main disadvantage is that it does not permanantly remove hair. Mechanical methods : -- In includes : depilation creams Depilation methods i.e. hair removal Epilation methods i.e. methods which remove the above the skin surface eg. - entire hair shaft and root. -- shaving Mechanical methods Thermal destruction using -- plucking electrolysis or laser -- waxing Note : While prescribing OCP's in a case of hirsutism : Do not prescribe OCP's containing norgestrel and norethindrone acetate as they have androgenic activity. OCP's containing Illrdeg generation progestins like gestodene, Desogestrel, norgestimate drospirenone are the best, as they have minimum androgenic activity.",A

Commonest cause of ectopic pregnancy: March 2007,Previous tubal disease,Oral contraceptives,IUCD,Endometriosis,"Ans. A: Previous Tubal Disease Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the feilized egg to the uterus. Damage to the cilia or blockage of the Fallopian tubes is likely to lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) increases the occurrence of ectopic pregnancy by 6-10 fold. This results from the build-up of scar tissue in the Fallopian tubes, causing damage to cilia. If however both tubes were occluded by PID, pregnancy would not occur and this would be protective against ectopic pregnancy. IUD increases the likelihood of tubal pregnancy by 7 times, should the pregnancy occurs with IUD in situ. Progestin only pill/postcoital estrogen preparations increases the risk due to impaired tubal motility. Tubal ligation can predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) carries a risk for ectopic pregnancy. A history of ectopic pregnancy increases the risk of future occurrences to about 10%. Ectopic pregnancy occasionally occurs in women who have had a hysterectomy. Women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero (aka ""DES Daughters"") also have an elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy, up to 3 times the risk of unexposed women.",A

At term, both are 50-60% higher than in the non-pregnant state.> This parallels the increases in blood volume and cardiac output. The elevations in plasma flow and glomerular filtration result in an elevation in creatinine clearance.> Blood urea and serum creatinine are reduced by 40%.> The increase in glomerular filtration may overwhelm the ability of the renal tubules to reabsorb leading to glucose and protein losses in the urine. Thus, mild glycosuria (1-10 gm/day) and/or proteinuria (to 300 mg/day) can occur in normal pregnancy.> There is also an increase in filtered sodium, but tubular absorption is increased by an increase in aldosterone secretion, via the renin-angiotensin mechanism.

A 32 weeks pregnant lady presents in emergency room with continuous bleeding per vaginum. The uterus is painful and tender. Most likely diagnosis is: September 2007,Circumvallate placenta,Rupture of membranes,Placenta praveia,Accidental hemorrhage,"Ans. D: Accidental Hemorrhage Bleeding in abruption placentae is painful and continuous Bleeding in circumvallate placenta is slight. Women with placenta pre often present with painless, bright red vaginal bleeding. This bleeding often stas mildly and may increase as the area of placental separation increases. Prae should be suspected if there is bleeding after 24 weeks of gestation. Abdominal examination usually finds the uterus non-tender and relaxed. Leopold's Maneuvers may find the fetus in an oblique or breech position or lying transverse as a result of the abnormal position of the placenta. Prae can be confirmed with an ultrasound.

"A 22-year-old nulliparous woman has recently become sexually active. She consults you because of painful coitus, with the pain located at the vaginal introitus. It is accompanied by painful involuntary contraction of the pelvic muscles. Other than confirmation of these findings, the pelvic examination is normal. Of the following, what is the most common cause of this condition?",Endometriosis,Psychogenic causes,Bartholin's gland abscess,Vulvar atrophy,"This patient presents with vaginismus, defined as involuntary painful spasm of the pelvic muscles and vaginal outlet. It is usually psychogenic. It should be differentiated from frigidity, which implies lack of sexual desire, and dyspareunia, which is defined as pelvic and/or back pain or other discomfort associated with sexual activity Dyspareunia is frequently associated with pelvic pathology such as endometriosis, pelvic adhesions, or ovarian neoplasms. The pain of vaginismus may be psychogenic in origin, or may be caused by pelvic pathology such as adhesions, endometriosis, or leiomyomas. Treatment of vaginismus is primarily psychotherapeutic, as organic vulvar or pelvic causes (such as atrophy, Bartholin's gland cyst, or abscess) are very rare.",B
A pregnant female has past history of embolism in puerperium. What medical management she should take in next pregnancy to avoid this:,Cumpulsory prophylaxis with warfarin start at 10 weeks,To take warfarin after delivery,Chance of thromboembolism increases by 12% in next pregnancy,Does not need anything,"Ans. is b, i.e. To take warfarin after deliveryRef. Williams 23/e, p 1028, 29, Table 47.6Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we do not study in detail during under graduation.So, I am giving in brief, all the important points you need to remember;Venous thromboembolism in pregnancyVenous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries.Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of Virchow's triad are increased. QA, Deep vein thrombosis:Left sided DVT is more common than right sided DVT.Homans sign-i.e. pain in calf muscles on dorsiflexion of foot is positive.InvestigationsRecommended method during pregnancy: Doppler ultrasoundGold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy); VenographyThough objective evidence is ideal, treatment should be started on clinical grounds, if confirmatory tests are not available.ManagementDrug of choice in pregnancy is unfractionated heparinLow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin) are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. But they should not be used ini. Women with prosthetic valvesii. Renal failureiii. With regional analgesiaWarfarin is not safe during pregnancy as it crosses placenta and can cause fetal malformations (Conradi syndrome). The single undisputed use for warfarin in pregnancy is in women with prosthetic heart valves.Monitoring is done by - APTT and Platelet count.ProtocolFor postpartum venous thrombosis, treatment with IV heparin and warfarin are started simultaneously 6-8 hours after vaginal delivery and 24 hours after cesarean section and once INR is between 2 and 3, heparin is discontinued and warfarin is continued for 6 weeks.Note: Warfarin is absolutely safe in lactation.ThromboprophylaxisWomen at risk of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy have been grouped into different categories depending on the presence of risk factors. Thromboprophylaxis to such a woman depends on the specific risk factor and the category. (1) A low risk woman has no personal or family history of VTE and are heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation. Such a woman need no thromboprophylaxis, (2) A high risk woman is one who has previous VTE or VTE in present pregnancy, or antithrombin--III deficiency. Such a woman needs low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and postpartum 6 weeks. Women with antithrombin-III deficiency can be treated with antithrombin-III concentrate prophylactically.Now lets have a look at the question: It says a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant, what medical management should be given to her.Option 'a' i.e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks.It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy.Option 'b' i.e. to take warfarin after delivery - As discussed above, in all high risk patients, post partum prophylaxis with warfarin has to be given as peuperium is the time of greatest risk for embolism/thromboembolism. Thus option b is correct.During pregnancy: A women with previous H/O embolism becomes high risk patient. In such patients prophylaxis with heparin needs to be given. Hence option 'd' is incorrect.",B

"A 31-year-old woman presents to the emergency depament because of two days of abdominal pain without vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination reveals a closed cervical os and right adnexal pain. The serum beta hCG level is 9,000 mIU/mL. An endovaginal ultrasound demonstrates no intrauterine gestational sac. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Ectopic pregnancy,Incomplete aboion,Ovarian torsion,Ruptured ovarian cyst,"The primary use of pelvic ultrasonography in women with lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a positive pregnancy test is to establish the diagnosis of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). Transvaginal ultrasound should visualize an IUP when the serum beta hCG level is more than 1,200 mIU/mL. If an IUP is not present, then the pregnancy lies outside of the uterine cavity, the patient has just had a miscarriage, or the pregnancy is less developed than menstrual dates indicate. The absence of vaginal bleeding and the closed cervical os suggest that an incomplete aboion is unlikely, but place this patient at high risk for ectopic pregnancy.

Change noticed in diastolic blood pressure in pregnancy is: March 2010,Decline of 10-20 mm of Hg,Decline of 5-10 mm of Hg,Elevation of 10-20 mm of Hg,Elevation of 5-10 mm of Hg,"Ans. B: Decline of 5-10 mm of Hg Systemic blood pressure declines slightly during pregnancy. There is a little change in systolic blood pressure, but diastolic pressure is reduced (5-10mm Hg) from about 12-26 weeks. Diastolic pressure increases thereafter to prepregnancy levels by about 36 weeks. The obstruction posed by the uterus on the inferior vena cava and the pressure of fetal presenting pa on the common iliac vein can result in decreased blood return to the hea. This decreases cardiac output, leads to a fall in blood pressure, and causes edema in the lower extremities. Peripheral resistance equals blood pressure divided by cardiac output. Because blood pressure either decreases or remain the same during pregnancy and cardiac output increases appreciably, there is good evidence that peripheral resistance declines markedly.",B
"In a study it is observed that the right ovary ovulates more than the left, all are possible explanation for the cause except",Anatomical difference between right and left side,Difference in blood supply to both sides,Right handedness is more common in population,Some embryological basis,"Ans. c. Right handedness is more common in population It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. Ovulation In the primate, it is suggested that ovulations occur with equal frequency in the left and right ovary. In the humans, there is some controversy about the frequency of ovulation on either side It is believed that in normally menstruating women, ovulation was significantly higher in right ovary. It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the IVC. The left renal vein is thought to be under pressure than the right and therefore drain slower. Because the left ovary drain slower, the collapsed follicle (corpus leuteum) takes longer to clean and thereby diminishes the chances that ovulation will occur on that side the following month. No such condition exists on the right side, that's why successive right side ovulation is more common",C

True about diabetes in pergnancy are all except :,Glucose challenge test is done between 24-28 weeks,50 gm of sugar is given for screening test,Insulin resistance improves with pregnancy,Diabetes control before conception is impoant to prevent malformation,"Ans. is c i.e. Insulin resistance improves with pregnancy In pregnancy, the insulin sensitivity decreases i.e. insulin resistance increases as the gestation advances mainly due to anti insulin signals produced by placenta (mainly human placental lactogen). Congenital malformations in a diabetic mother occur within first 8 weeks of gestation when most women are just begining prenatal care. Therefore preconceptional counselling is very essential in a diabetic mother Screening for diabetes during pregnancy : Glucose Challenges Test ? Screening for gestational diabetes is performed by orally administering 50g of glucose and measuring venous plasma glucose 1 hour later. (The test is done irrespective of the time of last meal and can be done at any time of day) Interpretation of result : - Plasma glucose : Interpretation - 140 mg/dl Fuher testing by GTT required - 140mg/dI Fuher testing not required. - >200mg/dI No fuher testing required as values > 200mg/dl confirm the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Time for screening : between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation (patients at high risk should be screened as early as possible and if initial screenings is negative it can be repeated between 26 and 30 weeks). Instead of 'universal screening', a 'selective screening' should be adopted Glucose Tolerance test : Patients with abnormal screening test are followed by a 3 hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) The test is performed with 100gm of glucose.(As recommended by ACOG. Note: WHO recommends 75 gm GTT) Upper limit of normal for the 3 hour glucose tolerance test during pregnancy Fasting : 95mg/dI - One hour 180mg/dI - Two hour 155mg/dI - Three hour : 140mg/dI Result If two or more of these values are abnormal : Gestational diabetes is confirmed. if one value is abnormal : Increased risk of complications like macrosomia and preeclampsia - eclampsia. (Though gestational diabets is not present) The GTT should be performed in the morning after an overnight fast of atleast 8 hours but not more than 14 hours and after atleast 3 days of unrestricted diet ( 150 gm carbohydrated) and physical activity The subject should remain seated and should not smoke during the test",C

"Apoptosis can occur by change in hormone levels in the ovarian cycle.

Shaws 13th/e page 47, (12th/e p 39& 38)After ovulation corpus luteum forms and starts secreting estrogen, progesterone and inhibin. (The increased LH at the time of ovulation is responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum).Continued increase in estrogen and progesterone exerts inhibitory effect on Hypothalamus and pituitary (Remember that increased estrogen plus moderate amount of progesterone exerts negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary whereas increased estrogen and small amount of progesterone exerts positive feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus and cause LH surge).So due to negative feedback of increased estrogen and moderate amount of progesterone the LH and FSH secretion decreasesDue to decreased LH, the corpus luteum starts degenerating and degenerates completely by about 9 days after ovulation.Due to degeneration of corpus luteum estrogen and progesterone secretion decreases rapidly. Due to rapid decrease in estrogen and progesterone the endometrium is unable to sustain itself and sloughs off (this is the end of menstrual cycle)On the other hand if fertilization occurs placenta will be formed. The placenta starts secreting a hormone called b HCG which maintains the corpus luteum and thus corpus luteum continues secreting estrogen and progesterone. The estrogen and progesterone maintains endometrium and thus pregnancy is sustained.",A

"Choose the virus that is responsible for ""Cataracts, cardiac defects, deafness"" when the fetus is exposed in utero (CHOOSE 1 VIRUS)",Cytomegalovirus,Rubella,Varicella zoster,Rubeola,"Viral infections during pregnancy are of great concern. The risk to the fetus is greatest during the first trimester. In most instances, congenital infection results from transplacental transmission of the virus during maternal viremia. In addition, perinatal infection may result from acquisition of virus by passage of the infant through a contaminated birth canal. Cytomegalovirus, rubella, and varicella are well established as teratogens. Congenital disease may range from mild symptoms to major congenital defects to asymptomatic disease with late sequelae. Hepatitis B is only rarely transmitted in utero-more usually at the time of birth and may cause a mild to severe hepatitis in infancy or, more commonly, result in a carrier state. Carriers run the risk of developing cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma later in life. Rubeola is uncommon in pregnancy and has not been associated with any specific anomalies.",B

Most common genital prolapse is :,Cystocoele,Procidentia,Rectocoele,Enterocoele,"Ans. is a i.e. Cystocoele Genital prolapse : refers to protusion of the pelvic organ into or out of the vaginal wall. Classification of prolapse Anterior vaginal wall : upper two thirds - cystocoele Cytourethrocoele lower one third - urethrocoele Posterior vaginal wall : upper one third - enterocoele (pouch of Douglas Hernia) Grade I = Descent halfway to the hymen Grade II = Descent to the hymen Grade IIt = Descent halfway past the hymen Grade IV = Maximum possible descent for site Bader walker Halfway system : 11, Grade 0 = Normal postion for each reproesentative site Uterine descent : Shaw's classification (old classification) : 1deg- descent of the cervix to the vagina 2deg - descent of the cervix to the introitus 3deg - descent of the cervix outside the introitus. Procidentia : all of the uterus outside the introitus. Utero vaginal Prolapse : It is the commonest type of prolapse. Cystocoele occurs first followed by traction on the cervix causing retroversion of the uterus and then uterus is pushed into the vagina. Vault prolapse : it follows vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, symptoms are-coital difficulty and difficulty in walking. Congenital Prolapse : There is no cystocoele. ""Data from Women's Health Initiative revealed anterior pelvic organ prolapse in 34.3%, posterior wall prolapse in 18.6% and uterine prolapse in 14.3% of women in the study.""

The requirement of which nutrient cannot be compensated by dietary intake in pregnancy,Iron,Protein,Carbohydrate,Fats,"(Iron) (121 -Shaw's 15th)Adequate energy intake and a diversified diet that includes fruit,vegetables, and animal products throughout the life cycle help ensure that women enter pregnancy and lactation without dcficienciesand obtain adequate nutrients during periods of heightened dcmand.Some nutrient requirements, particularly iron, folic acid, and vitaminA, aremore difficult to achieve than others through food sources.For this reason, supplements with these nutrients are recommendedin addition to improved diets. Fortified foods should be promotedthrough counseling and social marketing in countries where foodsfortified with iron, iodine, folic acid, or vitamin A are available andaffordable.IRON* In the absence of Iron supplementation, there is drop in hemoglobin serum iron, and serum ferritin concentration at term pregnancy thus pregnancy is an inevitable iron deficiency state* Daily iron requirement in non menstruating women to compensate the overage daliy loss is 1 mg. Thus in the second help, the daily requirement, actually becomes very much increased to the extent of about 6-7 mg* Total iron requirement during pregnancy is estimated approximately 1000 mg* The fall in the hemoglobin concentration during pregnancy is due to combined effect of hemodilution and negative iron balance* Folic acid supplementation beginning 1 month before conception to about 12 weeks of pregnancy has reduced the incidence of neural tube defects signilicantly A dose of 4 mg daily is recommended* Folic acid deficient most commonly seen in a pregnant mother who is on phenytoin therapy for epilepsy",A

"In early pregnancy, doubling time of beta HCG is-",24 hours,48 hours,96 hours,2 weeks,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., 48 hours * Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): Glycoprotein, with biological activity very similar to luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which act via the plasma membrane LH-hCG receptor. It is secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts.* This hormone is structurally related to three other glycoprotein hormones: LH, FSH, and TSH. The amino acid sequence of the a- subunits of all four glycoproteins is identical.* hCG is detectable in plasma of pregnant women as early as day 22 of menstrual cycle by RRA (radioreceptor assay) or day 25th of menstrual cycle by RIA (radioimmunoassay).* hCG enters maternal blood at the time of blastocyst implantation. Blood levels increase rapidly, doubling every 2 days, with maximal levels being attained at about 8-10 weeks of gestation.* From 10 to 12 weeks the level begins to decline to reach the nadir at 20 weeks. Plasma levels are maintained at this lower level for the rest of pregnancy.* It completely disappears from circulation 2 weeks postpartum.* The best-known biological function of the hCG is the rescue and maintenance of function of the corpus luteum, that is, continued progesterone production.",B

Most common cause of platelet.L in pregnancy :,Immune,Incidental,Idiopathic,Benign Gestational,"Ans. is d i.e. Benign Gestational Gestational thrombocytopenia / Benign Gestational Thrombocytopenia It is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia accounting for 80-90% of all cases of thrombocytopenia occuring during pregnancy. Exact cause is not known (may be due to hemodilution and increased platelet consumption.) Platelet count is rarely <70,000/mm3. Women are asymptomatic and their is no H/O bleeding. Condition is benign and has no risk to mother or infant. The only problem associated with it is - that anaesthesiologists are reluctant to give epidural or spinal anaesthesia if platelet count is < 1lakh/mm3. Treatment with steroids and IgG or platelet transfusion before delivery is sometimes necessary. Other rare causes of thrombocytopenia during pregnnacy : Associated with eclampsia / preclampsia/HELLP syndrome Immune thrombocytopenia Consumptive coagulopathy from placental abruption, severe obstetrical heamorrhage.

"A 57-year-old woman presents to a physician with chronic pelvic pain of many years duration. On fuher questioning, the woman also repos urinary frequency, constipation, pain with intercourse and bloating. On physical examination, a large mass is felt in the pelvic area. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrates that the mass involves the right adnexa and is composed of multiloculated cystic spaces. Prior to sending the patient to surgery, the primary care physician wants to order a serum tumor marker to screen for ovarian cancer. Which of the following would be the best choice?",Adrenocoicotropic hormone,CA-125,Galactosyltransferase,S-100,"The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive hea failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer.

In the question, FSH levels are 6mIU/mL, that means this is a case of secondary amenorrhea with normal FSH values.* In case of pituitary failure - as is evident from the flow diagram - values of FSH should be lower than the normal values. So Option'd' is ruled out* Incase of ovarian failure - estrogen is deficient so negative feedback on FSH will be absent, thus values of FSH will be more than normal. In case of ovarian failure/ menopause, FSH is above 40mIU/mL so option a is also ruled out.* Normal FSH and amenorrhea point towards uterine pathology. The patient had a spontaneous abortion following which a curettage is generally required which would be responsible for intrauterine synechiae (Asherman's Syndrome). Thus, the most probable diagnosis is uterine synechiae.KEY POINTSRememberHyperprolactinemia leads to decreased levels of FSH.",B

Following fetal tocographic finding was seen in a 30- year- old female patient in labor. What does it suggest?,Early cord compression,Fetal distress,Head compression,Fetal anemia,"Ans. b. Fetal distress (Ref: Williams Obstetrics 24/e p340) Late decelerations, typical of fetal distress can be seen in the given fetal tocography. Methods of Monitoring Fetal Heart Rate Fetal stethoscope (Pinard) & Hand-held Doppler (Sonicaid) Cardiotocograph (CTG) Cardiotocography (CTG) CTG: Technical means of recording (-graphy) fetal heartbeat (cardio-) & uterine contractions (-toco-) during pregnancy, typically in third trimester. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a Cardiotocograph, more commonly known as an Electronic Fetal Monitor (EFM). Two separate transducers perform recordings, one for the measurement of fetal heart rate & second one for uterine contractions. Types of measurement: Each of the transducers may be either external or internal. External measurement means taping or strapping the two sensors to the abdominal wall. This is called an indirect measure. Internal measurement (direct) requires a certain degree of cervical dilatation, as it involves insetting a pressure catheter into the uterine cavity, as well as attaching a scalp electrode to the childs head to adequately measure the electric activity of the fetal heart. Interpretation: Includes description of uterine activity (contractions), baseline fetal heart rate, baseline FHR variability, presence of accelerations, periodic or episodic decelerations The 3 primary mechanisms by which uterine contractions can cause a decrease in fetal heart rate are compression of fetal head, umbilical cord & uterine myometrial vesselsQ. Variability Baseline variability refers to the variation of fetal heart rate from one beat to the next. Variability occurs as a result of the interaction between nervous system, chemoreceptors. baroreptors & cardiac responsiveness. This is because a healthy foetus will constantly be adapting it's heart rate to respond to changes in it's environment. Normal variability is between 10-25 bpm To calculate variability you look at how much the peaks & troughs of the heart rate deviate from baseline rate (in bpm) Variability can be categorised as: Reassuring > 5 bpmQ Non-reassuring <5 bpm for between 40-90 minutesQ Abnormal <5 bpm for >90 minutesQ Accelerations Abrupt increase in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for >15 secondsQ The presence of accelerations is reassuring Antenatally there should be at least 2 accelerations every 15 minutesQ Accelerations occurring alongside uterine contractions is a sign of a healthy foetusQ Decelerations Decelerations: Abrupt decrease in baseline heart rate of >15 bpm for > 15 seconds Types of deceleration Early deceleration * Start when uterine contraction begins & recover when uterine contraction stops * Due to increased foetal intracranial pressure causing increased vagal tone * Resolves once the uterine contraction ends & intracranial pressure reduces * Considered to be physiological & not pathological Variable deceleration * Seen as a rapid fall in baseline rate with a variable recovery phase * Variable in their duration & may not have any relationship to uterine contractions * Seen during labour & in patients with reduced amniotic fluid volume * Variable decelerations are usually caused by umbilical cord compression * The umbilical vein is often occluded first causing an acceleration in response * Then the umbilical artery is occluded causing a subsequent rapid deceleration * When pressure on the cord is reduced another acceleration occurs & then the baseline rate returns * Accelerations before & after a variable deceleration are known as the ""shoulders of deceleration"" * Variable decelerations can sometimes resolve if the mother changes position * The presence of persistent variable decelerations indicates the need for close monitoring Late deceleration * Begin at the peak of uterine contraction & recover after the contraction ends. * Indicates there is insufficient blood flow through the uterus & placenta, foetal hypoxia & acidosis due to reduced uteroplacental blood flow. * If foetal blood pH is acidotic it indicates significant foetal hypoxia & the need for emergency C-section Prolonged deceleration * A deceleration that last more than 2 minutes * If it lasts between 2-3 minutes it is classed as non-reassuring * It it lasts longer than 3 minutes it is immediately classed as abnormal * Action must be taken quickly,e.g.. Foetal blood sampling/emergency C-section Sinusoidal Pattern A smooth, regular, wave-like pattern, frequency of around 2-5 cycles a minute, stable baseline rate around 120-160 bpm, no beat to beat variability It indicates severe foetal hypoxia, severe foetal anaemia, foetal/ maternal haemorrhageQ Management: Immediate C-section is indicated for this kind of pattern. Significance: This type of pattern is rare, however if present it is very serious, it is associated with high rates of foetal morbidity & mortality. Outcome is usually poor.",B

Main hormone acting upon uterus to initiate labour,Oxytocin,Estrogen,Progesterone,Cortisole,"Oxytocin is a nonapeptide,
 It is secreted by posterior pituitary along with vasopressin (ADH).
Both oxytocin and ADH are synthesized within the nerve cell bodies in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus; are transported down the axon and stored in the nerve endings within the neurohypophysis.
They are stored in separate neurones as complexes with their specific binding proteins (Neurophysin).

 Actions 

Uterus It increases the force and frequency of uterine contraction. Estrogens sensitize the uterus to oxytocin, while progestins decrease the sensitivity. The increased contractility is restricted to the fundus and body„ lower segment is not contracted, may even be relaxed at term.
Breast Oxytocin contracts myoepithelium of mammary alveoli and forces milk into bigger sinusoids - Milk ejection or milk letdown reflex.

Women with familial Lynch II syndrome suffering from anorectal and breast cancer are also likely to suffer from endometrial cancer* Tamoxifen given to women with breast cancer increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer to 2- 3 folds* Combined oral hormonal pills have protective effect and reduce its risk by 40-50% and also adding progestogens for 12 days each cycle to oestrogen in HRT reduces its risks to 20%**** Obesity, hypertension and diabetes characterize this cancer in 30%* Infertile women and women with PCOS on account of non-ovulation have high oestrogen.

Normal size but non functioning uterus is usually associated with :,Stenosis of the external os,Uterine synechiae,Paial agenesis of the vagina,Complete absence of vagina,"A hysterosalpingogram or preferably a diagnostic hysteroscopy helps to establish the diagnosis of Asherman syndrome, first described in 1948. Operative hysteroscopy to lyse the synechiae, followed by cyclic hormonal therapy with high doses of conjugated oestrogens of 2.5-5.0 mg/day for 3-6 months, results in the restoration of menstruation in about 50% cases. Some surgeons prefer to inse an intrauterine device in the uterine cavity after lysis of adhesions to ensure keeping the cavity patent and prevent recurrence of adhesions. Asherman syndrome is caused by dilatation and curettage (D&C), medical termination of pregnancy (MTP), uterine packing in postpaum haemorrhage, uterine infection and tubercular endometritis. It causes amenorrhoea, oligomenorrhoea, dysmenorrhoea, habitual aboion and infeility depending upon the extent of uterine cavity obliteration.

"A pregnant lady complaints of headache, feeling of excessive tiredness and drowsiness whenever she lies down in supine position. Her symptoms are relieved on sitting up and while lying on her side. What is the most likely diagnosis?",IVC compression,Compression on sympathetic chain,Raised intra abdominal pressure,Decreased blood supply to placenta,"Patient is showing features of supine hypotensive syndrome caused by the compression of inferior vena cava by the weight of a pregnant female's uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluids while lying in the supine position. This condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximal during the third trimester, 36 to 38 weeks. When the pregnant female in these stages lies in the supine position, the added weight of the enlarged uterus and its contents will press down on the inferior vena cava. When the IVC is compressed it reduces the amount of blood that returns to the hea and reduces cardiac output, this can result in a loss of 30% of the effective circulating blood volume. It can take 3-7 minutes for significant hypotension to manifest.",A

35 year old woman comes with postcoital bleeding. What is the next step?,PAP smear,Conisation,Cryotherapy,Colposcopic cervical biopsy,"Please note...this answer is given as Pap smear in most guides. Pap smear is a screening test and here the patient is symptomatic and hence a diagnostic test is warranted. Even so, the sensitivity of the paps smear is the sensitivity of the Pap test in detecting CIN 2 or 3 ranged from 47% to 62% and the specificity ranged from 60% to 95% Do read this from Novaks Gynecology: ... Vaginal bleeding is the most common symptom occurring in patients with cancer of the cervix. Most often, this is postcoital bleeding, but it may occur as irregular or postmenopausal bleeding. ... Initially, all women suspected of having cervical cancer should have a general physical examination performed to include evaluation of the supraclavicular, axillary, and inguinofemoral lymph nodes to exclude the presence of metastatic disease. On pelvic examination, a speculum is inseed into the vagina, and the cervix is inspected for suspicious area ...When obvious tumor growth is present, a cervical biopsy is usually sufficient for diagnosis. If gross disease is not present, a colposcopic examination with cervical biopsies and endocervical curettage is warranted",D
A female at 37 wks of gestation has mild labour pain for 10 hours and cervix is persistently 1CM dilated but non effaced. What will be next appropriate management?,Sedation and wait,Augmentation with syntocin,Cesarean section,Amniotomy,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Sedation and wait * It is a case of prolonged latent phase of the labourLatent phase of the labourLatent phase of the labour is difficult to define.It starts with onset of painful regular uterine contractions and end when the cervix starts dilating at an active rate.A latent phase exceeding 6 hours in primigravida or 4 hours in multigravida is considered prolonged. Secondary arrest of active phaseActive phase of the labour is defined as phase when active cervical dilatation occurs.Secondary arrest of cervical dilatation occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal portion of active phase dilatation.This is believed to be due to cephalopelvic disproportion.Prolonged latent phaseThe diagnosis of prolonged labour is made when there is little progress in cervical dilatation for several hours. (In the question the cervix is dilated for 1 cm for the last 10 hrs).More common than the diagnosis of prolonged latent phase is the need to differentiate whether a patient is in false labour or in the latent phase.This differentiation may be achieved by continuous observation of the patient for at least 2 hours. Patients in false labour will show a pattern of irregular uterine contractions that eventually decrease in frequency and intensity and there are no cervical changes during the observation periods.Whereas patients in latent phase will show persistent regular uterine contractions that usually increase in intensity and frequency. In addition, patient in latent phase will show some cervical changes.A second method used to differentiate false labour from the latent phase of labour is therapeutic restFor this purpose the patient is given a 15 mg dose of morphine sulfate.Patients in false labourSleep for a few hours and awake without contractions.Patients in latent phase continue with contractions and show cervical changes after the sleeping period.The second most common practical problem related to the latent phase of labour occurs when patients have 3 or 4 cm of cervical dilatation and regular uterine contractions and no progress is observed during the following few hours.These patients may be in a late stage of their latent phase or have an early secondary arrest of dilatation.To distinguish between late latent phase and early secondary arrest it is necessary to take into consideration the patient's parity.Multipara making little progress at 4 cm of dilatation most likely will be in latent phase.A nullipara under the same circumstances most likely will be in early secondary arrest.The degree of cervical dilatation is also important.60% of the patient will be in active phase if the cervix is 4 cm dilated and 90% if it is 5 cm.Finally cervical effacement is a good criterion for recognizing patients in active phase.Most patients will be in active phase if their cervix is dilated 3 cm or more and 100% effaced.If effacement is 50% or less most likely they are in latent phase.ManagementThere are two modes of management for patients with prolonged latent phase.Therapeutic restOxytocin stimulation.",A

"All of the following mechanisms might account for a reduce risk of upper genital tract infection in users of progestin - releasing IUDs, except :",Reduced retrograde menstruation,Decreased ovulation,Thickened cervical mucus,Decidual changes in the endometrium,"Ans. is b i.e. Decreased ovulation Several mechanisms account for a potential reduced risk of upper-genital-tract infection in users of progestin releasing IUDs. First, the local effect of progestin on cervical mucus make it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is eventually greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. In addition, decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. Also know : PID is common in non hormonal IUCD. IUCD related bacterial infections are due to contamination of endometrial cavity at the time of inseion. Actinomycosis infection is related to IUCD use. Most common side effect of 1UCD's is increased vaginal bleeding. 2nd most common side effect of IUCD : Pain in Lower back or cramps in lower abdomen.",B

(Ref Williams Obstetrics 22nd/ Ch. 34; Obstetrics by Dutta, 3rd/ 244)MAGNESIUM SULFATE# Magnesium sulfate is the treatment of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclamptic seizures.# In more severe cases of preeclampsia, as well as eclampsia, magnesium sulfate administered parenterally is an effective anticonvulsant agent without producing central nervous system depression in either the mother or the infant.# It may be given: intravenously by continuous infusion or intramuscularly by intermittent injection.# The dosage schedule for severe preeclampsia is the same as for eclampsia.# Magnesium sulfate is not given to treat hypertension.# Magnesium most likely exerts a specific anticonvulsant action on the cerebral cortex.Regimens for the Administration of Magnesium Sulfate for Seizure Prophylaxis in Labor with Preeclampsia.IntramuscularIntravenous10 g (5 g IM deep in each buttock)6-g bolus over 15 min1-3 g/h by continuous infusion pump5 g IM deep q4h, alternating sidesMay be mixed in 100 mL crystalloid; if given by intravenous push, make up as 20% solution; push at maximum rate of 1 g/min 40-g MgSO4 in 1000 mL Ringer's lactate; run at 25-75 mL/h (1-3 g/h)# Typically, the mother stops convulsing after the initial administration of magnesium sulfate and, within an hour or two, regains consciousness sufficiently to be oriented as to place and time.# Maintenance magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia is continued for 24 hours after delivery.# For eclampsia that develops postpartum, magnesium sulfate is administered for 24 hours after the onset of convulsions.# Magnesium sulphate practically always arrests eclamptic convulsions and prevents their recurrence.# The initial intravenous infusion of 4 to 6 g is used to establish a prompt therapeutic level that is maintained by the nearly simultaneous intramuscular injection of 10 g of the compound, followed by 5 g intramuscularly every 4 hours, or by continuous infusion at 2 to 3 g per hour.# Parenterally administered magnesium is cleared almost totally by renal excretion, and magnesium intoxication is avoided by ensuring that:- urine output is adequate,- the patellar or biceps reflex is present, and- there is no respiratory depression. EffectPlasma magnesium levels1Eclamptic convulsions are almost always prevented by levels maintained at:4 to 7 mEq/L(4.8 to 8.4 mg/dL, or 2.0 to 3.5 mmol/L).2Patellar reflexes disappear at:10 mEq/L (about 12 mg/dL)3Respiratory depression develops at:>10 mEq/L4Respiratory paralysis and arrest follows at:>12 mEq/L",B

Treatment of a cause of Endometriosis at a younger age group :,Progestin,Danazol,GnRH analogues,Hysterectomy with oophorectorny,"Ans. is a i.e. Progestin Adolescent Endometriosis : The incidental finding of minimal to mild endometriosis in a young woman without immediate interest in pregnancy is a common clinical problem. 70% of girls with chronic pelvic pain unresponsive to OCP's or NSAID's are affected by endometriosis. Mild disease can be treated by surgical removal of implants at the time of diagnosis followed by continuous administration of low dose combination oral pills to prevent recurrence. More advanced disease can be treated medically for 6 months, followed by continuous OCP's to prevent disease progression. The question now arises - which medical therapy is best suited for young women. Danazol causes virilising side effects and so not should be given to young women. GnRH causes severe osteoporosis and without backup therapy (like progesterone, OCP or tibolone) should not be used in young women especially in adolescent less than 16 years.

Ulipristal acetate is a/an:,GnRH agonist,Androgen antagonist,Selective estrogen receptor modulator,Selective progesterone receptor modulator,"Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.",D

A woman presents with a fluctuant non tender swelling at the introitus. The best treatment is:,Marsupialisation,Incision and drainage,Surgical resection,Aspiration,"The diagnosis in the question points towards the diagnosis of Baholin's cyst. Though both surgical resection and marsupialisation are used in the surgical management, the latter is preferred more due to its advantages. Incision and drainage would be appropriate for Baholin's abscess. Aspiration would lead to recurrence and thus not used in the surgical management of Baholin's cyst. The advantages of marsupialisation over surgical resection: The procedure is simple and can be done as a out patient procedure Even local anesthesia would be sufficient Requires only a sho hospital stay as within 24 hours Postoperative complications is very much less as there are increased chances of bleeding with surgical resection Better cosmetic outcome The gland secretion is maintained intact Ref: Dutta Gynaecology 2nd edition page 148, 4th edition, Page 152; Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology; 13th edition, Pages 196-97; Atlas of Gynecologic Surgery by By Hans A.

Advantages of ultrasound nuchal translucency over biochemical screening for Down syndrome include:,Uses transvaginal approach,More consistent measurements than lab tests,Better in multiple gestation,Wide gestational age range,"Ans. C. Better in multiple gestationThe ultrasound nuchal translucency (NT) is now appreciated as a sensitive marker for Down syndrome and other aneuploidies between 10 and 13 weeks. Outside that range, the NT disappears. Although some centers have had superb results, others have not done well. Blood free -hCG and PAPP-A in the first trimester, and double (AFP and hCG) or triple (AFP, hCG, and estriol at 15 to 20 weeks) evaluations are statistically comparable. The combination of NT and first-trimester biochemistry will likely be the optimal approach. Biochemistry does not work well for multiple gestations.

Select the most appropriate response of Pill forgotten for 10 continuous days (SELECT 1 RESPONSE),Stop pills and resume after 7 days,Continue pills as usual,Continue pills and use an additional form of contraception,Take an additional pill,"Common side effects of birth control pills include nausea, breakthrough bleeding, bloating, and leg cramps. If these side effects are experienced in the first two or three cycles of pills-when they are most common-the pills may be safely continued, as these effects usually remit spontaneously. On occasion, following correct use of a full cycle of pills, withdrawal bleeding may fail to occur (silent menses). Pregnancy is a very unlikely explanation for this event; therefore, pills should be resumed as usual (after 7 days) just as if bleeding had occurred. However, if a second consecutive period has been missed, pregnancy should be more seriously considered and ruled out by a pregnancy test, medical examination, or both. Women occasionally forget to take pills; however, when only a single pill has been omitted, it can be taken immediately in addition to the usual pill at the usual time. This single-pill omission is associated with little if any loss in effectiveness. If three or more pills are omitted, the pill should be resumed as usual, but an additional contraceptive method (e.g., condoms) should be used through one full cycle. Although most side effects caused by birth control pills can be considered minor, serious side effects do sometimes occur. A painful, swollen calf may signal thrombophlebitis.",C

Which of the following is true for the surgery?",A supracervical hysterectomy should be considered to preserve sexual function and pelvic suppo,Cholecystectomy should not be combined with hysterectomy as it increases post operative febrile morbidity and length of hospital stay,Thromboprophylaxis is required post operatively,"Since the age group is a likelihood for an endometrial malignancy, a radical Hysterectomy hence is a better option","All patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign disorders are at (at least) moderate risk for venous thromboembolism and require prophylaxis. Mechano-prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression devices) or chemoprophylaxis (unfractionated heparin or low molecular-weight heparin) or a combination of chemoprophylaxis and mechano-prophylaxis are indicated, depending on the patient's risk. Pelvic surgeries are the maximum risk of DVT development and hence Thromboprophylaxis is required here. There is no evidence to suppo the concept that leaving the cervix improves sexual function or lower rates of incontinence or constipation. Gallbladder disease is about four times more common in women than men, and its highest incidence occurs between 50 and 70 years of age, when hysterectomy is most often performed.

Obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly from,Diagonal conjugate,True conjugate,Oblique conjugate,Transverse conjugate,"Four diameters of the pelvic inlet are usually described: anteroposterior, transverse, and two oblique diameters. Most cephalad, the anteroposterior diameter, termed the true conjugate, extends from the uppermost margin of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory. The clinically impoant obstetrical conjugate is the shoest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis pubis. Normally, this measures 10 cm or more, but it cannot be measured directly with examining fingers. Thus, for clinical purposes, the obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1.5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory (Ref: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition)",A

A lady undergoes total radical hysterectomy for stage Ib Ca cervix. It was found that Ca extends to lower pail of body of uterus and upper pa of cervix. Next step of management will be,Chemotherapy,Radiotherapy,Chemoradiation,Follow-up,"Follow up This patient has stage Ib Ca cervix (i.e. clinical lesion confined to cervix). Management of Ca cervix consists of Primary management and Post-op management. Primary Mx of Ib Radical hysterectomy + lymphadenectomy (detailed Mx of Ib described ahead) Post surgical management depends on presence or absence of risk factors. So here this patient has stage Ib Ca cervix - She has undergone total radical hysterectomy, which is the appropriate primary management. Post-op it is found that carcinoma is extending to lower pa of body of uterus. This is the tricky pa of the question. - an extension to uterus is given no consideration in FIGO clinical staging of Ca Cervix. Fuhermore Novak writes - ""After a clinical stage is assigned and treatment has been initiated the stage must not be changed because of subsequent findings of either extended clinical staging or surgical staging"". So a finding of uterus involvement is not going to change the stage or the management. Post op. management (i.e. either follow up, radiotherapy or chemoradiation) is going to be determined by presence or absence of risk factors. In the question, no risk factor has been mentioned (uterine involvement is not a risk factor). So we assume that none are present and hence fuher management would be -> 'follow up' Management of Ca Cervix Primary Management of Note - Radiotherapy can also be used for stages la to Ila if patient is medically inooperable. Trachelectomy or cervicectomy refers to surgical removal of cervix. In radical trachelectomy parametria and vaginal cuff are also excised along with removal of cervix. This is a feility preserving alternative to radical hysterectomy in younger patients with early stage carcinoma. Types of hysterectomy Type I - Simple (extrafascial) hysterectomy routinely done for benign conditions for e.g. fibroid. Type II - (Weheim's or modified radical hysterectomy) In type II along with hysterectomy, medial half of the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments and proximal 1-2 cm of vagina are also removed. Type III - (Meigs radical hysterectomy) It includes removal of most of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments and the upper one third of the vagina. Both type II & type III hysterectomy includes pelvic lymph node dissection. Type IV - (extended radical hysterectomy) In type IV, the periureteral tissue, superior vesical aery, and as much as 3/4th of vagina in addition are removed. Type V (paial exenteration) - Poions of the distal ureter and bladder are resected. Type IV & V are rarely performed because radiotherapy is more adequate treatment in extensive disease. These factors are seen during histopathological examination of specimens (uterus, cervix, parametria, vaginal cuff, lymph nodes etc.) of radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy.

Gold standard investigation in diagnosing PID is: March 2005,Anti chlamydial Ab,Laparoscopy,USG,Blood leucocyte count,"Ans. B: Laparoscopy Investigations in a case of PID: Physical examination Pregnancy test (to rule out anectopic pregnancy) White blood cell test (to rule out appendicitis) Genital culture (to look for gonorrhea and chlamydia). An endometrial biopsy (tissue sample removed from the endometrium) Sonogram (if abscesses are suspected) Culdocentesis (fluid sample taken from uterine sac) Laparoscopy are done. Laparoscopy is considered the ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of PID, because it allows visualization of the pelvic organs. The procedure involves inseing a tiny, flexible lighted tube through a small incision just below the navel. This procedure is recommended when results of the preliminary tests (physical exam, blood tests and cultures) are unclear.",B

Which of the following have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome?,VEGF,hCG,EGF,FGF,"Ovarian Hyperstimulation SyndromeOHSS is a medical complication that is both completely iatrogenic and unique to stimulatory infeility treatment.Its symptoms are the result of ovarian enlargement and fragility, extravascular fluid accumulation, and intravascular volume depletion.Proposed mechanisms for the characteristic fluid shifts that accompany OHSS include increased protein-rich fluid secretion from the stimulated ovaries, increased renin and prorenin within follicular fluid, and increased capillary permeability mediated by angiotensin. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), whose expression in granulosa cells and serum is augmented by hCG, and a variety of other inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease.Reference: Novak's Gynecology; 14th edition; Chapter 32; Infeility and Assisted Reproductive Technology",A

A 20-year-old G2P1 patient comes to see you at 17 weeks gestational age to review the results of her triple test done 1 week ago. You tell the patient that her maternal serum a-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is 2.0 multiples of the median (MOM). The patient's obstetrical history consists of a term vaginal delivery 2 years ago without complications. What do you tell your patient regarding how to proceed next?,Explain to the patient that the blood test is diagnostic of a neural tube defect and she should consult with a pediatric neurosurgeon as soon as possible,Tell the patient that the blood test result is most likely a false-positive result and she should repeat the test at 20 weeks,Refer the patient for an ultrasound to confirm dates,Offer the patient immediate chorionic villus sampling to obtain a fetal karyotype,"The multiple marker screening test, also referred to as the expanded AFP test or triple screen, consists of maternal serum measurements of estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin, and a-fetoprotein. The multiple marker screening test is used to determine a pregnant patient's risk of having a baby with an- euploidy and a neural tube defect. The AFP test has the greatest sensitivity when done between 16 and 18 weeks. A maternal serum AFP level that is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 2.5 MOM indicates an elevated risk for a neural tube defect and indicates that further workup and evaluation are needed. The first step when an elevated serum AFP result is obtained is to have the patient undergo an ultrasound to verify that the gestational age of the pregnancy is correct. The sonogram can also identify a fetal death in utero, multiple gestation, or a neural tube or abdominal defect, which could all explain the elevated AFP level. A repeat serum AFP test can be done, because at a level of 2.0 MOM there is some overlap between normal and affected pregnancies. The repeat test should be done as soon as possible; waiting until 20 weeks decreases the sensitivity of the test and wastes valuable time in the workup. An amniocentesis is recommended if a neural tube defect is suspected, in order to measure amniotic fluid levels of AFP and therefore confirm the findings of the maternal serum AFP. The physician would not immediately refer the patient for a chorionic villus sampling because this procedure obtains placental tissue for fetal karyotyping and does not add to information regarding the presence of a neural tube defect. A cordocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) is a procedure whereby the umbilical vein is punctured under ultrasonic guidance and a fetal blood sample is obtained. Usually a PUBS is performed when rapid fetal karyotyping must be done, such as in a situation where severe growth restriction exists. PUBS is most commonly used in situations where fetal hydrops exists to obtain information regarding fetal platelet counts and fetal hematocrits.",C

Treatment of choice of stage III CIN in 40 year old female is :,Hysterectomy,Laser coagulation,Cryocoagulation,Cone excision,"Ans. is a i.e. Hysterectomy Before discussing the answer to this questions lets first have a look at the treatment modalities available in case of CIN Modalities for management of CIN Ablative procedures Cryotherapy * Loop electro surgical * Hysterectomy Laser Vaporisation Therapy excision (LEEP) * Conisation Ablative Procedures : They are performed in out patient setting (OPD procedures). They must only be performed when the following conditions exist : There is no evidence of micro invasion or invasive cancer (on cytology, colposcopy or ECC). The lesion is located on the ectocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). There is no involvement of the endocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). Cytology and histology correspond with each other Modalities available in Ablative procedure : Cryotherapy It destroys the surface epithelium of the cervix by crystallizing the intra cellular water, resulting in eventual destruction of the cell. Major advantage is its ability to control exactly the depth and width of destruction by It is useful when : It is paicularly useful in : - Small lesions - Larger lesions that cryoprobe cannot cover - CIN Grade I & II - Irregular cervix with a Fish Mouth appearance. - When lesion is located in ectocervix - Extension of the disease to vagina or satellite lesions on Vagina Lesions with extensive glandular involvement Depth of destruction = 4-5 mm * Depth of destruction = 7mm Complications : - Discharge (M/C) * Complications : - Slight discharge Bleeding (Rare) - Pain - Cervical Stenosis (Rare) - Bleeding - Infection (Rare) drawback of Ablative procedures : it destroys the tissue and so no tissue specimen is available for additional histological evaluation.deg Excici'InI Procedures :They can be used LEEP (Loop electrosurgical excision Cold Knife Conization procedure) or LLETZ= (Large loop excision of transformation zone) It is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. It is an OPD procedure & requires LA. Now it has become the procedure of choice for treating CIN II & CIN III. Complications are less & include : - Slight bleeding - Infection It is both diagnosis and therapeutic (Indications-given earlier) It is performed in 0.T and requires GA It refers to the excision of a cone shaped pa of cervix using a scalpel. Complications are more : - Paindeg - Bleedingdeg - Infectiondeg when Endocervix is involved as well Disadvantages of Excisional procedures : All Excisional procedures produce - Pregnancy complication. Cervical stenosisdeg Incompetent osdeg Aboiondeg Premature labourdeg Dystociadeg Advantage of excision procedures over ablative methods is tissue is available after excision method for fuher histological studies and Transformation zone is visible. Remember : In both ablative and excision methods patient should be followed with Pap smears every 3-4 months and by endocervical curettage (ECC), if endocervix is involved. As far as hysterectomy is concerned : ""Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for C1N1,2 or 3. However it may be considered when treating recurrent high grade cervical disease if childbearing has been completed or when a repeat cervical exicison is strongly indicated but technically not feasible."" But most of the other books say that : Large Loop excision of transformation zone has become the procedure of choice for management of CIN in many developed countries. But in developing countries where women are likely to default from follow up, hysterectomy is still the best option. According to Shaw 14/e, p 365 ? Hysterectomy is desirable in : * Older and parous women When a woman cannot comply with follow-up If uterus is associated with fibroids, DUB or prolapse. If micro invasion exists. If recurrence occurs following conservative therapy. According to Jeffocate 7/e, p 421 ? ""If smear remains or becomes positive after conservative surgery, total hysterectomy is indicated, but the ovaries need not be removed if the woman is premenopausal. There is also a place for totarhysterectomy as an elective procedure when micro-invasion is found on biopsy, or when the patient is more than 40 years of age.""

Fetal requirement of iron is :,200 mg,300 mg,400 mg,500 mg,"Ans. is b i.e. 300 mg Iron Requirements in Pregnancy : To compensate for external iron losses through sweat, urine and faeces - 170 mg For expansion of maternal Red cell mass 450 mg Fetal requirement 270 mg Iron in placenta and cord 90 mg Also Know Significance of knowing the above requirement All above requirements add up to = 980mg of Iron (1000-1200 mg). Blood loss at the time of delivery uses = 100-250mg of Iron. In pregnancy 240-480mg of Iron is conserved due to amenorrhea (i.e. 980 + 100 to 250 - 240 to 480). Therefore, net need of iron in pregnancy is 600 - 800 mg, which means 4-6 mg/day of absorbable iron is required. Since iron absorption is <10% of the total iron intake, therefore to fulfil the requirment of 4-6 mg/day around 40-60mg of the iron should be available in diet. Diet alone cannot supply such amount of iron, so iron supplementation is necessary in all pregnant females. Remember : Iron requirement during pregnancy : On an average 4mg/day of iron is required throughout pregnancy or : 2.5mg/day upto 20 weeks 5.5mg/day in 20-32 weeks 6-8mg/day 32 weeks onwards",B

"A 27-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) comes to the delivery floor at 37 weeks gestation. She has had no prenatal care. She complains that, on bending down to pick up her 2-year-old child, she experienced sudden, severe back pain that now has persisted for 2 h. Approximately 30 min ago she noted bright red blood coming from her vagina. By the time she arrives at the delivery floor, she is contracting strongly every 3 min; the uterus is quite firm even between contractions. By abdominal palpation, the fetus is vertex with the head deeply engaged. Fetal heart rate is 130/min. The fundus is 38 cm above the symphysis. Blood for clotting is drawn, and a clot forms in 4 min. Clotting studies are sent to the laboratory. Which of the following actions can wait until the patient is stabilized?",Stabilizing maternal circulation,Attaching a fetal electronic monitor,Inserting an intrauterine pressure catheter,Administering oxytocin,"The patient described in the question presents with a classic history for abruption-that is, the sudden onset of abdominal pain accompanied by bleeding. Physical examination reveals a firm, tender uterus with frequent contractions, which confirms the diagnosis. The fact that a clot forms within 4 min suggests that coagulopathy is not present. Because abruption is often accompanied by hemorrhaging, it is important that appropriate fluids (i.e., lactated Ringer solution and whole blood) be administered immediately to stabilize the mother's circulation. Cesarean section may be necessary in the case of a severe abruption, but only when fetal distress is evident or delivery is unlikely to be accomplished vaginally Internal monitoring equipment should provide an early warning that the fetus is compromised. The internal uterine catheter provides pressure recordings, which are important if oxytocin stimulation is necessary. Generally, however, patients with abruptio placentae are contracting vigorously and do not need oxytocin.",D

Oral contraceptive acts by,Aseptic inflammation,Change in endometrial fluid,Foreign body reaction,Prevent ovulation,"Neither estrogen nor progestin hormone dose used in combination hormonal oral contraceptives alone would be able to suppress ovulation but together the estrogen and progestin hormones work synergistically to suppress ovulation ""successfully"". The synergistic antiovulatory effect from the combined use of estrogen and progestin directly decreases the secretion of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and is considered the main action. This negative feedback mechanism disrupts ovulation by interfering with the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis and gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary. Specifically, the progestin component suppresses luteinizing hormone release and the LH surge, which is necessary for ovulation, and the estrogen component suppresses the follicle stimulating hormone, which prevents the selection and maturation of the dominant follicle.",D

All of the following are true about regional blood flow in pregnancy except :,Uterine blood flow at term is 750 ml/min,Blood flow through skin decreases,Renal blood flow increases by 50%,Pulmonary blood flow increase,"REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW: Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 mL/min in non-pregnant state to about 750 mL near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of uteroplacental and fetoplacental vasodilatation. The vasodilatation is due to the smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, estrogen, nitric oxide (endothelium derived factor), prostaglandins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In a normal pregnancy, vascular system becomes refractory to angiotensin II, endothelin I and other pressure agents. Pulmonary blood flow (normal 6000 mL/min) is increased by 2500 mL/min. Renal blood flow (normal 800 mL) increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term. The blood flow through the skin and mucous membranes reaches a maximum of 500 mL/min by 36th week. Heat sensation, sweating or stuffy nose in pregnant woman is thus explained.

Which of the following is preferred treatment after birth for baby of HBsAg positive mother?,HepB immunoglobulin only,HepB immunoglobulin + HepB immunization,Only HepB immunization,No active treatment required,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Hep B immunoglobulin + Hep B immunization o Hepatitis B virus (HBV): It is a global public health problem. The virus is transmitted by parenteral route, sexual contact, vertical transmission and rarely through breast milk. The risk of transmission to fetus ranges from 10% in first trimester to as high as 90% in third trimester and it is specially high (90%) from those mothers who are seropositive to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 'e'-antigen (HBeAg).o Neonatal transmission mainly occurs at or around the time of delivery through mixing of maternal blood and genital secretions. Approximately 25% of the carrier neonate will die from cirrhosis or hepatic carcinoma, between late childhood to early adulthood. HBV is not teratogenic.Recommended treatment for infants born to HBsAg positive mother:o Infants bom to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBIG (0.5 mL) intramuscularly (IM) once they are physiologically stable, preferably within 12 hours after birtho HB vaccine, either plasma-derived (10 *gmg per dose) or recombinant (5 *gmg per dose), should be administered IM in three doses of 0.5 mL each.o The first dose should be given concurrently with HBIG but at a different site. If vaccine is not immediately available, the first dose can be given within 7 days after birth. The second and third doses should be given 1 month and 6 months after the first.o Testing the infant for HBsAg and its antibody (anti-HBs) is recommended at 12-15 months of age to monitor the effectiveness of therapy. If HBsAg is not detectable and anti-HBs is present, the child can be considered protected. Testing for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is not useful, since maternal anti-HBc can persist for more than a year.o HBIG and HB vaccination do not interfere with the routine childhood immunizations.",B

In patients with dysmenorrhea there is a significantly higher than normal concentration of prostaglandins in the endometrium and menstrual fluid. Prostaglandin synthase inhibitors such as indomethacin, naproxen, ibuprofen, and mefenamic acid are very effective in these patients. However, for patients with dysmenorrhea who are sexually active, oral contraceptives will provide needed protection from unwanted pregnancy and generally alleviate the dysmenorrhea.

One of the following features can be used to define contracted pelvis :,Transverse diameter of inlet is 10 cm,AP diameter of inlet is 12 cm,Platypelloid pelvis,Gynaecoid pelvis,"Ans. is a i.e. Transverse diameter of inlet is 10 cm Minimal / Critical diameters of the Pelvis : (If any of the following diameter is less than critical diameter, Pelvis is said to be contracted) Inlet Mid pelvis Outlet Obstetric conjugate = 10 cms Interspinous diameter = 10 cms Inteuberous diameter = 8 cms Diagonal conjugate = 11.5 cm Transverse diameter = 12 cms Mid pelvis is said to be contracted when sum of interspinous diameter (Avg. = 10.5 cm) and posterior sagittal diameter (5 cm) falls from 15.5 cm to 13.5 cms. It can be clinically suspected when the inteuberous diameter does not admit four knuckles. Another way of defining contracted pelvis is where the essential diameters of one or more planes are shoened by 0.5 cms. In the question it is clearly evident that Transverse diameter (10 cms) is too sho and is therefore contracted. Gynaecoid, Anthropoid, Android and Platypelloid pelvis are variations of normal female pelvis. These varieties are not necessarily contracted, although there may be a detion of normal mechanism of labour. Extra edge: In women with contracted pelvis, face and shoulder presentations are encountered three times more frequently, and cord prolapse four to six times more often.",A

"A 26 year old female presents with a chief complaint of menstrual bleeding 10 days prior to the usual onset of menses. She states that her last menstrual period was heavier than usual. The physician examines her and performs a pregnancy test (which is negative) then concludes that she is probably experiencing dysfunctional bleeding due to anovulation. If an endometrial biopsy were performed, which of the following would be the most likely histologic appearance of this type of endometrium?",Asynchronous secretory endometrium,Decidualized stroma with inactive glands,Early proliferative endometrium,Proliferative endometrium with stromal breakdown,"The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is anovulation. This is caused by excessive and prolonged estrogen effect without the postovulatory progesterone effect. This occurs most often around menarche and menopause, when subtle hormonal imbalances commonly occur. An estrogenic stimulation causes the endometrial glands to proliferate. Persistent proliferation without a progesterone phase will eventually break down and bleed even though there is no secretory change present and the stroma is not menstrual. That is why this is called ""anovulation bleed,"" because it is a non-ovulatory bleed that may seem like normal menstruation. Asynchronous secretory endometrium refers to secretory endometrium that has a mismatch of 2 or more days between the glands and the stroma. For example, the glands may be at day 17 while the stroma shows more maturity, corresponding to day 22. This is a type of dysfunctional ovulatory bleeding and clinically presents with infeility. It is usually due to an inadequate luteal phase because the corpus luteum is not producing enough progesterone even though ovulation has occurred. Decidualized stroma with inactive glands is the common histologic appearance of patients taking oral contraceptives. These patients have asynchronous glands and stroma. The glands are usually not active and the stroma appears to be ready for implantation. This reves to normal with discontinuation of oral contraceptives. Early proliferative endometrium and late secretory endometrium (choice D) are physiologic phases of the normal menstrual cycle.

Best Indicator of Ovarian reserve,FSH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH Ratio,"None of the ovarian reserve tests currently in use are accurate predictors for pregnancy
With current methods, basal FSH concentration is simplest and most widely used to test ovarian reserve. Levels greater than 10 IU/L (10-20 IU/L) have high specificity (80-100%) for predicting poor ovarian response to ovulation. Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during the early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4).
Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test.
AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin-independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0.2-0.7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).",A
The following changes occur in urinary system in pregnancy except :,Increased GFR,Increased RBF,Hyperophy of bladder musculature,Increased activity of ureters,"URINARY SYSTEM: Kidney--There is dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis and the calyces. The kidneys enlarge in length by 1 cm. RBF is increased by 50-75%, maximum by the 16 weeks and is maintained until 34 weeks. Thereafter it falls by 25%. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is increased by 50% all throughout pregnancy. Increased GFR causes reduction in maternal plasma levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid. Renal tubules fail to reabsorb glucose, uric acid, amino acids, water soluble vitamins and other substances completely. Ureter: Ureters become atonic due to high progesterone level. Dilatation of the ureter above the pelvic brim with stasis is marked on the right side specially in primigravidae. It is due to dextrorotation of the uterus pressing the right ureter against the pelvic brim and also due to pressure by the right ovarian vein which crosses the right ureter at right angle. The stasis is marked between 20-24 weeks. There is marked hyperophy of the muscle and the sheath of the ureter specially the pelvic pa probably due to estrogen. There is elongation, kinking and outward displacement of the ureters. Bladder: There is marked congestion with hyper-trophy of the muscles and elastic tissues of the wall. In late pregnancy, the bladder mucosa becomes edematous due to venous and lymphatic obstruction especially in primigravidae following early engagement. Increased frequency of micturition is noticed at 6-8 weeks of pregnancy which subsides after 12 weeks. It may be due to resetting of osmoregulation causing increased water intake and polyuria. In late pregnancy, frequency of micturition once more reappears due to pressure on the bladder as the presenting pa descends down the pelvis. Stress incontinence may be observed in late pregnancy due to urethral sphincter weakness. Reference: Dutta's Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page 54",D

Blighted ovum is characterised by :,Avascular vitli,Syncytial knot,Intervillous hemorrhage,Intracerebral hemorrhage,"Ans. is a i.e. Avascular villa According to the clinical and echographic findings, it is possible to separate early pregnancy losses into two groups : Blighted ova ; Those early pregnancy losses (before 12 weeks) in which fetal development is not observed with ultrasound (so that only a gestational sac is present with or without a yolk sac) and fetal tissue is absent on histologic examination of the products of conception. -ay Fetal demise : Those early pregnancy losses (occur after 12 weeks) in which fetal development is clearly observed by ultrasound and fetal tissue is found on the histologic examination. The difference between these two types of aboion is of fundamental impoance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of aboions of genetic origin.

Which surgical procedure has the highest incidence of ureteric injury :,Vaginal hysterectomy,Abdominal hysterectomy,Weheim's hysterectomy,Anterior colporrhaphy,"Weheim's hysterectomy Because of the close anatomical association between ureter and Genital organs, ureteric injury is not uncommon during Gynaecological surgery. ""About 75% of Ureteral injuries result from Gynaecological operations and 75% of them occur following abdominal Gynaecological procedures."" From the above lines it is clear that, k abdominal operations, ureters are more prone to injury than in vaginal operations (ruling out Options ""a"" and ""d-). Friends amongst the remaining two options Viz- Abdominal hysterectomy and Weheims Hysterectomy (also done by abdominal route). Logically speaking Weheim's Hysterectomy carries more risk of Ureter injury which means (not just cutting of Ureter but also includes ligation and devasculirization of ureters) because of 2 reasons : Weheim's is done in case of carcinomas and therefore lots of adhesions are present during surgery In Weheims - medial half of cardinal ligament is cut. Now if you remember the position of ureter. (See diag below). * Ureters are very prone to injury during cutting of medial half of cardinal ligaments. To suppo the above logic CGDT 10/e, p 779 says : ""The repoed incidence of ureteral injury during Gynaecologic procedures ranges from about 0.5% in simple hysterectomies for benign disease upto 1.6% for laparoscopic cases and to as high as 30% for some older series of Weheim's Radical Hysterectomies.""

single most sensitive marker of intrauterine growth restriction in USG is :,AC,AFI,FL,BPD,"USG is extremely useful not only to diagnose the growth retardation but also to identify a fetus of symmetrical or asymmetrical one. Sonographic predictive values that are commonly used are: * Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio > 1.0 before 32 weeks,= 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected. Transcerebellar diameter correlates well with the gestational age. AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR. * Femur length (FL) is not affected in asymmetric IUGR. The FL/AC ratio is 22 at all gestational ages from 21 weeks to term. FL/AC ratio greater than 23.5 suggests IUGR. * Amniotic fluid volume--The reduced amniotic fluid volume is often associated with asymmetrical IUGR. A veical pocket of amniotic fluid < 1 cm suggests IUGR. An AFI between 5 and 25 cm is normal and an AFI less than 5 indicates oligohydramnios. * Anatomical survey: To exclude fetal anomalies by sonography Reference: Dutta,s Textbook of Obstetrics 7th edition page no 463.",A

The production of cervical mucus is stimulated by:,Progesterone,Estradiol,Estriol,Pregnenolone,"Thin copious cervical mucus in the mid cycle is indication of ovulation and is maximum on the 14th day of cycle. Intercourse in this time is more likely to result in a pregnancy as the sperms have easier access to the tube as the cervical mucus is thin which is facultative for easy sperm travel to the uterus. The first half of the menstrual cycle is characterised by increased estradiol levels and an increased amount of cervical mucous. Estradiol also makes it more thin and watery to allow sperm penetration. in the second half of menstrual cycle, which is progesterone dominant, cervical mucous becomes scanty, thick and opaque.",B

"The graph below portrays a labor curve for a woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 39 weeks' gestation. Membranes were ruptured at 4 cm. The fluid was clear and there has been no indication of fetal distress. Previous infants weighed 3500 g and 3750 g. The estimated weight of this infant, which appears normal on ultrasound, is 3200 g. This labor curve is compatible with which of the following conditions?",Prolonged latent phase,Protracted active phase dilation,Hypertonic dysfunction,Secondary arrest of dilation,"Ans. D. Secondary arrest of dilationThe labor portrayed in this labor curve is characteristic of a secondary arrest of dilation. The woman has entered the active phase of labor, as she previously progressed from 2 to 6cm in less than 2h. The multiparous woman normally progresses at a rate of at least 1.5cm/h (and the nullipara at least 1.2cm/h) in the active phase. Dilation at a slower rate is a protraction disorder. Primary dysfunction, prolonged latent phase, and hypertonic dysfunction occur prior to the active phase. The best evidence available indicates that this labor is hypotonic. Since the ultrasound indicates a fetus without obvious abnormalities, and since the patient's previous infants were larger than this one, we assume the absence of cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD). Oxytocin is the treatment of choice. If CPD were suspected, then the treatment preferred by many obstetricians would be cesarean section.",D

Cryosurgery is effective in all except:,Chronic cervicitis,Squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL),Condyloma accuminata,Cases with severe dysplasia or CIS lesion,"Cryosurgery
This is a procedure whereby destruction of the tissue is effective by freezing.
Indications
• Cervical ectopy
• Benign cervical lesions—such as CIN (ideal for minor degree and localized CIN), condyloma acuminata, leukoplakia, etc.
• Condyloma acuminata of vulva and VIN diagnosed colposcopically and not more than 2 cm in size.
• VAIN, condyloma acuminata or vault granulation tissue following hysterectomy.
• As a palliative measure to arrest bleeding in carcinoma cervix or large fungating recurrent vulvar carcinoma.
Principle: It consists of a ‘probe’, the tip of which is cooled to a temperature below freezing point (– 60°C). Freezing produces cellular dehydration by crystallization of intracellular water and ultimately death of cells. This is effective by rapid expansion of gas which is passed through it. Carbon dioxide is widely used while nitrous oxide and liquid nitrogen are also used.
The application to the cervix freezes the tissue to a depth of about 3 mm. Healing is complete in 6 to 10 weeks.",D

Estrogen-Progestin Contraceptives
Antiandrogens 

Mechanism of action

Androgen production in hirsuite women usually is an LH-dependent process


Estrogen-progestin contraceptives suppress pituitary LH secretion and thus suppress ovarian androgen production


The high level of estrogen in oral contraceptives stimulates hepatic SHBG production, which decreases the amount of free/active androgen
Directly or indirectly, estrogen-progestin contraceptives decrease adrenal DHEA-S secretion
Contraceptive progestins inhibit 5 alfa-reductase activity in the skin, which decreases the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the major nuclear androgen in hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Treatment with estrogen-progestin contraceptives induces regular, predictable menses and attenuates endometrial growth, thereby eliminating the risk for developing endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia Current oral contraceptives contain ethinyl estradiol, in doses ranging from 20 mcg to 50 mcg daily, and one of a variety of progestins All low-dose oral contraceptives (containing 20–35 µg ethinyl estradiol) have similar effectiveness in the treatment of acne and hirsutism Cyproterone is a derivative of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), has potent progestational activity that inhibits gonadotropin secretion and also acts as competitive androgen receptor antagonist which inhibits enzymes involved in androgen synthesis
“Dianette” or “Diane 35” contains 2 mg cyproterone acetate and 35 mg ethinyl estradiol
Antiandrogens are an effective treatment for hirsutism but are best used in combination with oral contraceptives or another means of highly effective contraception, because they adversely affect sexual development in a male fetus if the patient conceives during treatment",A

All are true in pregnancy with epilepsy except:,Seizure risk is decreased by 30%,Valproate causes adverse fetal outcomes,AED causes malformations in 15% cases,Monotherapy is better,"Ans. is a, i.e. Seizure risk is decreased by 30%In pregnancy the seizure risk increases and does not decrease, hence our answer is but obvious.Now here I want to tell you about antiepileptic drugs and malformations associated with them.Anti epileptic drugs and malformations:In Women with epilepsy not exposed to Anti epileptic drugs (AEDs), the incidence of major congenital malformations is similar to the background risk for the general population. A prospective Finnish population-based study reported a 2.8% (26/939) rate of congenital malformations in the offspring of Women with epilepsy who were not taking AEDs in the first trimester.In Women with epilepsy who are taking AEDs, the risk of major congenital malformation to the fetus is dependent on the type, number and dose of AED. Among AEDs, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine monotherapy at lower doses have the least risk of major congenital malformation in the offspring.The most common major congenital malformations associated with AEDs are neural tube defects, congenital heart disorders, urinary tract and skeletal abnormalities and cleft palate. Risk of major malformations is 3-5%.A milder form of malformations may be present in 8-15% cases.Sodium valproate is associated with neural tube defects, facial cleft and hypospadias; phenobarbital and phenytoin with cardiac malformations; and phenytoin and carbamazepine with cleft palate in the fetus.A systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 studies provided estimates of incidence of congenital malformation in fetuses born to women taking various AEDs.The risk was highest for women taking sodium valproate (10.7 per 100, 95% Cl 8.16-13.29) or AED polytherapy (16.8 per 100, 95% Cl 0.51-33.05) compared with the 2.3 per 100 (95% Cl 1.46-3.1) observed in mothers without epilepsy.Data from the EURAP study group 13 suggest that the lowest rates of malformation were observed in women exposed to less than 300 mg per day of lamotrigine (2 per 100, 95% Cl 1.19-3.24) and to less than 400 mg per day of carbamazepine (3.4 per 100, 95% Cl 1.11-7.71).",A

Process of carcinogenesis in carcinoma cervix begins at the -,Endocervix,Ectocervix,Transformation zone,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Transformation zone Site of origin of cervical carcinomao Squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) is the meeting point of columnar epithelium, that lines the endocervical canal, with squamous epithelium that lines the ectocervix. This SCJ is a dynamic point. It moves up and down in relation to different phases of life, e.g. puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Following image shows shows the cyclical changes in squamocolumnar junction:A) Before puberty, the ectocervix is covered with squamous epitheliumB) Hightened estrogenic activity exposes the columnar epithelium onto the ectocervixC) Replacement of columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium to form TZ. New squamocolumnar junction is situated at or slightly outside the external os during reproductive periodD) Indrawing of the squamocolumnar junction and the TZ well into the cervical canal following menopause.o The metaplasia extends from the original SCJ (now squamosquamous) outside to the newly developed (physiologically active) SCJ (now squamocolumnar) inside. This area is defined as transformation zone (TZ).o The process of carcinogenesis starts at this 'transformation zone' (TZ). The zone is not static but in a dynamic state.o Two mechanisms are involved in the process of replacement of endocervical columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium:# By squamous metaplasia of the subcolumnar reserve cells.# Squamous epidermidization by ingrowth of the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix under the columnar epithelium.o Initially, the squamous cells are immature but ultimately become mature and indistinguishable to the adjacent squamous epithelium.o This metaplastic process is very active at the time of menarche and during and after first pregnancy. These periods are of high estrogenic phase which lowers the vaginal pH. The acid pH probably is an important trigger for the metaplastic process.o Thesemetaplastic cells have got the potentiality to undergo atypical transformation by trauma or infectiono The prolonged effect of carcinogens can produce continuous changes in the immature cells which may lead to malignancy. Early age sexual activity and multiple sexual partners are the most consistent risk factors. HPV infection is transmitted through sexual activity.o Microtrauma (sexual intercourse) causes viral entry to the epithelium (basal or parabasal cells) of the transformation zone adjacent to the SCJ.o HPV- DNA positivity is strongly related with the number of sexual partners. Women with multiple partners have high HPV DNA positivity rate (60%) compared to women with single partner (21%).o The important factors in the genesis of cervieal cancer are:i) Infection with high-risk HPVii) Multiple types of HPViii) Persistence of infectioniv) Age >30 yearsv) Smokingvi) Compromised host immunodefense",C

First polar body is formed after ?,Mitosis,First meiosis,Second meiosis,Feilization,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., First meiosis Oogenesis Oogenesis refers to the process of formation of ova from the primitive germ cells. Unlike fetal testis (in which spermatogenesis beings at pubey), the fetal ovary begins oogenesis by 10 weeks of gestation. o The sequence of events in oogenesis are : i) The primitive germ cells undergo mitotic divisions to form oogonia (diploid Oogonium is unique in that it is the only female cell in which both 'X' chromosomes are active. ii) The oogonia proliferate by mitosis to form primary oocytes (diploid cells). iii) Primary oocytes formed from the oogonia enter a prolonged prophase (diplotene stage) of the first meiotic division and remain in this stage until ovulation occurs after pubey. iv) Primary oocytes completes the first meiotic division at pubey just before ovulation to form secondary oocyte (haploid cell) and 1st polor body. v) Secondary oocyte immediately begins second meiotic division but this division stops at metaphase and is completed only if the mature ovum (ootid) is feilized with sperm. At that time second polor body (polocyte) is extruded and the feilized ovum proceeds to form a new individual. Feilization normally occurs in the ampulla of fallopian tube.",B

Mechanism of action of Clomiphene citrate used for infeility:-,Block estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus,Negative feedback on HPO axis,Direct action on ovarian primordial follicles,Increase in tubal motility,"The ability of Clomiphene citrate (CC) to initiate an ovulatory sequence is primarily due to its ability to be recognized by and interact with the estrogen receptors in hypothalamus. In its capacity as an Estrogen antagonist,CC displaces endogenous estrogen from hypothalamic estrogen receptor sites and hence inhibiting the negative feedback of the endogenous estrogen on the hypothalamus (Reproductive Medicine & Surgery, Wallach and Zacur, Mosby '95). In simple terms, there is non recognition of the body's estrogens by the hypothalamus due to the blockade of estrogens receptors by CC and hence the hypothalamus directs the pituitary to make more of FSH which in turn drives the ovary to make a follicle to make estrogens.The development of follicle is the preceeding event before ovulation.",A

Screening tests of coagulation reveal a prolonged APPT. Likely diagnosis is:,Factor VIII deficiency,inherited Protein C S deficiency,Antiphospholipid syndrome,Hereditary excess of Anti thrombin III,"Ans. is c i.e. Antiphospholipid syndrome Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome : Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) is a treatabledeg, autoimmunedeg disorder associated with recurrent pregnancy loss. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies but the most impoant ones are : Lupus anticoagulant (LAC)deg Anticardiolipin antibody (ACL)deg Antibody which cause biologically false positive syphilis test (BFP - ST)deg Antiphospholipid antibodies are acquired antibodies targeted against a phospholipid. They can be IgG, IgM or IgA isotopes.deg The combination of either anticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant antibodies with one or more of the following characteristic / diagnostic clinical features is termed as the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Diagnostic Clinical Criteria for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome Thrombosis - Venous Aerial (small vessels). Adverse pregnancy outcome 3 or more consecutive miscarriages < 10 weeks. - 1 or more fetal deaths > 10 weeks. 1 or more preterm bihs due to severe pre-eclampsia or IUGR. Indications for Antiphospholipid antibody testing 3 or more consecutive first trimester losses Unexplained 2nd or 3rd trimester loss Unexplained IUGR Early onset severe preeclampsia Unexplained thrombosis Autoimmune connective tissue disease like SLE False positive serological tests for syphilis. Diagnosis : For diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome there should be two positive tests, 6 weeks apa for lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibody in addition to any of the clinical criteria mentioned above. Tests for detection of Lupus anticoagulant It delays clotting in phospholipid dependant coagulation test. - Prolongs activated paial thromboplastin time (APTT) (the term lupus anticoagulant is a misnomer as it prolongs clotting time, in vitro). Anticardiolipin antibody Measured by ELISA test IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies can be demonstrated IgG antibodies > 20U are significant - Prolongs kaolin clotting time. - Prolongs dilute Russel viper venom time.

Most common hea disease which is associated with maximum moality during pregnancy,>Eisenmenger syndrome,>MS,>AS,>VSD,Eisenmenger syndrome This syndrome is secondary pulmonary hypeension that can develop with any cardiac lesion in which pulmonary vascular resistance becomes greater than the systemic vascular resistance and there should also be some right to left shunting. The most common underlying defects are atrial or ventricular septal defects and persistent ductus aeriosus. Patients usually are asymptomatic but eventually pulmonary hypeension becomes severe enough to cause right to left shunting. The prognosis for pregnancy depends upon the severity of pulmonary hypeension. The moality rate in Eisenmenger's syndrome is 50%.

Events of female reproductive cycle are best assessed by:-,Hormone Analysis,Vaginal cytology,Spinnbarkeit effect in cervical mucous,Estrous Study,"Vaginal cytology can be done by scraping the lateral vaginal wall with a spatula and then looking at the cells on a stained slide. A Maturation Index (MI) is a ratio obtained through performing a random count of three major cell types (parabasal cells, intermediate cells and superficial cells) that are shed from the squamous epithelium. Parabasal cells are the least mature cells having not been affected by estrogen or progesterone. Intermediate cells display mild maturation, having been affected by progesterone, Superficial cells display the most maturity, having been affected by estrogen A predominance of Parabasal cells indicates an absence of estrogen stimulation, & that a predominance of superficial cells indicates estrogen stimulation. Vaginal cytology would be preferable to hormonal assay as end organ changes is the ultimate assessment of hormones in the body.",B

Drug of choice in chronically hypeensive pregnant women requiring long term antihypeensive therapy: September 2007,Nifedipine,Metaprolol,Methyldopa,Hydralazine,"Ans. C: Methyldopa Methyldopa is a drug of first choice for control of mild to moderate hypeension in pregnancy and is the most widely prescribed antihypeensive for this indication. During long term use in pregnancy, methyldopa does not alter maternal cardiac output or blood flow to the uterus or kidneys, and for all these reasons it is generally considered the agent of choice for chronic blood pressure control in pregnancy. Because the safety record of labetalol in pregnancy is not as well established as that of methyldopa, labetalol should probably be considered a second-line agent for pregnant women with chronic hypeension requiring long term drug therapy",C

A pregnant woman with fibroid uterus develops acute pain in abdomen with low grade fever and mild leucocytosis at 28 week. The most likely diagnosis is :,Preterm labour,Torsion of fibroid,Red degeneration of fibroid,Infection in fibroid,"Ans. is c I.e. Red degeneration of fibroid Friends, the answer is quite obvious but let's see how other options can be ruled out. Option ""a-Preterm labour Points in our Patient is pregnant Pain in abdomen at 28 weeks (Preterm labour is where labour stas before the 37'"" completed weeks. The lower limit is 28 wks in developing countries and 20 wks in developed countries Points against Preterm labour is diagnosed - When there are regular uterine contractions. (Not acute pain) With or without pain at least in every 10 minutes. Dilatation of cervix is > 2 cms -- Effacement of cervix = 80% - Length of cervix as measured by TVS < 2.5 cms & funneling of the internal OS. Pelvic pressure backache, vaginal discharge or bleeding. None of the above criteria are being fulfilled. Presence of leucocytosis & fever can also go against it as even if there is intraamniotic infection causing preterm labour - features like : fever, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness and fetal tachycardia are absent. Rather if these features are present it means a final stage of uterine infection has reached. And here our patient is having fever, Leukocytosis without regular uterine contractions (off and on pair) but with acute pain in abdomen so it can be ruled out . Points in our Points against Patient has fibroid (Though no mention has * Torsion is not associated with fever been made whether it is pedunculated and leucocytosis. or not, Remember torsion is seen in subserous pedunculated Myomas)deg Patient is complaining of acute pain in abdomen.

The placenta secretes a hormone that paicipates in stimulation of ductal growth in the mammary gland during pregnancy. This hormone is:,Endothelial growth factor (EGF),Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG),Human chorionic somatotropin (HCS),Relaxin,"All of these hormones are produced by the placenta, but hCG is the hormone that maintains the corpus luteum of pregnancy. The synthesis and secretion of hCG begins about day 6 of pregnancy, presumably from the trophoblast cells. Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of hCG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblasts. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to ""soften"" the cervix and pelvic ligaments. IGF act similarly to EGF by stimulating differentiation of the cytotrophoblast cells. HCS(Human chorionic somatotropin) is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast cells and will promote general growth. It is essential in the stimulation of mammary duct proliferation in development of the breast during pregnancy. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y.

"A 45 year old woman develops abdominal and pelvic discomfo. Physical examination reveals a large mass in the right lower quadrant, which is surgically resected. The mass consists of a large (25 cm) cystic sac containing thick mucinous fluid within a thin wall. On careful inspection, the pathologist finds an area of increased thickness in the cyst wall, which is sampled for histology. Microscopically, the tumor appears to be composed mostly of a single layer of nonciliated columnar cells arranged in papillary projections. The thickened area, however, displays stratification of epithelial cells, increased cytologic atypia, and high mitotic activity. Neveheless, no stromal invasion is found. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Borderline mucinous tumor,Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma,Mucinous cystadenoma,Serous cystadenocarcinoma,"Classification of ovarian tumors, like testicular tumors, is based on putative cell of origin. Thus, ovarian tumors can be divided into neoplasms of germ cells,surface epithelium, or stromal origin. Two thirds of all ovarian neoplasms derive from the surface (coelomic) epithelium. These cystic tumors may contain clear serous fluid or turbid mucinous fluid. Depending on whether a tumor is benign or malignant, surface epithelium tumors can be differentiated into serous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma, and mucinous cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma. Borderline tumors are intermediate cases in which the epithelial lining shows malignant features (cytologic atypia and architectural disorganization) in the absence of stromal invasion. Thus, microscopic features of the ovarian tumor in this case are consistent with a borderline mucinous tumor. Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma shows obvious signs of malignancy, including foci of invasion of the stroma within the cystic wall. Mucinous cystadenoma is a cystic tumor with a mucin-rich fluid content. The epithelial lining is similar to intestinal or cervical epithelium, ie, a single layer of columnar cells with apical mucin and no cilia. Serous cystadenocarcinoma is the most frequent malignant ovarian tumor. Its epithelial lining is composed of columnar cells showing atypia and crowding. By definition, stromal invasion is present.

Maximum chances of amniotic fluid embolism is seen at-,First trimester,Second trimester,Labor,Post partum,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Labor o Almost 80% of the cases of amniotic fluid embolism develop during labor.Amniotic Fluid Embolismo Liquor amnii is forced into the maternal circulation either through a rent in the membranes or placenta. Thromboplastin rich liquor amnii containing the debris, blocks the pulmonary arteries and triggers the complex coagulation mechanism leading to DIC.o There is massive fibrin deposition distributed throughout the entire pulmonary vascular tree. If the patient survives from the severe cardiopulmonary embarrassment which stimulates thromboembolic phenomenon, there will be severe clotting defect with profuse bleeding per vaginam or through the venopuncture sites due to consumption of coagulation factors.o From the damaged endothelium of the pulmonary arteries, massive fibrinolytic activators are produced which excite the fibrinolytic system converting the plasminogen to plasmin which in turn produces lysis of fibrin, fibrinogen and even the factor V and factor VIII.o Thus, there is secondary fibrinolysis on top of primary fibrinogen depletion arising out of DIC.Amniotic Fluid Embolish : Risko Older ageo Multiparityo Physiologic Intense uterine contractionso Drug-induced intense uterine contractionso Caesarian sectiono Uterine ruptureo High cervical tearo Premature placental separationo Intrauterine fetal deatho Placental abruptiono Trauma to abdomen# 80% of cases develop during labor# 20% may develop before or after labor",C

Feilization of a secondary oocyte by a spermatozoan usually occurs in the,Cervical canal,Uterine cavity,Uterine poion of the uterine tube,Ampulla of the uterine tube,"After the secondary oocyte is released from the ovary, it is captured by the fimbriae of the uterine tube. In the uterine tube, the oocyte enters the funnel-shaped infundibulum, reaches the abdominal ostium, and passes through the ampulla. Here, a spermatozoan typically feilizes the oocyte. The feilized ovum or the unfeilized secondary oocyte then moves through the narrow isthmus of the uterine tube to reach the intramural or uterine poion of the tube (that pan of the tube that is within the wall of the uterus). After the feilized ovum enters the uterus, it implants in the uterine wall. By this time, the embryo has developed into the blastocyst stage. If passage of the feilized ovum through the uterine tube is restricted, implantation into the tubal wall may occur.",D
