A hypeensive woman has come for preconception counseling. Which of the following antihypeensive is advised to continue once she becomes pregnant?,Enalapril,Chlohiazide,Nifedipine,Losaan,"Women with chronic hypeension are ideally counseled before pregnancy. The duration of hypeension, degree of blood pressure control, and current therapy are asceained. Those women who require multiple medications for control or those who are poorly controlled carry greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Tell women who take antihypeensive treatments other than ACE inhibitors, ARBs or chlorothiazide that the limited evidence available has not shown an increased risk of congenital malformation with such treatments.Angiotensin-Conveing Enzyme InhibitorsThese drugs inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin-II. They can cause severe fetal malformations when given in the second and third trimesters. These include oligohydramnios, hypocalvaria, and renal dysfunction Some studies also suggest teratogenic effects, and because of this, they are not recommended at any time during pregnancy.Angiotensin - receptor blockers act in a similar manner. But, instead of blocking the production of angiotensin-II, they inhibit binding to its receptor.They are presumed to have the same fetal effects as angiotensin-conveing enzyme inhibitors and thus are also contraindicated.Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition; Chapter 50; Chronic Hypeension",C

Risk of congenital heart disease in first degree relative is,0.5 to 0.6%,2 to 6%,5 to 6%,20 to 25%,"Ans. b (2 to 6%). (Ref. Nelson, Textbook of Paediatrics, 18th/pg. 1878)Congenital heart disease occurs in# 0.5 to 0.8% of live births.# 3 to 4 % of stillboms.# 10 to 25% of abortuses.# 2% of premature infants (except PDA)# 0.8% of normal population.# 2-6% after birth of a child with CHD or if parent affected.# 20-30% when 2 first-degree relatives have congenital heart disease.NOTE: Most congenital defects are well tolerated in the fetus because of the parallel nature of the fetal circulation. Even the most severe cardiac defects (hypoplastic left heart syndrome) can usually be well compensated for by the fetal circulation. It is only after birth when the fetal pathways (ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale) are closed that the full hemodynamic impact of an anatomic abnormality becomes apparent. One notable exception is the case of severe regurgitant lesions, most commonly of the tricuspid valve. In these lesions (Ebstein anomaly), the parallel fetal circulation cannot compensate for the volume load imposed on the right side of the heart. In utero heart failure, often with fetal pleural and pericardial effusions, and generalized ascites (nonimmune hydrops fetalis) may occur.",B
"An ultrasound performed on a women, shows twin pregnancy. Which of the following is a feature of dizygotic twins?",Separate amnion and same chorion,Separate chorion and amnion,Always different sex,None of the above,"In Dizygotic twins, each twin has separate amnion and chorion and the intervening membrane consists of 4 layers amnion, chorion, chorion and amnion. They have two placentae either completely separated or more commonly fused at the margin appearing to be one. There is no anastomosis between two fetal vessels. In monozygotic twins: There is only a single placenta, there is varying degree of anastomosis between two foetal vessels. Each fetus is surrounded by a separate amniotic sac with the chorion layer common to both (diamniotic monochorionic). Intervening membrane consist of two layers of amnion only.

All of following are true about neonatal sepsis except-,Premature babies are predisposed to sepsis,Late initiation of breast feeding is a predisposition,Most common transmission of infection is through nursery personel,Premature rupture of membranes predisposes to sepsis,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Most common transmission of infection is through nursery personal o Early onset sepsis is caused by organisms prevalent in the maternal genital tract. o Late onset sepsis is caused by organisms of the external environment of home or hospital and the infection is transmitted most frequently by the hands of the care-provider. Predisposing factors for neonatal sepsis 1) For early onset sepsis o Low bih weight or prematurity o Maternal fever o Prolonged rupture of membrane o Difficult or prolonged labor Foul smelling liquor o Meconium aspiration Multiple per vaginum examination 2) For late onset sepsis Low bih weight o Lack of breast feeding Superficial infections (pyoderma, umblical sepsis) o Aspiration of feeds o Disruption of skin integrity with needle pricks and use of iv fluids. Note? Option 'C' is also paially correct --> most common mode of infection transmission for late onset neonatal sepsis is through the hands of nursery personel, but it is not the most common mode of transmission for overall sepsis, i.e. early plus late neonatal sepsis.",C
A5 year old boy is detected to be HBs Ag positive on two separate occasions during a screening program for hepatitis B. He is otherwise asymptomatic. Child was given three doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at the age of 1 year. His mother was treated for chronic hepatitis B infection around the same time. The next relevant step for fuher investigating the child would be to -,Obtain 1-IBeAg and anti-HBe levels,Obtain anti HBs levels,Repeat HBsAg,Repeat another course of Hepatitis B vaccine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Obtain anti HBs levels The child in question has received complete vaccination for Hepatitis B, is currently asymptomatic but has tested positive for HBsAg. The aim in avestigating the child fuher is to establish his immune status which can be best revealed by obtaining anti HBsAg levels. o If the tests shows inadequate levels of anti-HBsAg it would indicate that the vaccine had failed to mount an adequate immune response. Such a child should consult a pediatric hepatologist. o If the test shows adequate levels of anti-HBs Ag, the adequacy of vaccination is confirmed and as the child is asymptomatic no fuher intervention is required. o Positivity of HBsAg indicates that the child is a carrier of the antigen. Vaccination does not effect the HBsAg carrier state.",B

"Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy by all of the following mechanisms, except :",Delaying / inhibiting ovulation,inhibiting feilization,preventing implantation of the feilized egg,Interrupting an early pregnancy,"Postcoital Contraception (Interceptives): interferes with postovulatory events leading to pregnancy and is therefore known as interceptive. It is also known as 'emergency contraception' method used to prevent pregnancy after an unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception is used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of a condom during coitus taking place around ovulation. It is used in misplaced IUCD and missed pill. These postcoital methods should be used mainly as 'back-up' methods The preparations available include: -Two tablets of relatively high doses of combined pill (Ovran/Eugynon 50), containing 100 mcg EE2 and 1 mg norethisterone, or 500 mcg LNG, taken within 72 h of intercourse followed by two tablets taken 12 h later (Yuzpe and Lancee, 1977). Failure rate--3.2 per 100 woman years. Mode of action: The hormones may delay ovulation if taken soon after intercourse, cause corpus luteolysis, and bring about cervical mucus changes and endometrial atrophy. -Levonorgestrel (LNG). Prostinar tablet contains 0.75 mg LNG. One tablet should be taken within 72 h of unprotected intercourse and another 12 h later. Alternately, two tablets can be taken as a single dose. The failure rate is 1.1%. The tablets can be offered up to 120 h but its efficacy decreases with the longer coital-drug interval. LNG prevents ovulation and causes desynchronization of endometrium through its receptors (luteal phase deficiency). The period may come earlier or delayed. Side effects are those of progestogens. The hormone is not teratogenic in case pregnancy does occur but risk of ectopic pregnancy remains.Advantages: It has no oestrogen and its associated side effects, It can be offered to hypeensive, cardiac and diabetic woman,It can be offered to a lactating woman,It can be given as late as 120 h after the unprotected intercourse,Single-dose therapy is an advantage.Contraindicated in liver disease, contains lactate, so allergy to galactose. The drug is also contraindicated in a woman with history of thrombophlebitis and migraine. -RU 486 (Mifepristone) : RU 486 is a steroid with an affinity for progesterone receptors. It does not prevent feilization but by blocking the action of progesterone on the endometrium, it causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and prevents implantation. It is not teratogenic. A single dose of 25-50 mg is effective in preventing pregnancy in 99.1% cases (failure rate 0.9%). It causes delayed menstruation. Ectopic pregnancy is not avoided. The drug is expensive as compared to LNG. -Ulipristal. Ulipristal is a synthetic progesterone hormone receptor modular, attaches to progesterone receptor and prevents/delays ovulation and suppresses endometrium, prevents implantation. A 30 mg tablet should be taken within 5 days. Two per cent pregnancy rate is repoed. Side effects are headache and mood changes. -Centchroman. Two tablets (60 mg) taken twice in 24 h within 24 h of intercourse can prevent implantation in 99% women. -GnRH Agonists. Daily administration of GnRH agonist (buserelin) prevents ovulation. The drug is on trial for its contraceptive effect. Very expensive--has to be given by subcutaneous injection. -Prostaglandin : Self-administered vaginal suppository containing prostaglandin following an unprotected intercourse, by viue of its luteolytic effect on the ovary and its increased motility effect on fallopian tubes and the uterus, prevents implantation and brings about menstruation. Its specific role as contraceptive is however yet to be established. -Copper T IUCD. Inseed within 5 days of intercourse can prevent implantation of a feilized ovum. Advantages of Copper T as emergency contraception are: It can be inseed as late as 5 days after the unprotected intercourse. It is cheap. Failure rate is 0.1%. It can remain as ongoing contraceptive method for 3-5 years. Reference : page 280 Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition",D

False regarding calcium homeostasis in pregnancy is?,Serum non ionized calcium levels fall,Serum ionized calcium levels fall,Intestinal absorption of calcium increased,"Levels of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D are increased","Ans. B. Serum ionized calcium levels fallTotal serum calcium levels, (which include both ionized and non-ionized calcium), decline during pregnancy, reduction follows lowered plasma albumin concentrations and, a consequent decrease in the amount of circulating protein- bound non ionized calcium. Serum ionized calcium levels remain unchanged. The fetal skeleton accretes approximately 30g of calcium by term, 80 percent of which is deposited during the third trimester. This demand is largely met by a doubling of maternal intestinal calcium absorption mediated, in part, by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . Dietary intake of sufficient calcium is necessary to prevent excess depletion from the mother.",B
Seen in rickets A/E -,Cupping of metaphysis,Defective Mineralization,Epiphyseal dysgenesis,All,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Epiphyseal dysgenesiso In rickets osteoid (protein matrix) is formed normally but mineralization of this osteoid does not occur i.e. there is defective mineralization.o Epiphyseal plate (growth plate) has following five zones (moving from epiphysis towards metaphysis) -i) Resting zoneii) Proliferative zoneiii) Maturation zoneiv) Zone of hyperophyv) Zone of provisional calcificationo Normally, capillaries grow from metaphysis to epiphysis tunnels in the zone of provisional calcification. This ingrowth of capillaries destroy the cailagenous cells in zone of hyperophy, thereby limiting the growth of epiphyseal plate.Changes in Ricketso In rickets, tunnels are not formed in zone of provisional calcification because there is defective mineralization No capillary ingrowth from metaphysis to epiphysis ---> cailagenous cells continue to proliferate but do not die --> Thickening of growth plate.o Proliferating cells in growth plate extend beyond the normal width of bone --> widning of growth plate (clinically presents as palpable enlargement at wrist, elbow and ankle, also at costochondral junction -4 rachitic rosary).o As there is softening of metaphysis, axial pressure pushes the epiphysis into the metaphysis cupping or flaring of metaphysis (In normal bones, metaphysis is rigid so cupping does not occur).o As there is irregular calcification (mineralization), the edge of the metaphysis loses its sharp border --> fraying of metaphysis.In subperiosteal region, calcium deposition in the osteoid surrounding the shaft is impaired --> softening and deformity of long bones.",C

Fortunately the malignancy is well-differentiated with good prognosis* Chronic non ovulatory cycle as seen in DUB* In some families, a strong familial predispotion is noticed. This may be due to genetic or dietic habits such as animal protein and fat. The oestrone is derived by peripherlal aromatization in the fat tissue from androstenedione and contributes to high level of oestrogen. Women with familial Lynch II syndrome suffering from anorectal and breast cancer are also likely to suffer from endometrial cancer* Tamoxifen given to women with breast cancer increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer to 2- 3 folds* Combined oral hormonal pills have protective effect and reduce its risk by 40-50% and also adding progestogens for 12 days each cycle to oestrogen in HRT reduces its risks to 20%**** Obesity, hypertension and diabetes characterize this cancer in 30%* Infertile women and women with PCOS on account of non-ovulation have high oestrogen.

It is characterized by adrenal insufficiency. The pathological examination of the adrenal gland reveals that:- This causes low coisol concentration because the zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for glucocoicoid production. Because the zona glomerulosa is well preserved mineralocoicoid action is usually unaffected. Low circulating serum coisol results in lack of feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus which results in increased ACTH secretion from pituitary. Clinical features Patients with .familial glucocoicoid deficiency generally presents with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with the impoant distinction that mineralocoicoid production is always normal. The most common initial presenting sign is ""deep hyperm,ementation"" of the skin, mucous membrane or both as a result of the action of adrenocoicotrophic hormone (ACTH) on cutaneous melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors.

The higher the reflux into the renal system, especially if the renal pelvis is dilated, the more likely it is for renal damage to occur; the grading system is based upon these radiographic observations. Grade I VUR is reflux of urine into an undilated ureter. Reflux into the ureter and collecting system without dilatation is called grade II. Grade III lesions have dilatation of the ureter and collecting system without blunting of the calyces. Grade IV lesions are characterized by blunting of the calyces, and grade V lesions demonstrate even more dilatation and tortuosity of the ureter. While somewhat controversial, low-grade lesions (grade I and grade II) usually are conservatively managed with close observation, daily low-dose antibiotics, and urinalyses and cultures every 3 to 4 months. Grade V lesions (and some grade IV lesions) require surgical reimplantation of a ureter if the findings persist. Lesions in between these two extremes are treatment dilemmas.

"In neonatal cholestasis, if the serum gamaglutamyl–transpeptidase (gamma GTP) is more than 600 IU/L the most likely diagnosis is –",Neonatal hepatitis,Choledochal cyst,Sclerosing cholangitis,Biliary atresia,"Neonatal cholestasis

Neonatal cholestasis is defined as prolonged elevation of serum levels of conjugated bilirubin beyond the first 14 days of life.
Neonatal cholestasis can be divided into extrahepatic and intrahepatic disease and clinical features of any form of cholestasis are more or less similar.
Neonatal hepatitis is the prototype of intrahepatic cholestasis
Biliary atresia is the prototype of extrahepatic biliary atresia

Enzymes that reflect cholestasis: There are three enzymes that are usually elevated in cholestasis

Alkaline phosphatase → Found in or near bile canalicular membrane of hepatocytes
5' nucleotidase
Gamma glutainyl transpeptidase → Located in the endoplasmic reticulum and in bile duct epithelial cells.


Because GGT is more diffusely localized in the liver, its elevation in serum is less specific than are the elevation of Alkaline phosphatase & 5' nucleotidase.
Nevertheless, the following distinction is worthwhile.

""GGT levels are commonly elevated to values more than 10 times normal in biliary atresia while in hepatic causes it is raised to about three times normal.""
Normal values for GGT is about 5-40 IU/L and thus a value of 600 IU/L in the patient in question reflects an elevation of more than ten times the normal value. The patient is thus likely suffering from `biliary atresia'.",D

Over time, bladder capacity increases.At 2-4 yr. the child is developmentally ready to begin toilet training.To achieve conscious bladder control, several conditions must be present: aw areness of bladder filling, cortical inhibition (suprapontine modulation) of reflex (unstable) bladder contractions, ability to consciously tighten the external sphincter to prevent incontinence, normal bladder growth, and motivation by the child to stay dry.The transitional phase of voiding is the period when children are acquiring bladder control.Girls typically acquire bladder control before boys, and bowel control typically is achieved before bladder control.Organic causes of secondary enuresisUrinary tract infectionsChronic kidney diseaseSpinal cord disordersConstipationDiabetes (thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia)Laboratory evaluation should includeUrinalysis to check for glycosuria or a low specific gravityBladder ultrasonography - to check residual urine in bladder after voidingTreatmentThe treatment of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis should be marked by a conservative, gentle, and patient approach.Treatment can begin with parent-child education, charting w ith rewards for dry nights, voiding before bedtime, and night awakening 2-4 hr after bedtime, while at the same time making sure that parents do not punish the child for enuretic episodes.In addition, the child should be encouraged to avoid holding urine and to void frequently during the day (to avoid day wetting).If this approach fails, urine alarm treatment is recommended.Application of an alarm for a period of 8-12 wk can be expected to result in a 75-95% success in the arrest of bedwetting.The underlying conditioning principle likely lies in the alarm's being an annoying awakening stimulus that causes the child to awaken in time to go to the bathroom and/or retain urine in order to avoid the aversive stimulus.Urine alarm treatment has been shown to be of equal or superior effectiveness when compared to all other forms of treatment.Relapse rates are approximately 40%, with the simplest response being a second alarm course as well as considering the addition of intermittent schedules of reinforcement or the use of overlearning (drinking just before bedtime).Pharmacotherapy for nocturnal enuresis is second-line treatment.Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) is a synthetic analog of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) vasopressin, which decreases nighttime urine production.The relapse rate is high when DDAVP is discontinued.DDAVP is also associated writh rare side effects of hyponatremia and water intoxication, with resulting seizures.Although imipramine has some usefulness, less than 50%' of children respond, and most relapse when the medication is discontinued.Much less commonly used, oxybutynin and tolterodine are antimuscarinic drugs, which may be effective by reducing bladder spasm and increasing bladder capacity.",D

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a disease of –,Neuromuscular junction,Sarcolemmal proteins,Muscle contractile proteins,Disuse atrophy due to muscle weakness,"DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (PSEUDO HYPERTROPHIC MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY)

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease affecting all races and ethnic groups.
Inheritance: X linked recessive
Presentation occurs between ages 3 and 5 


Pathogenesis

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for producing dystrophin.
Dystrophin is `subsarcolemmal protein' localized to the inner surface of the sarcolemma of the muscle fibre.
Dystrophin is part of Dystrophin - Glycoprotein sarcolenzmal complex and this protein deficiency leads to secondary loss of sarcoglycans and dystroglycans resulting in weakness of sarcolemma, causing membrane tears and muscle fibre necrosis.

Clinical manifestations:

Gower's sign is positive
Pseudohypertrophy of the calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue)
Loss of muscle strength is progressive.
Proximal muscles and neck flexors are involved more
Leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement.
Contractures of heel cords and iliotibial band occurs (by age of 6 years)
progressive scoliosis develops.

Complications:

Chest deformity (scoliosis): Impairs pulmonary function By age of 16 and 18 years patients are predisposed to serious pulmonary fatal infections.
Cardiac: Cardiomyopathy and CHF may be seen Cardiac cause of death is uncommon
Intellectual impairment: is common (IQ is one SD below the mean)",B

While awaiting final determination of this infant's HIV status, which can take several months, prophylaxis with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole starting at 6 weeks is usually appropriate.Severe anemia can be associated with AIDS and can require blood transfusion, especially if there is evidence of respiratory compromise. Bone marrow transplants in AIDS patients have been unsuccessful thus far because of the persistence of virus in macrophages throughout the body. HIV-positive and AIDS patients should receive primary and booster immunization with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine, measlesmumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (unless severely immunocompromised), hepatitis B vaccine, and Haemophilus influenzae type B conjugated vaccine (HibCV). Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is recommended in place of oral polio vaccine (OPV) for all patients now (not just immunosuppressed patients) because of the theoretical risk of paralytic polio. If children with HIV are exposed to measles, they should receive a protective dose of measles immunoglobulin regardless of their immunization history. Pneumovax at age 2 and influenza vaccine are recommended annually. Eventually, all patients infected with HIV will lose weight and fail to grow. The factors responsible include reduced caloric intake because of poor appetite, intestinal malabsorption, and increased resting energy expenditure associated with chronic infection. Maintaining adequate nutrition in AIDS patients is very difficult, but vitamin C supplementation, by itself, has no special benefits. Kaposi sarcoma is rare in children.",B

Obstetrics dutta, 6th ed., p 414)MANUAL REMOVAL OF PLACENTA# Manual removal is accomplished by developing a cleavage plane with the intrauterine hand between the maternal surface of the placenta and the uterine wall, while simultaneously fixing the uterus with the abdominal hand, and progressively peeling the placenta free.# To ensure complete placental removal, a 4-inch by 4-inch gauze may be wrapped around the hand and used to abrade the uterine wall.# The placenta should then be carefully inspected for cord insertion, confirmation of a three-vessel cord (infants with only two cord vessels have a higher rate of malformations and warrant closer evaluation by the newborn caregiver), and completeness of the placenta and membranes.# If any portion of the placenta or the membranes is missing, the uterine cavity should be manually explored.# Some advocate routine exploration of the uterine cavity to reduce the risk of infection and bleeding from retained placental fragments.# In most women, especially those without regional anesthesia, the benefit of manual exploration is outweighed by the discomfort it causes, as well as the increased risk for uterine infection.",D

A 6 year old girl is easily distracted in class and exhibits poor scholastic performance. Seizures are precipitated by hyperventilation. What is the probable diagnosis?,Myoclonic seizures,Absence seizures,Atonic seizures,Myoclonia,"Typical absence seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. The seizure typically lasts for only seconds, consciousness returns as suddenly as it was lost, and there is no postictal confusion. Although the brief loss of consciousness may be clinically inapparent or the sole manifestation of the seizure discharge, absence seizures are usually accompanied by subtle, bilateral motor signs such as rapid blinking of the eyelids, chewing movements, or small-amplitude, clonic movements of the hands. Typical absence seizures are associated with a group of genetically determined epilepsies with onset usually in childhood (ages 4-8 years) or early adolescence and are the main seizure type in 15-20% of children with epilepsy. Since the clinical signs of the seizures are subtle, especially to parents who may not have had previous experience with seizures, it is not surprising that the first clue to absence epilepsy is often unexplained ""daydreaming"" and a decline in school performance recognized by a teacher. Hyperventilation tends to provoke these electrographic discharges and even the seizures themselves and is routinely used when recording the EEG. Ref: Lowenstein D.H. (2012). Chapter 369.

"In a young female of reproductive age with regular menstrual cycles of 28 days, ovulation occurs around 14th day of periods. When is the first polar body extruded ?",24 hrs prior to ovulation,Accompanied by ovulation,48 hrs after the ovulation,At the time of fertilization,"Most of the standard text books say the first polar body is expelled just before or shortly before ovulation.
Which does not mean that it is released 24 hours before ovulation.
While still in the ovary the ovum is in the primary oocyte stage. Shortly before it is released from ovaria follicle (i.e. shortly before ovulation), its nucleus divides by meiosis and a first polar body is expelled from the nucleus of the oocyte. The primary oocyte then becomes the secondary oocyte. In this process each of the 23 unpaired of chromosomes loses one of its partners which become the first polar body that is expelled. This leaves 23 unpaired chromosomes in the secondary oocyte. It is at this time that the ovum, still in the secondary oocyte stage is ovulated into the abdominal cavity
So, first polar body is released at the time of ovulation i.e. Option “b”",B

Diagnosis is:",Bronchiolitis obliterans,Hemosiderosis,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,Follicular bronchitis,"Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest radiograph abnormalities include evidence of heterogeneous air trapping and airway wall thickening.Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Pulmonary angiograms reveal decreased vasculature in involved lung, and bronchograms show marked pruning of the bronchial tree. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. Suppoive care including supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia, routine vaccination, avoidance of environmental irritant exposure, exercise, and nutritional suppo should be provided. Ongoing airway damage due to problems such as aspiration should be prevented. Inhaled bronchodilators may reverse airway obstruction if the disease has a reactive component. Coicosteroids (inhaled, daily, or pulse dosing) may help reverse the obstruction or prevent ongoing damage.

Which of the following should be done in the management of this patient -,Conservative treatment,Resection and anastomosis,Stabilization with membrane oxygenator and defer surgery,Peritoneal drainage by putting drains in the flanks,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Peritoneal drainage by putting drains in the flanks o Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening emergency of the GIT in the newborn period. Management of necrotizing enterocolitis Medical treatment of NEC include Cessation of feeding Nasogastric decompression Administration of i.v. fluids Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture). Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia. Early surgery consultation Surgical interventions in NEC Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel. Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diveion. Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no fuher surgical procedure is required. Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. A penrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transpoed or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one third of the patients require only drain placement. A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS. From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because : Patients is on ventilator (too unstable). Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of ileostomy, which is not given in the options. Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",D

It typically presents with neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and ketosis. Failure to thrive is common in early life; convulsions may occur due to profound hypoglycemia. The glycogen accumulation in von Gierke's disease occurs primarily in the liver and kidneys, accounting for the enlargement of these organs. Gout may develop later because of the derangement of glucose metabolism. Even if you do not remember all of the details of the presentation of these genetic diseases, you should be able to narrow the choices: Gaucher's disease and Niemann-Pick disease are lipid storage diseases, and would not be expected to produce hypoglycemia.

Which of the following is the COMMONEST cause of pyometra?,Carcinoma ovary,Carcinoma cervix,Carcinoma vagina,Uterine myoma,"Pyometra refers to filling of the uterine cavity with pus. It occurs due to a blocked cervical canal in conditions such as cervical carcinoma or postmenopausal stenosis, it can also occur in senile endometritis, cancer of body of uterus, and puerperal endometritis.. In this condition, the cavity of distended uterus is filled with pus and the endometrium usually shows features of severe acute and chronic inflammation. Hematometra can result from atresia of the lower genital tract, vagina, and the cervix in an incomplete or complete vaginal septum. Clinical features can range from acute retention of urine to a case of primary amenorrhea with cyclical menstrual pain, it can also present as irregular menstrual bleeding or menorrhagia.

Which of the following parameters are not increased during pregnancy :,Vital capacity,Blood volume,Extracellular fluid,Weight,"RESPIRATORY SYSTEM: With the enlargement of the uterus, specially in the later months, there is elevation of the diaphragm by 4 cm. Total lung capacity is reduced by 5% due to this elevation. Diaphragmatic excursion is increased by 1-2 cm and breathing becomes diaphragmatic. Total pulmonary resistance is reduced due to progesterone effect. The subcostal angle increases from 68deg to 103deg, the transverse diameter of the chest expands by 2 cm and the chest circumference increases by 5-7 cm. The mucosa of the nasopharynx becomes hyperemic and edematous. This may cause nasal stuffiness and rarely epistaxis. Hyperventilation occurs during pregnancy leading to increase in tidal volume and therefore respiratory minute volume by 40%. It is probably due to progesterone acting on the respiratory center and also to increase in sensitivity of the center to carbon dioxide. The woman feels shoness of breath.

Affected infants are usually asymptomatic at bih or have mild anemia, and may develop neonatal jaundice that typically responds to phototherapy. The reasons only a MILD hemolysis are : (1) low prevalence of incompatible red cell antigens; (2) insufficient transplacental passage of fetal antigens or maternal antibodies; (3) maternal-fetal co existent ABO incompatibility, which leads to rapid clearance of fetal erythrocytes before they elicit an immune response; (4) variable antigenicity (5) variable maternal immune response to the antigen",C

"A 19-year-old patient presents to your office with primary amenorrhea. She has normal breast and pubic hair development, but the uterus and vagina are absent. Diagnostic possibilities include",XYY syndrome,Gonadal dysgenesis,Mullerian agenesis,Klinefelter syndrome,"Since this patient has other signs of pubertal development which are sex steroid-dependent, we can conclude some ovarian function is present. This excludes such conditions as gonadal dysgenesis and hypothalamic-pituitary failure as possible causes of her primary amenorrhea. Mullerian defects are the only plausible cause, and the diagnostic evaluation in this patient would be directed toward both confirmation of this diagnosis and establishment of the exact nature of the Mullerian defect. Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, presents as amenorrhea with absence of a vagina. The incidence is approximately 1 in 10,000 female births. The karyotype is 46, XX. There is normal development of breasts, sexual hair, ovaries, tubes, and external genitalia. There are associated skeletal (12%) and urinary tract (33%) anomalies. Treatment generally consists of progressive vaginal dilation or creation of an artificial vagina with split-thickness skin grafts (Mclndoe procedure). Testicular feminization, or congenital androgen insensitivity syndrome, is an X-linked recessive disorder with a karyotype of 46, XY. These genetic males have a defective androgen receptor and/or downstream signal transduction mechanism (in the genome) such that the androgenic signal does not have its normal tissue-specific effects. This accounts for 10% of all cases of primary amenorrhea. The patient presents with an absent uterus and blind vaginal canal. However, in these patients the amount of sexual hair is significantly decreased. Although there is a 25% incidence of malignant tumors in these patients, gonadectomy should be deferred until after full development is obtained. In other patients with a Y chromosome, gonadectomy should be performed as early as possible to prevent masculinization. Patients with gonadal dysgenesis present with lack of secondary sexual characteristics. Patients with Klinefelter syndrome typically have a karyotype of 47, XXY and a male phenotype. Causes of primary amenorrhea, in descending order of frequency, are gonadal dysgenesis, Mullerian agenesis, and testicular feminization. XYY syndrome and Turner syndrome often present with menstrual difficulties, but these patients have a uterus.",C

Normal value of Anti-Mullerian Hormone is,<1 ng/ml,2--6.8 ng/mL,6.8--10 ng/ml,>10ng/ml,"AMH is a peptide secreted by the Seoli cells in the testis and granulosa cells in the ovary. In the males, it inhibits the development of the Mullerian system. The absence of AMH results in the hermaphrodite. In the female, AMH is secreted by the granulosa cells after pubey. It helps in the follicular development and oocyte maturation. Normal value is 2-6.8 ng/mL; level <1ng/mL shows poor ovarian reserve, >10 ng/mL is seen in PCOD and hyperstimulation syndrome. Its level is related to precocious and delayed pubey, infeility and premature menopause. Its level is related and reflects the number of growing follicles. Estimation of serum AMH is used in the study of ovarian reserve in an infeile woman and a woman with secondary amenorrhoea. In in vitro feilization programme, it carries a prognostic value and helps to decide on donor egg.Reference: Shaw's Textbook of Gynecology; 16th edition; Chapter 3; Physiology",B

Most probable diagnosis is",Kawasaki disease,Paially treated meningitis,IMN,Type 3 hypersensitivity,"Type 3 hypersensitivity Immunologically mediated adverse drug been reactions have AND classified according to the GELL COOMBS CLASSIFICATION. The 4 types are: Immediate hypersensitivity - It occurs when the drug or drug metabolite interacts with preformed drug specific IgE antibodies that are bound to the surfaces of tissue mast cells and/or circulating basophils. Clinically manifests with uicaria, bronchospasm and anaphylaxis Cytotoxic reactions - Involve IgG or IgM antibodies that recognize drug antigen on cell membrane. In the presence of serum complement, the antibody coated cell is either cleared by the monocytes or macrophage system or is destroyed. Examples include drug induced hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia. Immune complex reactions (Type /I hypersensitivity) - It is caused by soluble complexes of drug or metabolite in slight antigen excess with IgG or IgM antibodies. The immune complex is deposited in blood vessel walls and causes injury by activating the complement cascade as seen in serum sickness. Clinical manifestations include fever, uicaria, rash, lymphadenopathy, and ahralgias. Symptoms typically appear 1-3 weeks after the last dose of an offending drug and subside when the drug and/or its metabolites are cleared from the body. Delayed hypersensitivity - These are mediated by drug specific T lymphocytes. Commonly implicated drugs include neomycin and local anesthetics in topical formulations. ""Serum sickness like reactions in which immune complexes have not been documented, which occur most commonly with cefaclor, may result from an inherited propensity for hepatic biotransformation of drugs into toxic or immunogenic metabolites.""",D

A 3.8 kg baby of a diabetic mother developed seizures 32 hours after birth. The most probable cause would be?,Hypoglycemia,Hypocalcemia,Birth asphyxia,Intraventricular hemorrhage,"Ans. A. Hypoglycemia* The neonate has seizures developed at around 32 hrs after birth. There are two possibilities in this neonate i.e. hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia.* Hypoglycemia in first 18-36 hrs is usually due to transient neonatal hypoglycemia and after 36 hrs metabolic and other causes are likely.* Hypoglycemia develops in about 25-50% of infants of diabetic mothers and 15-25% of infants of mothers with gestational diabetes, but only a small percentage of these infants become symptomatic. The probability of hypoglycemia developing in the infant increases, and glucose levels are likely to be lower at higher cord or maternal fasting blood glucose levels.* In those infants with HIE who have seizures, onset of seizures is generally within the first 24 hours after birth. However, the timing of onset is not a reliable indicator of the timing of the neurologic injury.* Seizures due to intracranial hemorrhage may also be associated with hypoxic-ischemic or traumatic injury since these events are frequently associated with each other.* Onset of seizures due to subarachnoid hemorrhage or subdural hemorrhage is usually the second or third day of life, while those due to germinal matrix-intraventricular hemorrhage present after the third day.",A

Hypertonic dysfunctional labour is generally characterized by:,Rapid cervical dilatation,Less pain in labour,Responds favourably to oxytocin stimulation,Needs adequate pain relief,"Types of Uterine Dysfunction
There are two types of uterine dysfunction:

In the more common hypotonic uterine dysfunction, there is o basal hypertonus and uterine cotractions have a normal gradient pattern (synchronous), but the slight rise in pressure during a contraction is insufficient to dilate the cervix.
In the other, hypertonic uterine dysfuctio or incoordinate uterine dysfunction, either the basal tone is elevated appreciably or the pressure gradient is distorted. Gradient distortion may result from contraction of the mid-segment of the uterus with more force than the fundus or from complete asynchronism of the impulses originating in each cornu, or from a combination of these two.

Pain is present before, during and after contractions. This results in fetal hypoxia in labor. Placental abruption is often associated with high baseline tone (> 25 mm Hg). On CTG the FHR shows reduced variability and late decelerations.
Effect on the fetus: Fetal distress appears early due to placental insufficiency caused by inadequate relaxation of the uterus.
Management: There is no place of oxytocin augmentation with this abnormality. Cesarean section is done in majority of cases. Adequate pain relief or sedation is helpful.",D

"A 26 year old female presents with a chief complaint of menstrual bleeding 10 days prior to the usual onset of menses. She states that her last menstrual period was heavier than usual. The physician examines her and performs a pregnancy test (which is negative) then concludes that she is probably experiencing dysfunctional bleeding due to anovulation. If an endometrial biopsy were performed, which of the following would be the most likely histologic appearance of this type of endometrium?",Asynchronous secretory endometrium,Decidualized stroma with inactive glands,Early proliferative endometrium,Proliferative endometrium with stromal breakdown,"The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is anovulation. This is caused by excessive and prolonged estrogen effect without the postovulatory progesterone effect. This occurs most often around menarche and menopause, when subtle hormonal imbalances commonly occur. An estrogenic stimulation causes the endometrial glands to proliferate. Persistent proliferation without a progesterone phase will eventually break down and bleed even though there is no secretory change present and the stroma is not menstrual. That is why this is called ""anovulation bleed,"" because it is a non-ovulatory bleed that may seem like normal menstruation. Asynchronous secretory endometrium refers to secretory endometrium that has a mismatch of 2 or more days between the glands and the stroma. For example, the glands may be at day 17 while the stroma shows more maturity, corresponding to day 22. This is a type of dysfunctional ovulatory bleeding and clinically presents with infeility. It is usually due to an inadequate luteal phase because the corpus luteum is not producing enough progesterone even though ovulation has occurred. Decidualized stroma with inactive glands is the common histologic appearance of patients taking oral contraceptives. These patients have asynchronous glands and stroma. The glands are usually not active and the stroma appears to be ready for implantation. This reves to normal with discontinuation of oral contraceptives. Early proliferative endometrium and late secretory endometrium (choice D) are physiologic phases of the normal menstrual cycle.

The following statements are related to rupture uterus except:,Lower segment scar rarely ruptures during pregnancy,In incomplete rupture the peritoneal coat remains intact,Classical caesarean scar often rupture during late pregnancy,Risk of lower segment scar rupture is high compared to classical scar rupture,"Rupture Uterus
Disruption in the continuity of the all uterine layers (endometrium, myometrium and serosa) any time beyond 28 weeks of pregnancy is called rupture of the uterus.
The causes of rupture of the uterus are broadly divided into:

Spontaneous
Scar rupture
Iatrogenic

SPONTANEOUS
During pregnancy: It is rare for an apparently uninjured uterus to give way during pregnancy.
The causes are: 
(1) Previous damage to the uterine walls following dilatation and curettage operation or manual removal of placenta
(2) Grand multiparae ( due to weak uterine walls)
(3) Congenital malformation of the uterus (bicornuate variety)
(4) In Couvelaire uterus.
Spontaneous rupture during pregnancy is usually complete, involves the upper segment and usually occurs in later months of pregnancy.
During labor: Spontaneous rupture which occurs predominantly in an otherwise intact uterus during labor. It is due to:

Obstructive rupture—This is the end result of an obstructed labor. The rupture involves the lower segment and usually extends through one lateral side of the uterus to the upper segment.
Non-obstructive rupture—Grand multiparae are usually affected and rupture usually occurs in early labor. The rupture usually involves the fundal area and is complete.

SCAR RUPTURE: The incidence of lower segment scar rupture is about 1–2%, while that following classical one is 5–10 times higher. Uterine scar, following operation on the nonpregnant uterus such as myomectomy or metroplasty hardly rupture. Uterine scar following hysterotomy behaves like that of a classical scar. During pregnancy: Classical cesarean or hysterotomy scar is likely to give way during later months of pregnancy. Lower segment scar rarely ruptures during pregnancy.",D

Treatment o First line treatment for enuresis is behavioral therapy. It consists of rewarding the child for being dry at night, child should void before retiring and the use of conditioning devices (e.g. bed alarm that rings when the child wets a special sheet). o Consistent dry bed training with positive reinforcement has a success rate of 85% and bed and pad alarm systems have a success rate of approximately 75% with relapse rate that are lower than those with pharmacotherapy. o Pharmacotherapy is second line treatment and should be reserved for those patients who have failed behavioural therapy. Imipramine and desmopressin are two impoant drugs useful for enuresis. o Fast action of desmopressin (orally or intranasaly) suggests a role for special occass ons when rapid control of enuresis is required.

Causes of prolonged first stage of labor are all except: March 2009,Weak uterine contractions,CPD,Rigid perineum,Transverse presentation,"Ans. C: Rigid Perineum The first stage stas with uterine contractions leading to complete cervical dilation and is divided into latent and active phases. In the latent phase, irregular uterine contractions occur with slow and gradual cervical effacement and dilation. The active phase is demonstrated by an increased rate of cervical dilation and fetal descent. The active phase usually stas at 3-4 cm cervical dilation and is subdivided into the acceleration, maximum slope, and deceleration phases. The second stage of labor is defined as complete dilation of the cervix to the delivery of the infant. The third stage of labor involves delivery of the placenta. Prolonged first stage of labour Latent phase: Diagnosis of abnormal labor during the latent phase is uncommon and likely an incorrect diagnosis. Active phase: Around the time uterine contractions cause the cervix to become 3-4 cm dilated, the patient usually enters the active phase of the first stage of labor. There may be abnormalities of cervical dilation (protracted dilation and arrest of dilation) or descent abnormalities (protracted descent and arrest of descent).

Since the USG in this patient does not show a sac and the level of HCG is low its level should be repeated after 48 hours to exclude ectopic pregnancy. In normal pregnancy at 5-6 weeks of gestation, a gestational sac is visible on ultrasound. A beta-hCG level of 6500 mU/mL with an empty uterine cavity by transabdominal ultrasound is highly suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy. A beta-hCG value of 2000 mU/mL or more can be indicative of an ectopic pregnancy if no products of conception are detected within the uterine cavity by transvaginal ultrasound.

Persistently high bilirubin levels may require changing from breast milk to infant formula for 24-48 hours and/or treatment with phototherapy, without cessation of breastfeeding.

Wide open Anterior Fontanelle is found in following diseases except ________,Rickets,Cretinism,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Craniosynostosis,"Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis) is a bih defect in which one or more of the fibrous joints between the bones of your baby&;s skull (cranial sutures) close prematurely (fuse), before your baby&;s brain is fully formed. Brain growth continues, giving the head a misshapen appearance Craniosynostosis usually involves fusion of a single cranial suture, but can involve more than one of the sutures in your baby&;s skull (complex craniosynostosis). In rare cases, craniosynostosis is caused by ceain genetic syndromes (syndromic craniosynostosis). Treating craniosynostosis involves surgery to correct the shape of the head and allow for normal brain growth. Early diagnosis and treatment allow your baby&;s brain adequate space to grow and develop. Although neurological damage can occur in severe cases, most children have normal cognitive development and achieve good cosmetic results after surgery. Early diagnosis and treatment are key. Types of Craniosynostosis The types of craniosynostosis depend on what sutures join together early. Sagittal synostosis- The sagittal suture runs along the top of the head, from the baby's soft spot near the front of the head to the back of the head. When this suture closes too early, the baby's head will grow long and narrow (scaphocephaly). It is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal synostosis - The right and left coronal sutures run from each ear to the sagittal suture at the top of the head. When one of these sutures closes too early, the baby may have a flattened forehead on the side of the skull that closed early (anterior plagiocephaly). The baby's eye socket on that side might also be raised up and his or her nose could be pulled toward that side. This is the second most common type of craniosynostosis. Bicoronal synostosis - This type of craniosynostosis occurs when the coronal sutures on both sides of the baby's head close too early. In this case, the baby's head will grow broad and sho (brachycephaly). Lambdoid synostosis - The lambdoid suture runs along the backside of the head. If this suture closes too early, the baby's head may be flattened on the back side (posterior plagiocephaly). This is one of the rarest types of craniosynostosis. Metopic synostosis - The metopic suture runs from the baby's nose to the sagittal suture at the top of the head. If this suture closes too early, the top of the baby's head shape may look triangular, meaning narrow in the front and broad in the back (trigonocephaly). This is one of the rarest types of craniosynostosis. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",D

Which of the following is true about vasa pre except ?,Incidence is 1:1500,Moality rate of 20% with undiagnosed case,Associated with low lying placenta,Caesarian section is indicated,"Moality rate of 20% with undiagnosed cases Fetal blood vessels normally travel from placenta through the umbilical cord into the fetal umbilicus. Vasa pre is a condition in which the fetal blood vessels unsuppoed by either umbilical cord or placental tissue are trapped between fetus and opening of the bih canal. This condition is associated with low lying placenta. There is considerable potential danger to the fetus because the membrane rupture is accompanied by tearing of fetal vessels which may lead to severe fetal bleeding. Fetal hypoxia and death may also be caused when the vessels are compressed by the fetal presenting pa, paicularly during uterine contractions. The amount of blood loss required to cause fetal death is very small thus the fetal moality in vasa pre is about 75-100%. Surprisingly there is little if any increase in maternal complications. Diagnosis of Vasa pre should be considered in all cases of third trimester bleeding associated with an FHR monitoring trace suggestive of fetal compromise or cord compression. In these cases vaginal blood should be examined for fetal hemoglobin. If there is evidence of fetal bleeding, emergency cesarean section, should be performed. 715",B

"Term for relation of different pas of the fetus to one another: September 2009, March 2013",Fetal station,Fetal attitude,Fetal lie,Fetal presentation,"Ans. B: Fetal Attitude Fetal station: This is the relationship between the presenting pa of the baby- the head, shoulder, buttocks, or feet and two pas of the mother's pelvis called the ischial spines. Normally the ischial spines are the narrowest pa of the pelvis. They are a natural measuring point for the delivery progress. If the presenting pa lies above the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a negative number from -1 to -5 (each number is a centimeter). If the presenting pa lies below the ischial spines, the station is repoed as a positive number from +1 to +5. The baby is said to be ""engaged"" in the pelvis when it is even with the ischial spines at 0 station. Fetal lie: This is the relationship between the head to tailbone axis of the fetus and the head to tailbone axis of the mother. If the two are parallel, then the fetus is said to be in a longitudinal lie. If the two are at 90-degree angles to each other, the fetus is said to be in a transverse lie. Nearly all (99.5%) fetuses are in a longitudinal lie. Fetal attitude: The fetal attitude describes the relationship of the fetus' body pas to one another. The normal fetal attitude is commonly referred to as the fetal position. The head is tucked down to the chest, with arms and legs drawn in towards the center of the chest. Abnormal fetal attitudes may include a head that is extended back or other body pas extended or positioned behind the back. Abnormal fetal attitudes can increase the diameter of the presenting pa as it passes through the pelvis, increasing the difficulty of bih. Fetal presentation: The presenting pa is defined as the pa of the presentation which overlies the internal os. - Cephalic (head-first) presentation: - Cephalic presentation is considered normal and occurs in about 97% of deliveries. There are different types of cephalic presentation, which depend on the fetal attitude. Rarely, the fetus' head is extended back, and the chin, face, or forehead will present first depending on the degree of extension. This is a more difficult delivery, because this is not the smallest pa of the fetus' head. It may result in a need for cesarean delivery. A cesarean delivery may be recommended for any of the fetal positions other than cephalic. Breech presentation: Breech presentation is considered abnormal and occurs about 3% of the time. A complete breech presentation occurs when the buttocks present first, and both the hips and knees are flexed. A frank breech occurs when the hips are flexed so the legs are straight and completely drawn up toward the chest. Other breech positions occur when either the feet or knees come out first. Shoulder presentation: The shoulder, arm, or trunk may present first if the fetus is in a transverse lie. This type of presentation occurs less than 1% of the time. Transverse lie is more common with premature delivery or multiple pregnancies.",B

Excessive testing and treatments are not typically useful. A thorough history and physical examination, including growth parameters, are frequently helpful in separating organic from nonorganic causes of abdominal pain. Any signs or symptoms of organic causes, such as growth failure, should be pursued. If nothing in the history or physical examination is found, as is likely in the case described, reassurance of the children and family members is indicated. Close follow-up for new or changing symptoms as well as further reassurance to the family is important.",D

Test for ovarian reserve:,LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"Ans. c. FSH /Ref Harrison 19e p2388, 18/e p17/e p2331]Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into Passive testing and Dynamic testing. FSH level is a method for testing passive ovarian reserve.""As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.""Ovarian reserve* Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg* During the first few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovaiy. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. AH the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic.* The process of atresia is important because it normally allow s only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy.* The single follicle reaches a diameter of l-l .5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle.* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines.Methods of assessing ovarian reserve:* With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age.* Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelerated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30. So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods for predicting ovrian reserve have been developed.* Goal of methods for assessing ovarian reserve is to provide information regarding oocyte quality and quantity.Methods for Assessing Ovarian ReservePassive testingDynamic testingFSH level:* Early folloicular phase FSH levels play an important role in pregnancy outcomes.* As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. Rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompanied by a decline in oocyte quality.* High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy.Measurement of Inhibin B:* Inhibin B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally found in postmenopausal women.* Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve.Transvaginal ultrasound:* Diminshed ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by fertility drugs.* Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume.)Ciomiphene citrate challenge test:* Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does not have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen.* Clomiphene is able to exert this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low.* In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene.* When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test. the first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 mg of clomiphere is administered on cycle day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurement are repeated on cycle day 10.* In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",C

A 45 yr old lady presented with recurrent uterine bleeding. On transvaginal USG thickness of endometrium was found to be 8 mm. What should be the next step in the management of this patient,Histopathology,Hysterectomy,Progesterone,OCP,"Histopathology Uterine bleeding in a 45 year old may also occur due to endometrial carcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasound is used to assess the endometrial thickness. Endometrial thickness depends upon the stage of the menstrual cycle. - Immediately after menstruation the endometrium is homogenous, 1-4 mm thick. - As the oestrogen concentration increases, endometrium proliferates and its thickness increases to 7-10 mm. - After ovulation the echogenecity of endometrium increases and it becomes hyperechogenic throughout with a thickness of 8-16 mm. Transvaginal ultrasound is usually the first investigation in case of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. TVS measures endometrial thickness. The exact cut off values for endometrial thickness measurement in premenopausal women to predict endometrial neoplasia are subject to continuing debate. The British ""RCOG"" Guideline development group analysed a number of studies and concluded that 10-12 mm was a reasonable cut off when using TVS preferably undeaken in follicular phase, as a method prior to more invasive procedures of endometrial assessment. In the question, the endometrial thickness is 8mm but the stage of the cycle is not mentioned. The endometrial thickness of the patient does not fulfill the criteria meted out by RCOG but still she should undergo fuher endometrial evaluation as her age is 45 years. Women aged 40 years or more with vaginal bleeding should have an endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial carcinoma. According to shawl ""It is essential to rule out endometrial carcinoma in premenopausal women with menorrhagia"". Also know",A

In which of the following situations should a court refuse to overturn a living will?,"At the patient's request, even if he or she is delirious",If the patient is pregnant,If it has been many years since the signing,To allow an organ recipient 1 month to obtain a donated organ,"Living wills represent the chance for patients to declare their wishes in advance of situations in which they become no longer competent to do so. They are revocable by the patient at any time and are automatically invalid if the patient is pregnant, as another being is involved. Living wills can be set aside if a long period has elapsed since their drafting and the wishes are not known to be current. Also, there is the potential for conflict if the patient has signed a donor card and prolongation of life would be needed to carry out those wishes. Generally, such action would not be honored unless relatively expeditious arrangements were possible.",D
"A 25 year old woman complains of abdominal pain of rapid onset in the right lower quadrant. She subsequently undergoes surgery for suspected acute appendicitis. At surgery, however, a tubal pregnancy is discovered. The most frequent predisposing factor for this condition is?",Endometriosis,A an intrauterine device,Leiomyomas of the uterus,Pelvic inflammatory disease,"The great majority of ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the fallopian tubes. The other sites are the ovaries, abdominal cavity, and the intrauterine segment of the fallopian tubes. Any condition that leads to anatomical abnormalities of the uterus and fallopian tubes may predispose to ectopic pregnancy. The most frequent of such conditions is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is usually associated with salpingitis. PID is a common infectious condition most frequently caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis, both sexually transmitted. Other cases are due to a polymicrobial population, including staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria, and Clostridium perfringens, acquired during aboion or delivery. PID leads to acute purulent salpingitis. If this is untreated or inadequately treated, it progresses to salpingo-oophoritis, tubal abscesses, pyosalpinx, or hydrosalpinx. Even milder cases may cause adhesions within the tube or between the tube and the ovary that interfere with implantation of the ovum and result in tubal pregnancy. All the remaining conditions listed above may also predispose to ectopic pregnancy. Endometriosis refers to the presence of endometrium in abnormal locations, such as the ovary, uterine ligaments, rectovaginal pouch, and pelvic peritoneum. It is an impoant clinical condition manifesting with pain, dysmenorrhea, and infeility. Scarring at endometriotic sites may cause peritubal adhesions and ectopic pregnancy. An intrauterine device may also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, but the mechanism of action is not clear. Leiomyomas of the uterus are the most frequent benign tumor in women. They develop from the smooth muscle as well-circumscribed nodules within the uterine wall (intramural), in a subserosal or submucosal location. Leiomyomas may cause significant distoion of the uterine wall and interfere with implantation, increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

You are called to the operating room. The general surgeons have operated on a woman to rule out appendicitis and the signs of an abdominal pregnancy with an 18 week fetus and placenta attached to the omentum. The best course of action in the case is:,Removal of both fetus and placenta,Laparoscopic ligation of umbilical cord,Removal of the fetus only,Closely follow until viability and then deliver by lapa- rotomy,"Abdominal pregnancy

Management includes urgent laparotomy irrespective of period of gestation.
The ideal surgery is to remove the entire sac, fetus, placenta and membrane. This can be done if placenta is attached to a removable organ like uterus or broad ligament.
If placenta is attached to some vital organs, it is better to take out the fetus and leave behind the placenta and the sac after tying and cutting the cord with its placental attachment.

"In a small child diagnosed with H.influenza meningitis, what investigation must be done before discharging him from the hospital ?",BERA,MBI,CT scan,X-ray skull,"Clinical description : Bacterial meningitis is characterized by acute onset of fever (usually > 38.5 degC rectal or 38.0 degC axillary), headache and one of the following signs: neck stiffness, altered consciousness or other meningeal signs. Hib, meningococcal meningitis and pneumococcal meningitis cannot be differentiated on clinical grounds alone Laboratory criteria for diagnosis Bacterial meningitis can be confirmed by three methods. (1) Culture method: isolation of a bacterial pathogen from a normally sterile clinical specimen such as CSF or blood. (2) Antigen detection methods: identification of a bacterial antigen in normally sterile fluids (i.e. CSF or blood) by such methods as latex agglutination or counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE). (3) Gram stain results Case classification Suspected: Any person with sudden onset of fever (> 38.5 degC rectal or 38.0 degC axillary) and one of the following signs: neck stiffness, altered consciousness or other meningeal sign Probable: A suspected case with CSF examination showing at least one of the following: - turbid appearance; - leukocytosis (> 100 cells/mm3); - leukocytosis (10-100 cells/ mm3) AND either an elevated protein (> 100 mg/dl) or decreased glucose (< 40) Confirmed: A case that is laboratory-confirmed by growing (i.e. culturing) or identifying (i.e. by Gram stain or antigen detection methods) a bacterial pathogen (Hib, pneumococcus or meningococcus) in the CSF or from the blood in a child with a clinical syndrome consistent with bacterial meningitis. Acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) constitutes 1.5% of all admissions in the pediatric ward with a mean case fatality of 16%. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common neuropsychological sequel of ABM. It occurs in as many as 30% of patients with pneumococcal meningitis, 10% with meningococcal meningitis and 5-20% with Haemophilus influenzae type &;b&; meningitis.The effect of SNHL on language is well-recognized and therefore early detection is mandatory. However, hearing assessment is difficult in infants and young children. Brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA) can help to assess hearing in this population. BERA is a helpful tool for screening of SNHL, especially in the young children and infants in whom other conventional methods may not be of much use. There is significantly increased risk of developing SNHL if the CSF has increased cells, paicularly polymorphs and proteins. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

"A healthy 23-year-old G1P0 has had an uncomplicated pregnancy to date. She is disappointed because she is 41 weeks gestational age by good dates and a first-trimester ultrasound and wants to have her baby She feels like she has been pregnant forever and wants to have her baby now. The patient reports good fetal movement; she has been doing kick counts for the past several days and reports that the baby moves about eight times an hour on average. On physical exam, her cervix is firm, posterior, 50% effaced, and 1 cm dilated, and the vertex is at a -1 station. As her obstetrician, which of the following would you recommend to the patient?",She should be admitted for an immediate cesarean section,She should be admitted for Pitocin induction,You will schedule a cesarean section in 1 week if she has not undergone spontaneous labor in the meantime,She should continue to monitor kick counts and to return to your office in 1 week to reassess the situation,"Post-term or prolonged pregnancies are those pregnancies that have gone beyond 42 completed weeks of gestation. In general, obstetricians do not allow pregnancies to persist after 42 weeks because of the significantly increased incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality. If a patient has a ripe cervix, it is reasonable to induce the patient at 41 weeks because the chance of having a successful vaginal delivery is very high. On the other hand, if the patient has an unripe cervix, it is generally recommended that she continue with the pregnancy. Alternatively, a patient can be induced at 41 weeks with an unripe cervix if cervical ripening agents are used. If a patient waits until 42 weeks and still has an unripe cervix, then admission with administration of cervical ripening agents prior to Pitocin induction is recommended to improve the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery. The Bishop score is a way to determine the favorability of the cervix to induction. The elements of the Bishop score include effacement, dilation, station, consistency, and position of the cervix (see table). Induction to active labor is usually successful with a Bishop score of 9 or greater. In the scenario described here, the patient has a Bishop score of 4, which is unfavorable for induction. Therefore, expectant management is a reasonable management plan to try to give the cervix time to ripen to avoid a cesarean section. It is not recommended to perform an elective section without a trial of labor because of the risks of major surgery.Bishop ScoreDilationEffacementStationConsistencyPosition0Closed0-30%-3FirmPosterior11-2 cm40-50%-2MediumMid-position23-4 cm60-70%-1,0SoftAnterior3>=5 cm>=80%+1,+2--",D

The epiglottis is classically described as being omega shaped and folded in upon itself so that the lateral margins lie close to each other. The aryepiglottic folds are tall, foreshoened, and thin, and the arytenoids are large with redundant mucosa. Ref: Yates P.D. (2012). Chapter 33. Stridor in Children. In A.K.

A neonate weighing 1500 grams is delivered at 33 weeks. Which of the following would be the most appropriate method of nutrition for the baby?,IV fluids and oral feeding,Orogastric feeding/alternate oral feeding,Total parenteral nutrition,IV fluids and assessment/follow-up,"Feeding of a preterm neonate

The aim of nutritional management of a preterm infant is to achieve full enteral feeding as soon as possible.
For pretenn infants of more than 34 weeks of gestation, it is possible that breast or bottle feeding can be adopted as they should be able to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing.
But for those younger infants who may have compromised respiration or be neurologically less well developed, this may not be advisable and nutrients may need to be passed into the stomach through a fine tube either through the mouth (oro-gastric tube) or the nose (naso-gastric tube). Nasogastric tube increases the airway impedance and work of breathing, therefore, the orogastric tube is preferred over nasogastric tube.
Breast milk is the food of choice as it is best tolerated and includes other benefits as well as nutrition.
TPN is given to VLBW infants who cannot tolerate gastric tube feeds, have the gastric disease; enteral feeding (by tube) is not possible or just while enteral nutrition is being established. Another important indication for TPN is sick premature/LBW infants which include Infants with:



Significant respiratory distress required assisted ventilation.

Now let’s see what Ghai 6/e, p 164, 331, 177 has to say on the rest of options.
Option “a” i.e. Necrotizing enterocolitis
“Almost all patients of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are artificially fed prior to the onset of illness. Breast milk is protective for NEC.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 164
Option “b” i.e. Otitis media
“Otitis media is one of the most common infections of early childhood. Anatomic features which make this age group particularly susceptible to ear infection include shorter, more horizontally
placed and compliant eustachian tube, which permits reflux of nasopharyngeal secretions into the middle year. A high incidence of bacterial carriage in the adenoids may also contribute to the frequency of otitis media in children. Other risk factors include exposure to cigarette smoke, over crowding, bottle feeding, cleft palate, allergic rhinitis, Down’s syndrome and disorders of mucocilliary transport.”
—Ghai 6/e, p 331
Option “c” i.e. Hypocalcemia
“In the neonatal period there is transient hypoparathyroidism. As a result, less phosphate is excreted in the urine. Human milk is low in phosphate, but cow’s milk is rich in phosphate. Immature parathyroid in the neonates can not easily cope with excess phosphate in cow’s milk leading to hypocalcemia in top fed babies”.

Kwashiorkor

It is characterized by following three essential features -

1) Edema

Edema starts in lower extremities and later involves upper limbs and the face.
Face appears moon shaped and puffy.
	a Edema is caused by -
Hypoalbuminemia → Major factor
Increased capillary permeability due to infection.
Free radical injury to the cell membrane.

2) Markedly retarded growth

Muscles of the upper limb are wasted, but the lower extremities appear swollen due to oedema. a Muscle wasting is masked by oedema.

3) Psychomotor (mental) changes

The child is lethargic, listless and apathetic (in contrast to marasmus, where the child is alert and irritable).
Appetite is impaired (in contrast to marasmus, where children show voracious appetite).

Other features of kwashiorkor

Estrogen-Progestin Contraceptives
Antiandrogens 

Mechanism of action

Androgen production in hirsuite women usually is an LH-dependent process


Estrogen-progestin contraceptives suppress pituitary LH secretion and thus suppress ovarian androgen production


The high level of estrogen in oral contraceptives stimulates hepatic SHBG production, which decreases the amount of free/active androgen
Directly or indirectly, estrogen-progestin contraceptives decrease adrenal DHEA-S secretion
Contraceptive progestins inhibit 5 alfa-reductase activity in the skin, which decreases the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the major nuclear androgen in hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Treatment with estrogen-progestin contraceptives induces regular, predictable menses and attenuates endometrial growth, thereby eliminating the risk for developing endometrial hyperplasia and neoplasia Current oral contraceptives contain ethinyl estradiol, in doses ranging from 20 mcg to 50 mcg daily, and one of a variety of progestins All low-dose oral contraceptives (containing 20–35 µg ethinyl estradiol) have similar effectiveness in the treatment of acne and hirsutism Cyproterone is a derivative of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP), has potent progestational activity that inhibits gonadotropin secretion and also acts as competitive androgen receptor antagonist which inhibits enzymes involved in androgen synthesis
“Dianette” or “Diane 35” contains 2 mg cyproterone acetate and 35 mg ethinyl estradiol
Antiandrogens are an effective treatment for hirsutism but are best used in combination with oral contraceptives or another means of highly effective contraception, because they adversely affect sexual development in a male fetus if the patient conceives during treatment",A

Congenital factor X deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease. Homozygous patients shows markedly prolonged PT and APTT, and heterozygous individuals show mildly prolonged or normal PT and APTT. Since this child is presenting with bleeding from umbilical stump with normal PT and PTT, most likely diagnosis is Factor X deficiency. In Von Willibrand disease: PT is normal, PTT is increased. In factor XIII deficiency: PT and PTT are normal, minimally prolonged thrombin time, increased fibrin degradation products. Diagnosis is established by increased clot solubility in 5M urea, dilute monochloroactic acid or acetic acid. In Bernard soulier sydrome: abnormally large platelets, moderate thrombocytopenia and prolonged bleeding time.

The specimen should be reach the laboratory within an hour of ejaculation. Extra Edge : Besides WHO criteria for evaluating sperm morphology, another 'strict criteria' by Kruger and Tygerberg is gaining impoance. Strict sperm morphology represents the best current predictor of sperm function (the capacity to feilize a mature oocyte) and has emerged as the most discriminating factor among infeile and feile men. If > 14% sperms are of normal morphology by the strict criteria then only the semen considered as normal. Teratospermia is < 4% normal sperms by the strict criteria and is an indicator of poor prognosis in assisted feilization by ICSI in IVF cycles. When no motile sperms are observed a sperm bility test differentiates ble non motile sperms from dead sperms. Round cells in semen analysis includes epithelial cells. prostate cells. immature sperms (spermatogonia, round spermatids, spermatocytes) and leucocytes. If total round cells is > 5 million/ml it is abnormal. True leukocytospermia means > 1 million leukocytes/ml and requires semen culture for mycoplasma hominis, ureoplasma ureolyticum and Chlamydia.

All the following are associated with Turner&;s syndrome except,Primary amenorrhea,Sho stature,Cubitus varus,Aoic coarctation,"45, X (Turner Syndrome)Turner syndrome (45, X) is the most common karyotypic abnormality causing gonadal failure and primary amenorrhea. It appears that patients with Turner syndrome initially have normal ovarian development in utero. Amenorrhea is the result of accelerated atresia of the follicles. The fibrotic ovaries are called streak ovaries.In addition to gonadal failure, there are associated stigmata with Turner syndrome that include sho stature, webbed neck, shield chest, cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the arms), low hairline, high arched palate, multiple pigmented nevi, and sho fouh metacarpals. X inactivation is a process that inactivates most of the genes on one X chromosome. Of the genes on the X chromosome, 20% escape X inactivation, and it is believed that loss of the second copy of these genes in a 45, X patient causes the stigmata associated with Turner syndrome.Although Turner syndrome classically is associated with a 45, X karyotype, more than half of patients are mosaics (e.g., 45, X/46, XX). The sine qua non of Turner syndrome is sho stature.Most women with Turner syndrome have no pubeal development and primary amenorrhea.After the diagnosis of Turner syndrome is confirmed by karyotype, studies should be performed to ensure that cardiac (30% have coarctation of the aoa), renal (especially horseshoe kidney), and autoimmune (thyroiditis) abnormalities are diagnosed and treated.Women with Turner syndrome should be screened for diabetes mellitus, aoic enlargement, hypeension, and hearing loss throughout their lives.Reference: Clinical gynecologic endocrinology; 10th edition; Chapter 9; Normal and Abnormal Sexual Development; Page no: 377, 378",C

Newer progestational contraceptives primarily act by:,Oviductal motility,Uterine endometrium,Cervix,Inhibiting ovulation,"FOGSI is Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India and the highest governing body in Obs and Gynae in India.
Progesterone only pills act mainly by causing thickening of cervical mucus.
Progesterone only pills
Mechanism of action of POP's is mainly on cervical mucus -

""All Estrogen free pills except the newer desogesterel pill primarily rely on changes in cervical mucus as they do not inhibit ovulation consistently.""
The cervical mucus effect peaks within 3-4.hours after taking the tablet and lasts for about 22 hours. Hence the next tablet must be taken within 27 hours of the preceeding tablet or else the contraceptive benefit of the cervical mucus effect will decrease and finally subside.
Unlike COC's that almost always prevent ovulation, traditional POP's (progesterone only pills) inhibit ovulation in 40-50% of cycles. ""A randomized double blind study, performed over 13 cycles showed that 75 lig desogestrel daily was sufficient to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles. Hence for newer POP's containing desogestrel the primary mode of action is inhibition of ovulation"". - FOGSI Focus Jan 06 issue on Modern pill, Chapter Estrogen free pill p 41
Thus, for newer progestational agents main mechanism of action is by inhibition of ovulation.

Remember

Traditional POP's are also known as Low-dose progestogen only pills.                                                    
Main progesterone used are:  
 Norethisterone 350 mcg

Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is attributed to the deficiency of?,Vitamin A,Vitamin E,Vitamin K,Vitamin C,"Ans. (c) Vitamin K* Vitamin K is produced by our gut flora. The gut of a New-born baby is sterile and hence no vitamin K is being produced. Moreover vitamin k is negligible in breast milk. In lieu of these factors all babies are susceptible to development of Hemorrhagic disease of New-born.* To prevent this from happening therefore, as standard operating procedure in all hospitals injection vitamin K 1 : 1 mg intramuscular is given to prevent hemorrhagic disease of new born referred to as H.D.N.* In our country where a large number of children are born via home deliveries, no vitamin K would be given to the child and therefore the child may be brought to the hospital on day 5 with umbilical stump bleeding.* For management: the child should be given injection vitamin K lmg intravenously. If bleeding is still present then FFP needs to be administered.Previous Year Questions on Topic: Bleeding Disorders in Children* Type of vitamin K used for treatment of H.D.N= vitamin K1* Umbilical stump bleeding in child on day 1 of life= factor 13 deficiency* Umbilical stump bleeding in child on day 5 of life= H.D.N* Male baby with excessive circumcision bleeding= hemophilia A* Vaginal bleeding in a girl child on day 5 of life= No intervention required",C

It is a case of mutation of the calcium sensing receptor The clincher here is o Age of the patient o Decrease in urinary calcium excretion Familial hypercalcemic hvpocalciuria o It is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutation in the calcium sensing receptor. o Pathophysiology of familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria. The primary defect is the abnormal sensing of the blood calcium by the parathyroid gland and renal tubule. The calcium sensor responds to ECF calcium concentration by suppressing PTH secretion through negative feed back. The mutations lower the capacity of sensors to bind calcium and the mutant receptors functions as though blood calcium levels are low. As a result of the false perception that calcium level are low in the body, the parathyroid gland stas secreting greater amount of parathyroid hormone and renal tubule stas reabsorbing greater amount of calcium in the tubule. o Comparison of hyper parathyroidism and familial hypercalcemic hypocalciuria These two disorders have almost similar features, they differ only in the following aspect 1) Urinary renal calcium reabsorption o FHH --> > 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes decrease in urine calcium) o Hyperparathyroidism ---*< 99% of renal calcium reabsorption in the kidney (This causes increase in urine calcium) 2) Age of patient o FIIH --> Hypercalcemia is detected in affected members in first decade of life o Hyper parathyroidism --> Hypercalcemia rarely detected in patient with primary hyperparathyrcidism or MEN syndrome who are less than 20 year of age. 3) Level ofparathvroid hormone o PTH can be elevated in FHH, but the values are usually normal or lower for the same degree of calcium elevation than in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.",B

GnRH analogue may be given in all of the following except,Prostate Ca,Endometrium Ca,Fibromyoma - uterus,Precocious pubey,"Ans. is b i.e Endometrial Ca GnRH agonist : Mechanism of action : GnRH agonist bind to GnRH receptors in the pituitary, and cause competitive inhibition of endogenous GnRH. Initially there is a supraphysiological release of FSH and LH from pituitary (Flare) followed by decrease in the synthesis and release of both FSH and LH. Preparations of GnRH : * Buserelin * Leuprorelin Nafarelin * Gosserelin Triptorelin * Historelin Method of administration : Subcutaneous/intramuscular injections or as nasal sprays. Indications : In females : (In all those conditions where there is increased estrogen, GnRH analogues are useful). Mnemonic : A - F and HIP. A = Adenomyosis B = Irritable Bowel Syndrome (under Trial) C = Ca Breast (Tamoxifen + GnRH agonist give good result) D = DUB E = Endometriosis F = Fibromyoma uterus. H = Hirsutism I = Infeility P = Precocious Pubey. In males : Cryptorchidism : sho term intranasal nafarelin is used. Carcinoma prostrate : GnRH agonist are as effective as orchidectomy in Ca prostrate but if there are neurological symptoms or life threatening metastatic disease - androgens should first be staed followed by GnRH agonist. BPH : Daily administration of leuprorelin or nafarelin decreases obstructive urinary symptoms in 1-6 months time. Adverse effects of GnRH : Local allergic reaction may occur at injection site. They cause menopause like Symptoms -- Hot flushes, vaginal dryness, headache, joint and muscle stiffness, depression, osteoporosis and irregular vaginal bleeding. GnRH antagonist : Acts immediately to stop Gonadotropin secretion (without any flare) eg : Cetrirelix, Ganirelix, Nal-glu.

A pelvis characterized by an anteroposterior diameter of the inlet greater than the transverse diameter is classified as?,Gynecoid,Android,Platypelloid,Anthropoid,"Pelvis are classified as belonging to one of four major groups. The gynecoid pelvis is the classic female pelvis with a posterior sagittal diameter of the inlet only slightly shoer than the anterior sagittal diameter. In the android pelvis, the posterior sagittal diameter at the inlet is much shoer than the anterior sagittal diameter, limiting the use of the posterior space by the fetal head. In the anthropoid pelvis, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the inlet is greater than the transverse diameter, resulting in an oval with large sacrosciatic notches and convergent side walls. Ischial spines are likely to be prominent. The platypelloid pelvis is flattened with a sho AP and wide transverse diameter. Wide sacrosciatic notches are common. The pelves of most women do not fall into a pure type and are blends of one or more of the above types. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010).

Which of the following statements is false about Sacral Meningomyelocele –,Spasticity of the lower limbs is seen,Hydrocephalus is seen,Bladder incontinence may be seen,Lax anal sphincter is present,"Meningomyelocele 

Meningomyelocele is a condition where normally develOped neural tissue along with its covering protrudes in the midline through a defect in mesodermal elements.
The neural tissue may be the spinal cord or the Cauda equina.
In a sacral meningomyelocele, however, the neural tissue involved would be the cauda equina, the involvement ofwhich would results in a lower neuron picture and not an upper motor neuron picture (ie. as in the involvement of spinal cord). Spasticity would thus not be a feature of Sacral Meningomyelocele. Spasticity is a feature of U.M.N. lesion and would thus be a feature of meningomyelocele occurring higher up, in the lumbar as dorsal region, where neural tissue involvement is that of spinal cord. (Note: Cauda equina are nothing but spinal nerves which have left the spinal cord, but yet have to leave the vertebral column, ie. they are lower motor neurons)

They are partially obstructive and thus lead to variable degrees of back pressure damage to the urinary bladder and upper urinary tract. Dilation and obstruction of the prostatic urethra are always present. Spontaneous urinary ascites from the kidneys is often seen in neonates. This clear when the obstruction is relieved.
About one-third of children with posterior urethral valves are now diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Another one-third are diagnosed in the first year of life, with the remaining third presenting later.


Clinical manifestations consist of difficult voiding, a weak urinary stream, and a midline lower abdominal mass that represents a distended bladder.

In some cases, the kidneys are palpable and the child may have signs and symptoms of uremia and acidosis. Urinary incontinence and urinary tract infection may occur.
Laboratory findings include elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and evidence of urinary infection.
Ultrasound shows evidence of bladder thickening and trabeculation, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis. Demon­stration of urethral valves on a voiding cystourethrogram establishes the diagnosis, as does endoscopic identifica­tion of valves. Up to 70% of children with valves may have vesicoureteral reflux.

"All of the following mechanisms might account for a reduce risk of upper genital tract infection in users of progestin - releasing IUDs, except :",Reduced retrograde menstruation,Decreased ovulation,Thickened cervical mucus,Decidual changes in the endometrium,"Ans. is b i.e. Decreased ovulation Several mechanisms account for a potential reduced risk of upper-genital-tract infection in users of progestin releasing IUDs. First, the local effect of progestin on cervical mucus make it thick and relatively impenetrable to bacteria. Since uterine bleeding is eventually greatly decreased in users of the LNG-IUD (progestin releasing IUD), any retrograde menstruation (which might seed the fallopian tubes with bacteria) should be reduced as well. In addition, decidual changes in the endometrium may make it less susceptible to infection. In other words, progestin-releasing IUDs may mimic the protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate against upper-genital-tract infection. Also know : PID is common in non hormonal IUCD. IUCD related bacterial infections are due to contamination of endometrial cavity at the time of inseion.

Generally : - Gestational age < 12 weeks - dose is 5Oug - Beyond 12 weeks - dose is 300ug Antepaum prophylaxis : At 28 weeks gestation in a Rh negative patient : Indirect coombs test is done and if antibodies are not detected i.e. patient is unimmunized, Anti D 300ug is given as antepaum prophylaxis. To know the exact amount of feto maternal bleed Kleihauer Betke test is done 300 pg of Anti D will neutralize about 30 ml of feto maternal bleed (i.e. approximately 15 ml of fetal cell).",C

Best treatment for enuresis is __________,Oxybutinin,Desmopressin,Bed alarm,Imipramine,"Enuresis Defined as normal, complete evacuation of the bladder at a wrong place and time at least twice a month after 5 year of age. More than 85% children attain complete diurnal and nocturnal control by 5 years of age. Enuresis is primary when the child has never been dry and secondary when bed wetting stas after a minimum period of six months of dryness at night. It is said to be monosymptomatic if not accompanied by any lower urinary tract infection and nocturnal if it occurs during sleep. It has to be differentiated from continuous or intermittent incontinence or dribbling.The bed is usually soaking wet in enuresis, compared to incontinence in which there is loss of urine without normal emptying of bladder. ETIOLOGY:- 1. Maturation delay is most likely cause. 2. Anxiety producing episodes during the 2 nd to 5 th years, the time for development of nocturnal bladder control, are associated with increased risk of enuresis. 3. Lack of circadian rhythm of ADH or impaired response of kidneys to ADH. 4. Secondary enuresis can be precipitated by acute stressful condition or traumatic experience. Bladder irritability due to urinary tract infection or severe constipation with the full rectum impinging on the bladder can cause enuresis. 5. Conditions causing polyuria, spina bifida, ectopic ureter and giggle and stress incontinence are other causes. Treatment:- General advice given to all enurectic children but active treatment need not begin before 6 years of age. Caffeinated drinks like tea , coffee, sodas should be avoided in evening. Adequate fluid intake during day as 40% in morning, 40% in afternoon and 20% in evening is recommended. First line of treatment is usually non pharmacological, comprising motivational therapy and use of alarm devices. Motivational therapy:- Successful in curing enuresis upto 25%. The child is reassured and provided emotional suppo.Every attempt is made to remove any feeling of guilt. The child is encouraged to assume active responsibility, including keeping a dry night diary, voiding urine before going to bed, and changing wet clothes and bedding. Dry nights should be credited with praise.punishments and angry parenteral response should be avoided. Child is encouraged both to void frequently enough to avoid urgency and daytime incontinence and to have daily bowel movement. Alarm therapy: Involves the use of device to elicit a conditioned response of awakening to the sensation of full bladder. Best used after seven years of age. Successful in two third cases without much recurrence. The alarm device consists of a small sensor attached to child&;s underwear or a mat under the bed sheet and an alarm attached to the childs collar or at bedside. When the child stas wetting, sensors are activated thus causing the alarm to ring. Pharmacotherapy:- Used if enuresis persists despite alarm therapy, regular voiding habits, exclusion or treatment of constipation, exclusion of post voidal residual urine. Imipramine works by aleing the arousal sleep mechanism. It gives satisfactory initial response at dise of 1-2.5 mg/ kg/ day. Relapse rate after discontinuation of therapy seen. Cardiac arrythmia is a serious adverse effect. Anticholinergic drugs reduce uninhibited bladder contractions and are useful in children who have significant daytime urge incontinence besides nocturnal enuresis. Usual dose is 5 mg for oxybutynin, 2 mg for tolterodine. Desmopressin works by reducing volume of urine. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

Spinbarkeit is basically a test for assessing ovulation :At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and so profuse that the patient may notice a clear discharge, (called Normal ovulatory cascade). This ovulatory mucus has the propey of great elasticity and will withstand stretching up to a distance of over 10 cm. This phenomenon is called SPINBARKEIT, or thread test for oestrogen activity. Under the influence of progesterone after ovulation mucus becomes thick and opaque and breaks on stretching i.e. hostile for sperms Therefore, indirectly Spinbarkeit test can also detect cervical hostility.",D

Treatment of choice of stage III CIN in 40 year old female is :,Hysterectomy,Laser coagulation,Cryocoagulation,Cone excision,"Ans. is a i.e. Hysterectomy Before discussing the answer to this questions lets first have a look at the treatment modalities available in case of CIN Modalities for management of CIN Ablative procedures Cryotherapy * Loop electro surgical * Hysterectomy Laser Vaporisation Therapy excision (LEEP) * Conisation Ablative Procedures : They are performed in out patient setting (OPD procedures). They must only be performed when the following conditions exist : There is no evidence of micro invasion or invasive cancer (on cytology, colposcopy or ECC). The lesion is located on the ectocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). There is no involvement of the endocervix (as determined by colposcopy and ECC). Cytology and histology correspond with each other Modalities available in Ablative procedure : Cryotherapy It destroys the surface epithelium of the cervix by crystallizing the intra cellular water, resulting in eventual destruction of the cell. Major advantage is its ability to control exactly the depth and width of destruction by It is useful when : It is paicularly useful in : - Small lesions - Larger lesions that cryoprobe cannot cover - CIN Grade I & II - Irregular cervix with a Fish Mouth appearance. - When lesion is located in ectocervix - Extension of the disease to vagina or satellite lesions on Vagina Lesions with extensive glandular involvement Depth of destruction = 4-5 mm * Depth of destruction = 7mm Complications : - Discharge (M/C) * Complications : - Slight discharge Bleeding (Rare) - Pain - Cervical Stenosis (Rare) - Bleeding - Infection (Rare) drawback of Ablative procedures : it destroys the tissue and so no tissue specimen is available for additional histological evaluation.deg Excici'InI Procedures :They can be used LEEP (Loop electrosurgical excision Cold Knife Conization procedure) or LLETZ= (Large loop excision of transformation zone) It is both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. It is an OPD procedure & requires LA. Now it has become the procedure of choice for treating CIN II & CIN III. Complications are less & include : - Slight bleeding - Infection It is both diagnosis and therapeutic (Indications-given earlier) It is performed in 0.T and requires GA It refers to the excision of a cone shaped pa of cervix using a scalpel. Complications are more : - Paindeg - Bleedingdeg - Infectiondeg when Endocervix is involved as well Disadvantages of Excisional procedures : All Excisional procedures produce - Pregnancy complication. Cervical stenosisdeg Incompetent osdeg Aboiondeg Premature labourdeg Dystociadeg Advantage of excision procedures over ablative methods is tissue is available after excision method for fuher histological studies and Transformation zone is visible. Remember : In both ablative and excision methods patient should be followed with Pap smears every 3-4 months and by endocervical curettage (ECC), if endocervix is involved. As far as hysterectomy is concerned : ""Hysterectomy is unacceptable as primary therapy for C1N1,2 or 3. However it may be considered when treating recurrent high grade cervical disease if childbearing has been completed or when a repeat cervical exicison is strongly indicated but technically not feasible."" But most of the other books say that : Large Loop excision of transformation zone has become the procedure of choice for management of CIN in many developed countries. But in developing countries where women are likely to default from follow up, hysterectomy is still the best option. According to Shaw 14/e, p 365 ? Hysterectomy is desirable in : * Older and parous women When a woman cannot comply with follow-up If uterus is associated with fibroids, DUB or prolapse. If micro invasion exists. If recurrence occurs following conservative therapy. According to Jeffocate 7/e, p 421 ? ""If smear remains or becomes positive after conservative surgery, total hysterectomy is indicated, but the ovaries need not be removed if the woman is premenopausal. There is also a place for totarhysterectomy as an elective procedure when micro-invasion is found on biopsy, or when the patient is more than 40 years of age.""

The causes include--(1) unripe cervix (2) malposition and malpresentation (3) cephalopelvic dispropoion and (4) premature rupture of the membranes. Management: Expectant management is usually done unless there is any indication (for the fetus or the mother) for expediting the delivery. Rest and analgesic are usually given. When augmentation is decided, medical methods are preferred. Amniotomy is usually avoided. Prolonged latent phase is not an indication for cesarean delivery. Ref : Dutta Obs 9e pg 376.",A

"A 3-day child vomits everything he feeds, has a distended abdomen & diarrhoea. The urine is positive for benedicts test for reducing substance. The substance in urine is –",Sucrose,Glucose,Galactose,Fructose,"Characteristic symptom i.e., vomiting, distended abdomen and diarrhoea along with the presence of reducing a substance in the urine suggests the diagnosis of galactosemia

Galactosemia 

Galactosemia is a group of metabolic disorders which occurs due to defect in the metabolism of galactose.
There is an inability to metabolise galactose which may be caused by a deficiency of any of the following enzymes: (1) Galactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (most common)


UDP-galactose-4-epimerase
Galactokinase
The defect in galactose metabolism results in accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate and galactical that are thought to have direct toxic effect on the liver and other organs.

Clinical features


Infant appears normal at birth, however, becomes symptomatic a few days to weeks after initiating galactose containing feeds.
Due to the accumulation of galactitol, damage to nerve tissue and liver occurs which causes:-


Hepatic parenchymal disease- jaundice, hepatomegaly and ascites
Mental retardation                                               
Vitreous haemorrhage 
Acidosis  
Cataract
Seizures   
Splenomegaly     
Hypoglycemia          


The accompanying GI symptoms are poor feedings, vomiting and diarrhea.
Fanconi syndrome (Aminoacidiuria, protein aria, phosphaturia) may occur.

Diagnosis

"A 28 yrs old lady, is suspected to have polycystic ovarian disease ,sample for testing LH and FSH are best taken on the following days of menstrual cycle",4-Jan,10-Aug,13-15,24-26,"In PCOD Determination of FSH and LH may help to confirm the diagnosis of poly cystic ovaries . These are assayed on the second or third day of cycle Lutenizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) LH and FSH are the hormones that encourage ovulation. Both LH and FSH are secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain. At the beginning of the cycle, LH and FSH levels usually range between about 5-20 mlU/ml. Most women have about equal amounts of LH and FSH during the early pa of their cycle. However, there is a LH surge in which the amount of LH increases to about 25-40 mlU/ml 24 hours before ovulation occurs. Once the egg is released by the ovary, the LH levels goes back down. While many women with PCOS still have LH and FSH still within the 5-20 mlU/ml range, their LH level is often two or three times that of the FSH level. For example, it is typical for women with PCOS to have an LH level of about 18 mlU/ml and a FSH level of about 6 mlU/ml (notice that both levels fall within the normal range of 5-20 mlU/ml). This situation is called an elevated LH to FSH ratio or a ratio of 3:1. This change in the LH to FSH ratio is enough to disrupt ovulation. While this used to be considered an impoant aspect in diagnosing PCOS, it is now considered less useful in diagnosing PCOS, but is still helpful when looking at the overall picture.

During progression of labor S/D of umbilical artery ratio?,Increases,Decreases,Persistent diastolic notch,Constant,"Ans. b. DecreasesFeto-placental perfusion assessed with Doppler ultrasound by three methods. Systolic versus end diastolic flow velocity (S/D flow) in the umbilical vessels, middle cerebral artery, and ductus venosus.UMBILICAL ARTERY DOPPLERThis test measures the ratio of systolic and diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.The umbilical circulation normally has low resistance, so significant diastolic blood flow is expected.The systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio normally decreases throughout pregnancy.Umbilical artery S/D ratio is gestational age-dependent.The S/D ratio normally decreases from approximately 4.0 at 20 weeks to 2.0 at term, and it is generally less than 3.0 after 30 weeks.Because of downstream impedance to flow, more end-diastolic flow is observed at the placental cord insertion than at the fetal ventral wall. Thus, abnormalities such as absent or reversed end-diastolic flow will appear first at the fetal cord insertion site.This test is predictive of poor perinatal outcome only in IUGR foetuses.Non-reassuring findings, which may indicate need for delivery, are absent diastolic flow and reversed diastolic flow.Note:-This notch disappears at 24 weeks of pregnancy as the resistance of uterine artery decreases due to trophoblastic invasion. There is no diastolic notch in late second and third trimester. But if this diastolic notch persists beyond 24 weeks, it predicts that female will have PIH during this pregnancy.Extra MileUmbilical artery Doppler waveform patterns vs USG patternsNORMAL UMBILICAL ARTERY DIASTOLIC FLOWABSENT UMBILICAL ARTERY DIASTOLIC FLOWREVERSED UMBILICAL ARTERY DIASTOLIC FLOW",B

Among the T-cell diseases is DiGeorge anomaly, in which defective embryologic development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches results in hypoplasia of both thymus and parathyroid glands. Associated findings with DiGeorge anomaly include CATCH: C for cardiac, A for abnormal faces, T for thymic hypoplasia, C for cleft palate, and H for hypocalcemia.Primary B-cell diseases include X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA, or Bruton disease), a deficiency of all three major classes of immunoglobulins, as well as other selective deficiencies of the immunoglobulins or their subgroups. This condition usually presents after 3 months of age (after maternal antibodies wane) with recurrent and often simultaneous bouts of otitis media, pneumonia, diarrhea, and sinusitis, but usually without fungal and viral infections. Combined T- and B-cell diseases include the X-linked recessive Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome of mild T-cell dysfunction, diminished serum IgM, marked elevation of IgA and IgE, eczema, recurrent middle-ear infections, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Patients with the catastrophic combined T- and B-cell disease known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease (Swiss-type lymphopenic agammaglobulinemia or SCID), have deficient T and B cells.

You counsel her about the etiology of this defect and the risk of further pregnancies being similarly affected, and state which of the following?",The hereditary pattern for this condition is autosomal recessive.,The prenatal diagnosis can be made by the detection of very low levels of alpha-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid.,Subsequent pregnancies are not at increased risk compared to the general population.,Supplementation of maternal diet with folate leads to a decrease in incidence of this condition.,"Diseases that are due to defects in a single gene are designated as autosomal or X-linked, depending on whether the affected gene is located on an autosome or an X chromosome. Genetically determined diseases that are multifactorial in origin (ie, neural tube defects) do not conform to the Mendelian pattern of inheritance but exhibit a variable outcome that reflects the interaction between a particular genotype and an environment. The relatives of persons with diseases of multifactorial origin have an increased risk of having similar abnormalities.The recurrence risk for most single primary defects of multifactorial inheritance (eg, neural tube defects) is increased with each child affected. This increased risk forms the basis for assuming that genetic factors play a role in the occurrence of these abnormalities. Other factors, such as race, sex, and ethnic and racial background, influence the frequency with which an abnormality of multifactorial inheritance occurs in relatives The prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects (anencephaly and meningomyelocele) can be made by the detection of elevated levels of alpha- fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid.

The valves are mucosal folds that look like thin membranes; they may cause varying degrees of obstruction when the child attempts to void. Children with posterior urethral valves may present with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of obstruction. Urinary infection and sepsis occur frequently. Severe obstruction may cause hydronephrosis, which is apparent as a palpable abdominal mass. A palpable midline mass in the lower abdomen is typical of a distended bladder. Voiding cystourethrography is the best radiographic study available to establish the diagnosis of posterior urethral valves. Treatment consists of destruction of the valves. Ref: McAninch J.W.

In which of the following conditions left atrium is not enlarged -,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,Aoopulmonary window,Patent ductus aeriosus,"Ans. is `b' i.e., ASD ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger 's syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect. All congenital hea diseases given in option cause left to right shunt. Size of left atrium in left to right shunts o In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of hea (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aoa) to right side of hea (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary aery) depending on the site of abnormal communication. o This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium. o The path of blood is then depending on the defect. o In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation --> Blood from right side of hea plus some blood from left side of hea because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal. o But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1)In ASD Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but founate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i.e., septal defect. So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium. i) Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle. ii) Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, PDA, Aoopulmonary window). In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit. So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium --> Volume over load --> Left atrial enlargement.",B

The advantages of hysterectomy in molar pregnancy are:,Chance of choriocarcinoma becomes nil,Follow up is not required,Enlarged ovaries can be removed during operation,Chance of pulmonary embolisation is minimal,"Hysterectomy when performed in molar pregnancy significantly decreases the chances of developing choriocarcinoma (by 5 fold times) but does not make it nil and hence follow up is required (so both options a and b are incorrect)

This is supported by following lines from Dutta-
“It should be remembered that following hysterectomy, persistent GTD is observed in 3–5% cases. As such, it does not eliminate the necessity of follow up.The enlarged ovaries (theca lutein cysts) found during operation should be left undisturbed as they will regress following removal of mole. But, if complication arises, like torsion, rupture or infarction, they should be removed.”
Dutta 7/e, p 195
Thus from above lines it is also clear that ovaries even if they are enlarged should not be removed during hysterectomy for h mole.

The onset of abnormalities may follow the onset of other symptoms by weeks (80% within 4 weeks) or even months (97% within 3 months).

Coming back to question

According to me the best answer is 4 months because renal involvement may be seen up to 3 months after the onset of other symptoms (examiner is asking about the renal involvement after onset of disease, not after the onset of other symptoms).
""Renal manifestations usually start at the onset or within 3 months of the onset of other symptoms"" — Pediatric nephrology

Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, i.e., the type of disease characterized by production of defective hemoglobin. Sickle cell anemia results from mutation in b-globin gene. It is caused by a point mutation (Base substitution mutation) at the sixth position of the b-globin chain leading to subsitution of a valine residue for a glutamic acid residue resulting in sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder. If an individual is homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS. In heterozyogotes, only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, the remainder being normal hemoglobins.",D

"A 9 year old girl is presenting with non productive cough and mild stridor for 2.5 months duration. Patient is improving but suddenly developed wheeze, productive cough, mild fever and on X-ray hyperlucency is seen and PFT shows obstructive curve. The MOST probable diagnosis is?",Bronchiolitis obliterans,Hemosiderosis,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,Follicular bronchitis,"Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare chronic obstructive lung disease characterized by complete obliteration of the small airways following a severe insult. The most common form in children is postinfectious, following a lower airway tract infection with adenovirus, although influenza, rubeola, Bordetella, and Mycoplasma are also implicated. Persons with bronchiolitis obliterans usually experience dyspnea, coughing, and exercise intolerance. This diagnosis should be considered in children with persistent cough, wheezing, crackles, or hypoxemia persisting longer than 60 days following a lower respiratory tract infection. Chest X-ray shows hyperlucency and patchy infiltrates. PFT shows airway obstruction. Ventilation-perfusion scans show a pattern of ventilation and perfusion mismatch. Classic findings on chest high-resolution CT include a mosaic perfusion pattern, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis. This finding along with pulmonary function testing showing airway obstruction unresponsive to bronchodilators may be diagnostic in some patients with the appropriate clinical history. Diagnosis is by open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy. No specific treatment is required. Administaion of coicosteroids may be benifical.

All the following are techniques used for preimplantation genetic testing except:,Polar body analysis,Blastomere biopsy,Trophectoderm biopsy,Morula biopsy,"Preimplantation Genetic Testing for couples undergoing in vitro feilization (IVF), may provide valuable information regarding the chromosomal complement and singlegene disorders. There are two separate categories of testing, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and preimplantation genetic screening each with different indications. There are three techniques that are used for both categories of preimplantation genetic testing:1. Polar body analysis is a technique used to infer whether a developing oocyte is affected by a maternally inherited genetic disorder. The first and second polar bodies are normally extruded from the developing oocyte following meiosis I and II, and their sampling should not affect fetal development 2. Blastomere biopsy is done at the 6- to 8-cell (cleavage) stage when an embryo is 3 days old, and it is the technique most commonly used for preimplantation testing. One cell is typically removed through a hole made in the zona pellucida. The technique is associated with a 10-percent reduction in the pregnancy rate 3. Trophectoderm biopsy involves removal of 5 to 7 cells from a 5- to 6-day blastocyst. An advantage is that because the trophectoderm cells give rise to the trophoblast no cells are removed from the developing embryo. Disadvantage is because the procedure is performed later in development, if genetic analysis cannot be performed rapidly, then cryopreservation and embryo transfer during a later IVF cycle may be required.(Ref: William's Obstetrics; 25th edition)",D

Which of the following has no role in the diagnosis of childhood TB?,ELISA,Mantoux,CXR,FNAC,"Lab investigations of pediatric TB

ESR and blood count: No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB.
Demonstration of AFB: Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it. Therefore sputum is not available for examination. A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteria. It is customary to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days. Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a Ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. The CSF, Pleural fluid or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculosis sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli.
Histopathology: Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC.
PCR: High sensitivity and specificity for pleural fluid and low for gastric aspirate.
CXR and CT may show characteristic features.
USG may be helpful for the detection of enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.
Serology: Elisa or other methods have no utility in pediatric TB.",A

X–ray shows hyperlucency and PFT shows obstructive curve. Most probable diagnosis is –",Post viral syndrome,Bronchiolitis obliterans,Follicular bronchitis,Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis,"Bronchiolitis obliterans

Bronchiolitis obliterans. is a rare chronic lung disease of the bronchioles and smaller airways
Bronchiolitis obliterans most commonly occurs in pediatric population after respiratory infections (i.e. adenovirus, mycoplasma, measles, influenza, pertussis).
Other causes include connective tissue disease (i.e. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma)
Bronchiolitis occurs in all age groups.


Pathogenesis

After the initial insult, inflammation affecting terminal bronchioles, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts may result in obliteration of the airway lumen.
Epithelial damage resulting in abnormal repair is characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans.
Complete or partial obstruction of the airway lumen may result in air trapping or atelactasis.

Clinical manifestations

Cough, fever, cyanosis and respiratory distress followed by initial improvement may be the initial signs of bronchiolitis obliterans.
Progression of the disease may ensue with increasing dyspnoea, cough, sputum production and wheezing.
Chest radiographs may be relatively normal compared with the extent of physical findings but may demonstrate hyperluscency and patchy infiltrates (occasionally, a swyer James syndrome, i.e. a unilateral hyperluscent lung has developed).
Pulmonary function tests demonstrate varaible findings but typically shows signs of airway obstruction.
Ventilation perfusion scan shows a typical motheaten appearance of multiple matched defects in ventilation and perfusion.
CT scan demonstrates patchy areas of hyperluscency.
Open lung biopsy or transbronchial biopsy remains the best means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans.

Treatment

No definite therapy exists for bionchiolitis obliterans.
Administration of corticosteroids may be beneficial

About other options
Follicular bronchitis

It is a lyinphoproliferative lung disorder characterized the presence of lymphoid follicles, coursing along the airways (bronchi or bronchioles)
It is rare in children.
Although the cause is unknown, an infectious aetiology has been proposed.
Onset of symptoms generally occurs by 6 weeks of age and peaks between 6 and 18 months.
Cough, moderate fever and fine crackles are common clinical findings.
Fine crackles generally, persist over time and recurrence of symptoms is common.
Chest radiographs may be relatively benign initially but evolve into the typical interstitial pattern.
Pulmonary function tests show restrictive pattern
Chest CT shows fine reticular pattern.
Open lung biopsy is used to make definitive diagnosis.


Pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis


This is a rare disorder.
Although the underlying cause of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis is unknown, the disease is characterized by the formation of lamellar concretions of calcium phosphate or ""inicrolith"", within the alveoli, creating a classic pattern on the radiograph.
Chest radiography typically reveal bilateral infiltrates with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance.
Although the mean age at the time of diagnosis is in the mid 30s the onset of the disease can occur during childhood.
When symptomatic, individuals with pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis usually complain of dyspnoea on exertion and non productive cough.
Physical examinations of the lungs may reveal fine inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds. Clubbing occurs, although this is usually a more advanced sign.
Children are often asymptomatic on initial presentation.
Diagnosis
Chest radiography typically reveals b/L infiltrate with a fine sandlike micronodular appearance or ""Sandstorm"" appearance.
CT scan shows diffuse micronodular calcified densities.
Open lung biopsy reveals laminated calcific ioncretions within the alceoli.",B

Select the ovarian tumor which is frequently associated with virilization (SELECT 1 TUMOR),Granulosa tumor,Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor,Immature teratoma,Gonadoblastoma,"Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which represent less than 1% of ovarian tumors, may produce symptoms of virilization. Histologically, they resemble fetal testes; clinically, they must be distinguished from other functioning ovarian neoplasms as well as from tumors of the adrenal glands, since both adrenal tumors and Sertoli-Leydig tumors produce androgens. The androgen production can result in seborrhea, acne, menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, breast atrophy, alopecia, deepening of the voice, and clitoromegaly. Recurrences of Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, which seem to have a low malignant potential, usually appear within 3 years of the original diagnosis. Granulosa and theca cell tumors are often associated with excessive estrogen production, which may cause pseudoprecocious puberty, postmenopausal bleeding, or menorrhagia. These tumors are associated with endometrial carcinoma in 15% of patients. Because these tumors are quite friable, affected women frequently present with symptoms caused by tumor rupture and intraperitoneal bleeding. Granulosa tumors are low-grade malignancies that tend to recur more than 5 years after the initial diagnosis. Because their malignant potential is impossible to predict histologically, long-term follow-up is mandatory. Recurrences have been reported as late as 33 years after the original diagnosis. Gonadoblastomas frequently contain calcifications that can be detected by plain radiography of the pelvis. Women who have gonadoblastomas often have ambiguous genitalia. The tumors are usually small, and are bilateral in one-third of affected women. The malignant potential of immature teratomas correlates with the degree of immature or embryonic tissue present. The presence of choriocarcinoma can be determined histologically as well as by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays. The presence of choriocarcinoma in an immature teratoma worsens the prognosis. Krukenberg tumors are typically bilateral, solid masses of the ovary that nearly always represent metastases from another organ, usually the stomach or large intestine. They contain large numbers of signet ring adenocarcinoma cells within a cellular hyperplastic but nonneoplastic ovarian stroma.",B

A pregnant female has past history of embolism in puerperium. What medical management she should take in next pregnancy to avoid this:,Cumpulsory prophylaxis with warfarin start at 10 weeks,To take warfarin after delivery,Chance of thromboembolism increases by 12% in next pregnancy,Does not need anything,"Ans. is b, i.e. To take warfarin after deliveryRef. Williams 23/e, p 1028, 29, Table 47.6Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we do not study in detail during under graduation.So, I am giving in brief, all the important points you need to remember;Venous thromboembolism in pregnancyVenous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries.Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of Virchow's triad are increased. QA, Deep vein thrombosis:Left sided DVT is more common than right sided DVT.Homans sign-i.e. pain in calf muscles on dorsiflexion of foot is positive.InvestigationsRecommended method during pregnancy: Doppler ultrasoundGold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy); VenographyThough objective evidence is ideal, treatment should be started on clinical grounds, if confirmatory tests are not available.ManagementDrug of choice in pregnancy is unfractionated heparinLow molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin) are safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. But they should not be used ini. Women with prosthetic valvesii. Renal failureiii. With regional analgesiaWarfarin is not safe during pregnancy as it crosses placenta and can cause fetal malformations (Conradi syndrome). The single undisputed use for warfarin in pregnancy is in women with prosthetic heart valves.Monitoring is done by - APTT and Platelet count.ProtocolFor postpartum venous thrombosis, treatment with IV heparin and warfarin are started simultaneously 6-8 hours after vaginal delivery and 24 hours after cesarean section and once INR is between 2 and 3, heparin is discontinued and warfarin is continued for 6 weeks.Note: Warfarin is absolutely safe in lactation.ThromboprophylaxisWomen at risk of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy have been grouped into different categories depending on the presence of risk factors. Thromboprophylaxis to such a woman depends on the specific risk factor and the category. (1) A low risk woman has no personal or family history of VTE and are heterozygous for factor V Leiden mutation. Such a woman need no thromboprophylaxis, (2) A high risk woman is one who has previous VTE or VTE in present pregnancy, or antithrombin--III deficiency. Such a woman needs low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis throughout pregnancy and postpartum 6 weeks. Women with antithrombin-III deficiency can be treated with antithrombin-III concentrate prophylactically.Now lets have a look at the question: It says a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant, what medical management should be given to her.Option 'a' i.e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks.It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy.Option 'b' i.e. to take warfarin after delivery - As discussed above, in all high risk patients, post partum prophylaxis with warfarin has to be given as peuperium is the time of greatest risk for embolism/thromboembolism. Thus option b is correct.During pregnancy: A women with previous H/O embolism becomes high risk patient. In such patients prophylaxis with heparin needs to be given. Hence option 'd' is incorrect.",B

"According to Tanner stages of development, which is the first sign of pubey in females?",Pubarche,Thelarche,Menarche,Increase in height,"GnRH stimulates secretion of LH and FSH which causes the ovary to produce estrogens. Subsequently changes of pubey occur including breast development (thelarche), development of pubic and axillary hair (pubarche), the growth spu (peak height velocity), and onset of menstruation (menarche). Thelarche (breast development) is the first sign of pubey (Tanner stage B2). It usually begins between 8 and 10 years of age and is associated with increased estrogen production. Pubarche (development of pubic and axillary hair) is the second stage in maturation and typically occurs between 11 and 12 years of age. Axillary hair usually appears after the growth of pubic hair is complete. Menarche (onset of menstruation) usually occurs 2-3 years after thelarche at an average age of 11-13 years. Initial cycles are often anovulatory and irregular. Ref: Blueprints Obstetrics & Gynecology By Tamara L.

Supine hypotension is a characteristic feature of:,First trimester of pregnancy,2nd trimester of pregnancy,3rd trimester of pregnancy,Twin pregnancy,"Supine Hypotension syndrome: During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position. This however results in the opening up of the collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygos veins. In some cases when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to the hea may be seriously cuailed. This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope. Note: The normal blood pressure is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position. The augmentation of the venous return during uterine contraction prevents the manifestation from developing during labour. Ref: Textbook of Obstetrics D.C.Dutta 6th Ed Page 53.",C
The commonest cyanotic hea disease manifesting as congestive cardiac failure during first week of life is -,Pulmonary stenosis,Fallot's tetralogy,Tricuspid atresia,Hypoplastic left hea syndorme,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Hypoplastic left hea syndrome o Amongst the given options, hypoplastic left hea syndrome causes CHF in First week. o Different congenital diseases have different time of onset of CHF : - 1)Left to right shunt o At bih, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, i.e., the pressure on side of circulation is high --> Pulmonary pressure is almost equal to systemic pressure. So, left to right shunt is small, whether the communication is atrial, ventricular or pulmonary aery level. As the neonate grows, pulmonary vascular resistance falls with maximum fall at the age of six to eight weeks (Note - In normal neonate, maximum fall is between 1 to 3 weeks). o This is the time (six to eight weeks) when the size of shunt is maximum as pulmonary vascular resistance is least at this time. So, patients with left to right shunts tend to develop CCF around six to eight weeks of life. 2)Right to left shunt Patients with right to left shunt may have : ? a) Shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level. b)Shunt at atrial level o Patients with shunt at the ventricular or pulmonary aery level do not develop CCF because the right ventricle is dompressed by the shunt. o Patients with shunt at atrial level may have. i) Obstruction at right ventricular outlet (Pulmonary stenosis or atresia) --> CCF develops in the first few days of life as ventricle does not decompress fully because shunt is at atrial level. ii) Obstruction at right ventricular inlet (Tricuspid atresia) CCF usually does not occur as there is no volume overload to right ventricle. But these patients develop congestive symptoms when the shunt is small. 3) Obstructive lesions o If the stenosis is critical (e.g., in aoic or pulmonary atresia), CCF may develop early because of impaired ventricular decompression. o Coarctation of aoa may develop CCF with in 1-4 weeks of life. However, if these patients do not manifest CCF in the first year of life, collaterals develop and prevent onset of failure by decompressing the obstruction. 4) Transposition o Patients with transposition of great aeries, develop CCF within first week of life, when there is no ventricular communication and the only mixing site is at the atrial level --> Hypoxemia along with anoxic myocardium results in tachycardia that causes CCF. o Patients with transposition of great aeries with an adequate ventricular defect and patients with transposition of pulmonary veins develop CCF somewhat later, usually by the age of six to eight weeks, following the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance as in patient with left to right shunt.",D

True about neuroblastoma:,Tumor of autonomic nervous system,Metastasis rarely present,Earliest detected in late childhood,All,"Ans is 'a' i.e., Tumor of autonomic nervous system o Neuroblastoma is a malignant tumor of autonomic nervous system. It is a neuroendocrine tumor, arising from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system. o Neuroblastoma is a disease of early childhood with approximately 90% of patients presenting before 5-years of age and almost 50% within the first 2-years of life. o In childhood, about 40% of neuroblastomas arise in the adrenal medulla0. The remainder occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain, with the most common locations being the paraveebral region of the abdomen (25%) and posterior mediastinum (15%). Tumours may arise in numerous other sites, including the pelvis and neck and within the brain (cerebral neuroblastomas). o It is the second most common solid malignancy of childhood. o In young children, under age 2 years, neuroblastomas generally present with large abdominal masses, fever, and possibly weight loss. In older children, they may not come to attention until metastases produce manifestations, such as bone pain, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints. o Neuroblastomas may metastasize widely (Present in 60-70%- Ghai 7th/5990) through the hematogenous and lymphatic systems, paicularly to liver, lungs, and bones, in addition to the bone marrow. o Proptosis and ecchymosis may also be present because the periorbital region is a common metastatic site. Bladder and bowel dysfunction may be caused by paraspinal neuroblastomas that impinge on nerves. o In neonates, disseminated neuroblastomas may present with multiple cutaneous metastases with deep blue discoloration to the skin (earning the rather unfounate designation of ""blueberry muffin baby)"" About 90% of neuroblastomas, regardless of location, produce catecholamines (similar to the catecholamines associated with pheochromocytomas), which are an impoant diagnostic feature (i.e., elevated blood levels of catecholamines and elevated urine levels of metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) Children older than age 5 years usually have extremely poor outcomes irrespective of stage (Robbins 7""/500-503) o NB can present as a parenoplastic syndrome of autoimmune origin manifesting as ataxia or opsomyoclonus (""dancing eye & dancing feet"").",A

Cut-off value of cervical length at 24 weeks of gestation for prediction of preterm delivery is:,0.5 cm,1.5 cm,2.5 cm,3.5 cm,"Ans. is c, i.e. 2.5 cm.Preterm labor (PTL): Preterm labor is defined as labor (regular, painful frequent uterine contractions causing progressive effacement and dilatation of cervix) occurring before 37 completed weeks of gestation.""Risk of preterm birth increases markedly when the cervix is less than 2.5 cm. This measurement has been widely accepted as the threshold to define the risk of premature birth. The possibility of preterm delivery when the cervix is <25 mm is 17.8%. This risk is significantly greater than the normal risk, and hence these women require additional diagnostic tests and special care."" --Fernando Arias 3/e, p 229, 230Also Know:Most common cause of preterm labor is idiopathic followed by infection like urinary tract infection, vaginal infections etcMost common organisms responsible for preterm labor:Ureoplasma urealyticum and Gardenerella vaginum causing bacterial vaginosis.Diagnosis of Preterm labor is by: --Dutta 9/e, p 294-Regular uterine contractions with or without pain (at least 4 in every 20 min or 8 in 60 min).-Dilatation (> 2 cm) and effacement (80%) of cervix.-Length of cervix (measured by TVS) < 2.5 cm and funneling of internal os.-Pelvic pressure, backache and or vaginal discharge or bleeding.Thus for detecting preterm labor -TVS should be done and cervical length measured. Besides this fetal fibronectin if present in vaginal/cervical secretions before 37 weeks indicates preterm labor.Fetal fibronectin:It is a fetal glycoprotein.Normally it is found in the cervicovaginal discharge before 22 weeks and again after rupture of membranes.If detected in cervicovaginal secretions prior to rupture of membranes, it indicates disruption of the maternal-fetal interface and may be predictive of impending preterm labor.It is measured by ELISA and a value equal to or exceeding 50 ng/ml is considered positive and predictive of preterm delivery.When the test is negative it reassures that delivery will not occur within next 14 days.Remember: Fetal fibronectin equal to or more than 50 ng/ml and cervical length <2.5cm on TVS are the best predictors especially in a woman with a prior history of preterm birth.",C

Urinary bacterial count is < 105/m1 is insignificant in all except :,Pregnancy,Healthy ambulatory male,In a setting of antibiotics treatment,Mid stream clean catch sample.,"Ans. is c i.e. In a setting of antibiotic treatment The concept of significant bacteriuria is given by Kass. Significant bacteriuria refers to bacterial count more than 105/ml of urine Prerequisite for collection of urine for culture. Clean voided mid stream samples of urine are employed for culture. Normal urine is sterile but during voiding may become contaminated with genital commensals. Even under ideal conditions (urine collected by catheterisation), rate of urinary infection is 296. In men. it is sufficient, if mid stream urine is collected after the prepuce is retracted and the glans penis cleaned with wet cotton. In women, anogenital toilet is more impoant and should consist of careful cleaning with soap and water. Results : - When bacterial count are more than 1051mi of urine, it is called Significant bacteriuria. Counts of 104/ml of urine are due to contamination during voiding and are of no significance. - In a patient on antibiotic treatment with some bacteria like staph. aureus. even low counts i.e. < 105/m1 may be significant.",C

A newborn baby presented with profuse bleeding from umbilical stump after birth. Probable diagnosis is,Factor XIII deficiency,VWF deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Glanzmann thrombosthenia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Factor XIII deficiency Bleeding from umbilical stump suggests Factor XIII deficiency.Neonates with a positive bleeding history, particularly with features such as delayed bleeding, umbilical stump bleeding or miscarriages and in whom the initial panel of screening test is negative should be tested for factor XIII deficiency.The normal screening tests such as PT and PTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency because factor XIII is needed to stabilize the clot after a fibrin clot has formed, so tests used for evaluating the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways are not affected. (Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.)Test used for evaluation of factor XIIITest used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea.Clots formed from normal individuals remain stable in 5M urea, while clots from factor XIII deficient patient dissolve in urea.This assay detects only the most severely affected patients with 1% to 2% factor XIII deficiency or tests.A quantitative chromogenic assay has been developed but is not yet readily available.In addition to hemorrhages these patients may have poor wound healing a high incidence of infertility among males and abortion among affected females and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage.About other options:Von Willebrand diseasePatients with Von-Willebrand disease rarely presents in the neonatal period because plasma concentration of Von Willebrand factor is high in neonatal period.Platelet function disordersGenetic disorders that result in deficient platelet function are rare causes of bleeding in infants.Most patients with these platelet disorders do not present in neonatal period but rather later in life. They are not recognized as a problem during the neonatal period.Glanzman's thromboastheniaThis is an extremely rare disorder of the blood in which the platelets lack the glycoprotein IIb/HIa.Hence platelet aggregation cannot occur and bleeding time is significantly prolonged and there is increased bleeding.Bernard Soulier syndromeIt is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and large platelets (giant platelets)There is absence of the platelet membrane GpIb/IX complex.Symptoms are consistent with low or dysfunctional platelets and include easy bruising, nosebleeds, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia and occasionally G.I. bleedingFactor XII deficiency * It is not associated with clinical bleeding.",A

"Prader willi syndrome, chromosomal defect?",Chromosome 15,Chromosome 5,Chromosome 10,Chromosome 21,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Chromosome 15 Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic condition that affects many pas of the body. In infancy, this condition is characterized by weak muscle tone (hypotonia), feeding difficulties, poor growth, and delayed development. Beginning in childhood, affected individuals develop an insatiable appetite, which leads to chronic overeating (hyperphagia) and obesity. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome, paicularly those with obesity, also develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (the most common form of diabetes). People with Prader-Willi syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual impairment and learning disabilities. o Behavioral problems are common, including temper outbursts, stubbornness, and compulsive behavior such as picking at the skin. Sleep abnormalities can also occur. Additional features of this condition include distinctive facial features such as a narrow forehead, almond-shaped eyes, and a triangular mouth; sho stature; and small hands and feet. Some people with Prader-Willi syndrome have unusually fair skin and light-colored hair. Both affected males and affected females have underdeveloped genitals.

"A female presented with thick white discharge and pruritus. aetiological agent is: September 2009, March 2013",Gardnerella,Trichomonas vaginalis,Candida,Gonococci,"Ans. C: Candida The most common etiologies in adults resulting in symptoms of vaginitis include Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis. Candidiasis is a fungal infection common in women of childbearing age that results in pruritus, with a thick, white vaginal discharge. Patients often have a history of recurrent yeast infections or recent antibiotic treatment. Symptoms of candidiasis often begin just before menses. Precipitating factors include immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and hormone replacement therapy. Candidiasis is usually not contracted from a sexual paner. Seventy-five percent of all women have one episode of candidiasis in their lifetime. Recurrent episodes may indicate underlying immunodeficiency or diabetes. Trichomoniasis is associated with risk factors for other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs); elicit a history of multiple sexual paners. The discharge is usually copious, slightly green and frothy, resulting in local pain and irritation. Pruritus might be present. Symptoms often peak just after menses. Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common nonviral STD in the world. Infection during pregnancy has been associated with preterm deliveries and low bih weight infants. Bacterial/ gardnerella vaginosis is asymptomatic in up to 50% of women. If a discharge is present, it is typically a homogeneous grayish white or yellowish white. Bacterial vaginosis is common in pregnant women and is associated with preterm bih. Treating pregnant women that have a history of preterm bih with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis early in pregnancy has been shown to decrease the incidence of preterm bih.",C

"A term large-for-gestational age newborn infant was born 50 hours ago by cesarean section to a 26-year-old primigravida mother with insulin-dependent gestational diabetes. The infant's initial glucose was 25 mg/dL, but after feeding subsequent glucoses have all been above 60 mg/dL. The infant is now diaphoretic and irritable, and seems to have some twitching and tremors of the extremities. The most likely cause of this infant's problems is which of the following?",Hypernatremia,Hypocalcemia,Hypoglycemia,Hyperphosphatemia,"Congenital heart disease, neural tube defects, small left colon, and metabolic derangements are all more common in infants of diabetic mothers. Hypoglycemia in these infants is usually seen in the first 24 hours of life. In utero exposure to the mother's hyperglycemia leads to fetal islet cell hypertrophy and beta cell hyperplasia, resulting in increased insulin production. After the umbilical cord is severed, that glucose supply is abruptly terminated and the elevated insulin levels cause hypoglycemia.Between 48 and 96 hours of life, these infants have usually achieved glycemic control. However, many now develop hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia. Hypocalcemia is thought to result from delayed parathormone (PTH) synthesis and/or responsiveness in the infant of a diabetic mother. Symptoms of hypocalcemia may include irritability, sweating, tremors, twitches, seizures, and arrhythmias. In the vignette, the child was showing symptoms of hypocalcemia in the appropriate time frame after delivery. Treatment of symptomatic infants is intravenous calcium gluconate.",B

Which is this structure?",Bladder,Body of uterus,Cervix of uterus,Pubic symphysis,"The cervix of the uterus is anterior to the rectum. Since the cervix is the inferior pa of the uterus that is protruding into the vagina, it should feel like a firm structure upon palpation. The bladder is the most anterior organ in the pelvis. So, the bladder would not be directly in front of the anterior wall of the rectum. The body of the uterus lies upon the bladder, so it is too far in front of the anterior rectal wall to be palpated. The pubic symphysis is the joint connecting the two pubic bones. It forms the anterior boundary of the pelvis, and would be too far forward to palpate through the rectum.

"A S2, S3, S4 lesion bilaterally can cause which of the followingmanifestations?",Painless menses,Painless Labour,Inability to abduct her thigh,Rectal incontinence,"Note the distribution of S2-S4 nerve. The S2, S3, S4 innervation, if damaged at the level of the spinal cord, is most likely to produce incontinence of bladder or bowel. Pain of the vaginal delivery arises from stimuli from the lower genital tract. These are transmitted primarily through the pudendal nerve, the peripheral branches of which provide sensory innervation to the perineum, anus, vulva, and clitoris. The pudendal nerve passes beneath the sacrospinous ligament just as the ligament attaches to the ischial spine. Sensory nerve fibers of the pudendal nerve are derived from ventral branches of the S2 through S4 nerves.... So labour will be painful but the vaginal stretching and the episiotomy may not be.

Examples include some forms of Tubal sterilization, Intrauterine devices, High-dose estrogen, Emergency contraception and Progestin only Minipills.",C
Test for ovarian reserve,LH,LH/FSH ratio,FSH,Estradiol,"FSH Ovarian reserve is the capability of ovary to produce egg. The ovary is generally thought of as an egg bank from which the woman draws during the reproductive life. During the .flrst few days of each monthly cycle, under the influence of FSH and LH there is rapid growth of several follicles in the ovary. After a week or more of growth one of the follicles begin to outgrow. All the others and the remaining follicles involute (a process called atresia), and these follicles are said to become atretic. The process of atresia is impoant because it normally allows only one of the follicles to grow large enough, each month, to ovulate. This usually prevents more than one child from developing with each pregnancy. The single follicle reaches a diameter of 1-1.5 centimeters at the time of ovulation and is called the mature follicle. With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce eggs declines. Methods of assessing ovarian reserve: With advancing age the capability of the ovary to produce egg declines i.e. ovarian reserve decrease with age. - Usually age is the best predictor of ovarian reserve but approximately 10% of women have an accelarated loss of ovarian reserve by their mid-30's. - So age alone does not tell the whole story. Consequently more refined methods .for predicting ovarian reserve have been developed. The methods for assessing ovarian reserve are classified into two groups:- a)Passive testing b)Dynamic testing The goal of both the approaches is to provide information regarding oocyte (egg) quality and quantity. Passive testing FSH level Early follicular phase FSH levels play an impoant role in pregnancy outcomes. As woman ages FSH becomes elevated in an attempt to force the aging ovary to respond. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this adaptive response remains unknown. A rise in early follicular phase FSH is also accompained by a decline in oocyte quality. High FSH has been correlated with poor ovarian reserve but it is difficult to establish absolute values that define how high an FSH level can be and still achieve pregnancy. Generally FSH level are expected to be below 10 lu/mlin women withreproductive potential - In one study it was .found out that 3 day FSH of less than 15 mlu/ml were twice as likely to conceive than women with FSH values between 15 and 24.9 mlu/ml. - Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. - Thus any determination of FSH needs to include corresponding estradiol level to indicate that the FSH level was drawn when estrogen level was low. Other methods for passive ovarian reserve testing Measurement of Inhibin B Inhibit B is an ovarian hormone that inhibits FSH release. Although present in ovulating women it is not normally .found in postmenopausal women. - Low inhibin levels suggests poor ovarian reserve. Transvaginal ultrasound Diminished ovarian reserve means that fewer follicles are available for stimulation and recruitment by _feility drugs. Transvaginal ultrasound allows the observation of ovaries and assess the number of follicles (ovarian volume). Dynamic ovarian reserve testing Clomiphene citrate challenge test ? Clomiphene is an antiestrogen which inhibits the negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamus i.e. the hypothalamus gets false signals that the patient does nor have enough estrogen. In response, the hypothalamus induces the pituitary gland to produce more FSH and LH. This is turn initiates follicular growth to produce estrogen. Clomiphene is able to exe this effect only when the estrogen level is low or the ovarian reserve is low. In a normal woman with adequate ovarian reserve there is enough inhibin and estrogen to suppress FSH production through negative feedback and resist the effects clomiphene. - When undergoing clomiphene citrate challenge test, the .first step is to measure day 3 FSH and estrogen. Then 100 ing of clomiphene is administered on cycles day 5 through 9 and FSH and estrogen measurements are repeated on cycle day 10. In general, a high day 10 FSH suggests poor ovarian reserve.",C

Graves disease is an autoimmune disease. The immune system normally protects the body from germs with proteins called antibodies. But with an autoimmune disease, the body makes antibodies that attack its own tissues. With Graves disease, antibodies cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. This is known as hypehyroidism. Excess thyroid hormone in the bloodstream causes the body&;s metabolism to be too active. This can lead to problems such as weight loss, nervousness, fast heabeat, tiredness, and other issues. Graves disease is an ongoing (chronic) condition that needs lifelong treatment or watching.

The most probable diagnosis in this infant is:,Febrile convulsions,Transient myoclonic epilepsy,Hypocalcemia,Hypernatremia,"Ans. A. Febrile ConvulsionsFebrile convulsions are the commonest provoked seizures affecting 3-5% children. They are defined as seizures. During fever occurring between 6 months and 5 yr. age in the absence of infection of the central nervous system in a neurologically normal child. Febrile seizures are frequently genetically determined. The convulsions are not related to the degree of temperature, but are frequent if temperature rises abruptly. Febrile convulsions may be (i) simple, benign; or (ii) atypical, complex. Lumbar puncture should be performed in the first episode of febrile seizure, in infants below 1 yr who are not immunized with Hib and pneumococcal vaccine, In all patients with febrile convulsions, a lumbar puncture is not required routinely. EEG and neuroimaging have no role in febrile seizures.",A
"In a multipara, the most common cause of Postpartum Haemorrhage is?",Retained placenta,Uterine atonicity,Uterine perforation,Fibroid in the uterus,"Uterine atony is a loss of tone in the uterine musculature. Normally, contraction of the uterine muscles during labor compresses the blood vessels and reduces flow, thereby increasing the likelihood of coagulation and preventing hemorrhage.
A lack of uterine muscle contraction, however, can lead to an acute haemorrhage, as the uterine blood vessels are not sufficiently compressed.
Clinically, 75-80% of postpartum haemorrhages are due to uterine atony.",B

Which of the following exocrine galndular ducts are not obstructed in cystic fibrosis,Pancreas,Lung,Sweat gland,All of above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Sweat gland Most CF patients have 3 distinct abnormal characteristics. The ducts of the mucus-secreting glands are obstructed due to an increase in viscosity of these secretions leading to glandular dilatation and destruction. CF patients are prone to chronic bacterial colonization and infections. The sweat glands are not obstructed in CF patients because in serous glands such as sweat glands there are abnormal concentrations of inorganic ions, rather than glandular obstruction with thick mucus. The quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test is a uniformly accepted method for diagnosing CF. The sweat gland ducts must be patent for this test. Obstruction of airways leads to bronchiectasis and atelectasis; pancreatic duct obstruction leads to pancreatitis and malabsorption; and plugging of bile ducts leads to obstructive jaundice.",C

Which of the following single agents is the most appropriate treatment of her condition?",Oral contraceptives,Corticosteroids,GnRH,Parlodel,"This patient has polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), diagnosed by the clinical picture, abnormally high LH-to-FSH ratio (which should normally be approximately 1:1), and elevated androgen but normal DHAS. DHAS is a marker of adrenal androgen production; when normal, it essentially excludes adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism. Several medications have been used to treat hirsutism associated with PCOS. For many years contraceptives were the most frequently used agents; they can suppress hair growth in up to two-thirds of treated patients. They act by directly suppressing ovarian steroid production and increasing hepatic binding globulin production, which binds circulating hormone and lowers the concentration of metabolically active (free unbound) androgen. However, clinical improvement can take as long as 6 months to manifest. Other medications that have shown promise include medroxyprogesterone acetate, spironolactone, cimetidine, and GnRH agonists, which suppress ovarian steroid production. However, GnRH analogues are expensive and have been associated with significant bone demineralization after only 6 months of therapy in some patients.

Bone age is advanced in,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Hypothyroidism,Hypopituitarism,Constitutional delay in growth,"An advanced or delayed bone age does not always indicate disease or ""pathologic"" growth. Conversely, the bone age may be normal in some conditions of abnormal growth. Children do not mature at exactly the same time. Just as there is wide variation among the normal population in age of losing teeth or experiencing the first menstrual period, the bone age of a healthy child may be a year or two advanced or delayed. Those with an advanced bone age typically hit a growth spu early on but stop growing at an earlier age. Consequently, when a naturally sho child has an advanced bone age, it stunts their growth at an early age leaving them even shoer than they would have been. Because of this, those who are sho with an advanced bone age, need medical attention before their bones fully fuse. An advanced bone age is common when a child has had prolonged elevation of sex steroid levels, as in precocious pubey or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The bone age is often marginally advanced with premature adrenarche, when a child is overweight from a young age or when a child has lipodystrophy. Those with an advanced bone age typically hit a growth spu early on but stop growing at an earlier age. Bone age may be significantly advanced in genetic overgrowth syndromes, such as Sotos syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Marshall-Smith syndrome. Bone maturation is delayed with the variation of normal development termed Constitutional delay of growth and pubey, but delay also accompanies growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism.

These symptoms can be attributed to which of the following,Reduced placental flow,Increased intragastric pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Inferior vena caval compression,"Ans. d. Inferior vena caval compression Symptoms of faintness and nausea in lying down position and recovery after turning on the side or getting up in a 26-year old primigravida at 32 weeks of gestation can be attributed to inferior vena caval compression. ""Supine hypotensive syndrome is caused when the inferior vena cava is compressed by the weight of a pregnant female uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluid while lying in the supine position. The condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximum during the third trimester. The patient experiences reduced blood pressure signs of shock such as cool, moist and clammy skin, tachycardia (early sign), bradycardia (very late sign), dizziness, syncope or near syncope, pedal edema, nausea, decreased femoral pulse and signs offetal distress. Supine hypotensive syndrome is easily managed by placing the patient in left lateral position Supine Hypotension Syndrome (Postural Hypotension) During late pregnancy, the gravid uterus produces a compression effect on the inferior vena cava when the patient is in supine position.Q This, however, results in opening up of collateral circulation by means of paraveebral and azygous veins. In some cases (10%) when collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return to hea is seriously cuailed.Q This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope.Q Turning patient to lateral position quickly restores the normal blood pressureQ.

The designation CIN III encompasses both severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.Cervical dysplasia is a precursor lesion of cervical squamous cancer. Most cases of cervical dysplasia occur in women in their late 20s and 30s. The pathogenesis of cervical dysplasia and cancer is an early age of first intercourse, multiple sexual paners, male paner(s) with multiple previous sexual panners, smoking, immunosuppression (renal transplants, AIDS), a strong association with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16, 18, 31, and herpes infection (possible cocarcinogen with HPV).Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a system for classifying dysplasia into mild, moderate, severe, and carcinoma in situ. The histologic correlations to these designations include CIN I (mild dysplasia), which involves the innermost one third of the cervical epithelium; CIN II (moderate dysplasia), which involves two thirds the thickness of the epithelium; and CIN III (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ), which involves in the full thickness of the epithelium.Koilocytosis refers to squamous cells with wrinkled nuclei surrounded by a perinuclear halo.

Gilbert syndrome true is -,Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,Starvation improves the condition,Phenobarbitone improves the condition,Life threatening,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Phenobarbitone improves the condition* Gilbert syndrome is a milder form of hyperbilirubinemia caused by a reduced activity of UDP-glucuronyl transferase. It is caused by mutation of UGT1A1 gene.* UDP glucuronyl transferase is involved in conjugating bilirubin to form bilirubin diglucuronide. Hence it presents as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.* Total bilirubin is mildly increased. But the ratio of unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin is high.* It presents as a milder form of jaundice. It is not life threatening* Starvation and stress are found to cause aggravation of the milder jaundice* If jaundice is disturbing, treatment can be tried with enzyme inducers like phenobarbitone. Phenobarbitone induces UDP glucuronyl transferase and helps in the reduction of bilirubin levels.* As some drugs also get metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase, detection of this condition is of clinical significance. For example, an antineoplastic drug, irinotecan is metabolised by UDP glucuronyl transferase. Hence in Gilbert's syndrome, Irinotecan has to be avoided. As UDP glucuronyl transferase defect increases the half-life of Irinotecan, it results in life threatening neutropenia.",C

The ductus venosus is a branch of the umbilical vein (not umbilical aery). The single umbilical vein enters the fetus and divides ductus venosus and poal sinus. The ductus venosus is the main branch of the vein which traverses the liver and enters the IVC directly.

These antibodies are passively transferred to the newborns from their mothers (IgG can cross placenta). These infants continue to test positive for IgG antibodies for upto 18 months. At the end of 18 month they will lose these antibodies so uptil 18 month of age this method of diagnosis cannot be used.
The presence of IgA or IgM anti HIV in the infant's blood can indicate HIV infection, because these classes of antibodies do not cross the placenta. However detectable quantities of IgA antibodies are detected only after 3 months of life and detection of IgM antibodies is very unreliable (both insensitive and nonspecific).
So direct viral detection assays are used for the diagnoses of HIV in newborn. These are


detection of HIV DNA or RNA by PCR.          
HIV culture
HIV p24 antigen
Immune complex dissociated p24 antigen        

These are very useful in young infants allowing a definitive diagnosis in most infected infants by 1— 6 months of age. Out of these method detection of viral DNA by PCR is the preferred method in developed countries.",C
Cryptomenorrhea is seen in,Asherman's syndrome,Testicular feminizing syndrome,Imperforate hymen,Uterine agenesis,"Cryptomenorrhea means monthly subjective symptoms of menstruation without the outflow of blood.In women with cryptomenorrhoea presenting as primary amenorrhoea, the common cause is an intact hymen or vaginal septum. A history of cyclic abdominal colickypain, retention of urine, the presence of a palpable abdominal lump and the visualization of a tense bluish bulging membrane on separation of the labia enables the diagnosis.Ultrasound scan of the pelvis confirms it. A simple cruciate incision of the hymen permits free drainage of the collected menstrual blood and leads to normal reproductive function.Ref: Shaw&;s Textbook of Gynecology; 16th edition; Page no: 324",C

It seems reasonable for women to substitute infant formula (top feeding) for breast milk if they are known to be HIV infected or are at risk for ongoing sexual or parenteral exposure to HIV.
However, the WHO recommends that developing countries where other diseases (diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition) substantially contribute to a high infant mortality rate, the benefit of breast feeding outweighs the risk for HIV transmission, and HIV infected women in developing countries should breast feed their infants for 1st  6 months of life followed by rapid weaning.

Select the most appropriate response of Pill forgotten for 10 continuous days (SELECT 1 RESPONSE),Stop pills and resume after 7 days,Continue pills as usual,Continue pills and use an additional form of contraception,Take an additional pill,"Common side effects of birth control pills include nausea, breakthrough bleeding, bloating, and leg cramps. If these side effects are experienced in the first two or three cycles of pills-when they are most common-the pills may be safely continued, as these effects usually remit spontaneously. On occasion, following correct use of a full cycle of pills, withdrawal bleeding may fail to occur (silent menses). Pregnancy is a very unlikely explanation for this event; therefore, pills should be resumed as usual (after 7 days) just as if bleeding had occurred. However, if a second consecutive period has been missed, pregnancy should be more seriously considered and ruled out by a pregnancy test, medical examination, or both. Women occasionally forget to take pills; however, when only a single pill has been omitted, it can be taken immediately in addition to the usual pill at the usual time. This single-pill omission is associated with little if any loss in effectiveness. If three or more pills are omitted, the pill should be resumed as usual, but an additional contraceptive method (e.g., condoms) should be used through one full cycle. Although most side effects caused by birth control pills can be considered minor, serious side effects do sometimes occur. A painful, swollen calf may signal thrombophlebitis.",C

A pelvis characterized by an anteroposterior diameter of the inlet greater than the transverse diameter is classified as:,Gynecoid,Android,Anthropoid,Platypelloid,"Ans. C. AnthropoidBy tradition, pelvis are classified as belonging to one of four major groups. The gynecoid pelvis is the classic female pelvis with a posterior sagittal diameter of the inlet only slightly shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter. In the android pelvis, the posterior sagittal diameter at the inlet is much shorter than the anterior sagittal diameter, limiting the use of the posterior space by the fetal head. In the anthropoid pelvis, the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the inlet is greater than the transverse diameter, resulting in an oval with large sacrosciatic notches and convergent side walls. Ischial spines are likely to be prominent. The platypelloid pelvis is flattened with a short AP and wide transverse diameter. Wide sacrosciatic notches are common. The pelves of most women do not fall into a pure type and are blends of one or more of the above types.",C

Billing method is -,Maneuver for delivery of head of fetus,Method of contraception,Ethical guidelines for better doctor - patient relationship,Assessing KAP in society,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Method of contraception Natural methods of contraceptiono These methods are :A) Safe period (rhythm method)# This is also knwon as calendar method first described by Ogino. Its calculations are dependent on length of menstural cycle. The method is based on the fact that ovulation occurs from 12 to 16 days before the onset of mensturation.# Calculation is as followso The shortest cycle minus 18 days gives the first day of the fertile period.o The longest cycle minus 10 days gives the last day of fertile period.o For example, if a woman's menstural cycle varies from 26-31 days, the fertile period during which she should not have intercourse would be from the 8th day to 21st day of the menstural cycle, counting day one as the first day of the menstural period.B) Basal body temperature (BBT) method# It is based on the principle that there is rise BBT at or just before ovulation.C) Cervical mucus method (Billings method or ovulation method)# It is based on the observation that at the time of ovulation cervical mucus becomes watery clear resembling raw egg white, smooth, slippery and profuse.D) Symptothermic method# This method combines temperature, cervical mucus and safe period (calender method) methods.E) Abstinence# There is complete abstinence from sexual intercourse. It is not used and can hardly be considered as a method of contraception to be advocated to the masses.F) Coitus interruptus# It is the oldest method of voluntary fertility control.

True regarding rubella infection in pregnancy is: March 2010,Risk of congenital infection is more in last trimester,Vaccination is indicated in pregnancy for protection,IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity,It is caused by DNA virus,"Ans. C: IgM antibodies in fetus reflects immunity Fetal rubella syndrome is a congenital disorder resulting from primary maternal infection with the rubella virus. It is characterized mainly by deafness, mental retardation, congenital cataract, hea defects, and other structural anomalies that may be found with variable severity and frequency. During acute rubella in pregnancy, the rate of congenital infection is over 90% in the 12 first weeks of pregnancy, approximately 60% in weeks 13 to 17, 25% in weeks 18 to 24 and then increases again during the last month of pregnancy. Etiology: It is caused by a RNA togavirus, which is the only member of the genus Rubivirus. The fetus is infected by transplacental transmission. Administration of rubella vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of maternal infection, although reinfection after vaccination is possible. The development of fetal infection reaches 50% among those exposed during the first trimester and 20% during the second trimester. Diagnosis: The most frequent sonographic findings are cardiac malformations (in paicular, septal defects), eye defects (cataracts, microphthalmia, and retinopathy), microcephaly, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and growth restriction. Deafness and mental retardation are expected after bih. Test for rubella specific antibody (IgM) should be done within 10 days of the exposure to know whether patient is immune or not. Associated anomalies: Occasionally the following anomalies can be associated with the classic findings of fetal rubella syndrome: renal disorders, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, meningocele, glaucoma, patent ductus aeriosus, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. Differential diagnosis: All the conditions that can be associated with congenital hepatomegaly and/or cataract should be excluded. It includes congenital infections (TORCHS), fetal anemia, fetal liver tumor, chondrodysplasia punctata, NeuLaxova syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Walker-Warburg syndrome. Prognosis: Intrauterine death may occur. Postnatal impact of the intrauterine infection varies from absence of any defect to all the anomalies mentioned above with variable severity. The agent may remain for years in the tissues, causing chronic infection and its complications (such as diabetes mellitus due to chronic viropathy of the pancreas). Management: Termination of pregnancy should be considered every time fetal infection is detected during the first trimester, due to the severity of the condition in this group. After bility, monthly sonographic monitoring for growth and follow-up of the anomalies is recommended. Prevention: Women found to be susceptible during pregnancy should be offered vaccination postpaum and before discharge from the hospital (vaccine is not recommended in pregnancy). Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to receiving the rubella vaccine.",C

The pediatric disease that most closely resembles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is,Schilder disease (adrenoleukodystrophy),Tabes dorsalis,Werdnig-Hoffmann disease,Gauches disease,"Werdnig-Hoffmann disease most closely resembles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Both of these diseases involve the degeneration of motor neurons. Presentation Symptoms symmetric flaccid paralysis most affected infants are hypotonic at bih proximal muscle involvement lower extremity greater than upper extremity sparing of upper cranial nerves e.g., normal eye movements Physical exam absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes tongue and finger fasciculatons infants have flaccid ""frog-like"" posture restrictive respiratory insufficiency ALS appears to be increasing in incidence. In 5% to 10% of cases, there is an autosomal dominant pattern with strong age-dependent penetrance. Proposed etiologies include oxidative stress, viral infection, immunologic disease, or some unknown environmental factor. Currently, the oxidative stress theory is ored because a defect in the zinc-copper binding superoxide dismutase (5001) coded on chromosome 21 was discovered. Because SO 01 is an antioxidant that conves the superoxide free radical into peroxide and oxygen, reduced activity causes apoptosis (individual cell necrosis) of spinal motor neurons. Inhibition of glutamate transpo potentiates the toxicity associated with the reduced SODllevels. ALS most commonly presents with both upper motor neuron signs (e.g., spastic paralysis) and, eventually, lower motor neuron signs (e.g., muscle atrophy, fasciculations). Atrophy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and forearms with hand weakness and spastic changes in the lower legs are early signs. Antioxidant cocktails have now been developed, which offer some symptomatic improvement. Werdnig- Hoffmann disease is a progressive muscular atrophy noted in infants. It often presents as the floppy child syndrome. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

A newborn suffering from perforated necrotizing enterocolitis is having the very poor general condition. He is currently stabilized on a ventilator. Which of the following should be done in the management of this patient –,Conservative treatment,Resection and anastomosis,Stabilization with membrane oxygenator and defer surgery,Peritoneal drainage by putting drains in the flanks,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening emergency of the GIT in the newborn period.

Management of necrotizing enterocolitis

Medical treatment of NEC include
Cessation of feeding
Nasogastric decompression
Administration of i.v. fluids
Systemic antibiotic against both gram +ve as well as gram -ye bacteria (after taking samples for blood culture).
Ventilation should be assisted if distention is contributing to hypoxia.
Early surgery consultation

Surgical interventions in NEC

Evidence of perforation is an indication for laparotomy and resection of necrotic bowel.
Failure to respond to medical management, a single fixed bowel loop, erythema of the abdominal wall and a palpable mass are additional indications of exploratory laparotomy, resection of necrotic bowel and external ostomy diversion.
Peritoneal drainage may be helpful for patients with peritonitis who are too unstable to withstand surgery. It is more successful in patients with isolated intestinal perforation. In many patients, no further surgical procedure is required.
Peritoneal drainage is performed under local anaesthesia. Alpenrose drain is placed in the right lower quadrant and permitted to drain peritoneal contents and decompress the abdomen. This procedure is employed predominantly in infants less than 1000g who have severe SIRS and are viewed as too unstable to be transported or to undergo laparotomy. In experienced hands, one-third of the patients require only drain placement.
A primary anastomosis at the time of initial surgery is indicated in patients with limited localized disease who have no distal bowel involvement and in patients who have demonstrated a walled-off perforation who are no longer manifesting the SIRS.

From this discussion, we choose the answer to be peritoneal drainage because:

Patients are on a ventilator (too unstable).
Surgery for NEC is resection and creation of an ileostomy, which is not given in the options.
Primary anastomosis is done only in stable patients with walled-off perforation.",D

"Kamla, a 48-years-old lady underwent a hysterectomy. On the seventh day, she developed fever, burning micturition and continuous urinary dribbling. She can also pass urine voluntarily. The diagnosis is:",Vesico vaginal fistula,Urge incontinence,Stress incontinence,Uretero-vaginal fistula,"Continuous dribbling of urine following hysterectomy points towards urinary fistulas as the diagnosis.
In case of urinary fistulas, if the patient never needs to void as there is continuous dribbling it signifies that the fistula communicates with the bladder. If, there is filling and emptying of bladder along with the fistula, it suggests fistula opening into one ureter i.e. Ureterovaginal fistula.
As far as urethral fistula are concerned, they give little trouble because the urethra is normally empty of urine. However, during micturition urine passes through the fistula and may then fill the vagina to dribble during body movements for a short time afterwards.
This patient is developing symptoms on the seventh day can be explained by: ""Fistulas resulting from accidental, surgical and obstetrical trauma are produced in two ways. They can be caused by a direct injury such as cuts and then they manifest themselves immediately by hematuria and incontinence. Alternatively, if they are the outcome of pressure necrosis or of ischemia, in such a case urinary incontinence, fever and burning micturition develop 7-14 days after the accident.""

Before concluding let's rule out other options as well:

In stress incontinence, dribbling of urine occurs only when intraabdominal pressure is raised.
In urge incontinence, the patient has the urge to void urine at a moment's notice and she is unable to control her bladder and passes urine instantly.",D

Which of the following is associated with Down syndrome: March 2010,Raised PAPP-A level,Decresed beta-HCG level,Raised estriol level,Decreased AFP level,"Ans. D: Decreased AFP level Alpha-fetoprotein is made in the pa of the womb called the yolk sac and in the fetal liver, and some amount of AFP gets into the mother's blood. In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amounts of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. This test may not be included in all screens, depending on the laboratory. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies. Inhibin A is a protein secreted by the ovary, and is designed to inhibit the production of the hormone FSH by the pituitary gland. The level of inhibin A is increased in the blood of mothers of fetuses with Down syndrome. PAPP-A, which stands for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, is produced by the covering of the newly feilized egg. In the first trimester, low levels of this protein are seen in Down syndrome pregnancies. It is impoant to keep in mind that even the best combination of ultrasound findings and other variables is only predictive and not diagnostic. For true diagnosis, the chromosomes of the fetus must be examined. Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 14th and 18th week of pregnancy. CVS is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.",D

"A 16-year-old girl has not yet reached menarche. She has normal secondary sex characteristics, and visual inspection of her external genitalia is unremarkable. The patient is given progesterone and has withdrawal bleeding a few days later. This patient most likely has",Primary ovarian disease,Turner syndrome,A destructive hypothalamic disorder,A constitutional delay in pubey,"The patient most likely has a delayed onset of pubey rather than a destructive lesion in the hypothalamic/pituitary axis, a primary disease involving the ovaries or a problem involving the end-organs (e.g., imperforate hymen). Note that she has normal secondary sex characteristics indicating the presence of estrogen. She had withdrawal bleeding after being given progesterone, which proves that the endometrial mucosa has already been primed with estrogen. In addition, a normal menstrual flow implies the absence of an end organ defect preventing menses from occurring.Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation by age 16 years. As a general rule, amenorrhea is the hallmark for hypogonadism, assuming that no end-organ abnormalities are present. As with secondary amenorrhea, primary amenorrhea is subdivided on the basis of gonadotropin levels (follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone ). Amenorrhea in the presence of elevated gonadotropins is designated as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (primary ovarian disease), while reduced gonadotropin levels is called hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypothalamic/pituitary disease). Normal levels of FSH and LH in the presence of normal secondary sex characteristics usually indicate an end-organ abnormality. The absence of secondary sex characteristics by age 16 years is always a more significant finding than having a patient with normal secondary sex characteristics.In addition to ordering gonadotropin levels, a progesterone challenge is an excellent test to perform in the initial evaluation of these patients. The absence of menses confirms that there is a problem, but it does not differentiate among the three main areas previously cited. Withdrawal bleeding indicates that the endometrial mucosa must have been primed with estrogen, so the hypothalamic/pituitary axis and ovaries must be normal. This test also rules out an end-organ defect. The following cha (paial list) provides a classification for these subdivisions of primary amenorrhea.",D

Investigation of choice for Hydrocephalus in infants ?,Cranial USG,CT Scan,MRI,X-ray skull,"Brain imaging Imaging tests can help diagnose hydrocephalus and identify underlying causes of the symptoms. These tests may include: Ultrasound. Ultrasound imaging, which uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images, is often used for an initial assessment for infants because it&;s a relatively simple, low-risk procedure. The ultrasound device is placed over the soft spot (fontanel) on the top of a baby&;s head. Ultrasound may also detect hydrocephalus prior to bih when the procedure is used during routine prenatal examinations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio waves and a magnetic field to produce detailed 3D or cross-sectional images of the brain. This test is painless, but it is noisy and requires lying still. MRI scans can show enlarged ventricles caused by excess cerebrospinal fluid. They may also be used to identify underlying causes of hydrocephalus or other conditions contributing to the symptoms. Children may need mild sedation for some MRI scans. However, some hospitals use a very fast version of MRIthat generally doesn&;t require sedation. Computerized tomography (CT) scan is a specialized X-ray technology that can produce cross-sectional views of the brain. Scanning is painless and quick. But this test also requires lying still, so a child usually receives a mild sedative. Drawbacks to CT scanning include less detailed images than an MRI, and exposure to a small amount of radiation. CT scans for hydrocephalus are usually used only for emergency exams. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

"A 4-year-old boy occasionally wakes in the middle of the night crying. When his parents check on him, he seems visibly frightened and tells his parents that Chihuahuas were chasing him. Choose the sleep disturbance most consistent with the history",Night terrors,Nightmares,Learned behavior,Obstructive sleep apnea,"Sleep disturbances are fairly common in childhood. Many children resist going to bed, and parents frequently give in just to get the child to sleep by allowing the child to sleep in the parents' bed or allowing them to stay up late. Unfortunately, children learn remarkably well how to get what they want, and the parents' concessions only make the problem worse. Learned behavior (behavioral insomnia, dyssomnia) is the root of many sleep disturbances in young children.Other types of sleep disturbance in children fall into the category of sleep disruptions, such as nightmares and night terrors.A nightmare is a scary or disturbing dream that usually awakens the child and causes agitation about the content of the dream. Nightmares occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Many children and adults have an occasional nightmare; recurrent or frequent nightmares, however, may be indicative of an ongoing stress in the child's life. Night terrors (pavor nocturnus) are non-REM phenomena seen less commonly than nightmares, occurring in 1% to 6% of all children. The child will be described as apparently awake but unresponsive; they can have evidence of autonomic arousal such as tachycardia, sweating, and tachypnea, and appear frightened and agitated. Attempts at calming the child are usually not effective, and the child will eventually go back to sleep. Although usually a problem in early childhood, night terrors can sometimes continue through adolescence.Somnambulism, or sleepwalking, occurs in 15% of children and is described as recurrent episodes of rising from bed and walking around. The child is typically hard to arouse and will have amnesia after the event. This usually happens in the first third of the sleep cycle, during stage 4 non- REM sleep. Somniloquy, or sleep talking, can occur at any sleep stage and is seen in all ages.",B
Which among the following is the Most Common tumour associated with Neurofibromatosis in a child ?,Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Acute monocytic leukemia,Acute myeloid leukemia,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare form of blood cancer. JMML predominately affects young children, most often developing in children under the age of 4. The male/female ratio of affected children is 2-3:1. The disorder is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of an immature form of a specific type of white blood cell known as monocytes. These abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow crowding out other healthy cells. The bone marrow produces specialized cells (hematopoietic stem cells) that grow and eventually develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. These cells are released into the bloodstream to travel throughout the body and perform specific functions. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to the body; white blood cells help the body to fight infection; and platelets allow the body to form clots to stop bleeding. When abnormal cells accumulate in the bone marrow, they can affect the production and function of these healthy blood cells. JMML cells can accumulate in other organs of the body including the lungs, skin, liver, and intestines. JMML is an aggressive and difficult to treat disease but is currently cured in about 50% of cases. Currently, the only effective treatment for most patients is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The exact, underlying causes of JMML are unknown, but nearly all patients will have a mutation that changes the DNA inside their blood cells in a RAS gene or in a gene that controls the activation levels of Ras proteins. With an incidence of 1 in 3000, NF1 is the most common familial cancer syndrome. Affected persons develop multiple noncancerous (benign) tumors of the nerves and skin (neurofibromas) and areas of decreased or increased coloration of the skin. Cafe-au-lait spots are common in neurofibromatosis type 1. However, many of these findings may not be present in very young children. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

A baby can breathe and suck at the same time. This is due to:,Highly placed larynx,Wide short tongue,Short soft palate,Short pharynx,"Ans. a. Highly placed larynx (Ref: Morgan 3/e p849; Logan Turner 10/e p382: Gray's Anatomy 40/e p584)A baby can suck milk into mouth and because of its palate in mouth is separated from its nasal cavity so while baby is sucking in milk, can also breath through nose.When the infant has to swallow, the soft palate rapidly moves upward to close off the back of the back of nasal air tube.At the same time, the epiglottis closes off the larynx and guides the milk into the esophagus.Because of these factors, infant can breath and swallow in quick succession.'As the person grow older, the larynx moves down to a lower position, this leaves a lorge gap between the back of mouth and the top of the larynx.'Anatomy of Airway in Neonate* Proportionately larger tongue* Tongue is pushed against the palate* Narrow nasal passage* Anterior and cephalad (highly placed) larynx* Larynx is anteriorly inclined* Soft, large, patulous omega shaped epiglottis* Epiglottis inclined at 45deg* Subglottic portion rather than rima glottides is the narrowest portion of the airway* Vocal cord at the level of C4* Trachea bifurcates at the level of 12* Larynx lies opposite 2nd, 3rd and 4th cervical vertebra at birth",A
A 3 year old boy is brought with normal developmental milestones but has delayed speech difficulty in communication and concentration. He is not making friends. What is the MOST probable diagnosis in this child?,Autism,ADHD,Mental retardation,Specific learning disability,"This child is most probably suffering from autism. Autism is a neurologic disorder characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction and communication and presence of restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Pervasive developmental disorder: Children with this disorder have impaired social interaction and shows repetitive behaviors. They do not have significant delays in cognitive, language or self-help skills. Childhood disintegrative disorder: Children have normal development for 2 years following which there will be regression in at least one of the following areas: social interaction, communication, and behavior.

"An infant born at 35 weeks' gestation to a mother with no prenatal care is noted to be jittery and irritable, and is having difficulty feeding. You note coarse tremors on examination. The nurses report a high-pitched cry and note several episodes of diarrhea and emesis. You suspect which of the following?",Fetal alcohol syndrome,Prenatal exposure to marijuana,Heroin withdrawal syndrome,Cocaine exposure in utero,"Infants born to narcotic addicts are more likely than other children to exhibit a variety of problems, including perinatal complications, prematurity, and low birth weight. The onset of withdrawal commonly occurs during an infant's first 2 days of life and is characterized by hyperirritability and coarse tremors, along with vomiting, diarrhea, fever, high-pitched cry, and hyperventilation; seizures and respiratory depression are less common. The production of surfactant can be accelerated in the infant of a heroin-addicted mother.In utero exposure to alcohol leads to a fetal alcohol syndrome consisting of growth retardation, microcephaly, flat philtrum, thin upper lip, cardiac defects, and hypoplastic fifth fingernails. Maternal cocaine use puts the infant at risk for vascular accidents and premature delivery, but not a withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, marijuana is not associated with neonatal withdrawal.

Which of the following is the aetiological agent most often associated with Epiglottitis in children -,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Haemophilus influenzae type b,Neisseria sp,Moraxella catarrhalis,"Ans. is (a > b) Streptococcus pneumoniae In recent days because of vaccination, cases of Epiglottitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b have gone down drastically and thus change in option from B to A. In the past, epiglottitis was most common in children 2 to 5 years old and was usually caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b. Now that most children are vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae type b, the disease is quite rare and is more common among adults. In adults, and also in children now, it is typically caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, and staphylococci. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (see Etiology) can colonize the pharynges of otherwise healthy children through respiratory transmission from intimate contact. These bacteria may penetrate the mucosal barrier, invading the bloodstream and causing bacteremia and seeding of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues. Bacteremia may also lead to infection of the meninges, skin, lungs, ears, joints, and other structures. Hib infection of the epiglottis leads to acute onset of inflammatory edema, beginning on the lingual surface of the epiglottis where the submucosa is loosely attached. Swelling significantly reduces the airway aperture. Edema rapidly progresses to involve the aryepiglottic folds, the arytenoids, and the entire supraglottic larynx. The tightly bound epithelium on the vocal cords halts edema spread at this level. Frank airway obstruction, aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, or distal mucous plugging can cause respiratory arrest. Noninfectious inflammation of any of the structures around the epiglottis may also result from thermal or chemical injury or from local trauma, including blunt trauma to the neck.",A

"Regarding Cephalohematoma, all the following are true Except",It is a Subperiosteal Haemorrhage,It may extend across the midline and cross suture lines,Occurs in 1-2% of live bihs,Underlying skull fracture may be associated with 10-25% cases,"Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage, hence always limited to the surface of one cranial bone. Cephalohematomas occur in 1-2% of live bihs. No discoloration of the overlying scalp occurs, and swelling is not usually visible for several hours after bih because subperiosteal bleeding is a slow process. The lesion becomes a firm tense mass with a palpable rim localized over one area of the skull. Most cephalohematomas are resorbed within 2 wk-3 months, depending on their size. An underlying skull fracture, usually linear and not depressed, may be associated with 10-25% of cases. A sensation of central depression suggesting but not indicative of an underlying fracture or bony defect is usually encountered on palpation of the organized rim of a cephalohematoma. Cephalohematomas require no treatment, although phototherapy may be necessary to treat hyperbilirubinemia.

Second stage of labour begins with,Complete cervical dilatation,Expulsion of foetus,Expulsion of placenta,Internal rotation,"Ans: a (Complete cervical Dilatation)Ref: William's Obstetrics, 23r ed. Chapter 17The dilatation and the effacement of the cervix occurs in the first stage of the labour. The patient is in active stage of labour once the cervix is effaced and dilated till 3 cm, following this the rate of dilatation is 1 cm/hour in cases of primigravidas and 1.5 cm/hour in cases of multigravidasThe beginning of the 2 stage of labour is characterized by the complete dilatation and the effacement of the cervixThe main aim of the 2 stage of the labor is the expulsion of the foetus through the female reproductive tract. The 2 stage consists of engagement, progressive flexion and descent, internal rotation, restitution, external rotation and lateral flexion for the delivery of the trunk.Engagement occurs when the greatest possible transverse diameter of the foetus enters the pelvic brim.Flexion and descent are the processes which occurs constantly during the 2 stage.Internal rotation is the most important step occurring in the 2 stage.Expulsion of the placenta is the 3 stage of labor which immediately follows the expulsion of the foetus.Once the baby is expelled, active management of the third stage of labour is recommended. In this immediately post the delivery of the baby, and after ensuring that the uterus is adequately contracted, controlled cord traction, uterine massage and administration of uterotonics is carried out.",A

True about Ebstein anomaly is?,Right ventricular dilatation,Right atrial dilatation,Left ventricular dilatation,Left atrial dilatation,"ANSWER: (B) Right atrial dilatationREF: Nelsons 18thed ch: 430.7Ebstien's anomaly is a cyanotic heart disease with decreased pulmonary flow Pathophysiology:Characterized by a downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, due to anomalous attachment of the tricuspid leaflets, the Ebstein tricuspid valve tissue is dysplastic and results in tricuspid regurgitation. The abnormally situated tricuspid orifice produces an ""atrialized1' portion of the right ventricle lying between the atrioventricular ring and the origin of the valve, which is continuous with the RA chamber.EBSTEIN ANOMALYThe right ventricle is thus divided into two parts by the abnormal tricuspid valve: the 1st, a thin-walled ""atrialized"" portion, is continuous with the cavity of the right atrium; the 2nd, often smaller portion consists of normal ventricular myocardium.Often the right ventricle is hypoplastic.The right atrium is huge, and the tricuspid valve is generally regurgitant, although the degree is extremely variable.At times, right ventricular function is so compromised that it is unable to generate enough force to open the pulmonary valve in systole, thus producing ""functional"" pulmonary atresia.Some infants have true anatomic pulmonary atresiaThe increased volume of right atrial blood shunts through the foramen ovale to the left atrium and produces cyanosis.Clinical manifestations:Although the clinical manifestations are variable, some patients come to initial attention because of eitherProgressive cyanosis from right-to-left atrial shuntingSymptoms due to tricuspid regurgitation and RV dysfunctionParoxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias with or without atrioventricular bypass tracts (""WPW"" syndrome).Diagnostic findings by two-dimensional echocardiography include the abnormal positional relation between the tricuspid and mitral valves with abnormally increased apical displacement of the septal tricuspid leaflet. Tricuspid regurgitation is quantitated by Doppler examination.Surgical approaches include prosthetic replacement of the tricuspid valve when the leaflets are tethered or repair of the native valve.",B

Estrogen administration in a menopausal woman increases the,Gonadotrophin secretion,LDL -- cholesterol,Bone mass,Muscle mass,"Ans. is c i.e Bone mass Before seeing any Reference for the Question let's rule out some options. Estrogen administration will exe a negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion and decreases Gonadotropin secretion rather than increasing it (Option 'a' ruled out). As I have already discussed in previous Question -Estrogen decreases LDL and not increases it (ruling out Option `b). Now we are left with 2 options, Option 'c' i.e. Bone mass and Option 'rile. Muscle mass. Estrogen given as hormone replacement therapy is most beneficial in preventing osteoporosis i.e it must be increasing bone mass. So, Option 'c'seems to be correct. Now have a look what texts have to say : Estrogen helps to maintain bone mass and skeletal integrity thereby protecting against osteoporosis. Effect of estrogen on bones : Estrogen causes increased osteoblastic activity in the bones. It is impoant in maintaining bone mass primarily by retarding bone resorption. The major action of estrogen is directed at reducing the maturation and activity of osteoclasts, by modifying regulatory cytokine signals from osteoblasts. The action of estrogen and progesterone result in increased expression of bone matrix proteins such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, collagen and alkaline phosphatase. Extra Edge : An overveiw of osteoporosis Risk factors for osteoporosis Non modifiable Modifiable Associated Medical Conditions * Age * Race (caucasian, asian) * Small body frame * Early menopause * Prior fracture * Family history of osteoporosis Inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D Smoking Low body weight Excess alcohol use Sedentary lifestyle Hypehyroidism Hyperparathyroidism Chronic renal disease Conditions requiring systemic coicosteroid use Diagnosis : Bone Mineral Density Measurement (BMD) Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) of hip and spine is the primary technique for BMD assessment. BMD is expressed as a T score, which is the number of standard detions from the mean for a young healthy woman. A T score above --1 is considered normal, a value between --1 and --2.5 denotes osteopenia and a score below --2.5 indicates osteoporosis. Evaluation of BMD by DXA is recommended for all women aged 65 and older, regardless of risk factors and for younger postmenopausal women with 1 or more risk factors.

The lecithin sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio is measured for assessing maturity of the following organ:,Lung,Brain,Hea,Spleen,"The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio for assessment of fetal pulmonary maturity. Before 34 weeks, lecithin and sphingomyelin are present in amniotic fluid in similar concentrations. At 32 to 34 weeks, the concentration of lecithin relative to sphingomyelin begins to rise. In the absence of complications, the ratio of these 2 components reaches 2.0 at approximately 35 weeks. There is increased risk of respiratory distress when this ratio is below 2. Because lecithin and sphingomyelin are found in blood and meconium, contamination with these substances may lower a mature L/S ratio.

In VVF
""Preoperative collection is best to be done through ureteric catheterization.""  So friends undoubtedly ureteric catheterization. (Don't get confused - it is not Foley's catheterization) is the best method for collecting urine for culture in a case of VVF. This option is not given, so, we will have to look for next best option.

""Urine collected through a sterile vaginal speculum will not serve the purpose because of contamination. 
Midstream clean catch sample is also contaminated in vesicovaginal fistulas. (Option ""b"")
Supra pubic aspiration done after proper cleansing and draping the patient with full bladder, is easy and next best method of urine collection after ureteric catheterization. But the only prerequisite for this method of collection is 'A full bladder' which cannot be fulfilled in a case of VVF as urine continuously dribbles from the vagina and therefore, bladder is never full.

Edema in nephrotic syndrome is due to,Sodium & water retention,Increased venous pressure,Hypoalbuminemia,Hyperlipidemia,"NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:- Characterised by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemua and edema, hyperlipidemia is often associated. Some patients show hematuria and hypeension. Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl). The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention. Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia. Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy. Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:- MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes. Immunofluorescence studies shows deposits of occassional mesangial IgM. Lab findings- urine examination shows heavy proteinuria. Hyaline and granular casts are present. Serum albumin is low.

During pregnancy there is reduced risk of which of the following condition?,Relapse of multiple sclerosis,Bell's palsy,Meningeoma,Chorea,"Ans. A. Relapse of multiple sclerosisThe onset of a new movement disorder during pregnancy suggests chorea gravidarum, a variant of Sydenham's chorea associated with rheumatic fever and streptococcal infection; the chorea may recur with subsequent pregnancies. Patients with preexisting multiple sclerosis experience a gradual decrease in the risk of relapses as pregnancy progresses and, conversely, an increase in attack risk during the postpartum period. Beta interferons should not be administered to pregnant MS patients, but moderate or severe relapses can be safely treated with pulse glucocorticoid therapy. Finally, certain tumors, particularly pituitary adenoma and meningioma, may manifest during pregnancy because of accelerated growth, possibly driven by hormonal factors.Peripheral nerve disorders associated with pregnancy include Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial paralysis), which is approximately threefold more likely to occur during the third trimester and immediate postpartum period than in the general population.",A

There are several limitations to their use, and there is currently no standardized assay in the United States. Moreover, most testosterone assays have poor sensitivity and accuracy in the female ranges (normal range, 20-60 ng/dl), which, even when elevated in conditions such as PCOS, tend to be well below normal male ranges (300-1000 ng/dl) Circulating levels in females vary according to reproductive maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, time of day, and also feeding . There are no age and gender normal ranges, and in fact there is no testosterone standard on which to base an assay . Other steroids with similar configuration may cross-react with the antibody used in immunoassay. Measurement of total testosterone by mass spectrometry (MS) has been recommended as a possible solution to these problems.

Here in the case since leison is visible we can go for direct biopsy i.e., Punch biopsy. Also know : Details of Diagnostic modalities in Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and Carcinoma cervix : A. Pap smear : It is a screening procedure. The primary goal of cervical cytologic screening is to identify women in whom fuher evaluation by coloposcopy is required to detect the presence of true cancer precursor. A speculum is introduced in vagina without lubricant and material from cervix is collected using Ayre's spatula. Whole of squamo-columnar junction has to be scrapped i.e. rotate the spatula through 360deg (Ist slide) and another slide is made from posterior fornix which acts as control. For more details, about Pap smear, see Chapter no. 2 B. Schiller Test : Principle : * Normal mature squamous epithelium of cervix contains Glycogen, which combines with Lugol's iodine to produce a deep mahogany colour. Abnormal squamous / dysplastic epithelium does not stain and constitutes a positive schiller test. C. Colposcopy associated with biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of cervical precancer. Ideally all patients undergoing treatment for abnormal cervical smears should be colposcoped. The aim of colposcopy is to identify the extent of the lesion and eradicate it by destruction or excision. The whole of the transformation zone needs to be visualize, as this area is believed to be the site of neoplastic change. Indications : Abnormal Pap smear cytology To locate abnormal areasdeg To obtain directed biopsiesdeg Conservative therapy under colposcopy guidancedeg For follow up of cases treated conservativelydeg In case of a lesion grossly suggestive of invasive carcinoma, cone biopsy is not indicated as it predisposes the patient to serious pelvic infection and bleeding. The diagnosis of such lesion can be confirmed by colposcopic directed simple biopsy. Colposocopy is safe in pregnancy. D. Endocervical Curettage : Transformation zone also extends into the endocervical canal. By colposcopy upper 2/3 of endocervix is not visualised. Therefore evaluation of the non visualised pa of the endocervical canal should be done by Endocervical curettage. Endocervical curettage should be performed in every case. - In which colposcopy is unsatisfactory. - where the lesion is extending into the endocervical canal. - Where the colposcopic impression does not explain the cervical cytology findings. E. Cone E'iopsy is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. Indications (Diagnostic) : When limits of the lesion cannot be visualised with colposcopy.deg The squamo-columnar junction is not seen at colposcopy.deg In Endocervical curettage-histological findings are positive for CIN II or CIN III.deg There is a lack of correlation between cytology biopsy and colposcopy results.deg Microinvasive carcinoma or Adenocarcinoma in situ on colposcopy or cytology results.deg Therapeutic - In case of CIN III",B

"A 9-month-old girl is presented with PR bleed, vomiting, mass & colicky pain in Rt lumbar region with masked liver dullness. She is in shock like condition. Management should includes – a) Barium enema b)  Saline reduction c)  Give O2 d)  Nasogastric tube d)  IV fluid",abc,acd,bcd,abde,"PR bleed, vomiting, mass in right lumbar region, colicky pain and masked liver dullness in a 9-month infant suggest the diagnosis of intussusception.
Patient is also having shock, so she requires treatment of shock and intussusception.

Diagnosis of intussusception 

The clinical history and physical findings are usually sufficiently typical for diagnosis. Plain abdominal radiographs may show a density in the area of the intussusception. A barium enema shows a filling defect or cupping in the head of barium where its advance is obstructed by the intussusceptum. A central linear column of barium may be visible in the compressed lumen of the intussusceptum, and a thin rim of barium may be seen traped around the invaginating intestine in the folds of mucosa within the intussuscipiens (coiled-spring sign), especially after evacuation.
Retrogression of the intussusceptum under the pressure of the enema and gaseous distention of the small intestine from obstruction are also useful radiographic signs.
Ileoileal intussusuception is usually not demonstrable by barium enema but is suspected because of gaseous disten­tion of the intestine above the lesion. The use of ""air"" enemas in the diagnosis and treatment of intussusception has supplanted hydrostatic reduction. Reflux of air into the terminal ileum and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve document successful reduction. Air reduction is associated with fewer complications and lower radia­tion exposure than traditional hydrostatic techniques.
Ultrasonography is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of intussusception.

Treatment of Intussusception 

The child should be first stabilized. A tube should be passed into the stomach through nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous line should be placed and fluids should be given to prevent dehydration.
Reduction of an acute intussusception is an emergency procedure and performed immediately after diagnosis in preparation for possible surgery. The reduction can be achieved by installation of barium, saline or air.

""In patients with prolonged intussusception with signs of shock, peritoneal irritation, intestinal perforation or pneumatosis intestinal, reduction (with barium, saline or air) should not be attempted"".

In the above cases and in cases where reduction by barium/saline/air fails, surgery is required, i.e., manual operative reduction.
If the manual operative reduction is not possible or the bowel is not viable, resection of the intussusception is necessary, with an end to end anastomosis.
Treatment of shock (e.g. O2 IV fluid etc) should be given first if it is present.

About option a & b

As the patient is in shock, reduction by air or barium is contraindicated. However, a barium enema can be used as a diagnostic modality.",D

A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus very much wants to become pregnant.

Patients with SLE have an increased incidence of spontaneous aboion, fetal death in utero, and prematurity. The mother may experience an exacerbation in the activity of her disease in the third trimester or peripaum period, and it may be difficult to distinguish between active SLE and preeclampsia.

A diabetic female at 40 weeks of gestation delivered a baby by elective cesarean section. Soon after birth the baby developed respiratory distress. The diagnosis is:,Transient tachypnea of the newborn,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Tracheo oesophageal fistula,Hyaline membrane disease,"Ans. is a, i.e. Transient tachypnea of the newbornRef. Ghai 6/e, p 166, 168; COGDT 10/e, p 316; Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1178, 23/e, p 1116Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books.Let's see what they have said.Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) --Ghai 6/e, p 166RDS almost always occurs in preterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation.It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate.According to Ghai - RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question).Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn;Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) --Ghai 6/e, p 168Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid.These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress.Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure.Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory support is necessary and prognosis is good.But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. COGDT 10/e, p 316 says:Neonatal complications: RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics.In this way we can derive some correlation between diabetes and TTN.Our answer is further strengthened by Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1178, 23/e, p 1116 which says -Respiratory distress:""Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than overt diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues, 1990b)"".So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress.In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer cannot be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i.e. option 'a' is correct).",A

A 30 year old male complains of loss of erection with low testosterone and high prolactin level in blood. What is likely diagnosis -,Pitutary adenoma,Craniopharyngioma,Cushings syndrome,Testicular failure,Ans. is 'a' Pituitary adenoma .Loss of erection with low testosterone level and increased prolactin level strongly suggests the diagnosis of prolactin secreting pituitary adenoma.These tumors arise from lactotroph cells and secrete prolactin. The low testosterone level can be attributed to gonadotropin suppression by the pituitary tumour.Presenting features in case of prolactinoma are -Loss of libidoVisual loss (due to optic nerve compression)Now let's see other options :Craniopharyngioma : Craniopharyngioma never affects prolactin level. The only hormone affected in craniopharyngioma is ADH. It causes Diabetes insipidus (d/t decreased ADH).Testicular failure will lead to decreased Testosterone but there will be no effect on prolactin. Moreover gonadotropin level will be increased whereas in prolactinoma gonadotropins are decreased.Cushing's syndrome : There will be no effect on either testosterone or prolactin level.,A

In asymmetrical IUGR, there is restriction of weight followed by length. The head continues to grow at normal or near-normal rates (head sparing). This is a protective mechanism that may have evolved to promote brain development. This type of IUGR is most commonly caused by extrinsic factors that affect the fetus at later gestational ages.* Symmetrical IUGR is less common and is more worrisome. This type of IUGR usually begins early in gestation. Since most neurons are developed by the 18th week of gestation, the fetus with symmetrical IUGR is more likely to have permanent neurological sequelae.",B

Protective bacterium in normal vagina is :,Peptostreptococcus,Lactobacillus,Gardenella vaginalis,E. coli,"Ans. is b i.e. Lactobacillus ""Doderlein's bacillus"" is a large gram-positive rod shaped organism which grows anaerobically on acid media. The Doderlein's bacillus appears in the vagina 3 to 4 days after bih and disappears after 1 - 14 days. It appears again at pubey and disappears after menopause. It probably comes from intestine and its presence is dependent on estrogen. its function is to conve the glycogen present in the vaginal mucosa into lactic acid so that the vaginal pH is maintained towards acidic side. This acid pH prevents growth of the other pathogenic organisms.",B

Hysteroscopic myomectomy scores over open omectoim in alb of the following except:,Less recurrence,Less post-operative pain,Less bleeding,Early ambulation,"Ans. c. Less bleeding Possible risk or complication of open myomectomy is excessive bleeding during the operation requiring blood transfusion, anemia due to blood loss during the operation and in post-operative period. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare. Bleeding is unlikely unless vessels are lacerated or injured in the cervical canal or lower uterine segment during dilation or deep ablation or vaporization. Hysteroscopic Myomectomy Hysteroscpic myomectomy involves inseing a hysteroscope through the vagina and the cervix into the uterus. Hysteroscopes are so thin that they can fit through the cervix with minimal or no dilation. Because the instruments are inseed through the cervix, no abdominal incisions are needed. A resectoscope, which is a hysteroscope fitted with a wire loop that uses high-frequency electrical current to cut or coagulate tissue, is then inseed to remove the fibroids. The loop is placed around the fibroid, electrical energy passes through the loop, and the fibroid is cut loose. The fibroid can then be removed through the vagina. Advantages of Hysteroscpic Myomectomy: This procedure is most often done on an ""outpatient"" basis under general anesthesia. There is usually minimal discomfo during hysteroscopy. It takes about 60 minutes to complete the procedure, which is followed by a few hours of recovery time. Hysteroscopy can be used to remove fibroids on the inner wall of the uterus that have not grown deep into the uterine wall. Complications occur less than 1% of the time with hysteroscopic myomectomy. During hysteroscopic myomectomy, intraoperative bleeding is rare. Bleeding is unlikely unless vessels are lacerated or injured in the cervical canal or lower uterine segment during dilation or deep ablation or vaporization",C

"A pregnant lady complaints of headache, feeling of excessive tiredness and drowsiness whenever she lies down in supine position. Her symptoms are relieved on sitting up and while lying on her side. What is the most likely diagnosis?",IVC compression,Compression on sympathetic chain,Raised intra abdominal pressure,Decreased blood supply to placenta,"Patient is showing features of supine hypotensive syndrome caused by the compression of inferior vena cava by the weight of a pregnant female's uterus, fetus, placenta and amniotic fluids while lying in the supine position. This condition can develop as early as the second trimester but is maximal during the third trimester, 36 to 38 weeks. When the pregnant female in these stages lies in the supine position, the added weight of the enlarged uterus and its contents will press down on the inferior vena cava. When the IVC is compressed it reduces the amount of blood that returns to the hea and reduces cardiac output, this can result in a loss of 30% of the effective circulating blood volume. It can take 3-7 minutes for significant hypotension to manifest.",A

Two month old baby presented with non bilious vomiting and a palpable epigastric lump. which among the following will be investigation of choice,USG abdomen,Xray abdomen,Upper GI Series,CT abdomen,"Ans) a (USG abdomen) Ref Nelson 18th ed pi555Above clinical scenario is about the classical presentation of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.Ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis in the majority of cases and allots an earlier diagnosis in infants with suspected disease but no pyloric mass on physical examination.Criteria for diagnosis include pyloric thickness >4 mm or an overall pyloric length >14 mm Ultrasonography has a sensitivity of ?95%When contrast studies are performed, they demonstrate an elon-gated pyloric channel, a bulge of the pyloric muscle into the antrum (shoul-der sign), and parallel streaks of barium seen in the narrowed channel, producing a ""double tract sign""Hypertrophic pyloric stenosisHypertrophic pyloric stenosis occurs in 1 -3/1,000 infants in the United States. Males, (especially first-borns) are affected approximately four times as often as females. The offspring of a mother and. to a lesser extent, the father who had pyloric stenosis are at higher risk for pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis develops in approximately 20% of the male and 10% of the female descendants of a mother who had pyloric stenosis. The inci-dence of pyloric stenosis is increased in infants with type B and O blood groups. Pyloric stenosis is associated with other congenital defects, in-cluding tracheoesophageal fistula and hypoplasia or agenesis of the infe-rior labial frenulum.ETIOLOGY.The cause of pyloric stenosis is unknown, but many factors have been implicated. Pyloric stenosis is usually not present at birth and is more concordant in monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Pyloric stenosis has been associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis, Apert syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, trisomy 18, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. A variable association has been found with the use of erythromycin in neonates when administered for pertussis postexposure prophy-laxis. Reduced levels of pyloric nitric oxide synthase have been found with altered expression of the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) exon lc regulatory region, which influences the expression of the nNOS gene. Reduced nitric oxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of pyloric stenosisCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONSNonbilious vomiting is the initial symptom of pyloric stenosis. The vomiting may or may not be projectile initially but is usually progressive, occurring immediately after a feeding. The vomiting usually starts after 3 wk of age, but symptoms may develop as early as the 1 st wk of life and as late as the 5th mo. As vomiting continues, a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ion, and chloride leads to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Serum potassium levels are usually maintained, but there may be a total body potassium deficit. Jaundice associated with a decreased level of glucuronyl trans-ferase is seen in ?5% of affected infants. The indirect hyperbiliru- binemia usually resolves promptly after relief of the obstruction.The diagnosis has traditionally been established by palpating the pyloric mass. The mass is firm, movable, ?2 cm in length, olive shaped, hard, best palpated from the left side, and located above and to the right of the umbilicus in the mid epigastrium beneath the liver edge. In healthy infants, feeding can be an aid to the diagnosis. After feeding, there may be a visible gastric peristaltic wave that progresses across the abdomen.",A

Lactational amenorrhea is due to :,Prolactin induced inhibition of GnRH,Prolactin induced inhibition of FSH,Oxytocin induced inhibition of GnRH,All,"Ans. is a i.e. Prolactin induced inhibition of GnRH In breast feeding females, prolactin levels are increased in response to suckling stimulus of breast feeding. Besides iProlactin, FSH concentrations are normal and LH concentrations are low. Despite the presence of gonadotropin the ovary during lactational hyperprolactinemia does not display follicular development and does not secrete estrogen. These observations suggest that high concentrations of prolactin can work at both central level (by inhibiting pulsatile secretion of GnRH) and peripheral level i.e. ovarian sites (by inhibiting synthesis of progesterone and by changing testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratio i.e. increasing local anti estrogen concentrations) to produce lactational amenorrhea and anovulation. The principle of GnRH suppression by prolactin is reinforced by the demonstration that, treatment of amenorrheic, lactating women with pulsatile GnRH, fully restores pituitary secretion and normal ovarian cyclic activity.",A

Which of the following mechanisms best explains the contraceptive effect of birth control pills that contain both synthetic estrogen and progestin?,Direct inhibition of oocyte maturation,Inhibition of ovulation,Production of uterine secretions that are toxic to developing embryos,Impairment of implantation hyperplastic changes of the endometrium,"The marked effectiveness of the combined oral contraceptive pill, which contains a synthetic estrogen and a progestin, is related to its multiple antifertility actions. The primary effect is to suppress gonadotropins at the time of the midcycle LH surge, thus inhibiting ovulation. The prolonged progestational effect also causes thickening of the cervical mucus and atrophic (not hyperplastic) changes of the endometrium, thus impairing sperm penetrability and ovum implantation, respectively. Progestational agents in oral contraceptives work by a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the secretion of LH and, as a result, prevent ovulation. They also cause decidualization and atrophy of the endometrium, thereby making implantation impossible. In addition, the cervical mucus, which at ovulation is thin and watery, is changed by the influence of progestational agents to a tenacious compound that severely limits sperm motility. Some evidence indicates that progestational agents may change ovum and sperm migration patterns within the reproductive system. Progestins do not prevent irregular bleeding. Estrogen in birth control pills enhances the negative feedback of the progestins and stabilizes the endometrium to prevent irregular menses. Oral contraceptives have no direct effect on oocyte maturation and do not cause uterotubal obstruction.",B

Decoicate child-False statement is,Acute Brain injury,"Susthalamic, CT & frontal lobe lesion",More dangerous than decerebrate lesion,Flexion of arm & extension of lower limb,"Causes of decoicate posturing : brain tumor. stroke. brain problem due to drug use, poisoning, infection, or liver failure. increased pressure in the brain. Decoicate Posturing The mechanism for decoicate posturing is not as well studied as that of decerebrate. Phylogenetically, the region of the red nucleus within the midbrain plays a significant pa in locomotion. In primates, the rubrospinal tract influences primitive grasp reflexes, paicularly in infants and is, incidentally, responsible for crawling.The rubrospinal tract carries signals from the red nucleus to the spinal motor neurons. Primates are reliant on fine motor skills, and therefore the motor coex the coicospinal tracts is more prominent in movement than phylogenetically lower regions. Extensive lesions involving the forebrain, diencephalon, or rostral midbrain are known to cause decoicate posturing. This includes the motor coex, premotor coex, corona radiata, internal capsule, and thalamus.In primates, the rubrospinal tract descends as far as the thoracic spine, it, therefore, has effects on the upper limbs but not lower. The red nucleus, the rubrospinal tract, causes a flexion, grasping type reflex of the upper limbs. The higher brain centers, such as the cerebral coex, inhibit this reflex during normal physiology. With a lesion of the coicospinal tract, the red nucleus is disinhibited, and the flexion reflex of the upper limbs is unimpeded. The vestibulospinal tracts, as discussed above, are also left disinhibited, and extension of the lower limbs occurs. This flexion of the upper limbs and extension of lower limbs is decoicate posturing. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C
In which of the following conditions left atrium is not enlarged –,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,Aortopulmonary window,Patent ductus arteriosus,"ASD is associated with an enlarged right atrium & right ventricle to accommodate large volume of blood. The left atrium is not enlarged because it decompresses itself by shunting blood to the right atrium at a minor difference in pressure. The left atrium may enlarge once Eisenmenger’s syndrome develops and a reversal of shunt is seen across the defect.
All congenital heart diseases given in option cause left to right shunt.
Size of left atrium in left to right shunts

In left to right shunt, blood enters from left side of heart (Lt. atrium, Lt ventricle or aorta) to right side of heart (Rt atrium, Rt ventricle or pulmonary artery) depending on the site of abnormal communication.
This blood then flows through pulmonary circulation and again enters the left atrium.
The path of blood is then depending on the defect.
In all these defects, left atrium recieves larger volume of blood which comes through pulmonary circulation → Blood from right side of heart plus some blood from left side of heart because of shunt enter into pulmonary circulation and then into left atrium. So left atrium recieve blood volume larger than normal.
But the effect of larger volume on left atrium will be different in ASD and other left to right shunts. 1)In ASD
Left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, but fortunate for the left atrium, it also has an extra exit for blood, i.e., septal defect.
So, larger volume of blood is decompressed through left atrium.



Amount, which is normally exits through AV valve (mitral valve) into left ventricle.
Extra amount, which left atrium recieves, exits through septal defect into right atrium. 2) Other left to right shunts (VSD, FDA, Aortopulmonary window).


In these defects also, left atrium recieves extra volume of blood, But there is no extra exit.
So, left atrium can pump out only normal amount of blood through mitral valve, and extra volume remains in the left atrium → Volume over load → Left atrial enlargement.",B

Milk ejection is due to which hormone -,Oxytocin,Progesterone,Estrogen,Prolactin,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Oxytocin Physiology of Lactation* 500-800 ml of milk is produced by a healthy mother per day which requires 700 kcal/day.* Physiological basis consists of 4 phases:1. Mammogenesis : Growth of both ductal and lobuloalveolar systems occurs in pregnancy2. Lactogenesis : Colostrum secretion is noted during pregnancy and immediately post delivery. Milk secretion starts around the third postpartum day. Despite high prolactin levels in pregnancy, milk is not secreted as the high levels of estrogen and progesterone make the breast tissue unresponsive. With withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone levels post delivery, prolactin acts on the breast tissue. Growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin also increase secretory activity.3. Galactokinesis: Milk is discharged due to the infant's suckling efforts and also a contractile mechanism which expresses milk from the alveoli into the ducts. Oxytocin is a major galactokinetic hormone.# Milk ejection reflex: Reflex by which milk is forced down into the ampulla of the lactiferous duct, where it can be sucked out by the baby.4.

The theorized function of the Hyl anastomosis is equalization of which of the following?,Oxygen diffusion across villi,Osmotic gradient across fetal membranes,Pressure gradient between spiral aeries,Pressure gradient between umbilical aeries,"The Hyl anastomosis is a common connection between the umbilical aeries near the cord inseion in most human placentas. It has been speculated that it equalizes the blood pressure between the territories supplied by the umbilical aeries. When placental territories of one aery impose increased resistance to fetal blood flow, the Hyl anastomosis redistributes the blood flow into the second aery to reduce the large pressure gradients that are developed in the affected aery. The Hyl anastomosis plays the role of either a safety valve or a pressure stabilizer between the umbilical aeries at the placental inseion.",D

NADA's criteria are used for –,Assessment of child for degree of dehydration,Assessment of child for degree of malnutrition,Assessment of child for presence of heart disease,Assessment of child for degree of mental retardation,"The assessment of a child for the absence or presence of Heart disease can be done with the help of some guidelines suggested by NADA and are called NADA's criteria.

NADA's Criteria

Either one major or two minor criteria are necessary for indicating the presence of heart disease.

A) Major Criteria
1) Systolic murmur of grade III or more.


The systolic murmur is classified into : -


Ejection systolic murmur
Pansystolic murmur


Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity.
Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur          

i) VSD                         
ii) MR                       
iii) TR

Ejection systolic murmur, on the other hand, may be organic or functional.  an If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic.
If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity → It is organic.
Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children.

2) Diastolic murmur

Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease.
There are two exceptions.


Severe hypertension → Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear.
Anemia → May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area.

3) Cyanosis

Central cyanosis indicates the presence of heart disease if lung disease has been excluded.

4) CHF

Presence of CHF indicates the presence of heart disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia.

B) Minor criteria

Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity.
Abnormal second heart sound


Abnormal S2 always indicates the presence of heart disease.
It has been included as a minor criterion only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding

3) Abnormal ECG

The main value of ECG lies in determining the : -


Mean QRS axis
Right or left atrial hypertrophy
Right or left ventricular hypertrophy

4) Abnormal X-ray

 If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of heart disease.

5) Abnormal BP",C

It is determined that the child has very low levels of hemoglobin A, with elevated fractions of hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F. Which of the following underlying mechanisms is most likely related to the observed findings?",Amino acid substitution on b globin,Antibody against fetal blood cells,Cytoskeletal protein defect,Insufficient production of b globin,"This child most likely has b+ thalassemia, an autosomal recessive disease that, in the homozygous state, produces defects in the transcription, processing, or translation of b globin mRNA. The predominant hemoglobin switches from HbF (a2g2) to HbA (a2b2) at about 6 months of age, at which point these children become markedly anemic because of their inability to synthesize the b globin chain. The anemia of b thalassemia is microcytic and hypochromic with anisocytosis. Amino acid substitutions in b globin lead to hemoglobinopathies, of which sickle cell anemia is the archetype. Homozygotes with these hemoglobin variants do not produce any HbA, but rather mutant types, such as HbS, HbC and HbM. Antibodies against fetal blood cells are generally produced by a mother who has been sensitized to fetal blood antigens by transfusion or a previous pregnancy.

Correction of dehydration, electrolytes and hypoglycemia2. Evaluation for infections using appropriate investigations and their management3.

Examination of the nose after topical decongestants shows pus in the middle meatus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Brain abscess,Maxillary sinusitis,Streptococcal throat infection,Sphenoid sinusitis,"Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are large enough to harbor infections from infancy. Frontal sinuses are rarely large enough to harbor infections until the sixth to tenth year of life. Sphenoid sinuses do not become large until about the third to fifth year of life. In general, a ""cold"" lasting longer than 10 to 14 days with fever and facial pain is suggestive of rhinosinusitis. Examination of the nose can reveal pus draining from the middle meatus in maxillary, frontal, or anterior ethmoid sinusitis. Pus in the superior meatus indicates sphenoid or posterior ethmoid sinuses. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds and can be difficult. Positive findings on plain sinus films in a symptomatic child are supportive of sinusitis. CT scans are more sensitive, but are usually reserved for the more complicated cases. The treatment is usually oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. Decongestants and antihistamines have not been shown to be helpful or necessary.Brain abscess is unlikely in this patient who demonstrates no neurologic symptoms. A streptococcal throat infection should present with acute onset of sore throat without other signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Sphenoid sinusitis usually does not cause facial pain or drainage from the middle meatus.

Best parameter measured by ultrasound to assess foetal maturity in the first trimester?,Crown - rump length,Biparietal diameter,Ratio of transverse diameter of abdomen to foetal head diameter,Transverse diameter of abdomen,"Ans. A. Crown - rump lengthThe most sensitive indicator of symmetric and asymmetric IUGR is the abdominal circumference, which has a sensitivity of over 95 percent if the measurement is below the 2.5th percentile. Head/abdomen ratio is very useful in suspected IUGR when sparing head growth is observed (asymmetrical IUGR) and ratio is increased. Between 20 and 36 weeks of gestation, the HC/AC ratio normally drops almost linearly from 1.2 to 1.0. The ratio is normal in the fetus with symmetric growth restriction and elevated in the infant with asymmetric growth restriction.1. First trimestercrown-rump length is most accurate. The image should be obtained in a sagittal plane and include neither the yolk sac nor a limb bud. If carefully performed, it has a variation of only 3 to 5 days.2. Second trimesterBetween 14 and 26 weeks, the biparietal diameter (BPD) is usually the most accurate parameter, with a variation of 7 to 10 days. By convention, the BPD is measured from the outer edge of the proximal skull to the inner edge of the distal skull, at the level of the thalami and cavum Septi pellucidi.The head circumference (HC) also is measured. If the head shape is flattened (dolichocephaly) or rounded (brachycephaly), this measurement is more reliable than the BPD.The femur length (FL) correlates well with both BPD and gestational age. The femur is measured with the beam perpendicular to the long axis of the shaft, excluding the epiphysis, and has a variation of 7 to 11 days in the second trimester.The abdominal circumference (AC) is the parameter with the widest variation of 2 to 3 weeks. This is because the AC measurement involves soft tissue rather than bone and is also the parameter most affected by fetal growth. The AC is measured at the skin line in a transverse view of the fetus at the level of the fetal stomach and umbilical vein.3. Third trimesterThe variability of gestational age estimation increases as pregnancy advances. By the third trimester, all individual measurements become less accurate. Estimates are improved by taking an average of the various parameters the BPD, HC, AC, and FL. Also, each measurement should be assessed individually; if one measurement is significantly different from the others, it can be excluded from the calculation. The outlier measurement could result from poor visibility, or it could indicate a fetal growth abnormality. If third-trimester ultrasound measurements must be used to determine gestational age, accuracy can be improved by performing serial examinations and documenting normal interval fetal growth",A

"A pregnant female in first trimester has 4 fold rise in IgG against toxoplasmosis, what does it indicate-",Acute infection in mother,Chronic infection in mother,Protective antibodies,None of the above,"Ans. is B. IgG is chronic IgM is acute Ref- Distinguishing of acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis has critical importance in pregnant women and immunocompromised patients. Some assays have been used to measure Toxoplasma specific IgM antibodies as indicators of the acute phase infection . Toxoplasma IgM antibodies can be detected for 1 year or longer in some cases, so in asymptomatic individuals with stable titers of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies, positive IgM results are not easy to interpret . The IgG avidity assay that had been started in the 1980s for diagnosis of rubella and hepatitis C is now used to distinguish between acute and chronic toxoplasmosis . This method was originally developed by Hedman et al. in Finland. It is based on dissociation of hydrogen bond between antigen and antibody with urea . High avidity (AI>=60%) means that Toxoplasma infection was acquired before 3 months ago, whereas borderline avidity (50%<AI<60%) means infection at an indeterminate period, and low avidity (AI<=50%) means that the infection was acquired within the last 3 months. According to the present study, 88.9% of patients with acute toxoplasmosis had low avidity (AI<=50%) and 92.7% of individuals with chronic infection had high avidity ranges (AI>=60%). It was suggested that Toxoplasma specific IgG avidity assay that is performed on specific IgM positive samples could diagnose acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis . Candolfi et al. also demonstrated that measuring of IgG avidity could differentiate between acute and chronic phases of toxoplasmosis. Our results showed that there was no significant relation between the concentration of IgG antibody and the level of AI. Therefore, the strength of links between antibody and antigen is not dependent on antibody concentration, which was confirmed by other investigators . Meanwhile, there are a converse relationship between IgM titer and levels of IgG AI in this study (P<0.05). On the other hand, Remington et al. suggested that IgG avidity ELISA test is not enough to confirm acute toxoplasmosis, and it should be done in addition to IgM ELISA test. Many investigators had mentioned the role of IgM detection as a key for diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis . One of the limitations of IgG avidity method is detection of reactivated toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients . In the present study, both IgM ELISA and IgG avidity ELISA tests together could confirm the phases of infection absolutely.",B

In either case, there must be no evidence of spread beyond the operative field, as suggested by negative intraoperative frozen-section biopsies. The procedure involves excision of the uterus, the upper third of the vagina, the uterosacral and uterovesical ligaments, and all of the parametrium, and pelvic node dissection including the ureteral, obturator, hypogastric, and iliac nodes.* Radical hysterectomy, thus, attempts to preserve the bladder, rectum, and ureters while excising as much as possible of the remaining tissue around the cervix that might be involved in microscopic spread of the disease. Ovarian metastases from cervical cancer are extremely rare. Preservation of the ovaries is generally acceptable, particularly in younger women.",D

iv. Sperm antibodies
The treatment of cervical factor thus depends on the cause:
• If it is due to chronic cervicitis/infection - Treatment of infection by antibiotics is the cure.
• If is due to decreased mucus volume - Treatment includes short term supplementation with exogenous estrogen like ethinyl estradiol and use of mucolytic expectorant like guaifenesin. However, their value has not been confirmed.
• If it is due to antisperm antibodies. Treatment options include:
– Use of condom or diaphragm as a barrier method for 3 months. During this period, the antibodies will disappear and conception may occur then.
– Corticosteroids given to female partner can also help in getting rid of these antibodies.
– Intrauterine insemination at the time of ovulation (most acceptable method for cervical factor infertility) or GIFT (Gamete intrafallopian transfer) are very useful techniques in such cases.

Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve --> Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2. o Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause --> Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur). o Larger volume reaches the left atrium -3 Left atrial hyperophy o Increased blood flow through mitral valve -3 Accentuated Si (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur. Note : o Ejection systolic murmur of pulmonary valve can not be separated from pansystolic murmur. o The effect of ejection systolic murmur is a selective transmission of pansystolic murmur to the upper left sternal border (pulmonary valve area) In this area ejection characteristic of this murmur can be recognized since it does not mask the aoic component of S2.

On physical examination, he has the weakness described and no lower extremity deep tendon reflexes, muscle atrophy, or pain. Spinal fluid studies are notable for elevated protein only. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Bell palsy,Muscular dystrophy,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,"The paralysis of Guillain-Barre often occurs about 10 days after a nonspecific viral illness. Weakness is gradual over days or weeks, beginning in the lower extremities and progressing toward the trunk. Later, the upper limbs and the bulbar muscles can become involved. Involvement of the respiratory muscles is life-threatening. The syndrome seems to be caused by a demyelination in the motor nerves and, occasionally, the sensory nerves. Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of observation alone, intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasma-pheresis. Recovery is not always complete. Bell palsy usually follows a mild upper respiratory infection, resulting in the rapid development of weakness of the entire side of the face. Muscular dystrophy encompasses a number of entities that include weakness over months. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease has a clinical onset including peroneal and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy, later extending to the intrinsic hand muscles and proximal legs. Werdnig-Hoffmann disease is an anterior horn disorder that presents either in utero (in about one-third of cases) or by the first 6 months of life with hypotonia, weakness, and delayed developmental motor milestones.",C

Formation of one of the following is essential for success of this instrument?,Caput,Chignon,Phlegmon,None of the above.,"Ans. B. Chignona. Ventouse, also known as vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery or vacuum extraction (VE), is a method to assist delivery of a baby using a vacuum device. It is used in the second stage of labor if it has not progressed adequately. It may be an alternative to a forceps delivery and caesarean section. It cannot be used when the baby is in the breech position or for premature births. The use of VE is generally safe, but it can occasionally have negative effects on either the mother or the child. The term comes from the French word for ""suction cup. ""Indications;b. Maternal exhaustion.c. Prolonged second stage of labor.d. Foetal distress in the second stage of labor.e. Maternal illness where prolonged ""bearing down"" or pushing efforts would be risky (e.g. cardiac conditions, blood pressure, aneurysm, glaucoma).TechniqueThe woman is placed in the lithotomy position and assists throughout the process by pushing. A suction cup is placed onto the head of the baby and the suction draws the skin from the scalp into the cup. Correct placement of the cup directly over the flexion point, about 3cm anterior from the occipital (posterior) fontanelle, is critical to the success of a VE. Ventouse devices have handles to allow for traction. When the baby's head is delivered, the device is detached, allowing the birthing attendant and the mother to complete the delivery of the baby.For proper use of the ventouse, the maternal cervix has to be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. If the ventouse attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by forceps or caesarean section.Positive aspectsa. An episiotomy may not be required.b. The mother still takes an active role in the birth.c. No special anesthesia is required.d. The force applied to the baby can be less than that of a forceps delivery, and leaves no marks on the face.e. There is less potential for maternal trauma compared to forceps and caesarean section.Negative aspectsa. The baby will be left with a temporary lump on its head, known as a chignon.b. There is a possibility of cephalohematoma formation, or subgaleal hemorrhage.c. There is a higher risk of failure to deliver the baby than forceps, and an increased likelihood of needing a Caesarean section",B
Most common cervical carcinoma: March 2007,Adenocarcinoma,Sarcoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Small cell carcinoma,"Ans. C: Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cervical cancer is typically composed of squamous cells. The most impoant risk factor in the development of cervical cancer is infection with a high-risk strain of Human papilloma virus. Women who have many sexual paners (or who have sex with men or women who had many paners) have a greater risk Risk factors for cervical cancer: HPV infection (16,18,31,33), HIV infection Smoking Chlamydia infection, Multiple pregnancies Exposure to the hormonal drug (DES) and a Family history of cervical cancer. Biopsy Procedures While the pap smear is an effective screening test, confirmation of the diagnosis of cervical cancer or pre-cancer requires a biopsy of the cervix. This is often done through colposcopy. Fuher diagnostic procedures are loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP) and conization. These are carried out if the biopsy confirms severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Pathologic Types Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, the precursor to cervical cancer, is often diagnosed on examiniation of cervical biopsies. Histologic subtypes of invasive cervical carcinoma include the following: Squamous cell carcinoma (about 80-85%) Adenocarcinoma (nearly 5%) Adenosquamous carcinoma Small cell carcinoma Neuroendocrine carcinoma Staging Cervical cancer is staged by the FIGO staging system Stage 0 - full-thickness involvement of the epithelium without invasion into the stroma (carcinoma in situ) Stage I - limited to the cervix - IA - diagnosed only by microscopy; no visible lesions IA1 - stromal invasion less than 3 mm in depth and 7 mm or less in horizontal spread IA2 stromal invasion between 3 and 5 mm with horizontal spread of 7 mm or less - IB - visible lesion or a microscopic lesion with more than 5 mm of depth or horizontal spread of more than 7 mm IB1 - visible lesion 4 cm or less in greatest dimension IB2 - visible lesion more than 4 cm Stage II - invades beyond cervix - IIA - without parametrial invasion, but involve upper 2/3 of vagina - IIB - with parametrial invasion Stage III - extends to pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina - IIIA - involves lower third of vagina - IIIB - extends to pelvic wall and/or causes hydronephrosis or non-functioning kidney IVA - invades mucosa of bladder or rectum and/or extends beyond true pelvis IVB - distant metastasis Treatment Microinvasive cancer (stage IA) is usually treated by hysterectomy (removal of the whole uterus including pa of the vagina). For stage IA2, the lymph nodes are removed as well. Early stages (IB1 and IIA less than 4 cm) can be treated with radical hysterectomy with removal of the lymph nodes or radiation therapy. Larger early stage tumors (IB2 and IIA more than 4 cm) may be treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin/ Paclitaxel+Ifosamide+Mesna based chemotherapy, hysterectomy (which then usually requires adjuvant radiation therapy), or cisplatin/ Paclitaxel+Ifosamide+Mesna chemotherapy followed by hysterectomy. Advanced stage tumors (IIB-IVA) are treated with radiation therapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The use of a combination of two chemotherapy drugs, hycamtin and cisplatin for women with late-stage (IVB) cervical cancer treatment is recommended. Combination treatment has significant risk of neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia side effects.",C

True about Meig's syndrome ;,Lymphatic dysplasia,2 - 30 years age,Associated with ascites and pleural effusion and No treatment required,None.,"Ans. is c i.e. Associated with ascites and pleural effusion; and No treatment required Ascites and right sided hydrothorax in association with fibroma of ovary is called as Meig's syndrome. It can also be seen in Brenner's tumour and Granulosa cell tumour where it is called as Pseudomeig's syndrome. Hydrothorax can be bilateral also. True meig's syndrome is rare, occuring in < 5 per cent of fibromas. Ascites is caused by transudation of fluid from the ovarian fibroma. Hydrothorax develops secondary to flow of ascitic fluid into the pleural space lymphatics of the diaphragm. Ascites occurs (in 50% cases) when tumour size is > 6 cms. Tumours producing Meig's syndrome manifest in the late childbearing period i.e., 30 - 40 years. Both ascites and hydrothorax resolve spontaneously after removal of the tumour. Criteria for diagnosis of Meig's syndrome : Tumour must be ovarian, solid and benign. Both hydrothorax and ascites must be present. Removal of the tumour must result in their spontaneous and permanent cure. Pseduomeig syndrome : Can be seen in association with either benign or malignant tumour. Hydrothorax could be a manifestation of pulmonary metastasis. Syndrome can result from overstimulation of the ovaries with gonadotropins but, in such cases, the peritoneal exudate is more likely to be caused by an electrolyte imbalance rather than by ovarian tumour.",C

The most likely etiological agent in this case is –,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Staphylococcus aureus,Mycobacterium avium intracellulare,Pneumocystis carinii,"Pneumonia with pneumatoceles (multiple thin-walled breaths of air containing cysts) is s/o staphylococcal pneumonia.

Clinical features of staphylococcal pneumonia

The illness usually follows upper respiratory tract infection, pyoderma or another associated purulent disease.
Besides the usual features of pneumonia child has fever and anorexia and is listless and irritable.
The abdomen is usually distended due to septicemia and ileus.
Cyanosis may be present
Progression of the symptoms and signs is rapid.

Diagnosis-

The diagnosis of staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected in a newborn or an infant with respiratory infection who has evidence of staphylococcal infection elsewhere in the body (here it is pyoderma).
Complications such as pyopneumothorax and pericarditis are highly suggestive of diagnosis (Empyeina in a child below 2 yrs of age is nearly always staphylococcal in etiology)
Presence of Pneumatoceles is considered pathognomic for staphylococcal pneumonia (It can also be seen in pneumonia due to Klebsiella)

Note: Pyoderma or impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin caused primarily by group A streptococci and occasionally by other streptococci and staphylococci.

Tachypnea is the most consistent clinical manifestation of pneumonia.  - Nelson 18th /e 1797",B

Hormone responsible for ferning pattern of cervical mucus: March 2007,Progesterone,Estrogen,LH,Prolactin,"Ans. B: Estrogen An enzyme called plasmin contained in the endometrium tends to inhibit the blood from clotting. Follicular Phase Through the influence of a rise in (FSH), five to seven teiary-stage ovarian follicles are recruited for entry into the next menstrual cycle. One (or occasionally two) dominant follicles will continue to maturity and secrete increasing amounts of estradiol which initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium Ovulation When the egg has matured, it secretes enough estradiol to trigger the acute release of (LH). In the average cycle this LH surge stas around cycle 12th day and may last 48 hours and leads to ovulation. At the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus is thin and has the propey of great elasticity and this is called spinnbarkeiti thread test under estrogenic activity. When viewed under the microscope, the mucus shows characteristic pattern of fern formation, which is due to presence of sodium chloride in the mucus secreted under estrogenic effect. Luteal phase After ovulation, the residual follicle transforms into the corpus luteum. This corpus luteum will produce Progesterone in addition to estrogens for approximately the next 2 weeks. Progesterone plays a vital role in conveing the proliferative endometrium into a secretory lining receptive for implantation and suppoive of the early pregnancy. It raises the body temperature. Hormonal control Gonadal Estradiol peaks twice, during follicular growth and during the luteal phase. Progesterone remains viually absent prior to ovulation, but becomes critical in the luteal phase and during pregnancy. Many tests for ovulation check for the presence of progesterone. After ovulation the corpus luteum which develops from the burst follicle and remains in the ovary secretes both estradiol and progesterone. Hypothalamus and pituitary These sex hormones come under the influence of the pituitary gland, and both FSH and LH play necessary roles: FSH stimulates immature follicles in the ovaries to grow. LH triggers ovulation. The Gonadotropin releasing hormone of the hypothalamus controls the pituitary, yet both the pituitary and the hypothalamus receive feedback from the follicle.",B

Continuous dribbling of urine is a classic feature of urinary fistulas and they are common after gynecological operations. In stress incontinence, dribbling of urine occurs only when intraabdominal pressure is raised. In urge continence, the patient must pass urine at a moment's notice and unless she is quick about it she is unable to control her bladder.

A child having delayed separaion of umbilical cord with leukocytosis with Downs syndrome and recurrent infections. Diagnosis ?,Leucocyte Adhesion deficiency,Neonatal sepsis,Histiocytosis-X,All of above,"Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency. The clinical picture is characterized by marked leukocytosis and localized bacterial infections that are difficult to detect until they have progressed to an extensive level secondary to lack of leukocyte recruitment at the site of infection. Thus the infections in patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency act similarly as those observed in patients with neutropenia. See the images below.

A pregnant mother at 32 weeks gestation presents in preterm labour. Therapy with antenatal steroids to induce lung maturity in the fetus may be given in all of the following conditions except:,Prolonged rupture of membranes for more than 24 hours,Pregnancy induced hypertension,Diabetes mellitus,Chorioamnionitis,"“Corticosteroids can be given even in presence of maternal hypertension or diabetes mellitus, but should preferably be avoided if PROM is associated with definitive evidence of chorioamnionitis”
Meherban Singh 5/e, p 227
“Steroid treatment is contraindicated in presence of overt infection.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 220
Steroid therapy in preterm labour:

Steroids are recommended for all women in preterm labour before 32 weeks with or without membrane ruptures in whom there is no evidence of chorioamnionitis. According to ACOG, single dose steroid injection is recommended between 24 to 32 weeks. There is no concensus regarding treatment between 32-34 weeks. Corticosteroid therapy is not recommended before 24 weeks.

Advantage:

Steroids reduce the rate of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis in the newborn.
The effect of treatment is maximal between 24 hours of the first dose and uptil 7 days.
Earlier it was recommended to give repeated doses weekly till the patient delivers but this practice is associated with significant fetal and neonatal side effects like cerebral palsy and should be abandoned.
Betamethasone is the steroid of choice as it also prevents periventricular leukomalacia although dexamethasone can also be used.
Dose:


Betamethasone = 2 doses of 12 mg, 24 hours apart,
Dexamethosane: 4 doses of 6 mg, 12 hours apart.",D
Cardiac output maximum in pregjtancy-,24 weeks,36 weeks,32 weeks,38 weeks,"Ans. is 'c1 i.e., 32 weeks Cardiac Output in pregnancyo The cardiac output starts to increase from the 5th week of pregnancy: reaches its peak 40 - 50% at 30 - 34 weeks.o Thereafter the cardiac output remains static till term when the observation is made at lateral recumbent position.o Cardiac output is lowest in the sitting or supine position and highest in the right or left lateral or knee chest position.Hemodynamic change in pregnancyo Blood volume is markedly raised. Starting to increase at 6 weeks & reaching max 40-50% above the nonpregnant level at 30-32 weeks.o Plasma volume is also increased. Starting to increase at 6 weeks & reaching max upto 50% at 30 weeks. Total plasma volume increases to the extent of 1.25 litres.o RBCs & Hb RBC mass increases upto 20-30% & volume increase is about 350ml. The disproportionate increase in plasma & RBC volume produces a state of hemodilution. Thus even though there is increase in the total mass of Hb but fall in concentration upto 2%.o Leucocytes & immune system Leucocyte count increases upto 10-15,00/mm3. Innate & humeral response increases.o Total protein Total plasma protein increases but due to hemodilution plasma protein concentration falls. Normal A:G ratio of 1:7 is diminished to 1:1.o Blood coagulation factors Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state. Fibrinogen level is raised by 50%.ESR is raised. Platelet count is either static or decreases. Gestational thrombocytopenia is due to increased consumption. Increased activity of X, IX. VIII, VII & I. Level of XI & XIII are decreased. Levels of coagulation factors normalises 2 weeks postpartum.Cardiovascular systemo Anatomical changes Heart is pushed upwards & outward. Apex beat is shifted in 4th intercostals space. A systolic murmur can be heard in apical or pulmonary area. Mammary murmur is a continuous hissing murmur audible over tricuspid area in left 2nd & 3rd intercostals space. ECG showrs left axis deviation. S3 and rarely S4 can be beard,o Cardiac output Starts to increase from 5th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak 40-50% at about 30-34 weeks.

Which is most significant finding in cardiotoco-graphy for detection of fetal hypoxia:,Late deceleration,Variable deceleration,Sinusoidal deceleration,Early deceleration,"It is one of those questions where if we keep searching for reference, we get more and more confused whereas the answer lies is front of our eyes and we all know it.
All of you know — contraction stress test
“The contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions, with the premise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened. This results in late decelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10 minutes, a positive or abnormal test is when late decelerations occur with more than half of the contractions, suspicious with any late decelerations, and negative with no late decelerations.”
COGDT 10/e, p 255
So here is our answer, the most significant finding for hypoxia is late deceleration.
Our answer is further supported by COGDT 10/e, p 257.
“Late decelerations are smooth falls in the FHR begining after the contractions has started and ending after the contractions has ended. They are associated with fetal hypoxemia and potential for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Variable decelerations are abrupt in decline and return to baseline, vary in timing with the contractions, and usually represents cord compression.”

A pregnant female has past history of embolism in puerperium. What medical management she should take in next pregnancy to avoid this,Cumpulsory prophylaxis with warfarin sta at 10 weeks,To take warfarin after delivery,Chance of thromboembolism increases by 12% in next pregnancy,Does not need anything,"Ans. is b i.e. To take Warfarin after delivery Friends venous thromboembolism in pregnancy, is one of those topics which we donot study in detail during undergraduation. So, I am giving in brief, all the impoant points you need to remember : Venous thromboembolism in pregnnacy : Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of maternal deaths in developed countries. Pregnancy increases the risk of thromboembolism 6 times as all components of virchow's triad are increased.deg A. Deep vein thrombosis : Left sided DVT is more common than Right sided DVT. Clinical features : swelling / redness / pain and calf muscle tenderness and oedema. Investigations - Recommended method during pregnancy : Doppler ultrasound - Gold standard (in conditions other than pregnancy) : venography Mangement : Therapeutic The treatment should be staed on clinical grounds if confirmatory tests are not available. Drug of choice - Heparin (as it doesnot cross the placenta) Initially intravenous Heparin is given with the aim to prolong APTT (activated paial thromboplastic time) by 1.5 to 2 times the control followed by subcutaneous Heparin. Monitoring is done by APTT and platelet count (as Heparin causes Thrombocytopenia). Oral anticoagulants like Warfarin cross the placenta and cause teratogenesis therefore should be avoided in pregnancy. Treatment is continued for 6 weeks following which prophylactic subcutaneous heparin is given throughout pregnancy. Heparin is stopped just before delivery. Regional anaesthesia should be avoided at the time of delivery in patients on heparin due to the risk of hematoma formation. Heparin is restaed about 6 - 8 hours after delivery as the puerperium is the time of greatest risk for VTE. Warfarin is commenced simultaneously and thereafter monitoring is done by prothrombin time (PT). Once the prothrombin time INR is between 2 and 3, heparin can be discontinued. Usually warfarin is continued for 6 to 18 weeks and is safe for breast feeding mothers. Thromboprophylaxis : Thromboprophylaxis is considered for women who are at increased risk of thromboembolism (TE). Risk category Risk factors High risk Recurrent TE Previous TE with thrombophilia Previous TE with family history TE in current pregnancy Low risk One episode of previous TE without thrombophiiia or family history Thrombophilia without previous thrombosis Additional risk Cesarean section, obesity, grand multiparity, age above 35, pre-eclampsia, prolonged immobilization etc. High risk patients need antepaum heparin, intrapaum heparin and postpaum prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Low risk patient require intrapaum and postpaum low dose prophylaxis for 6 weeks. Well, now that you have a detailed knowledge of thromboembolism, lets have a look at the question. It says : a female with previous history of embolism becomes pregnant,what medical management should be given to her? Option 'a. i.e. Compulsory prophylaxis with warfarin at 10 weeks. It is absolutely wrong as warfarin is not given during pregnancy. Option 'b Le to take warfarin after delivery - According to William obs. 22/e, p 1077 table 47-3, 23/e, p 1028 - table 47.6 In case of prior VTE associated with a non recurring risk factor and no known thrombophilia? During pregnancy : Only surveillance is required as per American college of chest physicians. Prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is required as per American college of obs & gynaecology (which also explains option 'd is paly correct). Postpaum : warfarin is given for 6 weeks. So, option 'b' is absolutely correct i.e. warfarin should be given in the post paum period for six weeks.",B

Sarcoid like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers. o Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in formation of crypt abscess. o Fibrosis of the submucosa, muscularis propria, and mucosa eventually leads to stricture formation.

Process of carcinogenesis in carcinoma cervix begins at the -,Endocervix,Ectocervix,Transformation zone,None of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Transformation zone Site of origin of cervical carcinomao Squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) is the meeting point of columnar epithelium, that lines the endocervical canal, with squamous epithelium that lines the ectocervix. This SCJ is a dynamic point. It moves up and down in relation to different phases of life, e.g. puberty, pregnancy and menopause. Following image shows shows the cyclical changes in squamocolumnar junction:A) Before puberty, the ectocervix is covered with squamous epitheliumB) Hightened estrogenic activity exposes the columnar epithelium onto the ectocervixC) Replacement of columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium to form TZ. New squamocolumnar junction is situated at or slightly outside the external os during reproductive periodD) Indrawing of the squamocolumnar junction and the TZ well into the cervical canal following menopause.o The metaplasia extends from the original SCJ (now squamosquamous) outside to the newly developed (physiologically active) SCJ (now squamocolumnar) inside. This area is defined as transformation zone (TZ).o The process of carcinogenesis starts at this 'transformation zone' (TZ). The zone is not static but in a dynamic state.o Two mechanisms are involved in the process of replacement of endocervical columnar epithelium by squamous epithelium:# By squamous metaplasia of the subcolumnar reserve cells.# Squamous epidermidization by ingrowth of the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix under the columnar epithelium.o Initially, the squamous cells are immature but ultimately become mature and indistinguishable to the adjacent squamous epithelium.o This metaplastic process is very active at the time of menarche and during and after first pregnancy. These periods are of high estrogenic phase which lowers the vaginal pH. The acid pH probably is an important trigger for the metaplastic process.o Thesemetaplastic cells have got the potentiality to undergo atypical transformation by trauma or infectiono The prolonged effect of carcinogens can produce continuous changes in the immature cells which may lead to malignancy. Early age sexual activity and multiple sexual partners are the most consistent risk factors. HPV infection is transmitted through sexual activity.o Microtrauma (sexual intercourse) causes viral entry to the epithelium (basal or parabasal cells) of the transformation zone adjacent to the SCJ.o HPV- DNA positivity is strongly related with the number of sexual partners. Women with multiple partners have high HPV DNA positivity rate (60%) compared to women with single partner (21%).o The important factors in the genesis of cervieal cancer are:i) Infection with high-risk HPVii) Multiple types of HPViii) Persistence of infectioniv) Age >30 yearsv) Smokingvi) Compromised host immunodefense",C

Child with recurrent hypoglycemic attack and hepatomegaly is likely to have -,Von Gierke's disease,Neonatal diabetes,Neonatal hepatitis,Galactosemia,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Von Gierke's disease Recurrent hypoglycemic attack with hepatomegaly is seen in Type I glycogen storage disease (Von Gierke disease). Glycogen storage diseases o Glycogen storage diseases result from a hereditary deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis or sequential degradation of glycogen. o Clinical features depend on type of enzyme deficiency and organ involvement. o Glycogen storage diseases can be divided into :? 1) Hepatic form (Liver glycogenoses) Liver is the key player in glycogen metabolism. It contains enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and ultimately break it down into free glucose, which is then released into blood. So, An inherited deficiency of hepatic enzymes that are involved in glycogen metabolism leads to i) Storage of glycogen in liver Hepatomegaly. it) Reduction in blood glucose --) Hypoglycemia. Examples of liver glycogenoses are - i) Type I glycogenosis Glucose - 6 - phosphatase deficiency (Von Gierke disease). ii) Type III glycogenosis ----> Debranching enzyme def iii) Type IV glycogenesis ----> Branching enzyme def iv) Type VI glycogenosis --> Liver phosphorylase def 2) Myopathic form (Muscular glycogenoses) In skeletal muscle, as apposed to the liver, glycogen is used predominantly as a source of energy. This is derived by glycolysis, which leads ultimately to the formation of lactate. So, enzyme deficiency leads to ? i) Glycogen deposition in muscle Muscle cramp after exercise iii) Exercise - induced rise in blood lactase levels owing to block in glycolysis iv) There may be myoglobinemia Examples are ? i) Type V glycogenosis --> phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease). ii) Type VII glycogenosis --> phosphofructokinase del 3) Miscellaneous types Associated with glycogen storage in many organs and death in early life.

A plastic clamp that is safe, efficient, and fairly inexpensive.Timing of Cord ClampingIf after delivery, the newborn is placed at or below the level of the vaginal introitus for 3 minutes and the fetoplacental circulation is not immediately occluded by clamping the cord, an average of 80 mL of blood may be shifted from the placenta to the neonate. This provides about 50 mg of iron, which reduces the frequency of iron deficiency anemia later in infancy.Accelerated destruction of erythrocytes, as found with maternal alloimmunization, forms additional bilirubin from the added erythrocytes and contributes further to the danger of hyperbilirubinemia. Although the theoretical risk of circulatory overloading from gross hypervolemia is formidable, especially in preterm and growth-retarded neonates, the addition of placental blood to the otherwise normal newborn's circulation ordinarily does not cause difficulty.",A

Differences in the etiology of cardiac arrest between child and adult victims necessitate some differences in the recommended resuscitation sequence for infant and child victims compared with the sequence used for adult victims. Because there is no single anatomic or physiologic characteristic that distinguishes a ""child"" victim from an ""adult"" victim and no scientific evidence that identifies a precise age to initiate adult rather than child CPR techniques, the ECC scientists made a consensus decision for age delineation that is based largely on practical criteria and ease of teaching.
In these 2005 guidelines, the recommendations for newborn CPR apply to newborns in the first hours after birth until the newborn leaves the hospital. Infant CPR guidelines apply to victims less than approximately 1 year of age.
Child CPR guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to children about 1 to 8 years of age, and adult guidelines for the lay rescuer apply to victims about 8 years of age and older. To simplify learning for lay rescuers retraining in CPR and AED apropos the 2005 guidelines, the same age divisions for children are used in the 2005 guidelines as in the ECC guidelines 2000.
Child CPR guidelines for healthcare providers apply to victims from about 1 year of age to the onset of adolescence or puberty (about 12 to 14 years of age) as defined by the presence of secondary sex characteristics. Hospitals (particularly children's hospitals) or pediatric intensive care units may choose to extend the use of Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines to pediatric advanced of all ages (generally up to about 16 to 18 years of age) rather than use onset of puberty for the application of ACLS versus PALS guidelines.",C

Which of the following condition does not present with both mullerian and wolffian duct structures?,Antimullerian hormone deficiency,FSH receptor mutation,Ovotesticular syndrome,Mixed gonadal dysgenesis,"Karyotype is 46 XY
Since Y chromosome is present gonads are testis, i.e. they are males. In this syndrome, in males - Sertoli cells fail to secrete Mullerian inhibiting substance and the Mullerian duct is present.
Since Leyding cell is also present, they secrete testosterone normally, thus Wolffian duct is also present. So in anti-Mullerian hormone deficiency, both Mullerian and Wolffian ducts are present.
Ovotestis: It is seen in true hermaphroditism. Both ovaries and testis are present. There is the ambiguity of external genitalia. The internal structures depend on the degree of differentiation of the gonads.
Mixed Gonadal dysgenesis Karyotype = 45XO/46XY.
In this situation, the gonadal pattern on one side is streak gonad ovary (corresponding to karyotype 45 XO) and a normal testis on the other side (corresponding to karyotype 46 XY)
Mullerian duct and Wolffian duct development correlates with the character of the ipsilateral gonad, i.e.

Shivering (Ref: Ghai 7/e pe p115)Neonates lack shivering mechanism. (A1IMS November 2006 Repeat)""On exposure to cold and wet environment, the neonate tries to generate heat by increased activity (crying with agitated movement) and a sympathetic surge that causes vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown fat. Babies attempt to conserve heat by peripheral vasoconstriction. """"Brown fat is a well-vascularized, sympathetically innervated lipid collection located in the axillae, groin, nape of the neck, interscapular area and perineal area. Cold stress causes the release of norepinephrine that uncouples beta-oxidation in fat with resultant heat generation. Preterm and small-for-gestational age inf ants have immature thermogenic response because of scanty brown fat stores.""Role of Brown Fat in Thermogenesis* A newborn baby is more prone to develop hypothermia because of large surface area per unit of body weight.* In infants, brown fat is an important site of thermogenesis. It results in the so-called non-shivering thermogenesis.* Brown fat is located around the adrenal glands, kidney, nape of neck, interscapular and axillary region.* Metabolism of brown fat leads to heat production.* Blood floiving through the brown fat becomes warm and through circulation, transfers heat to other parts of the body.

A premature infant is born with a patent ductus aeriosus. In closure can be stimulated by administration of:,Prostaglandin analogue,Estrogen,Anti-estrogen compounds,Prostaglandin inhibitors,"Patent ductus aeriosus represents persistent patency of the vessel. The ductus aeriosus usually closes within 2 or 3 days after bih and becomes the ligamentum aeriosum. Constriction of the ductus postnatally involves a complex interaction of increased paial pressure of oxygen, decreased circulating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), decreased PGE2 ductal receptors, and decreased pressure within the ductus. Subsequent vessel-wall hypoxia of the ductus promotes fuher closure through inhibition of prostaglandin and nitric oxide within the ductal wall. For premature infants, treatment with indomethacin, a prostaglandin inhibitor, is usually the first-line therapy. Ibuprofen has achieved closure rates equivalent to those of indomethacin with less renal toxicity. When PDA fails to close with indomethacin or for term infants with a persistent PDA, surgical or interventional closure is recommended. Ref: Brown D.W., Fulton D.R. (2011). Chapter 83.

Increased acidosis and hypoxaemia is seen in:,Normal Doppler wave form,Increased fetal diastolic flow in the middle cerebral artery with absent diastolic flow in the aorta,Presence of the 'notch' in the uterine artery,Absent umbilical artery,"Doppler Study of Middle Cerebral Vessels:

Normally the middle cerebral vessels have high resistance flow and are characterised by little diastolic flow.
In case of IUGR a brain-sparing effect is seen with a reduction in the resistance indices in the middle cerebral vessels (i.e. increased flow) due to the shunting of blood to the brain in IUGR. Whereas in other areas (as aorta in the options) show decreased flow.
“Increased fetal diastolic flow in middle cerebral artery with absent diastolic flow in aorta implies fetal acidemia.”

All are true about pre eclampsia except:,Cerebral hemorrhage,Pulmonary edema,ARF,DVT,"Severe complications of Preeclampsia:

Pulmonary edema


It is a common complication of severe preeclampsia and eclampsia affecting ~3% of patients.
Most cases are a result of aggressive use of crystalloid solutions, for intravascular volume expansion
It usually occurs in the post partum period and is characterized by profound respiratory distress, severe hypoxemia and diffuse rales.

Treatment:

Administering oxygen by nasal prongs.
Restriction of I/V or oral fluids.
Furosemide 20-40 mg l/v every 6 hours.


Acute renal Failure:


Oliguria is common in patients with severe preeclampsia
It is mostly prerenal in origin.


Intracranial bleeding: It is the leading cause of death in preeclampsia. It is seen that main connection of this event is with systolic BP and not with diastolic B/P.
Visual disorder: Blindness may occur in patients with severe preeclampsia and eclampsia and may persist for several days, although quick recovery after delivery is the rule.

As far as DVT is concerned – I know some of you may think that DIC is a result of preeclampsia which in turn can lead to DVT – But –
DIC is a complication of eclampsia and HELLP syndrome, perse preeclampsia does not lead to DIC. Only if preeclampsia is associated with abruption of placenta it leads to DIC,

This is only 25 % of al the cases of hirsutism, and not the commonest! The most common cause of hyperandrogenism and hirsutism is PCOS. There are only two major criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS: anovulation and the presence of hyperandrogenism as established by clinical or laboratory means. Revised criteria (2 out of 3) 1. Oligo ovulation or anovulation 2. Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism 3. Polycystic ovaries and exclusion of other etiologies (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen-secreting tumors, Cushing's syndrome) From Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop These features alone are sufficient for the diagnosis in the absence of other pathologies accounting for hyperandrogenism (i.e., AOAH, or ovarian neoplasm, Cushing syndrome) or anovulation (i.e., hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic disorders, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease).

The neonatal period is defined as the first 28 days after bih. Infancy is defined as the first year of life. This should not be confused the period used for calculation of perinatal moality rate. The actual perinatal period is defined as the period from the 22nd week of life to 7 days after bih, when the fetus weighs about 500g However, the calculation of perinatal moality rate primarily considers fetal weight above 1000g, which if acheived at 28 weeks of gestation. Therefore, for all statistical purposes, international comparisions and calculations of perinatal moality rate, the period from the 28th week of life is considered. Hence, Perinatal Period: From the 22nd week Perinatal moality rate calculation: From the 28th week Ref: World Health Organisation",D

"A boy with undescended testis, your concern to ask for operation is due to –a) Cosmetic reasonsb) Infertilityc) Risk of malignancyd) Impotence",a,c,ac,bc,"Let's see both options one by one.
1. Infertility

Infertility is a complication of undescended testis.
After treatment for a unilateral undescended testis, 85% of patients are fertile.
Following bilateral aorchidopexy 50-65% of patients are fertile.

2. Malignancy

Risk of developing germ cell tumors in an undescended testis is 4 to 5 times higher than that in general population.
The most common tumor developing is seminoma.
Whether orchidopexy reduces the risk of developing cancer of the testis is controversial, but it is uncommon for the testicular tumor to occur after orchidopexy performed before the age of 2 years.

For the mentioned description of head injury that follows, select the major abnormality with which it is most likely to be associated.",Intraventricular hemorrhage,Caput succedaneum,Subdural hemorrhage,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"A subgaleal or subaponeurotic hemorrhage can be life threatening; infants may lose a third or more of their blood volume into this potential space, leading to hypovolemic shock. A subgaleal hemorrhage will feel like a cephalohematoma that crosses the midline. Careful monitoring is essential.Subdural hematomas are commonly seen as part of abusive head trauma, formerly known as shaken baby syndrome. This lesion occurs when the bridging cortical veins that drain the cerebral cortex have been ruptured, leading to a collection of blood between the dura and the cerebral mantle. Repeated trauma can lead to additional collections of blood. In many children, additional findings of abuse such as broken bones, bruises, and retinal hemorrhages are found.Caput succedaneum is soft-tissue swelling of the scalp involving the presenting delivery portion of the head. This lesion is sometimes ecchymotic and can extend across the suture lines. The edema may be pitting, and resolves in the first few days of life.Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), also known as germinal matrix hemorrhage, is commonly seen in very small, preterm infants. The incidence of IVH increases with smaller-size infants and in those with perinatal complications. It occurs in the gelatinous subependymal germinal matrix of the brain and can lead to progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus in these children can present with enlarging head circumference, apnea and bradycardia, lethargy, bulging fontanelle, widely split sutures, or no signs at all. Therapy can include ventricular- peritoneal shunting.Cephalohematomas do not cross the suture line, since they are subperiosteal hemorrhages. No discoloration of the scalp is seen, and the swelling usually progresses over the first few hours of life. Occasionally, skull fractures are present as well. Most cephalohematomas resolve within the first few weeks or months of life without residual findings.",C

35 year old female patient Radha having children aged 5 and 6 years has history of amenorrhea and galactorrhea. Blood examination reveals increased prolactin. CT of head is likely to reveal:,Pituitary adenoma,Craniopharyngioma,Sheehan's syndrome,Pinealoma,"Patient is presenting with amenorrhea; galactorrhea with raised prolactin levels. So lets rule out some of the options:
Sheehan's Syndrome 
• In Sheehan's syndrome there is failure of lactation (due to ischemic necrosis of anterior pituitary) and not galactorrhea (so, option ""c"" ruled out).
Pinealoma: 
• If you go through the list of causes of hyperprolactinemia given in Harrison 17th/ed p 2205; Table 333-8 - Pinealoma is not one of the causes. (as there is no reason for a pineal gland tumor to raise prolactin levels), ruling out option ""d"".
That leaves us with 2 options:
Pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngiorma: Both are pituitary tumors which can present with amenorrhea galactorrhea, and raised prolactin levels.
Now comes the age factor - Craniopharyngiomas present usually before 20 years (Harrison 1762/ed p 2201) of age and so by exclusion: Option ""a"" i.e. Pituitary adenoma seems more likely as the cause.
""In patients with both galactorrhea and amenorrhea approximately two-thirds will have hyperprolactinemia, in that group approximately one third will have a pituitary adenoma.""
So, pituitary adenoma is more common than craniopharyngioma and this confirms our answer.",A

Poor indicator to response during treatment of malnutrition includes –,Presence of edema on day 10,Failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day by day 10,Failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days during the rehabilitation phase,All of these,"Guidelines on Hospital based management of severely malnourished children

The curent guidelines recommended in-patient (hospital) management of all severely malnourished children are divided into ten essential steps:


Treat/prevent hypoglycemia
Treat/prevent hypothermia
Treat/prevent dehydration
Correct electrolyte imbalance
Treat/prevent infection
Correct micronutrient deficiencies
Start cautious feeding
Achieve catch-up growth
Provide sensory stimulation and emotional support
Prepare for follow-up after recovery.

Monitoring progress  during treatment

Good weight gain is >10 g/kg/day and indicates a good response. It is recommended to continue with the same treatment.
Moderate weight gain is 5-10 g/kg/day; food intake should be checked and the children should be screened for systemic infection.
Poor weight gain is < 5g/kg/day, screening for inadequate feeding, untreated infection, tuberculosis and psycho-logical problems is recommended.

Indicators of failure to respond 

Primary failure to respond is indicated by:
Failure to regain appetite by day 4.
Failure to start losing edema by day 4.
Presence of edema on day 10.
Failure to gain at least 5.g/kg/day by day 10.
Secondary failure to respond is indicated by
failure to gain at least 5g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days during the rehabilitation phase.

Criteria for discharge


Severely malnourished children are ready for discharge when the following criteria have been 'Wiled:


The absence of infection.
The child is eating at least 120-130 cal/lcg/day and receiving adequate micronutrients.
There is consistent weight gain (or at least 5 g/kg/day for 3 consecutive days) on exclusive oral feeding.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis –",Rectal Polys,Intussuception,Meckel's Diverticulum,Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"The infant in question has:


Recurrent episodes of abdominal pain
Passing of altered stools after episodes of pain
No vomiting or bleeding per rectum.


Most common presentation of rectal polyps and Meckel's diverticulum is painless rectal bleeding (option a & c are ruled out)
Necrotizing enterocolitis is seen in premature infants and is manifested in neonatal period. Symptoms progress from abdominal distension, vomiting, lethargy, poor feeding to passage of grossly bloody stool and features of shock (option d is excluded)
Now we are left with intussusception. Most common presentation is recurrent abdominal pain (Paroxysmal clock pain offer severe).
The absence of history of bleeding per rectum is creating some confusion here.
However, the altered stool should raise the suspicion of intussusception because intussusception typically presents with ""currant jelly- stool"" (altered stool) representing a mixture of blood, mucus and stool.
So, amongst the given options, best answer is intussusception.",B

Which of the following is the best indicator of longterm nutritional status?,Mid arm circumference,Height for age,Weight for age,Weight for height,"Height-for-age (or length-for-age for children <2 yr) is a measure of linear growth, and a deficit represents the cumulative impact of adverse events, usually in the first 1,000 days from conception, that result in stunting, or chronic malnutrition. A low height-for-age typically reflects socioeconomic disadvantage. A low weight-for-height, or wasting, usually indicates acute malnutrition. Conversely, a high weight-for-height indicates overweight. Weight-for-age is the most commonly used index of nutritional status, although a low value has limited clinical significance as it does not differentiate between wasting and stunting. Weight-for-age has the advantage of being somewhat easier to measure than indices that require height measurements. In humanitarian emergencies and some field settings, mid-upper arm circumference is used for screening wasted children . Ref.nelson 20th edition page no 298 nutrition chapter",B

Which of the following should be the line of management in a pregnant female with controlled diabetes?,Even controlled diabetes in pregnancy does not disappear on its own and needs extensive treatment even after delivery,Pregnant females with controlled diabetes are more likely to deliver child by normal vaginal delivery without any complication.,"In all females with gestational diabetes, blood sugar levels remain too high, and daily insulin therapy is essential.",LSCS is must in almost every case of gestational diabetes,"Ans. b (Pregnant females with controlled diabetes are more likely to deliver child by normal vaginal delivery without any complication). (Ref. Dutta, Obstertics, 6th ed., p 284)DIABETES IN PREGNANCY# Gestational diabetes usually begins in the second half of pregnancy, and goes away after the baby is bom.Effects on the fetus:# Macrosomia# IUGR# Newborns of diabetic mothers are at risk of hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, polycythemia, and hyperviscosity.# Caudal regression syndrome: sacral agenesis (most characteristic feature)# Congenital defects: In pregnancies complicated by type I or II diabetes, the major cause of neonatal mortality is congenital malformation incompatible with life. Therefore, MS AFP should be determined at 16 to 18 wk gestation, and a thorough ultrasound examination should be performed at 18 to 22 wk.# Respiratory distress syndrome# Left lazy colon syndrome# Stillbirth or death as a newborn is rare.# Increased risk of the baby developing type II diabetes or being overweight later in life.Effects on the mother# Women who get gestational diabetes are more likely to develop gestational diabetes in future pregnancies, and are at a higher risk of developing type II diabetes later in life.# Diagnosing gestational diabetes- Urine is routinely tested for sugar throughout pregnancy, and high blood sugar, if present, is usually detected between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.- The only way to confirm gestational diabetes is with a glucose tolerance test, which needs to be carried out after eight hours without food.- When suspected, GTT may be carried out earlier than 24-28 weeks.Q# Treatment- A few women's blood sugar levels remain too high, and they may need daily injections of insulin.- The extra insulin will not cross the placenta and will not affect the baby.- In almost every case, gestational diabetes disappears on its own after delivery.Q# Labor and Delivery- During the 3rd trimester, care of diabetic women consists mainly of controlling maternal plasma glucose levels, assessing fetal well-being, and determining fetal pulmonary maturation.- For most women with gestational diabetes, labor begins spontaneously at term, and delivery is vaginal. If these pregnancies go beyond 42 wk, the fetus is at risk of death in utero, so labor should be induced.- Cesarean section may be necessary in cases of dysfunctional labor or cephalopelvic disproportion or to avoid shoulder dystocia and injury to the newborn and to the birth canal.# Postpartum Care- For women with type I diabetes, insulin requirements decrease dramatically but gradually increase after about 72 h.- Women who have had gestational diabetes should have a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test with 75 g of glucose at 6 to 12 wk postpartum to determine whether they are normal, clearly diabetic, or have impaired glucose tolerance (based on WHO criteria).Educational points:HPL has putative actions in a number of important metabolic processes. These include.1. Maternal lipolysis and an increase in the levels of circulating free fatty acids, thereby providing a source of energy for maternal metabolism and fetal nutrition.2. An anti-insulin or ""diabetogenic"" action, leading to an increase in maternal levels of insulin, which favors protein synthesis and provides a readily available source of amino acids for transport to the fetus.3. A potent angiogenic hormone; it also may play an important role in the formation of fetal vasculature.",B

Oxygenated blood to the fetus is carried by-,Umblical aery,Umblical vein,SVC,Pulmonary aery,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Umblical vein Fetal circulation o Fetal circulation differs from adult circulation in several ways. Almost all differences are attributable to the fundamental difference in the site of gas exchange. o In the adult gas exchange occurs in the lungs, while in the fetus placenta provides the exchange of gases and nutrients. Course of fetal circulation A) Blood returing to hea o Blood oxygenated in the placenta returns by way of the umblical vein, which enter the fetus at the umblicus and course through to join the poal vein. o The ductus venous is a bypass shunt between poal vein and IVC. o Most of the umblical venous blood shunts through the ductus venosus to the IVC. o Blood from IVC (which carries the blood drained from lower extremities, umblical veins, hepatic veins and renal veins) enters the right atrium. o On reaching the right atrium, about 1/3rd of total inferior vena caval return of blood enters the left atrium through formen oval. o The rest two third mixes with the venous return from SVC (which carries the blood drained from head, neck and upper limbs) to enter the right ventricles. B) Blood coming out of the hea Right side o The right ventricle pumps out the blood into pulmonary trunk -4 very small amount of this blood enters the pulmonary circulation because the lungs are collapsed and pulmonary vascular resistance is high. o Most of this blood passes to desending aoa through ductus aeriosus, a shunt between pulmonary trunk and desending Aoa. o Descending aoa carries blood to umblicus through umblical aery, for oxygenation. o Descending aoa also supplies the blood to lower lumbs, kidney and abdominal viscera.

"In a study it is observed that the right ovary ovulates more than the left, all are possible explanation for the cause except",Anatomical difference between right and left side,Difference in blood supply to both sides,Right handedness is more common in population,Some embryological basis,"Ans. c. Right handedness is more common in population It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. Ovulation In the primate, it is suggested that ovulations occur with equal frequency in the left and right ovary. In the humans, there is some controversy about the frequency of ovulation on either side It is believed that in normally menstruating women, ovulation was significantly higher in right ovary. It is believed that right sided predominance was either genetically determined or due to differences in vasculature of the ovaries. The anatomical asymmetry between the left and right side are also thought to be the reason. The left ovarian vein drains to the left renal vein and the right ovarian vein to the IVC. The left renal vein is thought to be under pressure than the right and therefore drain slower. Because the left ovary drain slower, the collapsed follicle (corpus leuteum) takes longer to clean and thereby diminishes the chances that ovulation will occur on that side the following month. No such condition exists on the right side, that's why successive right side ovulation is more common",C

A diabetic female at 40 wks of gestation delivered a baby by elective cesarean section. Soon after bih the baby developed respiratory distress. The diagnosis is,Transient tachypnea of the new born,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Tracheo oesophageal fistula,Hyaline membrane disease,"Ans. is a i.e. Transient tachypnea of the new born Friends don't get shocked by the answer, even I was perplexed when I went through the texts given in all the standard reference books. Let's see what they have said. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) RDS almost always occurs in nreterm babies often less than 34 weeks of gestation. It is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in a preterm neonate. According to Ghai -- RDS is seen in preterm babies and not the term babies (as is given in our question). Now let's see what Ghai says about transient tachypnea of newborn : Transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN) Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occurring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. These babies have tachypnea with minimal or no respiratory distress. Chest X-ray may show prominent vascular marking and prominent interlobar fissure. Oxygen treatment is often adequate and ventilatory suppo is necessary and prognosis is good. But Ghai didn't mention any correlation between TTN and Diabetes. So, I had to search other books for more information. Neonatal complications : RDS and transient tachypnea are more common in infants of women with poorly controlled diabetics. Respiratory distress : ""Conventional obstetrical teaching through the late 1980s generally held that fetal lung maturation was delayed in diabetic pregnancies. Thus, these infants were at increased risk for respiratory distress (Gluck and Kulovich, 1973). Subsequent observations have challenged this concept, and gestational age rather than ove diabetes is likely the most significant factor associated with neonatal respiratory distress (Berkowitz and colleagues, 1996; Kjos and colleagues. 1990b)"". So, it is the gestational age and not diabetes which is the main factor causing neonatal respiratory distress. In our question the baby is delivered at 40 weeks gestation (Full term) so, the answer can not be Hyaline membrane disease rather it is transient tachypnea of newborn (i.e. option 'a is correct).",A

A female with recurrent aboion and isolated prolonged APTT is most likely associated with,>Lupus anticoagulant,>DIC,>Von wilebrand disease,>Hemophilia,"Lupus anticoagulant They have asked about antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibodies account for 3% to 5% of patients with repetitive pregnancy losses. The frequency of fetal death and recurrent aboion in untreated patients with antiphospholipid antibodies is greater than 90%. There are several antiphospholipid antibodies. The most relevant to obstetricians are: - The lupus anticoagulant (LAC), - The anticardiolipin antibody and - The antibody that cause false positive syphilis test (BFP-ST). The name lupus anticoagulant was derived from the fact that this antibody was found first in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and acted as an anticoagulant by prolonging the paial thromboplastin time (PTT). This name was a poor choice because soon it was found that lupus anticoagulant was present in many patients who did not have lupus and that in majority of patients the antibody was responsible for episodes of thrombosis, rather than anticoagulation. In the laboratory, LAC is not measured directly. - It is assessed by its effect on PTT and the kaolin clotting time. - Typically patients with lupus anticoagulant have a prolonged PTT and a normal PT. - Unfounately, a normal PTT does not exclude the possibility of LAC, and if the clinical suspicion is strong and the PIT is normal a kaolin clotting time or a dilute Russel viper venom time should be performed. - It has also been found that some patients with LAC and recurrent aboions have elevated values of serum 1gM. Other antiphospholipid antibodies The anticardiolipin antibody is the antiphospholipid antibody, most commonly found in patients with repetitive early pregnancy losses. Anlicardiolipin antibody is found in 90% of patients with L.A.C. but the majority of patients with positive anticardiolipin antibody do not have L.A.C. - Anticardiolipin antibody is measured in the laboratory by the ELISA test. BFP-ST - It is the less common antiphospholipid antibody. - Both BFP-ST and Anticardiolipin antibody, measure the antibody against cardiolipin but they are not the same. Clinical features of antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of any or several of the three antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with - Recurrent early pregnancy losses. - Episodes of venous and aerial thrombosis - Severe preeclampsia - Chorea gravidarum - Pilo ischemic strokes, transient ischemic episodes, migraine headaches. - Postpaum complications such as pulmonary infiltrates, fever, and cardiac symptoms. Aboions in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome - Typically these patients give a history of a live fetus documented by ultrasound or by Doppler before demise or aboion occurs. The majority of the pregnancy losses occur between 14 and 18 weeks. Fetal death is these patients is caused by extensive thrombosis of the placental vessels and the placenta is usually smaller than expected for the gestational age.",A

Select the antibiotic most frequently associated with the Hypoplasia and staining of fetal teeth (SELECT 1 ANTIBIOTIC),Tetracycline,Streptomycin,Nitrofurantoin,Chloramphenicol,"Fetal exposure to an antibiotic depends on many factors such as gestational age, protein binding, lipid solubility, pH, molecular weight, degree of ionization, and concentration gradient. Some antibiotics are even concentrated in the fetal compartment. Tetracycline is contraindicated in all three trimesters. It has been associated with skeletal abnormalities, staining and hypoplasia of budding fetal teeth, bone hypoplasia, and fatal maternal liver decompensation. Sulfonamides are associated with kernicterus in the newborn. They compete with bilirubin for binding sites on albumin, thereby leaving more bilirubin free for diffusion into tissues. Sulfonamides should be withheld during the last 2 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. With prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy, streptomycin has been associated with fetal hearing loss. Its use is restricted to complicated cases of TB. Nitrofurantoin can cause maternal and fetal hemolytic anemia if glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is present. Chloramphenicol is noted for causing the gray baby syndrome.

Which of the following evaluation methods is most sensitive in diagnosing pregnancy?",No evaluation to determine pregnancy is needed because the patient is asymptomatic and therefore cannot be pregnant,Serum pregnancy test,Detection of fetal heart tones by Doppler equipment,Abdominal ultrasound,"Nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness, and urinary frequency are all common symptoms of pregnancy, but their presence cannot definitively make the diagnosis of pregnancy because they are nonspecific symptoms that are not consistently found in early pregnancy. On physical exam, the pregnant uterus enlarges and becomes boggier and softer, but these changes are not usually apparent until after 6 weeks gestational age. In addition, other conditions such as adenomyosis, fibroids, or previous pregnancies can result in an enlarged uterus being palpated on physical exam. Abdominal ultrasound will not demonstrate a gestational sac until a gestational age of 5 to 6 weeks is reached. A Doppler instrument will detect fetal cardiac action usually no sooner than 10 weeks. A sensitive serum pregnancy test can detect placental HCG levels by 8 to 9 days post-ovulation, and it is therefore the most sensitive modality for detecting and diagnosing pregnancy.",B

What does the below diagram indicate?,Abruptio placenta,Placenta accreta,Placenta increta,Placenta percreta,"The above image shows the placental villi penetrating through the myometrium and getting attached to the serosa. Hence, this is known as placenta percreta. Placenta Accreta syndromes include any placental implantation with abnormally firm adherence to myometrium because of paial or total absence of decidua basalis and imperfect development of the fibrinoid. The increased risk conveyed by previous uterine trauma (eg., cesaerean delivery) may be paially explained by an increased vulnerability of the decidua to trophoblast invasion following incision into the decidua. Microscopically, placental villi are anchored to muscle fibers rather than to decidual cells. Decidual deficiency then prevents normal placental seperation after delivery. Variants of placental accreta syndromes are classified by the depth of trophoblastic growth: Types Definition Placenta accreta Villi are attached to the myometrium Placenta increta Villi invade the myometrium Placenta percreta Villi penetrate through the myometrium and to or through the serosa In cases of first- and second-trimester accreta syndromes, there is usually hemorrhage that is the consequence of coexisting placenta pre.

Which of the following is the BEST indicator of ovarian reserve?,FSH,Estradiol,LH,FSH/LH ratio,Measurement of rise in basal FSH is an excellent indicator of ovarian aging. As women age serum FSH concentrations in the early follicular phase begins to increase due to a decline in the number of small follicles secreting inhibin. Day 3 FSH concentration greater than 20 to 25 IU/L is considered to be elevated and is associated with poor reproductive outcome. Measurement of serum E2 levels along with serum FSH adds to the predictive power of an isolated FSH determination. Basal E2 concentration greater than 75 to 80 pg/ml are associated with poor response to ovarian stimulation and pregnancy outcome.

Select the antibiotic most frequently associated with the Gray baby syndrome (SELECT 1 ANTIBIOTIC),Tetracycline,Streptomycin,Nitrofurantoin,Chloramphenicol,"Fetal exposure to an antibiotic depends on many factors such as gestational age, protein binding, lipid solubility, pH, molecular weight, degree of ionization, and concentration gradient. Some antibiotics are even concentrated in the fetal compartment. Tetracycline is contraindicated in all three trimesters. It has been associated with skeletal abnormalities, staining and hypoplasia of budding fetal teeth, bone hypoplasia, and fatal maternal liver decompensation. Sulfonamides are associated with kernicterus in the newborn. They compete with bilirubin for binding sites on albumin, thereby leaving more bilirubin free for diffusion into tissues. Sulfonamides should be withheld during the last 2 to 6 weeks of pregnancy. With prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) in pregnancy, streptomycin has been associated with fetal hearing loss. Its use is restricted to complicated cases of TB. Nitrofurantoin can cause maternal and fetal hemolytic anemia if glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is present. Chloramphenicol is noted for causing the gray baby syndrome. Infants are unable to properly metabolize the drug, which reaches toxic levels in about 4 days and can lead to neonatal death within 1 to 2 days.",D

Count each of your baby'smovements as one kick, and count until you reach 10 kicks or movements. Most of the time it will take less than a half-hour, but it could take as long as two hours. Log your recorded times into a Count the Kicks chart. The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (aka L-S or L/S ratio) is a test of fetal amniotic fluid to assess for fetal lung immaturity. Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. Human placental lactogen (hPL), also called human chorionic somatomammotropin (HCS), is a polypeptide placentalhormone, the human form of placental lactogen (chorionic somatomammotropin). Its structure and function are similar to those of human growth hormone. It modifies the metabolic state of the mother during pregnancy to facilitate the energy supply of the fetus. hPL has anti-insulin properties. hPL is a hormone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast during pregnancy. Like human growth hormone, hPL is encoded by genes on chromosome 17q22-24. HPL is present only during pregnancy, with maternal serum levels rising in relation to the growth of the fetus and placenta. Maximum levels are reached near term, typically to 5-7 mg/L. Higher levels are noted in patients with multiple gestation. Little hPL enters the fetal circulation. Its biological half-life is 15 minutes.",D

Which of the following is generally not seen in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) –,More common in females,"Petechiae, ecchymosis and bleeding",Palpable splenomegaly,Increased megakaryocytes in bone marrow,"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura

There are two clinical subtypes of primary I.T.P, acute and chronic both are autoimmune disorders in which platelet destruction results from the formation of antiplatelet antibodies.

Pathology

The principal morphologic lesions of thrombocytopenic purpura are found in the spleen and bone marrow but they are not diagnostic.
The point to stress is that despite the increased destruction of platelets in spleen the spleen size remains normal.  

Bone Marrow

Bone marrow reveals a modestly increased number of megakaryocytes.
These findings are not specific for autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura but merely reflect accelerated thrombopoiesis, being found in most forms of thrombocytopenia resulting from increased platelet destruction.
The importance of bone marrow examination is to rule out thrombocytopenias resulting from bone marrow failure.
A decrease in the number of megakaryocytes goes against the diagnosis of I.T.P.

Clinical Features

Chronic ITP occurs most commonly in adult women, younger than age 40 years.
Female to male ratio is 4: 1.
The clinical signs and symptoms associated with I.T.P are non-specific for this condition but they are rather reflective of thrombocytopenia.
The disease is often insidious in onset and is characterized by bleeding into the skin and mucosal surfaces.
Cutaneous bleeding occurs in the form of pinpoint haemorrhages, petechiae or ecchymoses. Often there will be a history of easy bruising, nosebleeds, bleeding from the gums and haemorrhages into soft tissues from relatively minor trauma.
Sometimes disease may first manifest with melena, hematuria or excessive menstrual flow.

Neural tube defects are prevented by –,Pyridoxin,Folic acid,Thiamine,Iron,"Neural tube defect

Neural tube defects account for most congenital anamalies of the CNS.
It results from failure of neural tube to close spontaneously between the 3rd and 4th week of in utero development.
Lumbo-sacrol region is the most common site Etiology
NTDs have multiple etiological factors -


Maternal diabetes                                                                                                   
Zinc and folate deficiency
Maternal exposure to alcohol, radiation, valproate, carbamazepine
Trisomy 13 and 15


Maternal malnutrition is an important risk factor for development of NTD. There is decreased maternal folate levels in NTD affected pregnancies --> Periconceptional folic acid supplementation decreases the occurrence of NTD

Pathogenesis

The human nervous system develops from neuroectoderm.
During development, behind neuroectoderm lies the mesoderm that encloses the notochord which is derived from endoderm.
Vertebral bodies develop from the mesoderm around the notochord.
Neuroectoderm forms invagination ---> Neural groove.
This neural groove separates from overlying surface ectoderm and becomes neural tube.
From developing vertebral bodies, two dorsal projection extends, which grow around the neural tube and form vertebral arch (pedicle and lamina).
Failure of these vertebral arches to fuse give rise to Neural tube defect.",B

This assay tests the extrinsic and common coagulation pathway.
So, a prolonged PT can result from a deficiency of factor V, VII, X, prothrombin or fibrinogen.

iii) Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 

This assay tests the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways.
So, a prolonged PTT. Can results from the deficiency of factor V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, prothrombin or fibrinogen.

iv) Thrombin time

It is the time taken for clotting to occur when thrombin is added to the plasma.
It tests the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and depends on adequate fibrinogen level.
Prolonged thrombin time results from a decreased level of fibrinogen.",A

Hypertensive crisis 

In hypertensive crisis, BP is rapidly rising or a high BP level is associated with neurological manifestations, heart failure or pulmonary edema.
Hypertensive crisis may be divided : -


Hypertensive emergencies ---> Situations in which immediate reduction of BP is needed (within minutes), usually with parentral therapy.
Hypertensive urgencies     Situations in which reduction of BP is needed within hours, usually with oral agents.
Accelerated malignant hypertension ----> Situations in which papilledema, hemorrhage, and exudate are associated with markedly elevated BP. The diastolic pressure is usually greater than 140 mm. Hg.
Hypertensive encephalopathy --> Situations in which markedly elevated BP is associated with severe headache and various alteration in consciousness.

Which of the following is NOT true regarding Vasa Pre?,Found with with velamentous cord inseion,APT TEST is the investigation of choice for diagnosing Vasa Pre,Very high perinatal moality as blood loss is exclusively fetal,An urgent cesarean is usually the best option to save the fetus,"Vasa pre: This finding is associated with velamentous inseion when some of the fetal vessels in the membranes cross the region of the cervical os below the presenting fetal pa. Marginal cord inseions and bilobed or succenturiate-lobed placentas are also associated with vasa pre. Color Doppler is the investigation of choice. With vasa pre, there is considerable potential fetal danger because membrane rupture may be accompanied by tearing of a fetal vessel. This is a/w very high perinatal moality as there is exclusive fetal blood loss. Low-lying placenta is a risk factor in 80% of cases. Patients of vasa pre should be delivered by elective LSCS. The Apt test is a medical test used to differentiate maternal and fetal blood. A positive test would indicate that blood is of fetal origin, and could be due to vasa pre. A negative test indicates that the blood is of maternal origin. In practice, the Apt test is almost never done when there is bleeding PV and a suspicion of vasa pre, because the time to fetal collapse with bleeding from vasa pre is often very sho.",B

She is usually asymptomatic and has had 3 flares in the past 5 years. She is concerned about exposing her unborn child to infection-What is the most appropriate counsel to offer to this patient.,Administer one dose of acyclovir if she has active genital herpes at the time of delivery.,Administer prophylaxis with acyclovir from now and uptil delivery whether she has active herpes or not.,Perform elective LSCS even if mother is asymptomatic at the time of delivery.,Perform elective LSCS only if mother has active herpes at the time of delivery.,"Herpes Simplex Virus infection in pregnancy:

Most common time of Mother To Child transmission is–at the time of delivery
About 50% women with HSV is first trimister abort while infection in second half can lead to IUGR, preterm labor.
ACOG does not recommend a routine screening for HSV
Viral isolation is the defective means of diagnosis for HSV infection
Specimens are obtained from any active lesions as well as from cervix and vagina
PCR can also be done
DOC during pregnancy-Acyclovir (safe in lactation also) × 7–10 days
ACOG recommends daily viral therapy at or beyond 36 weeks for women who have recurrences during pregnancy as it decreases the outbreaks at term and so decreased need for cesarean Cesarean section is indicated for women with active genital lesions or in patients having prodromal symptoms of herpes viz genital pain and tingling (ans 22). Cesarean is not indicated in women with a h/o HSV infection but no active genital tract lesion/prodromal symptoms at the time of delivery.
If no active breast lesions are present–patient can breastfeed.
Now with this background about HSV infection, lets have a look at the options
Option a: administer one dose of acyclovir if she has active genital herpes at the time of delivery-incorrect as acyclovir should be given for 7–10 days in case of active herpes infection.
Option b: administer prophylaxis with acyclovir from now and uptil delivery whether she has active herpes or not–again incorrect as we have to give acyclovir for 7–10 days, then stop and restart at 36 weeks of gestation.
Option c: perform elective LSCS even if mother is asymptomatic at the time of delivery. – again Incorrect
Option d: perform elective LSCS only if mother has active herpes at the time of delivery. – correct",D

During internal rotation, in occipito lateral position there is internal rotation of occiput anteriorly to 2/8th of the circle and simultaneous rotation of the shoulders to 1/8th of the circle. Crowning of head is said to occur when the biparietal diameter stretches the vulval outlet without any recession of the head even after the contraction is over. Delivery of head takes place by extension. Restitution: refers to the visible passive movement of the head due to untwisting of the neck sustained during internal rotation.

Clinical manifestations: o Gower's sign is positive o Pseudohyperophy of calf is seen (muscle is replaced by fat & connective tissue) o Loss of muscle strength is progressive. o Proximal muscles and neck flexors are involved more o Leg involvement is more severe than arm involvement. o Contractures of heel cords and iliotibial band occurs (by age of 6 years) o progressive scoliosis develops.",B
The vulval carcinoma will metastasize commonly into :,Para-aoic group of lymph nodes,Internal iliac group of lymph nodes,External iliac group of lymph nodes,Superficial inguinal group of lymph nodes,"Spread of the vulval Tumour : The tumour proliferates mainly by direct spread to the adjacent organs and by the lymphatics; blood-borne metastases are rare. Parry Jones was the first to describe the lymphatic spread that occurs in a systematic manner. At first, the superficial inguinal nodes are involved through lymphatic emboli, but later lymphatic channel permeation occurs causing lymphatic blockage and leg oedema. The malignancy spreads to deep nodes and the gland of Cloquet (uppermost of the femoral or the lowermost of the external iliac gland) to the external iliac glands, obturator and common iliac nodes in the advanced stages. Laterally placed tumours rarely spread to the contralateral inguinal glands, but centrally located lesion involves the lymph nodes of the opposite side in 25% cases and this is because of crossing of lymphatics in the midline. Lymph nodes not clinically suspicious may show metastasis in about 25% cases. Inguinal lymph nodes are involved in 10% in Stage I, 30% in Stage II, 70% in Stage III and 100% cases in Stage IV. Lymphatics of the clitoris drain directly into the pelvic lymph nodes. The regional lymph nodes are assessed by MRI and PET. The involvement of the lymph nodes depends upon the site of the lesion, its size and depth of invasion. Reference : Shaw's Textbook of Gynaecology 16th edition page no 479",D

Several different methods exist for calculating AFI, that produce different index numbers below which oligohydramnios is said to be present.Causes: It is typically caused by fetal urinary tract abnormalities such as bilateral renal agenesis (Potters syndrome), fetal polycystic kidneys, or genitourinary obstruction. Uteroplacentalinsufficiency is another common cause. Most of these abnormalities can also be detected by obstetric ultrasound. It may also occur without a determinable cause (idiopathic).Complications: Cord compression, musculoskeletal abnormalities such as facial distortion and clubfoot, pulmonary hypoplasia and intrauterine growth restriction. Amnion nodosum is frequently also present (nodules on the fetal surface of the amnion).Congenital Anomalies Associated with Oligohydramnios:Amnionic band syndromeCardiac--Fallot tetralogy, septal defectsCentral nervous system--holoprosencephaly, meningocele, encephalocele, microcephalyChromosomal abnormalities: triploidy, trisomy 18, Turner syndromeCloacal dysgenesisCystic hygromaDiaphragmatic herniaGenitourinary--renal agenesis, renal dysplasia, urethral obstruction, bladder exstrophy, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, prune-belly syndromeHypothyroidismSkeletal--sirenomelia, sacral agenesis, absent radius, facial cleftingTwin-reversed-arterial-perfusion (TRAP) sequenceTwin-to-twin transfusionVACTERL (vertebral, anal, cardiac, trachea-oesophageal, renal, limb) association",A
"A 30-year-old G2P1 is undergoing an elective repeat caesarean section at term. The infant is delivered without any dificulties, but the placenta cannot be removed easily because a clear plane between the placenta and uterine wall cannot be identified. The placenta is removed in pieces. This is followed by uterine atony and haemorrhage. All of the following are true regarding the condition except",Previous LSCS is a predisposing factor,Absence of Nitabuch's membrane,May require obstetric hysterectomy,If Placenta invades muscle and reaches serosa it is known as placenta increta,With placenta accreta a cesarean hysterectomy may be required. This is because there is uncontrollable bleeding often when placental delivery is attempted. Hysterectomy is frequently required since regular methods of reducing bleeding with suturing mostly don't work. Nitabuch's layer limits invasion of the decidua by the trophoblast. The membrane is absent in the placenta accreta. It causes morbid adhered placenta Placenta accreta:- Paial or complete absence of decidua with adherence of placenta directly to the superficial myometrium Placenta increta :- Villi invade into but not through the myometrium Placenta percreta :- Villi invade through the full thickness of myometrium to the serosa,D

All of the following are neural tube defects except:,Myelomeningocele,Anencephaly,Encephalocele,Holoprosencephaly,"Ans. D. HoloprosencephalyNeural tube defects (NTDs) are a group of birth defects in which an opening in the spinal cord or brain remains from early in human development. In the 3rd week of pregnancy called gastrulation, specialized cells on the dorsal side of the embryo begin to change shape and form the neural tube. When the neural tube does not close completely, an NTD develops. There are 2 types of NTD: open and closed. Open NTDs occur when the brain and/or spinal cord are exposed at birth through a defect in the skull or vertebrae (back bones).Examples of open NTDs are anencephaly, encephaloceles, hydranencephaly, iniencephaly, schizencephaly, and spina bifida. Rarer types of NTDs are called closed NTDs. Closed NTDs occur when the spinal defect is covered by skin. Common examples of closed NTDs are lipomyelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, and tethered cord.",D
Gold standard investigation for uterine cavity evaluation is,Ultrasonography,Saline sonography,Hysterosalpingography,Hysteroscopy,"Hysteroscopy is considered the gold standard for uterine cavity evaluation because it allows for direct visualization. The procedure involves inseion of an endoscope through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity and instillation of distension media to allow for visualization.To optimize visualization of the endometrial cavity and avoid performing the procedure during early pregnancy, hysteroscopy is typically scheduled during the early- to mid follicular phase of the cycle. Disadvantages to the procedure include poor visualization when uterine bleeding is present and the inability to evaluate structures outside the uterine cavity, including those in the myometrium and adnexa.

Kangaroo mother care can be initiated immediately in babies weighing,500 - 1000 grams,1000 - 1200 grams,1200 - 1800 grams,> 1800 grams,"Kangaroo mother care (KMC) refers to care of preterm or low bih weight infants by placing the infant in skin-to-skin contact with the mother or any other caregiver.KMC was first suggested in 1978 by Dr Edgar Rey in Bogota, Colombia. The term kangaroo care is derived from practical similarities to marsupial caregiving, i.e. the infant is kept warm in the maternal pouch and close to the breasts for unlimited feeding.ComponentsKangaroo position. The kangaroo position consists of skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant in a veical position, between the mother&;s breasts and under her clothes. The provider must keep herself in a semi-reclining position to avoid the gastric reflux in the infant. The kangaroo position is maintained until the infant no longer tolerates it, as indicated by sweating in the baby or baby refusing to stay in KMC position.Kangaroo nutrition: Kangaroo nutrition is exclusive breastfeeding.Kangaroo discharge and followup: Early home discharge in the kangaroo position from the neonatal unit is one of the original components of the KMC intervention.Physiological BenefitsKMC results in keeping neonates warm and cozy. Babies get protected against cold stress and hypothermia.Physiological parameters such as hea and respiratory rates, oxygenation, sleep patterns get stabilized.Clinical BenefitsKMC significantly increases milk production in mothers and exclusive breastfeeding rates.KMC improves weight gain in the infants and improves thermal protection. It reduces incidence of respiratory tract and nosocomial infections, improves emotional bonding between the infant and mothers and results in earlier discharge from the hospital.Bih Weight > 1800grams, KMC can be initiated immediately after bih1200 to 1800grams: May take a few days before KMC can be initiated< 1200grams: May take days to weeks before KMC can be initiatedRef: Paediatrics; O.P.

"While performing a vaginal delivery for a nulliparous woman, after successful delivery of the baby and placenta, you observe that a perineal laceration has extended to involve the external anal sphincter. All are true regarding this except?",It could have been avoided had you practiced a routine episiotomy,Lack of proper perineal support could be the reason,Repair is done in the OT under anaesthesia by senior,Torn anal sphincter is sutured using end to end anastomosis,"Ans. A. It could have been avoided had you practiced a routine episiotomyPerineal injury during delivery can be prevented by proper perineal support, slow delivery of head in between contractions. Alternatively, if expulsive efforts are inadequate or expeditious delivery is needed, the modified Ritgen maneuver may be employed. With this, gloved fingers beneath a draped towel exert forward pressure on the fetal chin through the perineum just in front of the coccyx. Concurrently, the other hand presses superiorly against the occiput, this allows controlled fetal head delivery. It also favors neck extension so that the head passes through the introitus and over the perineum with its smallest diameters.American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has concluded that restricted use of episiotomy is preferred to routine use and episiotomy should be considered for indications such as shoulder dystocia, breech delivery, macrosomic fetuses, operative vaginal deliveries, persistent occiput posterior positions, and other instances in which failure to perform an episiotomy will result in significant perineal rupture.Repair of 3rd and 4th degree perineal tear is performed in OT under proper relaxation and anaesthesia, light and position by a senior obstetrician for best results. Torn anal sphincter is sutured using end to end anastomosis. Overlapping technique is an alternative method. Data based on randomized controlled trials do not support that this method yields superior anatomical or functional results compared with those of the traditional end-to-end method.",A

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein normally produced by a developing fetus. Regarding Alpha Fetoprotein TRUE statement is:,Major source of late fetal life is yolk sac,Commonly elevated in Wilms tumor,Level increases after 20th week,Half-life 5-7 days,"This glycoprotein is synthesized early in gestation by the fetal yolk sac and later by the fetal gastrointestinal tract and liver. Its concentration increases steadily in both fetal serum and amniotic fluid until 13 weeks, after which, levels rapidly decrease. Conversely, AFP is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks. Half-life is 5-7 days. An elevated level of AFP suggests the presence of either primary liver cancer or a germ cell tumor of the ovary or testicle. Other conditions which cause elevated AFP are, gastric cancer, cirrhosis, hepatic necrosis, acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, ataxia-telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

Which of the following condition is associated with polycystic ovaries?,Pheochromocytoma,Adrenal hyperplasia,Pancreatic overactivity,Thyroid hypofunction,"Women with Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting adrenal tumors also tend to have high circulating androgen levels and anovulation with polycystic ovaries. In this late-onset form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), the enzyme deficiency leads to a relative coisol deficiency. In response, adrenocoicotropic hormone (ACTH) levels are increased to normalize coisol production. Adrenal hyperplasia and elevated androgens results as a consequence of this accommodation. Thus, symptoms of late-onset CAH reflect accumulation of precursor C19 steroid hormones. These precursors are conveed to dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. Thus, signs of virilization predominate. Ref: Hoffman B.L., Schorge J.O., Schaffer J.I., Halvorson L.M., Bradshaw K.D., Cunningham F.G., Calver L.E. (2012). Chapter 17.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology, but with a strong genetic basis. It develops and is typically diagnosed before 36 mo of age. It is characterized by a behavioral phenotype that includes qualitative impairment in the areas of language development or communication skills, social interactions and reciprocity, and imagination and play. Selective mutism is defined as a failure to speak in specific social situations, despite speaking in other situations; it is typically a symptom of an underlying anxiety disorder. Children with selective mutism can speak normally in ceain settings, such as within their home or when they are alone with their parents, but do not speak in other social settings, such as at school or at other places outside their home. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, 1 of the most prevalent chronic health conditions affecting school-aged children. ADHD is characterized by: Inattention, including increased distractibility and difficulty sustaining attention. Poor impulse control and decreased self-inhibitory capacity Motor overactivity and motor restlessness.

True about acute ITP,More common in female,Specific anti platelet antibodies detected,Viral infection predisposes as seen after vaccination,80% cases transforms to chronic,"ITP is proposed to be secondary to antibodies directed against the platelate glycoprotein 2b/3a complex. mmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a disorder that can lead to easy or excessive bruising and bleeding. The bleeding results from unusually low levels of platelets -- the cells that help blood clot. Formerly known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, ITPcan cause purple bruises, as well as tiny reddish-purple dots that look like a rash. Children may develop ITP after a viral infection and usually recover fully without treatment. In adults, the disorder is often long term. If you don&;t have signs of bleeding and your platelet count isn&;t too low, you may not need any treatment. If your symptoms are more severe, treatment may include medications to boost your platelet count or surgery to remove your spleen.

Cloherty, 7th edition, Page 619CONGENITAL RUBELLA SYNDROME (CRS)RNA virus (the toga virus family)Maternal Infection (in gestation)Rate of fetal infectionOccurrence of fetal anomaliesFirst 12 weeks of gestation81%100% of the infected fetuses had cardiac defects and deafnessIn 13 to 16 weeks54%Deafness was found in one-third of fetusesIn 31 to 36 weeks60%No abnormalities were found when fetal infection occurred beyond the 20th week of gestationBeyond 36 weeks100%Clinical Features:Cataracts (can be both unilateral or bilateral), sensory neural hearing loss (single most common finding among the CRS infants), and congenital heart disease (patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis).Common early features - IUGR, retinopathy (salt and pepper retinopathy), microphthalmia, meningo encephalitis, hypotonia, electroencephalographic abnormalities, dermatoglyphic abnormalities, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura, radiographic bone , and diabetes mellitus.Rare complications - myocarditis, glaucoma, microcephaly, chronic progressive panencephalitis, hepatitis, anemia, hypogammaglobulinemia, thymic hypoplasia, thyroid abnormalities, cryptorchidism and polycystic kidney disease.Antenatal Diagnosis:1. Determination of specific IgM in fetal blood obtained by PUBS.2. Direct detection of rubella antigen and RNA in a chorionic villus biopsy specimen.Postnatal Diagnosis: The diagnosis of congenital infection is made by one of the following:i. Isolation of rubella virus (oropharynx, urine).ii. Detection of rubella-specific IgM in cord or neonatal blood.iii. Persistent rubella-specific titers over time (i.e., no decline in titer as expected for transplacentally derived maternal IgG).If, in addition, there are congenital defects, the diagnosis of CRS is made.Treatment:No specific therapy for either maternal or congenital rubella infection.Maternal disease is almost always mild and self-limiting.1. Primary maternal infection occurs during the first 5 months of pregnancy-termination options should be discussed with the mother.2. Infection is known to have occurred beyond the 20th week of gestation, its unlikely to develop anomaliesIndividuals with postnatal infection typically shed virus for 1 week before and 1 week after the onset of rash.Infants with congenital infection may shed virus for many months, and contact should be avoided during the first year.Conception also should be avoided for 3 months following immunization.Immunization during pregnancy is not recommended because of the theoretical risk to the fetus. Inadvertent immunizations during pregnancy have occurred - reassurance of little risk to the fetus can be given.Maternal Infection:Symptoms - begin 2 to 3 weeks after exposure and include malaise, low-grade fever, headache, mild coryza, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, arthralgias and conjunctivitis.Occurring 1 to 5 days before the onset of rash (salmon-pink macular or maculopapular exanthem that begins on the face and behind the ears and spreads downward over 1 to 2 days and disappears in 5 to 7 days from onset).Confirmation - demonstrating a fourfold or higher rise in serum IgG titers when measured at the time of symptoms and approximately 2 weeks later.If a woman exposed to rubella is known to be seropositive, she is immune, and the fetus is considered not to be at risk for infection.If the exposed woman is known to be seronegative, a serum sample should be obtained 3 to 4 weeks after exposure for determination of titer.A negative titer indicates that no infection has occurred, whereas a positive titer indicates infection.",C
"A 3-month-old male infant developed otitis media for which he was given a course of Co-trimoxazole.

S.S.S. usually have primary infection at sites other than skin eg - Nasopharynx, conjuctiva, throat middle ear (otitis media).o Now, about the individual diseasesStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Usually begins as prodrome. The acute phase stas with the onset of erythematous rash in the periorbital and perioral area and is tender.o These erythematous rashes are soon (within hrs or days) followed by wrinkling or sloughing of the skin. o The sloughing can be provoked by stroking of the skin (Nikolsky's sign).In later stage, large flaccid bullae may develop. These bullae can cause loss of water and electrolyte. o Fever irritability and lethargy are common but systemic toxicity is not seen.o The entire illness resolves within about 10 days.Toxic epidermal necrolvsis ?It is a severe form of drug reaction.Toxemia is characteristicIt is characterized by bullae that arise on widespread areas of erythema and then they slough leaving behind raw ulcerated skin.Oral mucosa especially the lips, genital mucosa and conjunctiva are ofter involved.

Transcervical endometrial resection (TCRE) is used in:,Endometriosis,DUB,Carcinoma endometrium,Submucous fibroid,"Transcervical endometrial resection (Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation) is a technique for management of DUB.
Aim of the procedure is to produce a therapeutic Asherman’s syndrome and produce amenorrhea.
It destroys the endometrium → formation of synchea → Asherman syndrome → amenorrhea.
It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of myometrial depth.
Procedure : After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endomyometrium, to a depth of 4mm. Resected tissue is used for pathologic examination and documentation of the absence of cellular atypia. After a few strips are resected initially from the posterior uterine wall, resection of almost all the remaining surface with loop electrode by vaporization is performed. The procedure should be performed soon after menstruation or the woman should be given progesterone, danazol or GnRH to suppress the endometrium.
Result : Short term and long term studies show amenorrhea rates of 20–50%, overall improved bleeding patterns (including amenorrhea) in 85–95%, with failure rates of 5–10% which requires additional surgery i.e. hysterectomy.
Extra Edge:
• A COG recommends endometrial sampling prior to ablation surgery. Women with endometrial hyperplasia or cancer should not undergo ablation.
• Absolute contraindications for endometrial ablation :

Resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria in the pediatric age group should be treated with __________,Chloroquine,Tetracycline,Clindamycin,Doxycycline,"Blood schizonticides are the first-line drugs for the treatment of malaria and must be staed as soon as the diagnosis is made, or even suspected, in severe disease. They act on the asexual forms in the erythrocytes and interrupt clinical attacks. Delay in treatment of P falciparum malaria can lead to the development or worsening of severe malaria, which has a poorer prognosis than uncomplicated malaria. Chloroquine, quinine, quinidine, halofantrine, and aemisinin compounds are the rapidly acting drugs that can terminate an acute malaria attack. While chloroquine acts rapidly, resistance is widespread, and an accurate travel history should be obtained before choosing the antimalarial drug. Malaria impoed from Asia or the Americas is mostly P vivax and is chloroquine responsive. Malaria acquired in Africa is mostly P falciparum and is chloroquine resistant; quinine is an effective drug. P falciparummalaria incurred in Southeast Asia may be quinine and mefloquine resistant as well; a combination of aesunate and mefloquine, or aesunate and lumefantrine, is recommended. Time wasted in trials of a drug to which the parasite is resistant can result in a poor outcome, including death. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

"Apoptosis can occur by change in hormone levels in the ovarian cycle. When there is no feilization of the ovum, the endometrial cells die because;",The involution of corpus luteum causes estradiol and progesterone levels to fall dramatically,LH levels rise after ovulation,Estradiol levels are not involved in the LH surge phenomenon,Estradiol inhibits the induction of the progesterone receptor in the endometrium,"The stimulus for the corpus luteum to continue its function of progesterone production is LH. This stops after the 10th day of its formation in the absence of pregnancy. As the corpus luteum involutes, the levels of estrogen and progesterone falls and leads to a withdrawl bleed due to absence of progesterone that was suppoing the estrogen primed endometrium. Once pregnancy ensues , the hCG made from the syncytiotrophoblast is the stimulator for continuous corpus luteum function till around 12th week of gestation after which the placenta takes over the function of pregnancy maintenance.",A

This medication works which of the following mechanisms?",Decrease detrusor muscle tone,Improves aleness of the patient during the sleep cycle,Increase external sphincter contraction,Increase water permeability and reabsorption in collecting tubules,"Desmopressin, or DDAVP, can be used intranasally in patients suffering from enuresis. This medication is a long-acting synthetic analogue of vasopressin. The medication acts at V2 receptors, which are found on renal tubule cells, and mediates an anti-diuretic effect by increasing water permeability and water reabsorption in the collecting tubules, leading to decreased urine output. It is effective in 70% of patients with increased nocturnal urine output. Detrusor muscle tone is under control of the parasympathetic system. DDAVP does not affect this system. Some sympathomimetic drugs may cause enough wakefulness so that the child perceives the urge to void . Dextroamphetamine sulfate is one such medication. The external sphincter is under somatic nervous control. This medication does not contribute to this system. Ref: Goldson E., Reynolds A. (2012). Chapter 3. Child Development & Behavior. In W.W.

Which of the following is not a feature of Phenylketonuria?,Severe mental retardation,Reduced tendon reflexes,Hypopigmentation in skin,Hair loss,"Ans. B. Reduced tendon reflexesPhenylketonuria (PKU), is caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. The results of a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) impairs the body's ability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine. This leads to accumulation of phenylalanine in body fluids. Elevated phenylalanine levels negatively impact cognitive function, and individuals with classic PKU almost always have intellectual disability unless levels are controlled through dietary or pharmacologic treatment. Fair skin and hair resulting from impairment of melanin synthesis, is the most characteristic cutaneous manifestation of PKU .

Which of the following conditions is the brisk Moro reflex seen?,Kernicterus,Stage III hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE),Hypoglycemia,Erb's palsy,"A brisk moro reflex can be seen in neonates with hypoglycemia. In hypoglycemic babies, there is activation of the autonomic system, which results in jitteriness. Newborns often exhibit this as an exaggerated Moro reflex. The Moro Reflex: It is a primitive reflex which is very sensitive to the infant&;s level of aleness. It can be elicited by suppoing the infant in the semierect position and allowing the infant&;s head to fall backwards onto the examiner&;s hand. The Moro reflex: caused by significant generalized disturbance of the CNS.

She has no other medical problems and has never had surgery. She has had 3 sexual paners over her lifetime and is currently involved in a monogamous relationship. She has never had a sexually transmitted disease in the past. Examination demonstrates two nontender 6 mm well-circumscribed, flesh-colored, papillated, oval lesions on the labia majora. There is no ulceration, erythema, purulence, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Chancre,Condyloma,Herpes,Squamous cell carcinoma,"This patient, who presents with asymptomatic, well-circumscribed, benign-appearing, flesh-colored lesions in the genital area most likely has condyloma acuminatum, or genital was. These lesions result from contact with infected paners and represent a sexually transmitted disease. Most of the time these lesions are benign, without carcinogenic potential except if they are associated with the cervix, where they are an impoant etiologic agent for cervical carcinoma. Chancre is characterized as a painless ulcer and is the primary genital lesion of syphilis. This patient did not have an ulceration Herpes simplex lesions are characterized by grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. These lesions are usually symptomatic with a prodrome of burning or irritation. This patient had an asymptomatic lesion without vesicles, ulcerations, erosions, or erythema. Squamous cell carcinoma can present in this location, but usually is characterized with erythema, erosion, or ulceration.

"Mother with previous history of delivery a CAH child, what to do in next pregnancy in regard to steroid therapy",To sta before conception,To sta as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed,After chorionic villous sampling,Determine sex on usg and then sta steroid therapy,"CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) is associated with masculinisation of a female fetus caused by reduced or absent enzymatic activity at one of the stages of adrenal steroid biosynthesis. Prenatal exposure to androgens leads to external genital masculinisation of the affected female child. Since it is an autosomal recessive disorder, there is risk of recurrence. Diagnosing the fetal sex before is impoant since the problems of virilisation in girls are permanent at this stage. To prevent masculinisation of a female fetus its impoant that the changes are prevented from occurring by providing exogenous steroids during the intrauterine life itself.

Weight Gain in the second year of life is _____________,1 kg,2 kg,3 kg,4 kg,"The average bih weight of neonates is about 3 kg. During the first a few days after bih, the newborn loses extracellular fluid equivalent to about 10% of the body weight. Most infants regain their bih weight by the age of 10 days. Subsequently, they gain weight at a rate of approximately 20-40 g per day for the first 3 months of life. Thereafter, they gain about 400 g weight every month for the remaining pa of the first year. An infant usually doubles his bih weight by the age of 5 months. The bih weight triples at 1 year and is four times at 2 years of age. Thus, the weight at 5months, 1 year and 2 years is approximately 6, 9 and 12 kg, respectively. The weight of a child at the age of 3 years is approximately five times that of the bih weight. At 5 years, the expected weight can be calculated by multiplying the bih weight by 6, at 7 years by 7 and at 10 years by 10. It follows that the expected weight at 3, 5, 7 and 10 years is approximately 15, 18, 21 and 30 kg, respectively.

"A neonate delivered at 32 weeks, is put on a ventilator, X–ray shows 'white out lung' and ABG reveals PO2 of 75. Ventilator settings are an, FiO2 of 70, and rate of 50/minute. Next step to be taken should be ?",Increase rate to 60 per minute,Increase FiO2 to 80,Continue ventilation with the same settings,Weaning ventilator,"Lets see the individual findings.

The neonate is premature.
X - Ray shows 'White - Out' : is a sign of Hyaline Membrane disease in the Newborn i.e. RDS.
ABG reveals p0, of 75 : which is acceptable.
FiO, : Fractional Inspiratory 0„ here in the ventilator settings, is 75% well above the normal.
Respiratory Rate settings in the ventilator is 50/min : Normal for that age.

Now, we have the complete picture here :
The premature baby is having HMD, and so has been put on Artificial respiration.
The FiO2 being given is in the higher normal range, and also the partial pressure of 0, in the neonates blood is acceptable . So we will avoid increasing the Fi0„ as this carries a risk of blindness by ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity). As a rule, we avoid tampering with the ventilator rate settings, because it causes changes in the CO, levels of the blood, and consequent disturbances in the acid - base balance. This is also one of the reasons for keeping this rate of 50/min. in this neonate.
Weaning from ventilator will start once the baby shows hyper - oxygenation with the currect settings, i.e. the p0, in the range of 120 .
The answer here would be to continue the current settings till such time when the baby shows hyper-oxygenation, and then slowly wean him off the ventilator",C
Automatism is seen in,Paial seizures,complex paial seizures,Infantile spasms,Absence seizures,"A complex paial seizure is a type of seizure that arises in one lobe of the brain, rather than the whole brain. The seizure affects people&;s awareness and may cause them to lose consciousness . A complex paial seizure stas focally within the brain and causes impairment of consciousness. This definition is based on both clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. A complex paial seizure is most commonly a manifestation of temporal lobe epilepsy, but the term is so broadly defined (le, as any focal seizure with Impairment of consciousness) that it is very nonspecific. For this reason, many clinicians make a point of distinguishing between temporal and extratemporal complex paial seizures. Complex paial seizures are paial seizures that are associated with an alteration of consciousness ( Complex-Paial Seizures with Automatisms). The term psychomotor describes a paicular semiology characterized by automatisms and impairment of consciousness, usually of temporal lobe origin. Automatisms: Automatisms are nonpurposeful, stereotyped, and repetitive behaviors that commonly accompany complex paial seizures (In the sem lologic classification, they define automotor seizures). The behavior Is Inappropriate for the situation. Verbal automatisms range from simple vocalizations, such as moaning, to more complex, comprehensible, stereotyped speech. The most common automatisms, at least In temporal lobe epilepsy, are oral (eg, lip smacking, chewing, swallowing) and manual (eg, picking. fumbling, patting). Unilateral manual automatisms accompanied by contralateral arm dystonia usually Indicates seizure onset from the cerebral hemisphere !psilateral to the manual automatisms. Automatisms can also be more elaborate, coordinated movements Involving bilateral extremities. Bizarre automatisms, such as alternating limb movements, right-to-left head rolling, or sexual automatisms, may occur with frontal lobe seizures. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",B

Ideally the obstetrician suctions the mouth, nose, and hypopharynx immediately after delivery of the infant's head but before delivery of the reminder of the body. If the infant's heart rate is more than 100 beats per minute and respirations are unlabored, routine neonatal management is appropriate.

Cervical length considered as cut off for preterm labour is?,1.0 cm,1.5 cm,2.5 cm,3.5 cm,"REF: Manual Of Obstretics 3rd ed by Daftary page 250, Textbook of Basic Nursing by Caroline Bunker Rosdahl, Mary T. Kowalski 9th ed page 906 ""At the time of onset of labour the cervix is 1-2 cm in length"" The traditional criteria of onset of labour is persistent uterine contraction accompanied by effacement of cervix or dilatation of cervix or both, are reasonably accurate when frequency is 6 or more contractions per hour, cervical dilatation is 3 cm or more, effacement is 80% or more and membrane ruptures or bleeding occurs. EFFACEMENT OF CERVIX: Effacement or taking up is a process by which the cervix is thinned out and gradually pulled up to be incorporated in the lower segment, thereby causing shortening of the cervical length on vaginal examination. The cervix dilates from above downwards, becoming shorter until only the external os remains as a rim. The cervical projection can no longer be felt. The effacement is caused by the contraction and retraction of the upper uterine segment Normally in a primigravida the effacement precedes cervical dilatation, but in most multigravida both occurs at the same time. The cervix is thus significantly effaced before the onset of labour, particularly in nulliparous. Prior to the onset of labour, the cervix is approximately 4 cm long by digital examination. As the cervix shortens with labour, the effacement is described as a percentage of the remaining length. So if the cervix shortens from 4 cm to 3 cm it is 25% effaced, 2 cm is 50% effaced, 100% or completely effaced cervix is paper thin. When the cervix is 100 percent effaced and 10 cm dilated, the first stage of labor is said to be complete",C

C. Mild proteinuria, high hematuria, high ASO titreAcute glomerulonephritis is a disease characterized by the sudden appearance of edema, hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. It is a representative disease of acute nephritic syndrome in which inflammation of the glomerulus is manifested by proliferation of cellular elements secondary to an immunologic mechanism. Most commonly it results due to a preceding infection (hence PIGN). Most common organism implicated being streptococcal hence (PSGN)Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) results from an antecedent infection of the skin (impetigo) or throat (pharyngitis) caused by nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci. The disease is most common in children 4-12 years of age and rare before 2 years of age or in those individuals older than 18 years. The latency period from infection may vary from 1 to 2 weeks after pharyngitis to 3 to 6 weeks after skin infections. The classic triad of gross hematuria, edema, and hypertension are the most common presenting symptoms. Hematuria is almost a universal finding with about one third of patients having gross hematuria. The dark urine is due to the oxidation of hemoglobin that turns brown after a prolonged time in an acidic environment. Gross hematuria may last up to 10 days and recur after a febrile illness. Recent poststreptococcal infection is most commonly demonstrated by serologic markers for elevated antibodies to extracellular streptococcal antigens.",C

Uterine atony - ""Tone"": Atony is by far the most common cause of postpaum hemorrhage. Uterine contraction is essential for appropriate hemostasis, and disruption of this process can lead to significant bleeding. Uterine atony is the typical cause of postpaum hemorrhage that occurs in the first 4 hours after delivery. Risk factors for atony include the following: Overdistended uterus (e.g., multiple gestation, fetal macrosomia, polyhydramnios) Fatigued uterus (e.g., augmented or prolonged labor, amnionitis, use of uterine tocolytics such as magnesium or calcium channel blockers) Obstructed uterus (e.g., retained placenta or fetal pas, placenta accreta, or an overly distended bladder) Trauma to the genital tract accounts for 20% of cases",B

Which type of shift in intracranial content is common in children with progressive hydrocephalus,Transforaminal herniatation,Upward cerebellar herniation,Unilateral transtentorial herniation,Central transtentorial herniation,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This excessive accumulation results in an abnormal dilation of the spaces in the brain called ventricles. Increased pressure in the posterior fossa forces the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. These will compress the lower pa of the brain stem and upper cervical cord, resulting in life-threatening consequences. It usually occurs along with ascending or descending transtentorial herniation.

"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she thinks that she may be pregnant. She missed her last two periods and feels ""different."" A urine pregnancy test is positive and an ltrasound reveals a 12-week fetus. The patient is very concerned because she received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine four months ago and was told to wait 3 months before attempting conception. The pregnancy is desired. The patient asks if she should have a termination of pregnancy because she was vaccinated sholy before becoming pregnant. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?",There is no vaccine risk and termination is completely inappropriate,The vaccine risk is low and is not in itself a reason to terminate,The vaccine risk is moderate and termination should be considered,The vaccine risk is high and termination should be strongly considered,"Women that acquire rubella during pregnancy are at risk of developing fetal infection and congenital rubella syndrome. If the mother is infected during the first trimester the malformation rate in the fetus is approximately 50%.

Therefore, all women need to be vaccinated with the rubella vaccine-most often given as pa of the MMR series of vaccines. However, because the MMR vaccine is a live-virus vaccine, there is a concern that administration Of the vaccine within 3 months of conception, or during the pregnancy, could result in bih defects or illness. Yet, this concern is more theoretical than real as studies performed on women given the rubella vaccine sholy before becoming pregnant or during pregnancy have failed to show any increase in the risk of malformations compared to the general background risk in the population. To state that there is no vaccine risk and termination is completely inappropriate (choice A) is incorrect. Although the risk of the MMR vaccine appears more theoretical than real, one cannot state that there is no risk. To state that the vaccine risk is moderate and termination should be considered (choice C) or that the vaccine risk is high and termination should be strongly considered (choice D) is incorrect.

A young child with recurrent bacterial meningitis should be clinically evaluated for the presence of,Holoprosencephaly,Hypoplastic left hea syndrome,Spina bifida occulta with a dermal sinus tract,Syringomyelia of the lower cervical cord,"Spina bifida is a general term that refers to the abnormal fusion of the veebral arches of the lowest veebrae, usually in the sacrolumbar region. There are several disorders in this group of developmental abnormalities that have varying degrees of severity. Spina bifida occult is the mildest form and is characterized by failure of veebral fusion only. The spinal cord and meninges are normal. In spina bifida occult the defect in the closure of the neural tube is covered by skin and dermis, with only a pinpoint sinus or hair-covered depression marking the site. Bacterial meningitis, or meningomyelitis, is the major potential risk in these patients. The remaining types of spina bifida are classified as spina bifida cystic. Spina bifida with a meningocele is characterized by protrusion through the veebral defect of a meningeal sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because the cord is in its normal location, there are minimal neurologic deficits. Next in severity is spina bifida with a myelomeningocele, which is characterized by herniation of the cord and a meningeal sac through the veebral defect. This abnormality is often associated with severe neurologic defects in the lower extremities, bladder, and rectum. The most severe form of spina bifida, spina bifida apea or myeloschisis, results from complete failure of fusion of the caudal end of the neural plate, which lies open on the skin surface. This abnormality also results in severe neurologic defects in the legs, bladder, and rectum. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

As labor progresses, sinciput and brow presentations almost always convert into vertex or face presentations by neck flexion or extension, respectively.# Face presentation: Much less commonly, the fetal neck may be sharply extended so that the occiput and back come in contact, and the face is foremost in the birth canal, giving it the face presentation.",B
"A 25-year-old G1P0 woman delivers a 4000 g infant, and encounters a shoulder dystocia. Which of the following is a risk factor for this condition",Fetal hydrocephalus,Fetal prematurity,Precipitous (fast) labor,Maternal gestational diabetes,"Gestational diabetes is a risk factor because the fetal shoulders and abdomen are dispropoionately bigger than the head, therefore the head may pass through with no problems, yet it is quite difficult to deliver the anterior shoulder since it is lodged behind the maternal symphysis pubis. The McRobes maneuver and application of suprapubic pressure are two techniques that attempt to relieve the impaction of the anterior shoulder. Unlike gestational diabetes, the complication with hydrocephalus is that the fetal head is greater than the body. The head itself may have a difficult time passing through the pelvis, but if it does pass, the shoulders would have no problem passing through since their width would be smaller than the width of the fetal head. The pre-mature fetus typically has a well-propoioned body, but is overall smaller in size than the average-sized baby. No pa of a premature fetus body should typically get impacted anywhere along the bih canal. With precipitous labor, there is a decreased chance that a shoulder dystocia will occur, whereas a prolonged second stage of labor should raise suspicion that a dystocia is present.",D

Best test for estimating hCG:,Radio immunoassay,ELISA,Radio receptor assay,Bioassay,"Before answering this questions, let us first understand what is bioassay, immunoassay and Radioimmunoassay

Bioassay – A Bioassay is a test that uses animals or live tissues to look for a response to the hormone that is injected.
Immunoassay – An Immunoassay is a test that uses antibodies detected against the hormone to “capture” the hormone. The test uses materials or substances that are related to or are a part of the immune system. To perform an immunoassay, cells are introduced from the immune system which may or may not have an antibody and cell clumping is observed.
Radioimmunoassay – An radioimmunoassay uses a radioisotope as the label to detect and measure the amount of hormone present in the sample.

Bioassay for detecting hCG was developed in 1930’s. wherein samples were injected in rabbits, frogs etc and ovulation was observed. These tests were expensive, slow and insensitive for hCG as they couldnot differentiate between LH and hCG.
Bioassay for hCG is an outdated test these days.
ELISA – It consists of immunosorbent assay of monocional antibodies to detect B-hCG. It forms the bases of home pregnancy tests. This is more sensitive and specific and can detect hCG in serum upto 1-2 mIU/ml. Radioimmunoassay and Radio receptor assay are more sensitive than ELISA and detect hCG Gupto .002 mLU/ml in serum (RIA) or .05 mLU/ml (IRMA)
But between the two, Radioimmunoassay is more specific as it doesnot cross react with luteinizing hormone and is the best test for detecting B-hCG
“Radioreceptor assays are more sensitive, but not much used as there is cross reactivity with LH.”",A
All of the following are features of mullerian agenesis except :,46 XX karyotype,Normal breast development,Absent vagina,Ovarian agenesis,"Ans:D.)Ovarian agenesis Mullerian agenesis It is Mayer Rokitansky-Kuster Hauser syndrome. . Mullerian agenesis is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the Mullerian duct to develop, resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia of its upper poion. Mullerian agenesis (including absence of the uterus, cervix and/or vagina) is the cause in 15% of cases of primary amenorrhoea. Because ovaries do not develop from the Mullerian ducts, affected women might have normal secondary sexual characteristics but are infeile due to the lack of a functional uterus. Signs and Symptoms: An individual with this condition is hormonally normal; that is, the person will enter pubey with development of secondary sexual characteristics including thelarche and adrenarche (pubic hair). The person's chromosome constellation will be 46,XX. At least one ovary is intact, if not both, and ovulation usually occurs. Typically, the vagina is shoened and intercourse may, in some cases, be difficult and painful. Medical examination suppoed by gynecologic ultrasonography demonstrates a complete or paial absence of the cervix, uterus, and vagina. Classification: Typical MRKH - Isolated uterovaginal aplasia/hypoplasia Prevalence - 64 percent Atypical MRKH - Uterovaginal aplasia/hypoplasia with renal malformation or uterovaginal aplasia/hypoplasia with ovarian dysfunction Prevalence - 24 percent MURCS syndrome - Uterovaginal aplasia/hypoplasia with renal malformation, skeletal malformation, and cardiac malformation Prevalence - 12 percent",D

Causes of hyperprolactinemia are Pregnancy and lactation Drugs: dopamine antagonists, MAO inhibitors, cimetidine etc Pituitary tumours Hypothyroidism Renal and hepatic disorders Now since the patient also has presented with weight loss, it points towards a pituitary tumor Hypothyroidism can cause amenorrhea but it is usually associated with weight gain. Anorexia nervosa is psychogenic weight loss and may present with amenorrhea. However, pituitary tumors and craniopharyngiomas can cause increase in PRL and consequent galactorrhea with amenorrhea and the weight loss is attributed then to the malignant process.",A
The organism contributing to vaginal defence mechanism is _________,Doderlein's bacillus,Staphylococcus,Streptococcus,Treponema pallidum,The organism contributing to vaginal defence mechanism is Doderlein&;s bacillus. Doderlein&;s bacillus is a gram positive rod shaped bacillus which grows anaerobically in acidic media. It appears in vagina 3-4 days after bih and disappears after 10-14 days. It appears again at pubey and disappears after menopause. Its presence is dependent on estrogen Its function is to conve glycogen to lactic acid and maintains acidic pH in vagina thus preventing growth of pathogenic bacteria.

Although the incidence of ectopic pregnancies with an IUD was at one time thought to be increased, it is now recognized that in fact the overall incidence is unchanged. The apparent increase is the result of the dramatic decrease in intrauterine implantation without affecting ectopic implantation. Thus, while the overall probability of pregnancy is dramatically decreased, when a pregnancy does occur with an IUD in place, there is a higher probability that it will be an ectopic one. With this in mind, in the absence of signs and symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, especially after ultrasound documentation of an intrauterine pregnancy, laparoscopy is not indicated. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy, in which intrauterine and extrauterine implantation occur, is no higher than approximately 1 in 2500 pregnancies.",C

• Rare, self-limiting process.
• Also called irregular shedding.
• It is due to persistent corpus luteum due to incomplete withdrawl of LH even on 26 day of cycle. The CL continues to secret progesterone
• Menstruation comes on time, is prolonged but not heavy. Slight bleeding continues intermittently for several days after proper flow.
• D & C done on 5-6th of cycle - endometrial tissue shows presence of progestational changes (proliferative endometrium) along with secretory endometrium.
Pregnanediol is found in urine during menstruation.
• Treatment - spontaneous cure or NSAIDs for 6 months.
Also know-Irregular ripening of corpus luteum
• It is due to poor formation and function of corpus luteum.
• The endometrium is without adequate hormonal support, so slight losses or spotting occur for many days before the proper flow starts.
Diagnosis: 
• Serum progesterone <5 ng/mL (or urinary pregnanediol <3 mg) in luteal phase.
• Endometrial study prior to or soon after spotting reveals patchy areas of secretory changes amidst proliferative endometrium.
Management: Administration of progestogens in premenstrual phase.",A

Leukodystrophies affect the growth and/or development of myelin, the fatty covering which acts as an insulator around nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. It involves sulfatide accumulation.> Like many other genetic disorders that affect lipid metabolism, there are several forms of MLD, which are late infantile, juvenile, arid adult.> Children with the juvenile form of MLD (onset between 3-10 years of age) usually begin with impaired school performance, mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression.> Age of death is variable, but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some juveniles can live for several decades or longer after onset.> Tay-Sachs disease (abbreviated TSD, also known as GM2 gangliosidosis or Hexosaminidase A deficiency) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder.> In its most common variant, known as infantile Tay-Sachs disease, it causes a relentless deterioration of mental and physical abilities that commences around six months of age and usually results in death by the age of four.> Fabry disease (also known as Fabry's disease, Anderson.> Fabry disease, angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) is a rare X-linked recessive (inherited) lysosomal storage disease, which can cause a wide range of systemic symptoms.Full body or localized pain to the extremities (known as acroparesthesia) or Gl tract is common in patients with Fabry disease.Kidney complications are a common and serious effect of the disease; renal insufficiency and renal failure may worsen throughout life.> Cardiac complications occur when glycolipids build up in different heart cells; heart related effects worsen with age and may lead to increased risk of heart disease.> Hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiomyopathy are commonly observed.mental retardation is rare presentation",D

All are true in pregnancy with epilepsy except:,Seizure risk is decreased by 30%,Valproate causes adverse fetal outcomes,AED causes malformations in 15% cases,Monotherapy is better,"Ans. is a, i.e. Seizure risk is decreased by 30%In pregnancy the seizure risk increases and does not decrease, hence our answer is but obvious.Now here I want to tell you about antiepileptic drugs and malformations associated with them.Anti epileptic drugs and malformations:In Women with epilepsy not exposed to Anti epileptic drugs (AEDs), the incidence of major congenital malformations is similar to the background risk for the general population. A prospective Finnish population-based study reported a 2.8% (26/939) rate of congenital malformations in the offspring of Women with epilepsy who were not taking AEDs in the first trimester.In Women with epilepsy who are taking AEDs, the risk of major congenital malformation to the fetus is dependent on the type, number and dose of AED. Among AEDs, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine monotherapy at lower doses have the least risk of major congenital malformation in the offspring.The most common major congenital malformations associated with AEDs are neural tube defects, congenital heart disorders, urinary tract and skeletal abnormalities and cleft palate. Risk of major malformations is 3-5%.A milder form of malformations may be present in 8-15% cases.Sodium valproate is associated with neural tube defects, facial cleft and hypospadias; phenobarbital and phenytoin with cardiac malformations; and phenytoin and carbamazepine with cleft palate in the fetus.A systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 studies provided estimates of incidence of congenital malformation in fetuses born to women taking various AEDs.The risk was highest for women taking sodium valproate (10.7 per 100, 95% Cl 8.16-13.29) or AED polytherapy (16.8 per 100, 95% Cl 0.51-33.05) compared with the 2.3 per 100 (95% Cl 1.46-3.1) observed in mothers without epilepsy.Data from the EURAP study group 13 suggest that the lowest rates of malformation were observed in women exposed to less than 300 mg per day of lamotrigine (2 per 100, 95% Cl 1.19-3.24) and to less than 400 mg per day of carbamazepine (3.4 per 100, 95% Cl 1.11-7.71).",A

"Group B streptococcal infection, prophylactic screening in pregnancy is done in",All cases,All cases in 23-27 weeks,All cases in 35-37 weeks,All cases of vaginitis,"(All cases 35-37 weeks) (Internet)Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacterial infection that can be found in a pregnant woman's vagina or rectum. This bacteria is normally found in the vagina and/or rectum of about 25 % of all healthy, adult women.Routine screening for vaginal strep B for all pregnant women is recommended. This screening is performed between the 35th and 37th week of pregnancy (studies show that testing done within 5 weeks of delivery is the most accurate at predicting the GBS status at time of birth.)The test involves a swab of both the vagina and the rectum. The sample is then taken to a lab where a culture is analyzed for any presence of GBS. Test results are usually available within 24 to 48 hours.Not every baby who is bom to a mother who tests positive for GBS will become ill. There are, however, symptoms that may indicate that patient are at a higher risk of delivering a baby with GBS.These symptoms include:* Labor or rupture of membrane before 37 weeks* Rupture of membrane 18 hours or more before delivery* Fever during labor* A urinary tract infection as a result of GBS during your pregnancy* A previous baby with GBS diseaseIf patient test positive for GBS and meet the high risk criteria, then it will require antibiotics through IV during delivery to prevent baby from becoming ill.

True about coarctation of aorta –,Most common site is distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery,Most common age of presentation is at 15–20 years,Upper rib notching is due to erosion by dilated collateral vessels,Right ventricular hypertrophy,"Most common site of COA is distal to the origin of left subclavian artery.
Hemodynamics of COA during fetal life 

In fetal life, blood from right ventricle passes to pulmonary artery and then to descending aorta through ductus arteriosus.
Blood from left ventricle passes to Aorta and then to innominate, left carotid and left subclavian artery.
If constriction (coarctation) is proximal to ductus arteriosus (preductal or infantile coarctation), there is no obstruction to flow because constriction is not obstructing the flow of upper limb and lower limb --> Collaterals are not formed.
If the constriction is distal to ductus arteriosus (post ductal or adult type coarctation of aorta), it causes obstruction of flow of desending aorta, and parts of body that are supplied by descending aorta, have impaired circulation —> This stimulates formation of collaterals in fetal life.

Hemodynamics after birth 

After birth, ductus arteriosus closes, so that blood flow to descending aorta from right ventricle does not occur and descending aorta must receive its total supply from left ventricle via ascending aorta.
But there is obstruction due to coarctation.
In preductal coarctation, there are no collaterals Neonates become symptomatic immediatly --> Hypertension results in CHF.
In postductal coarctation, due to presence of collaterals neonates are spared from developing hypertension & CHF.
Due to obstruction, there is pressure overload to left ventricle -4 Left ventricular hypertrophy.",A

Indicators of impending uterine rupture durine labour include all of the following except :,Fetal distress,Hematuria,Fresh bleeding per vaginum,Passage of meconium,"Ans. is d i.e. Passage of meconium Features of Rupture uterus Impending rupture : Abdominal pain Slight vaginal bleeding Fetal distress as evidenced by abnormal FHR, bradycardia and variable and late declerations. Tenderness in uterine palpation Complete rupture : Sense of something giving away Collapse, shock, dehydration Absent FHS Palpation of superficial pas Shoening of cord immediately following a difficult vaginal delivery is pathognomonic of uterine rupture. So it is clear that fetal distress and vaginal bleeding may be seen in impending uterine rupture. Now we are left with 2 options: Hematuria and passage of meconium ""There are no reliable signs of impending uterine rupture that occurs hpfnre labor, although the sudden appearance of gross hematuria is suggestive"" ...COGDT 10/e p 340. Thus. hematuria can be seen in impending rupture. Though some of you may argue that passage of meconium is a sign of fetal distress, it should not be ruled out but here I would like to say--lets think as a clinician if we have a patient with previous LSCS in whom there is passage of meconium, obviously it will not mean that patient is going to have impending rupture. it means the fetus is in distress which can be due to any reason. Also remember: Spontaneous rupture of uterus during pregnancy occurs in upper segment. Spontaneous non obstructive rupture during labour occurs in upper segment - Fundus. Spontaneous obstructive rupture during labour occurs in lower segment. Most common sign of uterine rupture is non reassuring FHR pattern with variable hea rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations.

Patient diagnosed as squamous cell intraepithelial lesion which of the following has the highest risk for progression to carcinoma :,Low grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia,High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia,Squamous intraepithelial associated with HPV 16,Squamous intraepithelial neoplasia associated with HIV,"Ans. is b i.e. High grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia There are various nomenclatures / classification systems for repoing of Pap smear. The one which is classically used is by WHO, which uses the terms CIN-I, CIN-II and CIN-III (as discussed in chapter on CIN). Another system is devised Bethesda. It classifies cytological abnormalities of premalignant leisons into three categories : Atypical squmous cells of undetermined signifcance (ASCUS). Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance : The most common cytologic abnormality is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). which indicates cells that are suggestive of, but do not fulfill the criteria for, SIL. The risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-III approximates only 5% and cancer is found in only 1 to 2 per thousands instances. The evaluation of ASC-US should not be overly aggressive, paicularly in adolescents who are at low risk of cervical cancer. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, 2006a: Moscicki, 2005). There are three options for evaluation of ASC-US - HPV DNA testing. Colposcopy. or Repeat cytologies at 6 and 12 months, with referral to colposcopy if either of these is abnormal. Low-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion : This cytology result indicates the likely presence of HPV infection or low-grade neoplasia. Low-grade SIL encompasses the cytologic features of HPV infection and CIN-I and carries a 15 to 30 percent risk of progression to CIN-II or CIN-Ill. Therefore, colposocpy is indicated for most. High-Grade Squamous Intraepiethelial Lesion and Glandular Abnormalities : High grade SIL, should all be evaluated by prompt colposcopic evaluation. High-grade SIL cytology encompasses features of CIN-II and CIN-III and carries a high risk of underlying histologic CIN-II or CIN-Ill (at least 70%). or invasive cancer (1 to 2%). Alternative management of HSIL cytology in women age 21 years and older includes immediate diagnostic loop excision because colposcopy may miss a high-grade lesion and most HSIL cytologies evenatually result in excision for diagnosis or treatment.",B

Shortest anteroposterior diameter of pelvic inlet is,Obstetric conjugate,Diagonal conjugate,Anatomic conjugate,All are equal,"Pelvic Inlet

Also called the superior strait
Pelvic inlet is also the superior plane of the true pelvis
Bounded posteriorly by the promontory and alae of the sacrum, laterally by the linea terminalis, and anteriorly by the horizontal pubic rami and the symphysis pubis
During labour, fetal head engagement is defined by the fetal head’s biparietal diameter passing through this plane
Four diameters of the pelvic inlet are usually described: anteroposterior, transverse, and two oblique diameters
Distinct anteroposterior diameters have been described using specific landmarks


Most cephalad, the anteroposterior diameter, termed the true conjugate, extends from the uppermost margin of the symphysis pubis to the sacral promontory
The clinically important obstetrical conjugate is the shortest distance between the sacral promontory and the symphysis pubis. Normally, this measures 10 cm or more, but it cannot be measured directly with examining fingers. Thus, for clinical purposes, the obstetrical conjugate is estimated indirectly by subtracting 1.5 to 2 cm from the diagonal conjugate, which is determined by measuring the distance from the lowest  margin of the symphysis to the sacral promontory

"If baby of XX or XY genotype has normal internal gonads but ambiguous external genitalia, it is called as?",Pseudohermaphrodite,True hermaphrodite,Undetermined Intersex,Any of the above,"Ans. A. Pseudohermaphrodite. (Ref Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics . 19th ed. chap 582)Persons with intersex states can be classified as a true hermaphrodite, a female pseudohermaphrodite, or a male pseudoher- maphrodite. This is determined by examining the internal and external structures of the child.True hermaphrodites are bom with both ovaries and testicles. They also have mixed male and female external genitals. This condition is extremely rare.In the female pseudohermaphrodite. the genotype is 46,XX, and the gonads are ovaries, but the external genitalia are virilized. In the male pseudohermaphrodite, the genotype is 46,XY, and the external genitalia are undervirilized.Intersex can be divided into four categories:# 46, XX Intersex# 46, XY Intersex# True Gonadal Intersex# Complex or Undetermined Intersex46. XX Intersex . The person has the chromosomes of a woman, the ovaries of a woman, but external (outside) genitals that appear male. This usually is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia (""lips"" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse, and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. Usually this person has a normal uterus and Fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46, XX with virilization. It used to be called female pseudohermaphroditism. There are several possible causes:Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (the most common cause).Male hormones (such as testosterone) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy.Male hormone-producing tumors in the mother. These are most -often ovarian tumors. Mothers who have children with 46, XX intersex should be checked unless there is another clear cause.Aromatase deficiency. This one may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little to 46, XX intersex. At puberty these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics. 46. XY Intersex. The person has the chromosomes of a man, but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous, or clearly female. Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46, XY with undervirilization. It used to be called male pseudohermaphroditism. Forming normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones; therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46, XY intersex has many possible causes:# Problems with the testes and testetosterone production. The testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.# Problems with using testosterone. Some people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY intersex.# 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. People with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least five different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty.# Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). This is the most common cause of 46, XY intersex. Here the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. There are over 150 different defects that have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS. AIS has also been called testicular feminization.True Gonadal Intersex . Here the person must have both ovarian and testicular tissue. This might be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have one ovary and one testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. This condition used to be called true hermaphroditism. In most people with true gonadal intersex, the underlying cause is unknown, although in some animal studies it has been linked to exposure to common agricultural pesticides.Complex or Undetermined Intersex Disorders of Sexual Development. Many chromosome configurations other than simple 46, XX or 46, XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45, XO (only one X chromosome), and 47, XXY, 47, XXX -- both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in an intersex condition where there is discrepancy between internal and external genitalia. However, there may be problems with sex hormone levels, overall sexual development, and altered numbers of sex chromosomes.",A

Additional symptoms which may be reported in common with other forms of cholestasis are right upper quadrant pain, pale stools and dark urine.Changes in liver function in obstetric cholestasisThe most common abnormalities in liver function are:Increase in ALT (seen in 100% cases)Increase in AST (seen in 99% cases)Increase in bile acids (seen in 92%) cases)Elevated bilirubin (22%) of cases)Increased GGT (39% cases)Elevations in alkaline phosphatase are seen in cholestatic disease such as obstetric cholestasis as it is released from the damaged liver but because the enzyme is also released from the placenta in normal pregnancies, measurements are less helpful than outside the pregnancy.Serum bile acid test is the most accurate determinant of cholestasis of pregnancy.The problem with the bile acid test is that only a small number of labs around the world have the equipment necessary to perform it which can result in a considerable delay for women experiencing symptoms of the conditions.Liver biopsy in a case of obstetric cholestasis: -Liver biopsy demonstrates: -Acinar cholestasis with centrilobular bile staining and bile plugs in the canaliculi.Liver biopsy is the definitive diagnostic test of the disease.Postnatal course in obstetric cholestasisBiochemical abnormalities and pruritics in obsteric cholestasis persists until delivery following which resolution occurs.Pruritus is typically absent within 48 hour after delivery usually improved within 1 week.Liver function tests becomes normal within 6 weeks.Complications of obstetric cholestasisMeconium stained liquorPremature deliveryFetal distressPost-partum hemorrhageTreatment of obstetric cholestasis: -AntihistaminesChlorpheniramine can provide symptomatic relief in pruritus.Topical treatmentsIf the skin is well moisturized pruritus may be relieved.Ursodeoxycholic acidS-Adenosyl methionineDexamethasoneDexamethasone in high dose results in resolution of all pruritus cases and significant reduction in total bile acids and ALT.Vitamin KIn obstetric cholestasis there is malabsorption and subsequent deficiency of vitamin K.

Coalescence of these spaces forms the antrum, and the follicle is termed a secondary (vesicular, Graafian) follicle.|Initially, the antrum is crescent shaped, but with time, it enlarges. Granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte remain intact and form the cumulus oophorus. At maturity, the secondary follicle may be 25 mm or more in diameter. It is surrounded by the theca interna.|With each ovarian cycle, a number of follicles begin to develop, but usually only one reaches full maturity. The others degenerate and become atretic.

Which of the following strategy has been recommended to reduce the heredity risk for ovarian cancer in women with BRCA - 1 and BRCA - 2 mutations:,Use of oral contraceptive pills,Screening with transvaginal ultrasound,Screening with CA - 125,Prophylactic oophorectomy,"As discussed in previous question:
• BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are tumour suppressor genes.
• Individuals who inherit mutations of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 are highly susceptible for the development of hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. The mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant.
Strategies for prevention of hereditary ovarian cancer
• Genetic testing for susceptibility to ovarian cancer is rapidly becoming integrated into the clinical practice of oncology.
Strategies have been adopted to reduce the incidence of ovarian cancer in patient with BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations.
a. Prophylactic oophorectomy:
“The only proven way to prevent ovarian cancer is surgical oophorectomy. As another possible site of disease among these high risk patients is fallopian tube therefore should be removed. IN BRCA 1 or BRCA-2 mutation carriers, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BS0) may be performed on either completion of childbearing or at age 35. In these patients, the procedure is approximately 90% effective in preventing epithelial ovarian cancer. In women with HNPCC, the risk reduction approaches 100%.”
• Additional benefit of prophylactic oophorectomy is that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 50-80%.
b. Oral contraceptive pills:
• Data received from a multicenter control of genetic screening centers indicates that the use of oral contraceptive pill is associated with 50% decreased risk for developing ovarian cancer in women who have mutation in either in BRCA - 1 or BRCA - 2. However there is short term increased risk of developing breast cancer.
c. Role of screening with CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasound:
“In BRCA1- BRCA2 mutation carriers who donot wish to undergo prophylactic surgery a combination of through pelvic examination, transvaginal sonographic examination and CA125 blood testing should be done”.
• Best method of prevention: Prophylactic hysterectomy and BSO at 35 years or as soon as family is complete.
• 2nd line: OCP’s + screening
• Screening: TVS + Ca 125 started at 35 years and done every 6 or 12 months, breast screening by MRI and mamography at 30 years done annually.",D

Laboratory Testing In addition to a pregnancy test, laboratory testing should include a complete blood count with platelets, coagulation studies, and bleeding time. Thyroid studies also may be appropriate. A complete pelvic examination is appropriate if the patient has been sexually active, is having severe pain, or an anomaly is suspected. Cultures for gonorrhea and testing for chlamydia infection are appropriate if the patient has been sexually active. Some young teens who have a history that is classic for anovulation, who deny sexual activity, and who agree to return for follow-up evaluation may be managed with a limited gynecologic examination and pelvic ultrasonography Imaging Studies If the pregnancy test is positive, pelvic imaging using ultrasonography may be necessary to confirm a ble intrauterine pregnancy and rule out a spontaneous aboion or ectopic pregnancy. If a pelvic mass is suspected on examination, or if the examination is inadequate (more likely to be the case in an adolescent than an older woman) and additional information is required, pelvic ultrasonography may be helpful Management Management of bleeding abnormalities related to pregnancy, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic abnormalities, hematologic abnormalities, or androgen excess syndromes should be directed to treating the underlying condition. Oral contraceptives can be extremely helpful in managing androgen excess syndromes. After specific diagnoses have been ruled out by appropriate laboratory testing, anovulation or dysfunctional bleeding becomes the diagnosis of exclusion.",B

"In the mother, suckling leads to which of the following responses?",Decrease of oxytocin,Increase of prolactin-inhibiting factor,Increase of hypothalamic dopamine,Increase of hypothalamic prolactin,"The normal sequence of events triggered by suckling is as follows: through a response of the central nervous system, dopamine is decreased in the hypothalamus. Dopamine suppression decreases production of prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF), which normally travels through a portal system to the pituitary gland; because PIF production is decreased, production of prolactin by the pituitary is increased. At this time, the pituitary also releases oxytocin, which causes milk to be expressed from the alveoli into the lactiferous ducts. Suckling suppresses the production of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor and, as a result, acts as a mild contraceptive (because the midcycle surge of luteinizing hormone does not occur).",D

Delivery of the first baby before the age of 20 years. Multiparity with poor bih spacing between pregnancies. Poor personal hygiene. Carcinoma of the cervix shares similar epidemiological features to those of sexually transmitted diseases and viral infections and these are strongly linked to cancer cervix as causative agents. Poor socioeconomic status. At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised paners was considered an impoant factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives. Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13-fold). Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33) and condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is now considered the most impoant oncogenic cause. Most HPV infection 16, 18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases.Before the age of 30 years, 90% women with intact immune system are able to get rid of HPV infections. 10% with persistent infection after the age of 30 years tend to progress to CIN or invasive cancer. Immunosuppressed individuals (following transplant surgery), viral infections and HIV. Women with pre-invasive lesions. Women who do not come for regular health check-up and Pap tests. COC and progestogens use over 8-year periods can cause adenocarcinoma of the endocervix (double the risk). Five per cent women exposed to diethylstilboestrol in utero developed carcinoma of vagina and cervix. With withdrawal of this hormone, its incidence has dropped.

False about paial mole,Caused by triploidy,Can be diagnosed very early by USG,Can present as missed aboion,Rarely causes persistent GTD,"Ans. is b i.e. can be diagnosed very early by USG Paial moles Paial moles or incomplete molar pregnancy means that along with the hydatidiform changes some element of fetal tissue is present They have a triploid karyotype (69 chromosomes)deg, the extra haploid set of chromosomes usually is derived from the fatherdeg. Characteristic pathological features of paial mole Chorionic villi of varying sizes with focal hydatiform swelling, cavitation and trophoblastic hyperplasia Marked villous scalloping Prominent stromal trophoblastic inclusions Identifiable embryonic or fetal tissue. Clinical features -- hey generally do not have the dramatic clinical features characteristic of complete pt general these patients have the signs and symptoms of incomplete or missed aboion, and paial mole can be diagnosed after histologic review of tissue obtained by curettage"". Features like hyperemesis, hypehyroidism and Theca lutein cysts are rare in paial mole. Prognosis ""The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease after a paial mole is substancially lower than following a complete molar pregnancy. Moreover, persistent disease is seldom a choriocarcinoma."" The risk of persistent trophoblastic disease in a case of paial mole is 1-5% wherease with complete mole, it is 15-20% Hence option d i.e. it rarely causes persistent trophoblatic disease is paially correct Diagnosis -- of paial mole by USG is not that easy as is in the case of complete mole because it does not give the characteristic vesicular & ultrasonographic appearance like a complete mole. ""Sonographic features of a paial mole include a thickened, hydropic placenta with fetal tissue. Impoantly, in early pregnancy, sonographv will demon t te the rho raeristic appearance in as few as third of women with a paial mole"" ... Williams Obs 23/ed pg-260 Hence Option b i.e. it can be diagnosed very early by USG is incorrect Remember - - The USG criteria for diagnosis of paial mole is Presence of focal cystic areas in the placental tissues . Increase in transverse diameter of gestational sac. The combination of above two criterias have a positive predictive value of 90% for paial moles . (This means USG can diagnose paial mole but not in early pregnancy) The nonble fetus associated with a triploid paial mole typically has multiple malformations, like syndactyly and hydrocephaly and have symmetrical growth retardation. 13 hcg levels > 200 m IU/rni, after evacuation of paial mole in the third through the eighth week are associated with a 35% risk of persistent trophoblastic disease. Extra edge The most significant recent development in the pathological analysis of H. mole is the use of P57kip2 immunostaining to make a definitive diagnosis of androgenetic complete H. Mole as opposed to an hydropic aboion or a paial mole. P57kip2 is a paternally imprinted gene. which is maternally expressed. The absence of maternal genes in androgenetic complete mole means that the gene cannot be expressed in a complete mole cytotrophoblast Hence V kip2 staining is negative in complete mole in contrast to paial moles, hydropic aboion & normal placenta. This technique is well validated, easy and inexpensive to perform.",B

"In a diagnosed case of IUGR, bih weight of the fetus can be increased by which of the following:",Cessation of smoking,Aspirin,Ca++ and vitamin D supplement,Bed rest in left lateral position,"Bed rest in left lateral position in all pregnancies and even with IUGR is proven to increase uterine perfusion, increase the fetal nutrition and consequently increase the fetal weight. The use of aspirin for IUGR is fairly common but has not been proven beyond doubt to be of use. Cessation of smoking will prevent an IUGR rather than increase fetal weight.

The protective effects of breast milk are known to be associated with -,IgM antibodies,Lysozyme,Mast cells,IgA antibodies,"Ans. is `d' i.e., IgA antibodies Although antibodies and Lysozyme, both are impoant for protective effects of breast milk, antibodies play the major role. Out of IgM and IgA antibodies, breast milk is especially rich in secretory IgA which is the single best answer here. Protective role of breastfeeding against infection o Breast milk provides protection against infection because of the following facts ? 1. The breast milk is clean and uncontaminated 2. Breast milk contains several antiinfective factors - i) Antibodies secretory IgA, IgM ii) Lysozyme iii) Antistaphylococcal factor iv) Specific inhibitory substances against viral infections. v) Lactoferrin --> Inhibits growth of E. coli. vi) Bile stimulated lipase --> kills entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. vii) Bifidus factor -4 Inhibits growth of E. coli viii) Para-amino-benzoic acid (PABA) -3 Provides protection against malaria ix) Phagocytic macrophages and lymphoid cells 3.

True statement regarding twin delivery is:,First twin has more chances of asphyxia,Second twin has more chances of developing polycythemia,Second twin has more chances of developing hyaline membrane disease.,Increased mortality in first twin.,"Twin pregnancy in general is associated with higher incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality.
Perinatal mortality in twins is 5 times greater than in singleton pregnancies.
Perinatal mortality in twins varies with birth order and the type of placentation.
 “Second twins do not do as well as the first twin…perinatal mortality being 9% for the first twin and 14% for the second twin”.

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 297

Also monochorionic—monoamniotic twins have a poor prognosis, perinatal mortality being 50%.
Now with this background lets see each option separately.

Option a: First twin has more chances of asphyxia—incorrect as:

“Asphyxia and stillbirth are more common (in twin pregnancy) due to increased prevalence of pre-eclampsia, malpresentations, placental abruption and increased operative interferences. The second baby is more atrisk.

Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 206
Option b: Second twin has more chances of developing polycythemia:

This statement can be true as second baby has more chances of asphyxia which can stimulate erythropoeisis in the second twin. Also there are chances of bleeding from the first twin into the second twin in case of monochorionic twins which can cause polycythemia.

Option c: Second twin has more chances of developing hyaline membrane disease—this is incorrect as is evident from the following lines of Williams:

“As measured by determination of the lecithin and sphingomyelin ratio, pulmonary maturation is usually synchronous in twins.”

Williams 23/e, p 880

Hence second twin does not have increased chances of developing hyaline membrane disease.
Coming to the last option—Increased mortality in first twin (option d)",B

Kliegman et al, pp 1274-1275. McMillan et al, pp 371-372. Rudolph et al, pp 1420-1421.) A history of nonbilious vomiting for 10 days in a child of this age who does not look ill points to infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis as the most likely diagnosis; surgical consultation for a likely pyloromyotomy is indicated. The ultrasound in the question demonstrates the thickened pylorus. The incidence of this condition in infants is between 1:200 and 1:750, with males affected more often than females. Although there is no specific pattern of inheritance, a familial incidence has been observed in about 15% of patients. Information about predisposing ancestry is conflicting, as are data concerning the assertion of a firstborn predilection. Metabolic alkalosis with low serum potassium and chloride levels is frequently seen in pyloric stenosis as a result of loss of gastric contents from vomiting. A child with a small-bowel obstruction (who may require an upper GI with small-bowel follow through to help diagnose the point of obstruction) should develop bilious emesis and should not look well 10 days into the illness; similarly, a child with intussusception (who requires an air contrast enema, which is both diagnostic and perhaps therapeutic) would be markedly ill at this point. Gastroenteritis (IV fluids alone to maintain hydration) does not usually last for 10 days. A brain tumor causing increased intracranial pressure could present with isolated emesis, but should show other symptoms such as irritability and somnolence.",A

Sperm capacitation takes place in -,Testes,Epididymis,Female genital tract,All of the above,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Female genital tract * After the ejaculation the sperm cells go through several essential physiological changes during their time in the female genital tract before they, at the end, are able to penetrate the oocyte membrane.* The first change in this cascade is capacitation. The sperm cells accomplish this during the ascension through the female genital tract (in contact with its secretions). It has to do with a physiological maturation process of the sperm cell membranes, which is seen as the precondition for the next step to follow, namely the acrosome reaction.* Capacitation is a functional maturation of the spermatozoon. The changes take place via the sperm cell membrane in which it may be that receptors are made available through the removal of a glycoprotein layer. The area of the acrosomal cap is also so altered thereby that the acrosome reaction becomes possible.* Through the membrane alterations, the motile properties of the spermatozoon also change. Discharging whipping movements of the tail together with larger sideways swinging movements of the head take place. This type of motility is designated as hyperactivity. One can therefore say that the visible consequences of capacitation consist in hyperactivity of the spermatozoon.",C

Antibodies → secretory IgA, IgM
Lysozyme
Antistaphylococcal factor
Specific inhibitory substances against viral infections.
Lactoferrin → Inhibits growth of E. coli.
Bile stimulated lipase → kills Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia.
Bifidus factor → Inhibits growth of E. coli

Early signs of the disorder include weight loss (up to 5% of body weight) and ketonuria. Because vomiting causes potassium loss, electrocardiographic evidence of potassium depletion, such as inverted T waves and prolonged QT and PR intervals, is usually a later finding. Jaundice also is a later finding and is probably due to fatty infiltration of the liver; occasionally, acute hepatic necrosis occurs. Metabolic acidosis is rare. Hypokalemic nephropathy with isosthenuria may occur late. Hypoproteinemia also may result, caused by poor diet as well as by albuminuria. Patients who have hyperemesis gravidarum are best treated (if the disease is early in its course) with parenteral fluids and electrolytes, sedation, rest, vitamins, and antiemetics if necessary. In some cases, isolation of the patient is necessary. Very slow reinstitution of oral feeding is permitted after dehydration and electrolyte disturbances are corrected.

The first step in the management of hirsutism due to stein leventhal syndrome is :,OCP,HMG,Spironolactone,Bromocriptine,"Ans. is a i.e. OCP Friends, all the options given in the question are used for treatment of PCOS but only OCP and spironolactone are used for managing hirsutism. The first step done in general practise in OPD's when a patient of PCOS comes is : Advise : Weight reduction. 'Weight reduction in obese patients is the initial recommendation because it reduces insulin, SHBG and androgen levels (mainly calculated or bioavailable testosterone) and may restore ovulation either alone or combined with ovulation induction agents."" Drug therapy If a patient has hirsutism primary goal is lowering androgen levels to halt futher conversion of vellus hairs to terminal ones. Drugs used are : i. OCP's ? ""Combination OC's decrease adrenal and ovarian steroid production and reduce hair growth in nearly two - third of hirsute patients."" ""Combined oral contraceptive - COC's are effective in establishing regular menses and lowering ovarian androgen production. As an additional effect, the estrogen component of these pills leads to increased SHBG levels. With higher SHBG levels, a greater amount of free testosterone is bound and thus becomes biologically unavailable at the hair follicle."" Gonadotropin releasing horomone agonists - ""GnRH agonists effectively lower Gonadotropin levels over time, and in turn subsequently lower androgen levels. Despite their effectiveness in treating hirsutism, administration of these agents is not a preferred long term treatment method due to associated bone loss. high cost and menopausal side effects."" iii Androgne receptor antagonists - like spirono lactone, cyproterone acetate and flut amide. These antiandrogens are competitive inhibitors of androgen binding to the androgen receptor. ""Although these agents are effective in the treatment of hirsutism, they carry a risk of several side effects. Metrorrhagia may frequently develop. In addition, as antiandrogens, these drugs bear a theoretical risk of pseudo hermaphroditism in male fetuses of women using such medication in early pregnancy. None of these antiandrogen agents are approved by the FDA for treatment of hyperandrogenism and thus are used off-label."" iv. 5 a reductase inhibitor : Conversion of testosterone to dihydro testosterone can be decreased by 5 a reductase inhibitor, Finasteride. It is modestly effective in treating hirsutism and similar to other antiandrogens the risk of male fetus teratogenecity is present. So, friends after such a detailed discussion on the management of hirsutism. You can very well understand that the first line therapy for management of hirsutism are combined oral contraceptive pills.

Which of the following is true about Constitutional Delay in growth?,Neonates with constitutional delay show anomalies at bih,IGF-1 levels are low for chronological age,Bone age is normal,IGF-1 levels are low for bone age,"Constitutional growth delay is a physiological variant of sho stature. Here children grow normally upto 6-12 months of life. Thereafter, there is deceleration such that the height and weight fall below the 3rd centile. By 3 yrs of age,normal height velocity is resumed and continues to grow below and parallel to the 3rd centile. Here pubey is delayed; And the bone age is consistent with the child&;s height age, but lower than the chronological age by 2-3 yrs , unlike in the familial sho stature.

All are true about septic shock in children except –,1st response is ↑ C.O. due to vasodilatation,Hypotension is a late sign,Heart rate remains same,↓ Peripheral vascular resistance,"Septic shock in children

Septic shock is an inflammatory state resulting from a systemic response to bacterial infection.
The decrease in peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) is the hallmark of early (hyper dynamic) stage of septic shock, this feature distinguishes it from other types of shock. Decreased peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) leads to a compensatory increase in cardiac output; therefore, cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite of shock.
Decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output lead to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissue. But, still, the tissues lack O2 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen. So, increased blood flow and cardiac out are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis.
As sepsis progresses, hypo dynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance.
So, hemodynamic changes in septic shock occur in two characteristic patterns, Early hyperdynamic and late hypo dynamic shock

1) Early hyperdynamic shock

Hypotension is a late feature of septic shock and early hyperdynamic stage is characterized by normal or increased BR
Other features are : -
Tachycardia

A premature infant born at 34 weeks presented with acute onset lethargy and cessation of feeding. The imaging modality of choice to screen for intraventricular haemorrhage is,NCCT,Transcranial USG,MRI,Plain radiograph,"Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a major complication of prematurity. IVH typically initiates in the germinal matrix, which is a richly vascularized collection of neuronal-glial precursor cells in the developing brain. The etiology of IVH is multifactorial and is primarily attributed to the intrinsic fragility of the germinal matrix vasculature and the disturbance in the cerebral blood flow. While this review broadly describes the mechanism underlying IVH, the main focus is on the recent development in molecular mechanisms that elucidates the fragility of the germinal matrix vasculature. The microvasculature of the germinal matrix is frail because of an abundance of angiogenic blood vessels that exhibit paucity of pericytes, immaturity of basal lamina and deficiency of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the ensheathing astrocytes-endfeet. High VEGF and angiopoietin-2 levels activate a rapid angiogenesis in the germinal matrix. The elevation of these growth factors may be ascribed to a relative hypoxia of the germinal matrix perhaps resulting from high metabolic activity and oxygen consumption of the neural-progenitor cells. Hence, the rapid stabilization of the angiogenic vessels and the restoration of normal cerebral blood flow on the first day of life are potential strategies to prevent IVH in premature infants.

Child with PDA will not have aEUR',Bounding pulses,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Necrotising enterocolitis,"CO, washout","CO. washout During intrauterine life the fetus does not breathe. The .fetus does not require .functioning lung to oxygenate its blood. The fetus receives oxygenated blood from the mother through the umbilical vein. The lungs remains collapsed during the fetal life and the pulmonary circulation is a high pressure circuit. So, the fetal blood does not pass through the lungs. Instead, it requires a duct that can bypass the lung and can carry the blood straight way to systemic circulation i.e., Aoa. This function is carried out by ductus aeriosus. During intrauterine life only 10% of the cardiac output passes through the lungs the remaining 90% is shunted through the ductus aeriosus to the Aoa and the systemic circulation. After bih, the umbilical vein is cut off The blood must now pass through the lungs for oxygenation.Soon, after bih fetus stas breathing, the lung is filled with air and it expands. The pulmonary vasculature changes from high pressure circuit to low pressure circuit.Now, the fetal blood must pass through the lungs to facilitate proper gas exchange. In order to make this possible, the ductus aeriosus undergoes constriction, and functional closure occur soon after bih in term neonates. Eighty percent of the ductus aeriosus in term infants close by 48 hours and nearly 100% by 96 hours. Oxygen and endothelins are very strong vasoconstrictors and pro- staglandins E2 and 12 are strong vasodilator of the ductus aeriosus. During fetal life, the 02 concentration is Low and PGE2 and PGI2 level in high. This keeps the ductus aeriosus patent. Soon after bih there is sudden elevation in circulating oxygen tension and fall in prostaglandin levels. This results in strong vasoconstriction and functional closure of the ductus aeriosus soon after the delivery. The functional closure is followed by anatomic closure in the next 1-3 months.But in ceain infants the ductus aeriosus does not close after the bih it remains open and is called patent ductus aeriosus. Since after bih the systemic circulation has higher pressure than the pulmonary circulation the blood flows from Aoa to the pulmonary aery through the patent ductus aeriosus. Hemodynamic consequences of the PDA Shunting of blood from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation results in congestive cardiac failure, which manifests clinically ""with wide pulse pressure"" and ""bounding pulses"". Overloading of the pulmonary vasculature leads to pulmonary edema/hemorrhage which predisposes the neonate to ""chronic lung"" disease (CO2 retention may occur). Blood flow to the kidney and gastrointestinal tract is compromised due to shunting of blood front systemic circulation, predisposing to acute renal failure (ARE) and ""necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and metabolic acidosis"".

On fuher questioning, the woman also repos urinary frequency, constipation, pain with intercourse and bloating. On physical examination, a large mass is felt in the pelvic area. Follow-up ultrasound examination demonstrates that the mass involves the right adnexa and is composed of multiloculated cystic spaces. Prior to sending the patient to surgery, the primary care physician wants to order a serum tumor marker to screen for ovarian cancer. Which of the following would be the best choice?",Adrenocoicotropic hormone,CA-125,Galactosyltransferase,S-100,"The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive hea failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer.

Sickle cell anemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, i.e. the type of disease characterized by the production of defective hemoglobin.

Normal hemoglobin

The hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein.
Each subunit is composed of a protein part, i.e, globin and a nonprotein part, i.e. heme, i.e. Each hemoglobin molecule contain four heme units and two pairs of a similar protein, globin.
The heme part of the globular protein is same in all types of hemoglobin.
The protein part vary in different hemoglobin -


Adult hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A) consists of two identical α-chains and two identical δ-chains.
Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical γ chains.
Minor hemoglobin (HbA,) consists of two identical a-chains and two identical δ chains.


Normally adult blood contains about 96% of HbA (α2 β2) 3-3.5% HbA2(α2 δ2), and small amount of fetal hemoglobin HbF (α2 γ2).

Defect in sickle cell anemia 

Sickle cell anemia results from a mutation in β-globin gene.
It is caused by a point mutation at the sixth position of the β-globin chain leading to a substation of a valine residue for a glutamic acid residue. resulting in sickle hemoglobin (HbS).
Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder.
If an individual is homozygous for the sickle cell mutation, almost all the hemoglobin in the red cell is HbS.
In heterozygotes, only about 40% of the hemoglobin is HbS, the remainder being normal hemoglobins.",B

Not used in treatment of thalassemia:,Folic-acid,Iron therapy,Splenectomy,Bone marrow transplant,"Ans. b (Iron therapy). (Ref. Harrison, Principles of Medicine, 18th/Ch. 104)# Iron therapy is infact contraindicated in thalassemic patients on transfusion, as they are likely to have iron overload.Many patients with Beta-thalassemia major require chronic hypertransfusion therapy designed to maintain a hematocrit of at least 27-30% so that erythropoiesis is suppressed. Splenectomy is required if the annual transfusion requirement (volume of RBCs per kilogram of body weight per year) increases by >50%. Folic acid supplements may be useful. Vaccination with Pneumovax in anticipation of eventual splenectomy is advised, as is close monitoring for infection, leg ulcers, and biliary tract disease. Many patients develop endocrine deficiencies as a result of iron overload. Early endocrine evaluation is required for glucose intolerance, thyroid dysfunction, and delayed onset of puberty or secondary sexual characteristics.Patients with Beta-thalassemia intermedia exhibit similar stigmata but can survive without chronic hypertransfusion.Persons with alpha-thalassemia trait may exhibit mild hypochromia and microcytosis usually without anemia. HbA2 and HbF levels are normal. Affected individuals usually require only genetic counseling. HbH disease (in which three loci deleted on the contrary to Hb Barts, in which all four loci are deleted) resembles -thalassemia intermedia, with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients.",B

A plain radiograph of the abdomen demonstrates gas within the bowel wall (pneumatosis). Which of the following would MOST likely be associated with this finding?,Air in the biliary tract,BIood in the biliary tract,Gas in the hepatic veins,Gas in the poal vein,"Poal venous gas is seen in association with pneumatosis intestinalis, most commonly with necrotizing enterocolitis. The physiology of this is that the poal vein, the mesenteric veins, drains nutrient-rich blood from the gut to the liver. In the case of necrosis with air in the bowel wall, air migrates into the poal venous system and to the liver. On CT, this has the characteristic appearance of peripheral lucencies following the poal venous system intrahepatically. In cases of more severe pneumatosis, the bowel may rupture and lead to pneumoperitoneum. Also Know: Pneumobilia, or air in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP). Other causes include a gas-forming infection within the biliary tree or previous sphincterotomy (endoscopic opening of the sphincter of Oddi). Pneumobilia has a distinct appearance on CT: there is gas located centrally in the liver within the ducts. Hemobilia, or blood in the biliary tract, would be seen after instrumentation of the biliary system, such as after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP), from a biliary or hepatic tumor, or secondary to a hypocoagulable state. Hemobilia is found at endoscopy, and is generally not visible on plain radiographs. High attenuation material may be seen within the bile ducts on a CT scan, suggesting hemobilia. Hepatic venous gas would not be seen with pneumatosis because the hepatic veins drain the liver into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Gas from the bowel wall gets trapped in the poal veins and does not traverse the liver to get into the hepatic veins. Ref: Thilo E.H., Rosenberg A.A. (2012). Chapter 2. The Newborn Infant. In W.W.

HPV vaccine is ?,Monovalent,Bivalent,Quadrivalent,Both bivalent and Quadrivalent,"Both bivalent and Quadrivalent Currently, there are two types of cervical cancer vaccines available Gardasil vaccine (quadrivalent vaccine) Cervavarix vaccine (Bivalent vaccine) Gardasil vaccine Gardasil is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine. Gardasil is the only vaccine that helps protect against 4 types - types 6, 11, 16, 18 - of HPV. - The vaccine helps prevent diseases such as cervical cancer, abnormal and precancerous cervical lesions, vaginal lesions, vulvar lesions, and genital was, caused by these strains of HPV. Gardasil contains recombinant virus like paicle (VLPs) assembled from the Ll proteins of HPVs 6, 11, 16 and 18. - Since VLPs lack the viral DNA, they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an antibody response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV Ives represented in the vaccine. Gardasil is recommended to be given to females aged between 9 to 26 years Gardasil provides 98% protection against cervical pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 & 18, which are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. Similarly, in large placebo controlled, double blind, randomized, multicentric studies, the vaccine has also been proven to be 90% effective in the prevention of genital was caused by HPV types 6 and 11, which are responsible for 90% of all genital was cases worldwide. According to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics Committee of Immunization (L4PC01) 2008 recommendations : ""This vaccine has a .orable tolerability profile and the IAP-001 recommends offering HPV vaccine to all females as per label. The recommended age for initiation of vaccination is 10-12 years and catch up vaccination is permitted up to the age of 26 years. It is recommended to be given in three doses at 0, 2 and 6 months"". Gardasil is usually given in the arm muscle. Three shots are given on the following schedule: - Dose 1 -? - Dose 2 --4 2 months after Dose 1 - Dose 3 -4 6 months after Dose 1 Cervarix Cervarix is a vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18, which currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. - Cervarix is a preventative cervical cancer vaccine, not therapeutic; Cervarix vaccine will not block infection .from cervical cancer-causing HPV strains other than HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45. Cervarix is using the ""L1 protein"" of the viral capsid. The viral proteins induce the .fonnation of neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient. Cervari data from patients show that at 18 months after the first of a three-dose regimen, 100 percent of women up to age 55 vaccinated with cervarix vaccine had antibodies present against the two most common cancer-causing human papillomavirus types, 16 and 18. Cervarix Vs. Gardasil: which is the better cervical cancer vaccine ? Cervarix is ""bivalent"" -effective against only two strains of the virus-vaccine. While Gardasil is ""quadrivalent"" vaccine (effective against four common strains of HPV). The question now arises which vaccine to be the vaccine of choice?? On the face of it a quadrivalent vaccine seems to be the better choice. In reality that is not so - The vaccine protects against the HPV viruses 16, 18, 6, 11, of which only the .first two are responsible for cervical cancer, while the other two are responsible for genital was. On the other hand cervarix gives protection against 16 and 18. It is better because, there is cross-reactive protection against the virus strains 45 and 31, two other viruses causing cervical cancer. Cervarix is formulated with ASO4, a propriety adjuvant that boosts the immune system response .for a longer period of time. Both vaccines are against the human papillom virus but cervarix seems to be more effective against cancer cervix. Cervarix can be given to females between 10 to 45 yrs old whereas Gardasil can be given to females between 10 to 26 yrs only. Both the vaccines are given in the schedule of 0, 1, 6 months, Cervarix is the costlier one being priced at Rs.3200 per dose.

"An infant weighing 1600 g (3 1/2 lb) is born at 32 weeks' gestation. Initial evaluation was benign, and the infant was transferred to the level 2 nursery for prematurity. The nurse there calls at 1 hour of life and reports the infant is tachypneic. Vital signs include a heart rate of 140 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 80 breaths per minute, a temperature of 35degC (95degF), and a peripheral oxygen saturation of 98%. The lungs are clear with bilateral breath sounds and there is no murmur; the infant is in no distress. The child's chest radiograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in evaluating the infant?",Obtain a complete blood count and differential.,Perform a lumbar puncture.,Administer intravenously 5cc of D50W.,Place the infant under a warmer.,"(d) Source: (Hay et al, pp 30-31. Kliegman et al, pp 536-537. McMillan et al, p 259. Rudolph et al, pp 171-172.) The radiograph is normal. However, the vignette describes a cold infant. A room temperature of 24degC (approximately 75degF) provides a cold environment for newborn infants. Aside from the fact that these infants emerge from a warm, 37.6degC (99.5degF) intrauterine environment, at birth, infants (and especially preterm infants) are wet, have a relatively large surface area for their weight, and have little subcutaneous fat. Within minutes of delivery, the infants are likely to become pale or blue and their body temperatures will drop. In order to bring body temperature back to normal, they must increase their metabolic rate; ventilation, in turn, must increase proportionally to ensure an adequate oxygen supply. Because a preterm infant is likely to have respiratory problems and be unable to oxygenate adequately, lactate can accumulate and lead to a metabolic acidosis. Infants rarely shiver in response to a need to increase heat production. If the tachypnea persists after warming the infant, sepsis, pneumonia, and primary surfactant deficiency are all possible; several of the alternative answers then may be appropriate.",D
The most common and the most poorly tolerated heart disease during pregnancy is:,Mitral stenosis,Mitral regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Aortic regurgitation,"Ans. c (Aortic stenosis). (Ref.

Together, these factors increase the risk of pulmonary edema, the most lethal complication of mitral stenosis.# Mitral valvotomy can be performed during pregnancy, but open heart surgery increases the risks of abortion and fetal damage.# Prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be continued during pregnancy.# In patients with mitral stenosis, digoxin 0.25 mg/day po is used if atrial fibrillation develops.# Labor and delivery are best tolerated at full term, and close attention to analgesia and to relief of anxiety is essential.# Generally the most hazardous time is during peak cardiac output (at 20 to 34 wk).",C

Clinical studies show that this condition progresses to choriocarcinoma at a rate of?",0.20%,2%,20%,50%,"The condition described is a complete hydatidiform mole. Hydatidiform mole is a spectrum of conditions due to abnormal proliferation of trophoblast and ranging from entirely benign conditions (complete and paial mole) to very aggressive neoplasms (choriocarcinoma). Paial moles have a triploid karyotype (69,XXY) and derive from feilization of an ovum with one or two sperm; fetal pas are frequently seen. Complete moles have a diploid karyotype (46,XX or 46,XY) and derive from feilization of an empty ovum by a single sperm (androgenesis); no fetal pas are found. Ten percent of moles acquire a more aggressive behavior and invade deeper pas of the myometrium, degenerating into invasive moles. Two percent of complete moles may transform into choriocarcinoma, a very aggressive neoplasm that spreads rapidly through the bloodstream. Founately, choriocarcinomas of placental origin are highly responsive to chemotherapy, affording up to 100% cure or remission. Nongestational choriocarcinoma, in contrast, is poorly responsive to chemotherapy. Remember the following impoant points: Complete mole, usually diploid karyotype: results from androgenesis (sperm feilization of an empty egg), no fetal pas are identified, 2% progress to choriocarcinoma. Paial mole, usually triploid karyotype: results from feilization of normal egg by one or two sperm; fetal pas are often identified; rarely progresses to choriocarcinoma.

Resuscitation protocol o As soon as the baby is delivered, five signs are assessed ? Clearance of meconium Active breathing or crying Good muscle tone (flexed posture and active movement of baby). Pink color (look at tougue and lips) Term gestation (delivery between 37-42 weeks of pregnancy). o If all signs are positive no active resuscitation is required. o If any of the 5 signs is absent, baby requires resuscitation. o The baby should be placed under the heat source (radiant warmer) and subjected to a set of intervention known as initial steps. Initial steps of resuscitation 1. Positioning The neonate should be placed on her back or side with the neck slightly extended. This can be achieved by putting a rolled blanket or towel under the shoulders, elevating them 3/4 or 1 inch off the mattress. 2. Suctioning The mouth and nose should be suctioned The mouth is suctioned first to ensure that there is nothing for the infant to aspirate when the nose is suctioned. One should not inse the catheter very deep in mouth or nose for suction -4 Stimulation of posterior pharynx during the first few minutes after bih can produce a vagal responce, causing severe bradycardia or apnea. 3. Dry, stimulate and reposition After suctioning, the baby should be dried by using pre-warmed linen to prevent heat loss. A brief tactile stimulation in the form of flicking the soles or rubbing the back may be provided in case of non-establishment of good respiratory effos. 4. Free flow of oxygen If the baby continues to be depressed, provide free flow of oxygen using a facemask. After providing initial steps, the baby should be evaluated for three signs ?

"Preterm baby with PDA, which is the least idly findings?",CO2 washout,Bounding pulses,Pulmonary hemorrhage,Necrotising enterocolitis,"PDA in preterm neonate

In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief :-



Normal neonate :- Ductus arteriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of birth.
FDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus arteriosus beyond 24 hours after birth is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality.
FDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus arteriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality.


Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate).
Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is common place, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open.


So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not nonnal term neonate in which ductus arteriosus closes within 15 hours of birth).

A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice;
Carbon 'oxide retention;
Increasing oxygen dependence;
X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and
Hepatomegaly


Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a P A is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage.
The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preteen infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC.",A

True statement regarding oogenesis is/are:a) Primary occyte arrests in prophase of 1st meiotic divisionb) Primary occyte arrests in prophase of 2nd meiotic divisionc) Secondary oocyte arrest in Metaphase of 1st meiotic divisiond) Secondary oocyte arrest in Metaphase of 2nd meiotic divisione) 1st polar body is extruded during 1st meiotic division of primary oocytes,acd,ade,abd,ad,"The process involved in the development of mature ovum is called Oogenesis.
The primitive germ cells take their origin from yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and migrate to the developing gonadal ridge, at about the end of 4th week.
Important facts:

Oogenesis begins in the ovary at 6-8 weeks of gestation.
Maximum number of oocytes/oogonia are in the ovary at 5th month of development (20 weeks of gestation number being 6-7 million).
At birth no more mitotic division occur, all oogonia are replaced by primary oocyte.
At birth total content of both ovaries is 2 million primary oocytes.
At puberty number is further decreased and is ~ 300000-500000, of which only 500 are destined to mature during an individual’s life time.
All the primary oocytes in the ovary of a newborn are arrested in the diplotene stage of prophase (of meiosis).
All the primary oocytes then remain arrested and the arrested phase is called as “Dictyate stage” till puberty.
The primary oocyte gets surrounded by follicular cells in the ovary and this structure is now called as Primordial follicle.
At puberty as a result of mid cycle preovulatory surge, meiosis is resumed and completed just prior to ovulation.
Therefore first polar body is released just prior to ovulation or along with ovulation..
The second division starts immediately after it and is arrested in metaphase.
At the time of fertilization second division is completed which results in the release of oocyte and second polar body.
Therefore second polar body is released only at the time of fertilisation.
Size of mature ovum = 120-130 μm (It is the largest cell in the body).
Size of mature follicle = 18-20 mm",B
Endometriosis is explained by :,Sampson's Implantation theory,Metastatic epithelium,Histogenesis by induction,All of the above,"Implantation Theory : Sampson's theory of endometriosis is reflux of menstrual endometrium through the fallopian tubes and its subsequent implantation and growth on the pelvic peritoneum and the surrounding structures. Sampson observed that in cases of uncomplicated endometriosis, the fallopian tubes were usually patent. Coelomic Metaplasia Theory : Meyer and Ivanoff (1919) propounded that endometriosis arises as a result of metaplastic changes in embryonic cell rests of embryonic mesothelium, which are capable of responding to hormonal stimulation. Embryologically, Mullerian ducts arise from these same tissues, hence such a transformation in later life seems plausible. Metastatic Theory : While the above theories can explain the occurrence of endometriosis at the usual sites, they found it difficult to explain its occurrence at less accessible sites like the umbilicus, pelvic lymph nodes, ureter, rectovaginal septum, bowel wall, and remote sites like the lung, pleura, endocardiumband the extremities. Hence it was suggested by Halban et al. (1924) that embolization of menstrual fragments through vascular or lymphatic channels occur, and this leads to the launching of endometriosis at distal sites. Endometrial tissue has been retrieved in pelvic lymphatics in 20% women with endometriosis. Hormonal Influence : Whatever the initial genesis of endometriosis, its fuher development depends on the presence of hormones, mainly oestrogen. Pregnancy,oopherectomy,irradiation,before pubey,menopause,anti estrogenic substances,smoking-----negative factors for endometriosis.Cyclical hormones stimulate its growth, but continuous hormone secretion or therapy suppresses. Immunological Factor : The peritoneal fluid in endometriosis contains macrophages,cytokines and natural killer (NK) cells which clear blood spilled into the peritoneal cavity. Impaired T cell and NK cell activity and altered immunology in a woman may increase the susceptibility to proliferation and growth. Other Factors : Other factors implicated in the occurrence of endometriosis are genetic, multifactorial, vaginal or cervical atresia encouraging retrograde spill. The more frequent the cycles, and the more the bleeding, greater is the risk of endometriosis. Prostaglandins secreted by endometriotic tissue may exacerbate chronic pain and dysmenorrhoea. Risk factors are polymenorrhagia, retroveed uterus which increases the risk of retrograde spill. A woman who has undergone tubectomy operation rarely develops endometriosis. History of familial tendency is repoed in 15%. Genetic basis accounts for 10% of endometriosis; incidence in first-degree relative is sevenfold. It may be that several factors are involved in the aetiology of endometriosis at different sites and none of the above theories fits into the development of endometriosis Reference: Shaw's Textbook of gynaecology,16th edition page no 410",D

The definition of hypeension in children is,"Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=2 occasions","Average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions","The definition of hypeension in adults is BP >=140/90 mm Hg, regardless of body size, sex, or age. This is a functional definition that relates level of BP elevation with the likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular events. Because hypeension-associated cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke, usually do not occur in childhood, the definition of hypeension in children is statistical rather than functional. The National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents published the Fouh Repo on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents (Fouh Repo) in 2004. This repo established normal values based on the normative distribution of BP in healthy children and included tables with systolic and diastolic values for the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentile by age, sex, and height percentile. The Fouh Repo defined hypeension as average systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic BP that is >=95th percentile for age, sex, and height on >=3 occasions. Prehypeension was defined as average SBP or diastolic BP that is >=90th percentile but <95th percentile. In adolescents beginning at age 12 yr, prehypeension is defined as BP between 120/80 mm Hg and the 95th percentile. A child with BP levels >=95th percentile in a medical setting but normal BP outside of the office has white coat hypeension. The Fouh Repo fuher recommended that if BP is >=95th percentile, then hypeension should be staged. Children with BP between the 95th and 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg are categorized as stage 1 hypeension, and children with BP above the 99th percentile plus 5 mm Hg have stage 2 hypeension. Stage 1 hypeension, if asymptomatic and without target organ damage, allows time for evaluation before staing treatment, whereas stage 2 hypeension calls for more prompt evaluation and pharmacologic therapy.

Cesarean section If the pelvis is android or there is CPD, cesarean section should be done. In modern obstetrics, traumatic vaginal delivery causing intracranial hemorrhage is to be avoided at all costs and so there is increasing use of cesarean section for deep transverse arrest. Craniotomy If the baby is dead. Note : In most centres now a days, either cesarean section or vaccum extraction is performed, due to lack of experience in forceps rotation and manual rotation. It is extremely impoant to remember that if vaccum or forceps fails, no attempt should be made to persist with vaginal delivery. The procedure should be abandoned and immediate cesarean section undeaken. In late and neglected cases if the fetus is dead, craniotomy is an option in experienced hands. However, now days most obstetricians would prefer to perform cesarean section in cases of obstructed labour, even when the fetus is dead.",D

There is an arteriovenous malformation such that there exists a communication from the umbilical arterial system of the “donor” twin to the umbilical vein of the “recipient” twin.
The donor twin is growth restricted, hypovolemic, has oligohydramnios and is anemic because it gives blood to the recipient twin. The recipient is larger, hypervolemic, has polyhydramnios and is plethoric. It has also been termed as Twin Oligohydramnios/Polyhydramnios Sequence (TOPS).
The earlier the TOPS appears, worse will be the prognosis.
TTTS is more common in female fetuses.
TTTS can cause preterm delivery due to polyhydramnios, IUGR or fetal demise.
Coming to the question—Twin A is the recipient twin and Twin B is the donor twin since it has oligohydramnios.

Thus twin A can have CHF—due to volume overload, can have hydramnios and can have thrombosis since it has polycythemia which can lead to thrombosis, but it will never have anemia.",B

For antenatal fetal monitoring in a diabetic pregnancy all of the following are useful except:,Non-stress test,Biophysical profile,Doppler flow study,Fetal kick count,"Fetal surveillance in gestational diabetes:
“Low risk gestational diabetic patiens who achieve adequate control with diet alone and do not develop macrosomia, polyhydramnios or preeclampsia do not requre antepartum fetal surveillance testing before 40 weeks. In fact, the risk of fetal distress in those patients is as low as in non diabetics and fetal well being can be assessed by teaching the patients about fetal movements and asking them to fill up a chart for kick counts. On the other hand, high risk gestational diabetics and patients on glyburide and/or insulin should have antepartum fetal surveillance testing starting at 32-34 weeks of gestation. There is no conscensus as to what is the best test for these patients.
Weekly or twice weekly NST are the most popular. However biophysical profile (BPP) the modified biophysical profile and CST are also used.”
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 449
According to COGDT 10/e, p 315
“Surveillance for fetal well being often begins at 32 weeks gestation in patients with end organ disease using a twice weekly NST or modified BPP done twice weekly by measuring the fetal heart rate an the amniotic fluid volume. A weekly BPP is similarly useful. Women without end organ disease who requrie insulin often begin fetal monitoring at 32-34 weeks. Women with diet controlled gestational diabetes usually begin testing at 36-40 weeks until delivered. Maternal fetal movement monitoring check count using a count to 10 or similar method is recommended for all pregnant
women, including those with diabetes to reduce the stillbirth rate.
COGDT 10/e, p 315
So from above 2 texts it is very clear that:

Fetal kick count
NST – Non stress test
CST – Contraction stress test
BPP – Biophysical score/profile

are done for anteratal fetal surveillance in diabetes.

Some group A -hemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus produce virulent exotoxins that can rapidly cause all features of the sepsis syndrome. Some virulent streptococci produce proteases that degrade IL-8. In pyelonephritis, E coli and Klebsiella species commonly cause bacteremia and sepsis syndrome.- Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide released on lysis of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria.- A number of potent bacterial exotoxins can also cause severe sepsis syndrome. Examples include exotoxins from Clostridium perfringens, toxic shock syndrome toxin from S aureus, and toxic shock-like exotoxin from group A -hemolytic streptococci.- These exotoxins cause rapid and extensive tissue necrosis and gangrene, especially of the postpartum uterus, and may cause profound cardiovascular collapse with maternal death.",D

"A 25 year old nulliparous woman at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the labor and delivery ward complaining of contractions, a headache, and flashes of light in front of her eyes.

Her temperature is 37 C (98.6 F), blood pressure is 160/110 mm Hg, pulse is 88/minute, and respirations are 12/minute. Examination shows that her cervix is 2 centimeters dilated and 75% effaced, and that she is contracting every 2 minutes. The fetal hea tracing is in the 140s and reactive. Urinalysis shows 3+ proteinuria. Laboratory values are as follows: leukocytes 9,400/mm3, hematocrit 35%, platelets 101,000/mm3. Aspaate aminotransferase (AST) is 200 U/L, and ALT 300 U/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Administer oxytocin,Discharge the patient,Encourage ambulation,Sta magnesium sulfate,"This patient has severe preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is diagnosed on the basis of hypeension, edema, and proteinuria. Severe preeclampsia may be diagnosed when the patient has one of the following: a headache that does not respond to analgesics, visual changes, seizure, very elevated blood pressures, pulmonary edema, elevated liver function tests, severe proteinuria, oliguria, an elevated creatinine, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, intrauterine growth restriction, or oligohydramnios. The management of severe preeclampsia after 32 weeks is with delivery. Prior to 32 weeks, consideration may be given to expectant management of the patient depending on the clinical circumstances. This patient is at 35 weeks' with headache, visual changes, elevated blood pressures, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests. She, therefore, needs to be delivered. She appears to already be in labor as she is contracting every two minutes and her cervix is dilated and effaced. At this point, magnesium sulfate should be staed. Magnesium sulfate has consistently been demonstrated to be the most effective medication for seizure prophylaxis in women with preeclampsia. To administer oxytocin would not be necessary for this patient. She appears to already be in labor with contractions every two minutes. To discharge the patient would absolutely be incorrect. Severe preeclampsia need to be delivered or, at the very least, admitted to the hospital. There is no role for discharging a patient home in the management of severe preeclampsia. To encourage ambulation would also be incorrect. Severe preeclampsia should be kept on bed rest. Ref: Cunningham F.G., Leveno K.J., Bloom S.L., Hauth J.C., Rouse D.J., Spong C.Y. (2010). Chapter 34.

Benefits of breast milk are –,Better nutrition,Less infection,Less allergy,All of these,"Breast feeding

Breast feeding is feeding an infant or young child with breast milk directly from breast and not from a baby bottle or other container.
Under any circumstances, breast milk is the ideal food for the infant —> Human breast milk is the best source of nourishment for human infants.
No other food is required by the baby until the age of 6 months after birth.
So, exclusive breast feeding should be given to infant for first 6 months of life.

Benefits of breast feeding

Among the benefits of breast feeding are the following -

Superior nutrition
Carbohydrates

Lactose is in a high concentration in breast milk which helps in the absorption of calcium and enhances the growth of lactobacilli in the intestine.

Proteins

The protein content of breast milk is low which causes lower solute load on the kidney.
Most of the protein is whey proteins (lactalbumin and lactoglobulin), which can be digested easily (In contrast cow milk contains more casein).
Breast milk contains the ideal ratio of the amino acids cysteine, taurine and methionine to support the development of the central and peripheral nervous system.

Fats


Breast milk is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the myelination of the nervous system and brain growth.
Active lipase in the breast milk promotes digestion of fats and provides FFA.
The pattern of fats facilitates the absorption of calcium.

Minerals

Breast milk protects against neonatal hypocalcemia and tetany due to ideal calcium phosphorus ratio (2:1) and better calcium absorption.
Iron of breast milk is very well absorbed → breast feeding prevents against iron deficiency anemia.
Breast milk also prevents deficiencies of vitamin A, C, D, E and zinc.
Breast milk has a water content of 88% and hence a breastfed baby does not require additional water in the first 6 months of life even in summer months.
Breast milk has a low mineral and sodium content → low osmolality presents a low solute load to the kidney.

Lower risk of infection

The breast milk is clean and uncontaminated with several anti-infective factors → protect the baby from infection and diarrhoea

Protection from allergy (atopy)

Low protein contents of breast milk along with a higher concentration of secretory IgA decreases the absorption of protein macromolecules → less chances of allergy and asthma.

Emotional bonding

Breast feeding promotes close physical and emotional bonds between the mother and the baby.

Others

Breast feeding lowers the risk of ovarian and breast cancer in mother.
Breastfed babies have a higher IQ and have less chances of developing hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease and diabetes in their adulthood.
The other diseases which are less common in breastfed babies include inflammatory bowel disease, Hodgkin's lymphoma, necrotizing enterocolitis and sudden infant death syndrome.",D

What does the CTG depicts?,Fetal Hea rate monitoring,Growth monitoring,Size monitoring,Amniotic index monitoring,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Foetal hea rate monitoring Cardiotocography or CTG is a test usually done in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is done to see if your baby's hea beats at a normal rate and variability. Normally, a baby's hea rate is anywhere between 110 and 160 beats per minute and increases when the baby moves. Checking that your baby's hea rate responds to his movements is an indirect way of knowing if he gets enough oxygen from the placenta. The test will also see how baby's hea rate is affected by your contraction. A CTG done in your third trimester is also known as a 'non stress test' because your baby is not under the 'stress' oflabour.

Weight gain in pregnancy is related to all except:,Ethnicity,Smoking,Socio economic status,Pre conceptional weight,"Average maternal weight gain during pregnancy is 11-12 kg
Factors which affect maternal weight gain during pregnancy are:

Pre pregnancy weight: If the pre pregnancy weight is more than normal (obese), there is a tendency to gain excessive weight during pregnancy.
Race and ethnicity: American women tend to put on more weight during pregnancy as compared to Asians and Africans.
Socio economic status: Women from higher socio economic group have more weight gain as compared to women from lower socio economic group. This is because malnutrition prevents optimum weight gain.
Associated conditions like women with gestational/over diabetes mellitus, twins and polyhydramnios have higher weight gain during pregnancy
Parity: Multigravida females tend to gain less weigh than primigravida

Smoking does not affect maternal weight gain during pregnancy, Smoking affects fetal weight gain and is one of the causes of IUGR.
“Studies have, indicated a lack of relationship between smoking and maternal weight gain while demonstrating a direct relationship between smoking and fetal grown rate.” 
Remember:
Rapid weight gain, i.e. more than 0.5 kg a week or 2 kg per month is an early manifestation of preeclampsia.

Stationary or falling weight suggests IUGR or IUD.

Pulmonary hemorrhage

Coming back to question -

The newborn baby in this question is preterm neonate (born before 37 weeks).
Diaphragmatic hernia may occur in term or preterm infants and may present as respiratory distress soon after birth.
Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is a disease of preterm neonates and present as respiratory distress during first 6 hours of life.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) occurs most commonly in neonate of HMD who have been treated with oxygen and positive pressure ventilation ---> Instead of showing improvement on 3rd-4th day, some infants of HMD develop an increased need of oxygen and ventilatory support. So, BPD is not a differential diagnosis of respiratory distress at 2-3 hours after birth.",D

"Child (Breast fed) at 30 hrs. of life develops yellowing of face, palm and soles not true is :",Congenital obliteration of bile duct,Breast milk jaundice,Physiological jaundice,Due to septicemia,"Ans. is 'c' physiological jaundice Child presents with severe jaundice at 30 hrs. of life (or we can say 2nd day of life.) Yellowing of face, palms and soles indicate that bilirubin level is > 15 mg/dl (For explanation see O.P.

Both septicemia and congenital obliteration of bile duct can present with severe jaundice on the 2nd day of life. The other 2 options Breast milk jaundice & physiological jaundice cannot cause such an elevation in bilirubin by 2nd day of life. Now let's see them one by one. Breast milk jaundice In breast milk jaundice significant elevation in bilirubin occurs by 7th day of life reaching maximum concentration of 10-30 mg/dl by 2nd-3rd week.

What is this maneuver?",McRobes maneuver,Rubin's maneuver,Wood Corkscrew maneuver,Zavanelli's maneuver,"The McRobes maneuverThe maneuver consists of removing the legs from the stirrups and sharply flexing the thighs up toward the abdomen. The procedure caused straightening of the sacrum relative to the lumbar veebrae, rotation of the symphysis pubis toward the maternal head, and a decrease in the angle of pelvic inclination. Although this does not increase pelvic dimensions, pelvic rotation cephalad tends to free the impacted anterior shoulder.Of rotational maneuvers, Woods (1943) repoed that by progressively rotating the posterior shoulder 180 degrees in a corkscrew fashion, the impacted anterior shoulder could be released. This is frequently referred to as the Wood's corkscrew maneuver. Rubin (1964) recommended two maneuvers. First, the fetal shoulders are rocked from side to side by applying force to the maternal abdomen. If this is not successful, the pelvic hand reaches the most easily accessible fetal shoulder, which is then pushed toward the anterior surface of the chest. This maneuver most often abducts both shoulders, which in turn produces a smaller bisacromial diameter. This permits displacement of the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis With an all- fours maneuver , also called the Gaskin maneuver, the paurient rolls onto her knees and hands. Here, downward traction against the head and neck attempts to free the posterior shoulder The Zavanelli maneuver involves replacement of the fetal head into the pelvis followed by cesarean delivery Reference: William's obstetrics; 25th edition",A

Serum FSH levels vary significantly across the cycle hence FSH is best measured during the early follicular phase ( cycle day 2-4).
Basal serum estradiol concentration has little value as ovarian reserve test.
AMH: Antimullerian hormone is produced from preantral and small antral follicles hence AMH levels are gonadotropin-independent and exhibit little variation within and between menstrual cycles. AMH threshold levels (0.2-0.7ng/ml) has 40-97% sensitivity, 70-92% specificity, 22-88% PPV and 97-100% NPV for predicting poor response to stimulation (<3 follicles or < 2-4oocytes).",A

A new born baby is brought with seizures refractory to treatment and continuous bruit through the anterior fontanelles. CT scan showed a midline lesion with hypoechogenicity and dilated lateral ventricles. The probable diagnosis is,Arachnoid cyst,Encephalocele,Teratomas,Vein of Galen Malformation,"Vein of Galen malformation (VOGM) is a type of rare blood vessel abnormality inside the brain. In VOGM, misshapen aeries in the brain connect directly with veins, instead of connecting with capillaries, which help slow blood flow. This causes a rush of high-pressure blood into the veins. This extra pressure in the veins can cause a number of problems: The rush of blood toward the hea and lungs forces the hea to work oveime to get blood to the rest of the body. This can lead to congestive hea failure in some infants. Blood pressure in the aeries from the hea to the lungs may rise, causing a serious condition called pulmonary hypeension. The high pressure in the veins can prevent the infant's brain from draining adequately. This can lead to widespread brain injury and sometimes causes severe loss of tissue in the brain. Some infants can develop hydrocephalus (an enlarged head) if the VOGM blocks the normal flow of fluid in the brain Image : 3D C+ aerial phase Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",D

Blighted ovum is :,Synaptic knobs,Avascular villi,Intervillous hemorrhage,None.,"Ans. is b i.e. Avascular villi According to the clinical and echographic findings, it is possible to separate early pregnancy losses into two groups : alighted ova : Those early pregnancy losses in which foetal development is not observed with ultrasound (so that only a gestational sac is present with or without a yolk sac) and fetal tissue is absent on histologic examination of the products of conception. * Early Fetal demise Those early pregnancy losses in which fetal development is clearly observed by ultrasound and feta! tissue is found on the histologic examination. The difference between these two types of aboion is of fundamental impoance. The lack of development of fetal structures defines a subset of aboions of genetic origin. In contrast, the early interruption of fetal life is a complex phenomenon with multiple etiologies. Therefore, the patients with blighted ova do not require extensive work up, whereas patients who have aboed cytogenetically normal fetuses need an extensive search for non genetic factors responsible for the pregnancy loss.",B

Most common cause of UTI in pregnancy:,Proteus mirabilis,Group B b haemolytic streptococcus,E. coli,Klebsiella,"Ans. C. E. colia. Urinary tract infections are more concerning in pregnancy due to the increased risk of kidney infections.b. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, which leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys.c. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present, they do have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection.d. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection--even in the absence of symptoms--treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures).e. E coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI), accounting for approximately 80-90% of cases. It originates from fecal flora colonizing the periurethral area, causing an ascending infection.",C

Zinc deficiency is usually seen as a part of malnutrition or malabsorption syndromes, caused by low dietary intake or intestinal disease. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is an autosomal recessive syndrome of severe zinc deficiency, caused by defective intestinal absorption due to intestinal zinc transporter protein. Presentation in early infancy, with vesicobullous, dry, scaly or eczematous skin lesions chiefly involving the perioral, perineal and acral areas.

Not a cause of primary amenorrhea-,Turner's syndrome,Kallmann syndrome,Asherman's syndrome,Rokitansky syndrome,"Ans. B Asherman's syndrome Primary Amenorrhea is defined as: 1. In absence of secondary sexual characters No menses till the age of 14 years or 2. In presence of secondary sexual characters no menses till the age of 16 years. 3. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as absence of menses for 6 consecutive months (or length of time equivalent to total of 3 previous cycles) in a female who had previously regular menses. 4. MC cause of primary amenorrhea is ovarian dysgenesis/Turners syndrome. 5. Mullerian agenesis (Rokitansky Mayer Kustner Hauser/ R.M.K.H Syndrome) is the secondMC cause and Androgen insensitivity syndrome or Testicular feminizing syndrome (A.I.S./T.F.S) is the 3rd MC of primary amenorrhea . 6. Patients with classic Kallmann syndrome or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism may not experience puberty or may experience incomplete puberty and have symptoms associated with hypogonadism. 7. For men, these symptoms include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, decreased muscle strength, and diminished aggressiveness and drive. 8. For women, symptoms include amenorrhea and dyspareuniA. Notably, patients with Kallmann syndrome or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism do not experience hot flashes. 9. All patients with Kallmann syndrome have either anosmia or severe hyposmia and may exhibit symptoms of associated conditions including those of congenital heart disease (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, cyanosis, palpitations, syncope) or neurologic manifestations (eg, color blindness, hearing deficit, epilepsy, paraplegia). 10. Pregnancy in the MC cause of secondary amenorrhea 11. ""Asherman's Syndrome"" is a condition characterized by adhesions and/or fibrosis of the endometrium particularly but can also affect the myometrium. It is often associated with dilation and curettage of the intrauterine cavity. A number of other terms have been used to describe the condition and related conditions including: intrauterine adhesions (IUA), uterine/cervical atresia, traumatic uterine atrophy, sclerotic endometrium, endometrial sclerosis, and intrauterine synechiae",C

"Epiglottitis in a 2-year-old child is diagnosed. Among the following options, most commonly Epiglottitis occurs due to infection with:",Influenza virus,Staphylococcus aureus,Hemophilus influenzae,Respiratory syncytial virus,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hemophilus influenza From the above given long list of references it must be evident, that this one was tough for us. is H. influenzae still the most common etiological agent of epiglottitis or has it receded back giving place to other agents such as Streptococcus? Harrison, 16/e and Nelson, 17/e, say that - H. influenzae was the most common etiological agent of epiglottitis but because of widespread use of the HIB vaccine, diseases d/t H. influenzae have reduced drastically and ""therefore, other agents such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumaniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, now represent a larger proportion of pediatric cases of epiglottitis."" So far fine. But the trouble is that both of them mention this change for US only. Harrison writes - 'After the introduction of Hib vaccine, disease incidence among children in the United States declined dramatically."" Nelson writes - ""Since the widespread use of the Hib vaccine in the United States, invasive disease due to H. influenzae type b in pediatric patients has been reduced by 80-90%. Therefore other agents, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, now represent a larger proportion of pediatric cases of epiglottitis."" Apart from Nelson and Harrison, all other books consulted (mentioned in References above) write H. influenzae to be the most common etiological agent. They also mention that it has reduced considerably in US d/t extensive use of Hib vaccine. CPDT writes - ""In published case series, it is almost always caused by H. influenzae type B"" O.P. Ghai writes - ""H. influenzae type B is the most frequent causative agent."" I consulted specifically book by UK authors who also endorse the same fact Furfare and Ameils Textbook of Pediatrics, 6/e p 777 write - ""Epiglottitis is caused primarily by H. influenzae type B. The introduction of the conjugate vaccine in the UK in October 1992 has substantially reduced the incidence of epiglottitis, however, there has been a recent resurgence of cases d/t vaccine failure."" Also, read these lines from Harrison - ""Nevertheless, lack of vaccination or vaccine failure has meant that many pediatric cases seen today are still due to Hib"" So we conclude that- in India - H. influenzae in U.S. - Group A Streptococcus in World as a whole - Not sure but I would go for H. influenzae Most common etiological agent of epiglottitis As far as this question is concerned, it is being asked by an Indian institution, so I would go for the most common etiological agent in India (or may be in the world but definitely not in US)",C

What is the most probable diagnosis?",Pseudohypoparathyroidism,Vitamin D deficiency,Hypoparathyroidism,Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Hypoparathyroidism o This child has :- i) Hypocalcemia ii) Hyperphosphatemia in) Normal PTH levels o Option b & d can be ruled out because :- i) In Vitamin D deficiency :- serum calcium is normal or slightly reduced (7.5 -slightly reduced; and parathormone levels are increased. ii) hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is not related to calcium and phosphate me o Now, we are left with Pseudohypoparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism both hyperphosphatemia. o In Pseudohypoparathyroidism, there is increased concentration of parathyroid most of the times. Thus, this option is also excluded. o Coming to hypoparathyroidism: As the name suggests, PTH is low in hypoparathyroidism. But, sometimes PTH may be in normal range (10-60 Pg/ml) and this is inappropriately normal PTH. However it is generally believed that 'Normal' levels of PTH in a patient with hypocalcemia indicate 'inappropriately normal PTH' and relative Hypoparathyroidism should always be considered as the initial diagnosis. `Serum PTH levels should be related to the concurrent serum calcium. High PTH is the normal response to hypocalcemia and therefore 'normal' PTH in a patient with Hypocalcemia indicates relative Hypoparathyroidism' -Practical Algorithms in Pediatric Endocrinology' by Hochberg (2007)/71. 'Because normally hypocalemia is a potent stimulus for secretion of PTH, patients with intact parathyroid gland function should be expected to have high circulating levels of PTH, during hypocalcemic episodes. Low levels of serum PTH and in some assays even inapropriately 'normal' levels despite hypocalcemia should prompt consideration of various form of hypoparathyroidism' - Principles and Practice of Endocrinology & Metabolism' by Beeker.",C

Routine inspiratory films are likely to appear normal or near normal (as outlined in the question and noted in the first radiograph). Expiratory films will identify air trapping behind the foreign body (as noted on the second radiograph).

Billing's method of contraception refers to :,Monitoring BBT,Cervical mucus method,Rhythm method,Coitus interruptus method,"Ans. is b i.e. Cervical mucus method Billing's or cervical mucus method is a type of natural family planning method. This method is based on the observation of changes in the characteristics of cervical mucus. At the time of ovulation - mucus is watery, clear (resembling raw egg white), smooth, slippery and profuse. After ovulation, under the influence of progesterone, the mucus thickens and lessens in quantity. It is recommended that women use a tissue paper to wipe inside the vagina to assess quantity and character of mucus. Intercourse is considered safe during the dry days immediately after the menses initial the mucus is detected. Thereafter the couple must abstain until the fouh day after the peak day. To practice this method, the women should be able to distinguish between different types of mucus. This requires a high degree of motivation. Other natural family planning methods are : Basal body temperature (under the influence of progesterone at the time of ovulation, BBT rises by 0.3 -0.5degF). Calender technique Symptothermic method - it combines BBT+ cervical mucus + calendar technique",B

"Chromosomal analysis of all of the following genotype shows Barr bodies, EXCEPT:",XO,XXY,XX,XXX,"Routine microscopy of mammalian cell nuclei reveals a small, dense mass of heterochromatin present in females but not males. This ""sex chromatin"" (or Barr body or X-chromatin) is one of the two X chromosomes present in females. As a general rule, only 1 X chromosome functions in a cell at a given time. All other X chromosomes present in a cell may be seen as X-chromatin bodies in a resting nucleus. Thus, if one knows the number of X chromosomes, one can anticipate that the number of Barr bodies will be 1 less. If one counts the number of Barr bodies, the number of X chromosomes can be determined by adding 1. Hence Barr bodies are not seen in genotype XO. The male cell has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, therefore no sex chromatin is visible in males. Ref: Manipalviratn S., Trivax B., Huang A. (2013). Chapter 3.

TVS findings show thickness of endometrium as 8 mm. First lets understand what does this signify -Endometrial thickness has been correlated with endometrial cancer risk in pe and post menopausal women. In postmenopausal females with : Atrophic endometrium Endometrial hyperplasia Endometrial cancer Endometrial thickness is 3.4 + 1.2 mm It is 9.7 + 2.5 mm It is 18.2 + 6.2 mm Sensitvities of 95 - 97% have been repoed using a measurement of < 4 mm for exclusion of endometrial cancer.

Extra Edge : Clear cut endometrial thickness giudelines have not been established for premenopausal females. It is generally seen that normal endometrial thickness in premenopausal women does not exceed 4 mm on day 4 of menstrual cycle and 8 mm by day 8. A persistent finding of endometrial thickness > 12 mm independant of cycle day should prompt fuher evaluation in these women, especially in those with risk factors for endometrial carcinoma. Summary of diagnostic procedures in case of DUB if endometrial neoplasia is suspected : - There is is no clear sequence to the use of endometrial biopsy, TVS, SIS and hysteroscopy when evaluating abnormal uterine bleeding. - TVS - as it is well tolerated, cost effective and requires minimal technical skill is the first logical step. It addition TVS can determine whether a lesion is diffuse or focal - If endometrial hyperplasia / neoplasia is suspected - then endometrial biopsy is done. If there is a focal leison - either hysteroscopy or SIS is done.",A

Mechanism of action of Clomiphene citrate used for infeility:-,Block estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus,Negative feedback on HPO axis,Direct action on ovarian primordial follicles,Increase in tubal motility,"The ability of Clomiphene citrate (CC) to initiate an ovulatory sequence is primarily due to its ability to be recognized by and interact with the estrogen receptors in hypothalamus. In its capacity as an Estrogen antagonist,CC displaces endogenous estrogen from hypothalamic estrogen receptor sites and hence inhibiting the negative feedback of the endogenous estrogen on the hypothalamus (Reproductive Medicine & Surgery, Wallach and Zacur, Mosby '95). In simple terms, there is non recognition of the body's estrogens by the hypothalamus due to the blockade of estrogens receptors by CC and hence the hypothalamus directs the pituitary to make more of FSH which in turn drives the ovary to make a follicle to make estrogens.The development of follicle is the preceeding event before ovulation.",A

Which of the following is NOT characteristic of menopause?,There is a decrease in skin elasticity,Systemic vasomotor instability may be present,There may be an increase in FSH secretion by the pituitary gland,There is a marked decrease in adrenal coical estrogen secretion,"Menopause begins at age 45 to 50 years old. It is a gradual process which concludes with the cessation of menstruation. Cessation of menstrual flow for a period of one year is considered completion of menopause. Menopause is associated with a marked decline in ovarian estrogen secretion, but adrenal coical estrogens continue to be secreted but are not of sufficient quantity to maintain secondary sexual characteristics. There is a loss of breast tissue, subcutaneous fat, skin elasticity, and body hair as a result of decrease in estrogen supply. There is also systemic vaso instability leading to hot flashes, dizziness, and headaches. The pituitary gland responds to the decrease in estrogen by increasing FSH secretions.

Which of the following is not a risk factor for Carcinoma cervix :,Nulliparity,Multiple sexual paners,Early sexual intercourse,Smoking,"Risk factors for cancer of the cervix: Age 35-45 years. Pre-cancerous lesions occur 10-15 years earlier. Coitus before the age of 18 years. Multiple sexual paners. Delivery of the first baby before the age of 20 years. Multiparity with poor bih spacing between pregnancies. Poor personal hygiene. Carcinoma of the cervix shares similar epidemiological features to those of sexually transmitted diseases and viral infections and these are strongly linked to cancer cervix as causative agents. Poor socioeconomic status. At one time, exposure to smegma from uncircumcised paners was considered an impoant factor, accounting for lower incidence of cancer of the cervix amongst Jews and Muslims. Now it is realized that the incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV) is low in circumcised men, and that is the reason for low incidence of cancer in their wives. Smoking and drug abuse, including alcohol, are immunosuppressive (13-fold). Women with STD, HIV infection, herpes simplex virus 2 infection, HPV infection (16, 18, 31, 33) and condylomata have a high predisposition to cancer. Of these, HPV is now considered the most impoant oncogenic cause. Most HPV infection 16, 18 are symptomless in young women and clear within 2 years. Persistent infection is the cause of cancer of the cervix in 70-90% cases.Before the age of 30 years, 90% women with intact immune system are able to get rid of HPV infections. 10% with persistent infection after the age of 30 years tend to progress to CIN or invasive cancer.

A characteristic feature of nephrotic syndrome in children –,Lipid casts in urine,WBC casts in urine,RBC casts in urine,Albumin in urine,"Acute nephritic syndrome 

Nephritic syndrome is a collection of signs associated with disorders affecting the kidneys, more specifically glomerular disorders and is characterized by haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, oedema and oliguria.

1. Haematuria

The haematuria is slight giving the urine smoke appearance.
Erythrocytes are detectable by microscopy or by chemical testing for haemoglobin.
Presence of RBC casts in urine is a classical feature of nephrotic syndrome.

2. Proteinuria

Proteinuria is mild (< 3 gm/day) also called nephritic range proteinuria or subnephrotic range proteinuria.
Proteinuria is nonselective.


Edema → Usually mild and results from sodium and water retention.
Hypertension → Is variable depending upon the severity of the glomerular disease.
Oliguria → Reflects the severity of glomerular involvement.

(d) Ventricular septal defect.* In the differential diagnosis, early-onset sepsis may be indistinguishable from RDS. In pneumonia manifested at birth, the chest roentgenogram may be identical to that for RDS. Maternal group B streptococcal colonization, organisms on Gram stain of gastric or tracheal aspirates or a buffy coat smear, and/or the presence of marked neutropenia may suggest the diagnosis of early-onset sepsis.* Cyanotic heart disease (total anomalous pulmonary venous return) can also mimic RDS both clinically and radiographically. Echocardiography with color flow imaging should be performed in infants who fail to respond to surfactant replacement to rule out cyanotic congenital heart disease as well as ascertain patency of the ductus arteriosus and assess pulmonary vascular resistance.* Congenital alveolar proteinosis (congenital surfactant protein B deficiency) is a rare familial disease that manifests as severe and lethal RDS in predominantly term and near-term infants.* In atypical cases of RDS, a lung profile (lecithin: sphingomyelin ratio and phosphatidylglycerol level) performed on a tracheal aspirate can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of surfactant deficiency.

Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy,Transvaginal USG,Culdocentesis,MRI,Serial monitoring of (-HCG,"Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

This form of diabetes has an impoant autoimmune component to its etiology. As many as 85% of patients have islet cell autoantibodies in their blood in the first few weeks after onset of the disease. Most of these antibodies are directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme that is present in b cells. Insulin deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake and hyperglycemia. The increase in blood glucose results in increased glycosylation of hemoglobin in red blood cells. Hence, the hemoglobin A1c concentration will be increased, not decreased, reflecting long-standing hyperglycemia. Another consequence of the increased blood glucose is increased serum osmolarity (not decreased). If the osmolarity exceeds 330 mOsm/L, consciousness begins to be impaired.beta; cell destruction in type 1 diabetes leads to decreased secretion of insulin. Since insulin and C-peptide are released on a 1:1 ratio by the beta; cells, the secretion of C-peptide is also decreased . Insulin is first synthesized as preproinsulin, with an initial leader sequence of hydrophobic amino acids that allows the developing protein to be extruded from the ribosomes into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The ""pre"" segment is then cleaved off, leaving proinsulin. Proinsulin is packaged into secretory granules within the Golgi, and as the granules bud off, enzymes cleave the precursor into insulin and C-peptide. Ref: Klein U. (2012). Chapter 17.

Regarding IUGR,Abdominal circumference (AC) is the least sensitive parameter for detection of IUGR,In asymmetric IUGR head circumference/abdominal circumference (HC/AC) is reduced,Serial biparietal diameter (BPD) is the only important measurement in IUGR,AC indirectly reflects fetal liver size and glycogen storage,"‘AC is the single most sensitive parameter to detect IUGR’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
‘Serial measurements of AC (not BPD) and estimation of fetal weight are more diagnostic to fetal growth restriction’
Dutta Obs 7/e, p 462
Head circumference (HC) and abdominal circumference (AC) ratios: In a normally growing fetus the HC/AC ratio exceeds 1.0 before 32 weeks. It is approximately 1.0 at 32 to 34 weeks. After 34 weeks, it falls below 1.0. If the fetus is affected by asymmetric IUGR, the HC remains larger. The HC/AC is then elevated. In symmetric IUGR, both the HC and AC are reduced. The HC/AC ratio remains normal. Using HC/AC ratio, 85% of IUGR fetuses are detected
Pathophysiology: Basic pathology in small for gestational age is due to reduced availability of nutrients in the mother or its reduced transfer by the placenta to the fetus. It may also be due to reduced ultilization by the fetus. Brain cell size (asymmetric–SGA) as well as cell numbers (symmetric-SGA) are reduced. Liver glycogen content is reduced. AC indirectly reflects the decreased fetal liver size and glycogen content.",D

Causes of female pseudohermaphroditism are:
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia. (M/C cause)
• Increased androgens in the mother which cross the placenta and cause virilization of the external genitalia. Like
maternal intake of androgenic drugs, maternal adrenal tumor, etc.
• Placental aromatase deficiency. Aromatase enzyme is responsible for conversion of testosterone to estradiol. If this enzyme is deficient there will be excess of testosterone.
• Wnt4 mutation. Wnt4 Mullerian aplasia is a disorder that occurs in females and affects their reproductive system. There is abnormal development of the Mullerian duct, and ovarian dysfunction so females have an underdeveloped or absent uterus and may also have abnormalities of other reproductive organs. Women with this condition have primary amenorrhea, normal breast and pubic hair development and higher than normal levels of androgens in their blood. These high levels of androgens cause acne, hirsutism and virilisation. Kidney abnormalities may also be present in some affected individuals.",C

If the life style factor that is causing infeility in a young male is identified. Which of the following life style modification will have no effect?,Weight gain,Less exercise,Vegetarian diet,Weight loss,"Ans. c. Vegetarian diet Vegetarian diet will have minimal or no effect on feility. 1 'Weight definitely matters when it comes to feility. Women who are overweight - or underweight - tend to have a more difficult time conceiving. The same goes for men, but more about that later.'- http //www early-pregnancy-tests com/ weight-feility html 'Exercise can affect feility in several ways. Over-exercising is one of the bigger causes of infeility for women. If a woman exercises too much, she is at a risk of losing too much of her body fat. Body fat plays an essential role in the production of estrogen; without enough estrogen, a woman who over-exercises might not ovulate. The technical term for not ovulating is oligomenorrhea, and is a major cause of feility problems. Women who don't get enough exercise can impact their feility negatively as well. By not getting enough exercise, a woman runs the risk of becoming overweight or obese. An overweight or obese woman, because she has more fat cells, can actually have too much estrogen. This overproduction of estrogen can negatively impact ovulation and conception. In addition, being overweight puts you at risk for insulin resistance, which can ultimately keep you from ovulating. http://wwwbabyhopes.com/aicles/exercise-feility.html",C

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the anemia,Iron deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Folate deficiency,Physiologic anemia of pregnancy,"This is a macrocytic anemia because the mean corpuscular volume is above normal. Macrocytic anemias include folate deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency; however, folate deficiency is more commonly seen in pregnancy than vitamin B12 deficiency. Iron deficiency is a microcytic anemia (MCV below normal), and it is the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy. Physiologic anemia of pregnancy is a result of the physiologic hemodilution that occurs in the vasculature. There is a dispropoionate increase in plasma volume over the increased RBC volume, and this ""diluted state"" also gives the appearance of a fall in the laboratory values of hemoglobin and hematocrit.",C

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is useful for the following cancer-,Cervix,Vulva,Vagina,Endometrial,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Vulva * The sentinel lymph node is the hypothetical first lymph node or group of nodes reached by metastasizing cancer cells from a primary tumor.* Sentinel node biopsy technique is used in the staging of certain types of cancer to see if they have spread to any lymph nodes. It is done using lymphoscintigraphy with technetium-99m labeled nanocolloid or isosulfan blue dye to identify a sentinel node that would predict the presence or absence of regional nodal metastasis.* The main advantage of this procedure is that it decreases unnecessary lymph node dissections, where it is not necessary, thereby reducing the risk of lymphedema and other complications. The main uses are in breast cancer and malignant melanoma surgery, although it has been used in other tumor types with a degree of success.* Vulvar cancer was the first and most promising gynecological site for the sentinel lymph node biopsy strategy. As it involves a cutaneous tumor, peritumoral injections are easy and the sentinel lymph node is always located in the groin. This is another factor making the vulva an ideal site for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Preliminary studies indicate that a sentinel node can be identified in most of the patients of Ca vulva. Trials are on to determine the accuracy of negative predictive value of a uninvolved sentinel node. As of now complete inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy is indicated in all stages of Ca vulva except stage la.",B

Information obtained by lateral plate X-ray pelvimentry are all except :,Sacral curve,True conjugate,Bispinous diameter,Inclination of the pelvis,"X-ray pelvimetry is of limited value in the diagnosis of pelvic contraction or cephalopelvic dispropoion.X-ray pelvimetry is a poor predictor of pelvic adequacy and success of vaginal delivery. However, X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the impoant diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination (see below). Techniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken -- anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter. Limitations of X-ray pelvimetry: The following are the prognostic significances of the successful outcome of labor: (1) Size and shape of the pelvis; (2) Presentation and position of the head; (3) Size of the head; (4) Moulding of the head; (5) Give way of the pelvis; and (6) Force of uterine contractions. Out of these many unknown factors, X-ray pelvimetry can only identify one factor, i.e. size and shape of the pelvis. Thus, it can only supplement the clinical assessment of pelvis but cannot replace the clinical examination. Otherwise it is true that satisfactory progress of labor is the best indicator of pelvic adequacy. Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad. So it is restricted to selected cases only. Diagnostic range of radiation exposure (less than 5 rads) is not associated with any significant congenital malformation either in human or in animal.

During this stage, there will be an appearance of sexual characters with changes in cognition and psychology. Adolescence refers to this entire process, pubey refers to the physical aspect. Age 10-19 year is considered as a period of adolescence and pubey marks the early half of adolescence. Pubey in girls stas with breast development( thelarche) anytime between 8-13 years. This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair ( pubarche) and subsequently menstruation ( menarche), occurring at an average of 12.6 years. Menarche occurs after 2-2 1/2 years of thelarche. In boys, the earliest change is an increase in testicular size( testicular volume reaching 4 ml) and this occurs between 9-14 years. This is followed by an appearance of pubic hair and lengthening of the penis. Spermarche( sperm production) stas during mid-adolescence. Laryngeal growth, manifesting as cracking of voice, begins in boys in mid-pubey, deepening of voice is complete by end of pubey. During pubey, boys gain 20-30 cm and girls 16-28 cm of height. Peak growth velocity in girls occurs before attainment of menarche. Boys have their peak growth in later stages of pubey. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",A

Anatomical closure of ductus aeriosus occurs at-,Bih,3-4 day,10th day,30th day,"Ans. is `c' i.e., 10th day Circulatory adjustments at bih o These are brought about because of a shift from placental dependance for gas exchange in the fetus to pulmonary gas exchange in neonate. I) Pulmonary circulation Immediatly after bih lungs expand due to first few breaths of neonate. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance (02 causes pulmonary vasodilatation). This results in increased flow into pulmonary trunk and aeries. The pulmonary aery pressure falls due to lowering of pulmonary vascular resistance. The pressure relations between aoa and pulmonary trunk are reversed so that the blood flow through the ductus aeriosus is reversed --> Instead of blood flowing from the pulmonary aery to aoa, the direction of flow through ductus, is from aoa to pulmonary trunk. Increasing oxygen saturation causes the muscle of ductus to constrict --> In full term neonates the ductus aeriosus closes within 10 to 25 days. 2) System circulation and circulation through hea Loss of placental circulation and clamping of the cord after bih results in increase in systemic vascular resistance. This tends to increase the aoic blood pressure and the left ventricular systolic pressure. The loss of placental circulation results in sudden reduction of flow through ductus venosus which closes off --> Flow through ductus venosus disappears by the 7th day of posnatal life. The loss of placental flow results in a decrease in the volume of blood returning to right atrium --> Right atrial pressure decreases. The left atrial pressure becomes higher than right atrial pressure and the septum primum which ats as a valve of fossa ovalis, approximates with the septum secundum to close off formen ovale. Functional closure of foramen ovale occurs very quickly. Over a period of months, the septum primum and septum secundum become firmly adherent resulting in anatomical closure of the foramen ovale. o After closure of ductus aeriosus, there is establishment of postnatal circulation : - The blood reaching the right atrium through IVC and SVC is emptied into the right ventricle from where it is pumped into pulmonary trunk. After coursing through lungs for gas exchange, it reaches the left atrium. and ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it out for distribution in the body for oxygenation of the tissues. The venous return again comes back to right atrium through IVC and SVC. All of the blood leaving the right ventricle, after coursing through lungs, reaches the left ventricle --> The two ventricles are connected in series and therefore, the output of right and left ventricles are same (in contrast to fetal circulation, where right ventricular output is more).",C

The use of the following drug during pregnancy can lead to mobius syndrome:,Warfarin,Phenytoin,Mifepristone,Misoprostol,"Möbius syndrome is an extremely rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side.
Most people with Möbius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expression.
They have normal intelligence.
Möbius syndrome results from the underdevelopment of the VI and VIIcranial nerves.
Causes: The causes of Möbius syndrome are poorly understood. Möbius syndrome is thought to result from a vascular disruption (temporary loss of bloodflow) in the brain during prenatal development. There could be many reasons for the vascular disruption leading to Möbius syndrome. The use of the drugs misoprostol or thalidomide or cocaine by women during pregnancy can lead to mobius syndrome.",D
"A 38-year-old woman is in her first pregnancy, which has been uneventful until the 34th week, when she develops swelling of feet and hands. An obstetric check-up reveals that she also has hypeension and proteinuria. Laboratory analysis shows elevated aspaate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and slightly decreased platelets. The initial event in the pathogenesis of her condition is thought to be which of the following?",Chorioamnionitis,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Maternal hypeension,Placental ischemia,"This patient's condition is a classic third trimester complication referred to as toxemia of pregnancy, or preeclampsia. It occurs in 6% of all pregnancies but is more frequent in primiparas. Although the pathogenesis is still unclear, the first event appears to be placental ischemia, probably due to abnormalities in the trophoblast and alterations in the maturation of placental vessels. The trophoblast of invading placental vessels fails to acquire the characteristics of normal endothelial cells, with subsequent alterations in blood flow. Placental ischemia then triggers the release of thromboplastic substances, increases renin synthesis, and reduces prostaglandin E levels. Chorioamnionitis is an infection of chorioamniotic membranes due to bacteria that ascend through the vaginal canal. This is an impoant cause of spontaneous aboion in the second and third trimester, but it plays no role in the pathogenesis of toxemia of pregnancy. The release of thromboplastic substances may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Increased renin and reduced prostaglandin E mediate increased sensitivity to angiotensin, leading to maternal hypeension.",D

All are true about septic shock in children except ?,1st response is TC.O. due to vasodilatation,Hypotension is a late sign,Hea rate remains same,LPeripheral vascular resistance,"Ans. is c' i.e., Hea rate remains same Septic shock in children Septic shock is an inflammatory state resulting from systemic response to bacterial infection. o Decrease in peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) is the hallmark of early (hyperdynamic) stage of septic shock, this feature distinguishes it from other types of shock. Decreased peripheral resistance (vasodilatation) leads to compensatory increase in cardiac output; therefore, cardiac output is maintained or some time increased despite of shock. o Decreased peripheral resistance and increased cardiac output leads to increased blood flow and total oxygen delivery to the tissue. But, still the tissues lack 02 due to local microcirculatory changes produced as a result of sepsis which causes decrease tissue extraction of oxygen. So, increased blood flow and cardiac out are still inadequate to meet the total metabolic needs of the tissue which are increased in sepsis. o As sepsis progresses, hypodynamic stage supervenes in which there is decreased cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. So, hemodynamic changes in septic shock occur in two characteristic patterns, Early hyperdynamic and late hypodynamic shock 1) Early hyperdynamic shock Hypotension is a late feature of septic shock and early hyperdynamic stage is characterized by normal or increased BP Other features are : ? o Tachycardia o Warm extremities o Normal or increased cardiac output o Decreased systemic vascular resistance o Tachypnea o Increased pulmonary vascular resistance 2) Late hypodynamic stage o Decreased cardiac output o Cool, mottled and often cyanotic extremities o Hypotension o Oliguria, renal failure o Increased vascular resistance o Hypothermia",C

Its major actions are :1. Uterus# It increases the force and frequency of uterine contraction. Estrogens sensitize the uterus to oxytocin, while progestins decrease the sensitivity.# The increased contractility is restricted to the fundus and body, lower segment is not contracted, may even be relaxed at term.# Excessive uterine contraction prior to labor may cause fetal distress, placental abruption or uterine rupture.2. Breast# Oxytocin contracts myoepithelium of mammary alveoli and forces milk into bigger sinusuids - Milk ejection or milk letdown reflex.3.

Undiagnosed or undetected ectopic pregnancy is a common cause of maternal death during the first trimester. Most valuable diagnostic test in a case of suspected ectopic pregnancy is:,Serial (3-hCG levels),Transvaginal USG,Progesterone measurement,Culdocentesis,"Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) has the advantage of earlier and better localization of the pregnancy, with less pelvic discomfo because the bladder is not painfully distended. The double-ring sign and the yolk sac must be identified to ensure that the pregnancy is intrauterine. When an intrauterine pregnancy is not visualized on TVUS and the hCG level exceeds 1000-2000 mIU/mL, suspicion for an ectopic pregnancy should be high. Ref: Hill M.J., DeCherney A.H. (2013).

FALSE with respect to Progestase is,It releases 65 mcg of progesterone per day,Effective life is 1 year,It is a subdermal implant,It reduces menstrual blood loss,"Progesterone IUD (Progestase) The veical shaft is fitted with a capsule containing 38 mg of progesterone dispensed in silicone oil. It delivers progesterone to the uterus at the rate of 65 micrograms/day. Though a few sources claim the effectiveness to be of 2 years, the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)-approved effective life is only 1 year. The contraceptive effectiveness of the progestase is similar to that of Cu IUDs; it reduces menstrual loss but has to be replaced every year and possibly increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy (as it decreases tubal motility).",C

If the fetal trunk is rotated keeping the back anterior and maintaining a downward traction, the posterior shoulder will appear below the symphysis pubis.About other optionso Impacted breech : Inspite of good uterine contractions and complete dilatation of the cervix, the breech fails to descend. This occurs only in extended breech and is usually due to disproportiono Impaction can occur at the inlet, cavity or outlet. If within 30 minutes of full dilatation, the breech does not descend and distend the perineum, caesarean section is done regardless of the level of impaction.Frank Breech Extraction (Pinard's maneuver)o Is done by intrauterine manipulation (for breech decomposition) to convert a frank breech to a footling breech. This is possible when the membranes have ruptured recentlyo In Pinard's maneuver, the middle and index fingers are carried upto the popliteal fossa. It is then pressed and abducted so that the fetal leg is flexed. The fetal foot is grasped at the ankle and breech extraction is accomplished.Option 'c'o For delivery of the after coming head of breech, following maneuvers are used :# Bums marshall method# Forceps delivery# Malar flexion shoulder traction (modified Mauriceau - Smellie - Veit technique).",A

The coagulation profile in a 13-year old girl with Menorrhagia having von Willebrands disease is,Isolated prolonged PTT with a normal PT,Isolated prolonged PT with a normal PTT,Prolongation of both PT and PTT,Prolongation of thrombin time,"In Von willebrand disease there will be abnormal aPTT and normal PT. Activated Paial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) Test This test measures how long it takes for blood to clot. It measures the clotting ability of factors VIII (8), IX (9), XI (11), and XII (12). If any of these clotting factors is too low, it will take longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will show a longer clotting time among some people with VWD. However, the results of this test will be normal among people with mild VWD. Prothrombin Time (PT) Test This test also measures the time it takes for blood to clot. It measures primarily the clotting ability of factors I (1), II (2), V (5), VII (7), and X (10). If the level of any one of these factors is too low, it will take longer than normal for the blood to clot. The results of this test will be normal among most people with VWD.

All of the following are true about regional blood flow in pregnancy except :,Uterine blood flow at term is 750 ml/min,Blood flow through skin decreases,Renal blood flow increases by 50%,Pulmonary blood flow increase,"REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD FLOW: Uterine blood flow is increased from 50 mL/min in non-pregnant state to about 750 mL near term. The increase is due to the combined effect of uteroplacental and fetoplacental vasodilatation. The vasodilatation is due to the smooth muscle relaxing effects of progesterone, estrogen, nitric oxide (endothelium derived factor), prostaglandins and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In a normal pregnancy, vascular system becomes refractory to angiotensin II, endothelin I and other pressure agents. Pulmonary blood flow (normal 6000 mL/min) is increased by 2500 mL/min. Renal blood flow (normal 800 mL) increases by 400 mL/min at 16th week and remains at this level till term. The blood flow through the skin and mucous membranes reaches a maximum of 500 mL/min by 36th week. Heat sensation, sweating or stuffy nose in pregnant woman is thus explained.

"A newborn with ambiguous genitalia and a 46,XY karyotype develops vomiting, low serum sodium concentration, and high serum potassium. Which of the following proteins is most likely to be abnormal?",21-hydroxylase,An ovarian enzyme,5a-reductase,An androgen receptor,"Sex steroids are synthesized from cholesterol by side chain cleavage (employing a P450 enzyme) to produce pregnenolone.Pregnenolone is then conveed to testosterone in the testis, to estrogen in the ovary, and to coicosterone and aldosterone in the adrenal gland. The enzymes 3b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, 11b-hydroxylase, and 18-hydroxylase modify pregnenolone to produce other sex and adrenal steroids. Deficiencies in adrenal 21-hydoxylase can thus lead to inadequate testosterone production in males and produce ambiguous external genitalia. Such children can also exhibit low sodium and high potassium due to deficiency of the more distal steroids, coisol and aldosterone. 5a-reductase conves testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and its deficiency produces milder degrees of hypogenitalism without salt wasting. Deficiency of the androgen receptor is called testicular feminization, producing normal-looking females who may not seek medical attention until they present with infeility.",A
Tuberculosis in children true is,Commonly sputum negative,Incidence < 5% of all TB cases,Clinically child does not show sign of florid TB,All of the above,"Tuberculosis in children :

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Cases of tuberculosis represent 5 - 15 percent of all tubercular cases.

Clinical manifestations of TB in children :

The majority of children with tuberculosis infection develop no signs or symptoms at any level.
Occasionally.

Infection is marked by low - grade fever, mild cough, malaise and u - like symptoms.
A) Primary pulmonary disease the lung is the portal of entry in >  98% of cases.

The primary complex of tuberculosis includes local infection at the portal of entry and regional lymph nodes that drain the area.
The combination of the parenchymal pulmonary - lesion and corresponding lymph node is called Ghon complex.
Asymptomatic pleural effusion is so frequent in primary - tuberculosis that it is basically a component of the primary complex.
Nelson, It may have one of the following course : - Heating by brosis and calcification.
Progressive primary > tuberculosis. Cavity Obstructive emphysema If the incomplete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Resorption atelectasis If the complete obstruction is caused by lymph nodes.
Tubercular bronchitis & bronchiectasis Hematogenous dissemination During early bacteremia seeding may occur at apex Simon's focus.
Miliary tuberculosis Collapse consolidation (segmental lesion) A combination of pneumonitis and atelectasis.

B) Chronic pulmonary tuberculosis :

Infrequent in young children.
Children above the age of seven years, especially girls are more vulnerable.

The commonest site of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the apex of lung Puhl's lesion.

Infraclavicular lesion of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is called Assman's focus.Regional lymph nodes are not involved in chronic pulmonary TB (in contrast to primary TB). Lab investigations of pediatric TB.
ESR and blood counts : No value in diagnosis or follow up of TB.
Demonstration of AFB.
Children don't expectorate out sputum, but swallow it.

Therefore sputum is not available for examination.

A laryngeal swab may be obtained for smear and culture examination for mycobacteriaIt is customer to examine the gastric lavage in children for bacteriological examination on 3 consecutive days, Aspiration of early morning gastric contents (before breakfast) is done with a Ryle's tube and sent for bacteriological examination. Adding vancomycin to the sample improves the yield of mycobacterium. The CSF, Pleural did or bronchial aspirate, urine and discharges from tuberculous sinuses are examined for tubercle bacilli. Histopathology : Material for histopathology may be obtained by biopsy or FNAC.
PCR : High sensitivity and specificity for pleural uid and low for gastric aspirate. CXR and CT may show characteristic features.
USG may be helpful for the detection of enlarged abdominal lymph nodes,
Serology : Elisa or other methods have no utility in pediatric TB. Antitubercular drugs used in children.

Which of the following has life span of upto 10 years?,Progestasert,CuT 380A,LNG-IUD,CuT 250,"Ans. B. CuT 380A. (Ref. Obstetrics D.C. Dutta 6th Ed. - 483).The TCu380A IUD (ParaGard) is a T-shaped polyethylene rod, wrapped with copper around the arms and stem. It is approved for 10 years of continuous use.Good Candidates for TCu380A# Postpartum women, breastfeeding or not, after 4 weeks.# Women with liver disease, hepatitis.# Women with breast cancer.# Women with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.# Women with current or history of ischemic heart disease, stroke.# Women with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Women with uncomplicated valvular heart disease.# Women with current deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism.# Women who have had major surgery.# Women with migraines with or without focal neurological symptoms.# Women with gall bladder disease or history of pregnancy-related cholestasis.The LNG-IUS (Mirena). is a T-shaped polydimethylsiloxane rod con- taining 52 mg LNG. The LNG-IUS is approved for 5 years of use. The LNG-IUS adds an important non-contra- ceptive advantage for this age group: it decreases menstrual blood loss and dysmenorrhea and may avoid the need for hysterectomy or endometrial ablation. The copper IUD is generally associated with heavier menses.In addition to decreasing menstrual blood loss, the local administration of LNG to the endometrium protects it from development of estrogen-induced endometrial hyperplasia. This is of benefit for transitional women with irregular bleeding and for women on tamoxifen therapy following breast cancer. Use of the LNG-IUS is reported to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer by 40-60%.GOOD CANDIDATES FOR LNG-IUS# Women with menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, or endometriosis.# Women with bleeding disorders or on anticoagulation therapy.Women with thalassemia, sickle cell disease, or iron- deficiency anemia.# Breastfeeding women after 4-6 weeks postpartum.Generation of IUCDCoilFailure rateLasts for (years)FirstCuT (200)>2/1003-5 CuT (200)>2/100 SecondMultiload Cu 2501-2 /1003-5 NovaT1-2 /1001-2/100ThirdMultiload Cu 3750.5-111005+ Copper Cu 380A0.3-1/100 Hormone releasingProgestasert (no more manufactured)1lyr LNG-IUCD(52mg Levenorgestrel impregnated; releases at arte of 20?g/day)0.5/100 at 1 yr5 yrs 0.7/100 at 3 yr 1/100 at 5 yr Marina (Latest)Least5 yrsMore Educational points:# Cu T 380A and Levenorgestrel have got lowest rate, whereas progestasert has got highest rate of ectopic pregnancy.# The Mirena IUD works by killing or irreparably damaging sperm and obstructing it's ability to fertilize an egg. It does this by releasing levonorgestrel, also known as progestin.# Progestin is a synthetic substance which imitates the biological activity of the natural hormone progesterone.# Progesterone can inhibit ovulation during pregnancy. Progestin was synthesized for, among reasons, suppresing ovulation for birth control.- Mirena reduces the frequency of ovulation. Ovulation occurs during the menstrual cycle where the ovarian follicle releases an egg. Reduction of the times in which an egg is available to fertilize handicaps the sperm's opportunity for reproduction.- Mirena changes the consistency of cervical mucus. This change thickens the cervical mucus making the passage of sperm through the cervix much more difficult.- Mirena thins the endometrium, the lining of the walls of the uterus. It is thought that this reduces the chances of embryo implantation to the endometrium.LNG-IUCD:# A new device, levonova (LNG IUD) contains 60mg of levonorgestrel and releases the hormone in very low doses i.e. 20 microgram/ day (versus Progestasert which carries 38mg of progesterone and releases 65microgram of the hormone per day).# It is thus longacting (5 years) and has low pregnancy rate of 0-3 per 100 woman years, n However, risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher.# Mechanism of action: - Strong and uniform endometrial suppression - Scanty cervical mucus - Anovulation and insufficient luteal phase and normal progesterone levels, n It can be used as hormone replacing therapy.# It is useful for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia, n Irregular uterine bleeding can be a problem initially.# MIRENA contains 52mg levonorgestrel, eluting 20 microgram daily. It can be retained for 5 years, with failure rate of 0 to 3 per 100 woman years.EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION (Postcoital contraception)Mechanism of action1. Delaying /inhibiting ovulation2.

Quintero staging is used for:,Twin to twin transfusion syndrome,Twin reversed arterial perfusion,Discordant twins,Monoamniotic twins,"Ans. A. Twin to twin transfusion syndromeTwin Twin Transfusion Syndrome: TttsOccurs in monochorionic diamniotic twin gestation resulting from unidirectional flow through deep arteriovenous anastomoses in the shared placenta. In this syndrome blood is transfused from a donor twin to its recipient sibling such that the donor may eventually become anemic and its growth may be restricted. In contrast, the recipient becomes plethoric, develop circulatory overload manifest as hydrops, polycythemic, may develop hyperviscosity and Occlusive thrombosis is another concern. Finally, polycythemia in the recipient twin may lead to severe hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus.TTTS is diagnosed based on two criteria:(1) presence of a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy(2) hydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 8cm in one twin and oligohydramnios defined if the largest vertical pocket is 2cm in the other twin.TTTS is typically staged by the Quintero (1999) staging system:Stage I--urine is still visible sonographically within the bladder of the donor twin.Stage II--criteria of stage I, but urine is not visible within the donor bladder.Stage III--criteria of stage II and abnormal Doppler studies of the umbilical artery, ductus venosus, or umbilical vein.Stage IV--ascites or frank hydrops in either twin.Stage V--demise of either fetus.Treatment - laser ablation of the vascular anastomoses",A
A female developed consumptive coagulopathy after an obstetric event. Consumptive coagulopathy is MOST commonly found in:,Abruptio placentae,IUCD,Dead fetus,Retained products of conception,"Placental abruption can lead to initiation of the coagulation cascade by release of tissue thromboplastin into the maternal circulation. Consumption of coagulation factors and platelets is followed by coagulopathic hemorrhage. A cycle ensues as fuher bleeding worsens the depletion of coagulation factors.

A newborn baby presented with profuse bleeding from umbilical stump after bih. Probable diagnosis is,Factor XIII deficiency,VWF deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Glanzmann thrombosthenia,"Factor XIII deficiency Bleeding from umbilical stump suggests Factor XIII deficiency. Neonates with a positive bleeding history, paicularly with features such as delayed bleeding, umbilical stump bleeding or miscarriages and in whom the initial panel of screening test is negative should be tested for factor XIII deficiency. The normal screening tests such as PT and PTT are normal in factor XIII deficiency because factor XIII is needed to stabilize the clot after a fibrin clot has formed, so tests used for evaluating the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways are not affected. (Note, that factor XIII is used, once the clot has formed.) Test used for evaluation of factor XIII Test used in qualitative evaluation of factor XIII is evaluation of clot stability in 5M urea. Clots formed from normal individuals remain stable in 5M urea, while clots from factor XIII deficient patient dissolve in urea. This assay detects only the most severely affected patients with 1% to 2% factor XIII deficieincy or tests. A quantitative chromogenic assay has been developed but is not yet readily available. In addition to hemorrhages these patients may have poor wound healing a high incidence of infeility among males and aboion among affected females and a high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage. About other options : Von Willebrand disease Patients with Von-Willebrand disease rarely presents in the neonatal period because plasma concentration of Von Willebrand factor is high in neonatal period. Platelet function disorders Genetic disorders that result in deficient platelet function are rare causes of bleeding in infants. Most patients with these platelet disorders do not present in neonatal period but rather later in life. They are not recognized as a problem during the neonatal period. (1) Glanzman's thromboasthenia This is an extremely rare disorder of the blood in which the platelets lack the glycoprotein Hence platelet aggregation cannot occur and bleeding time is significantly prolonged and there is increased bleeding. (ii) Bernard soulier syndrome It is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and large platelets (giant platelets) There is absence of the platelet membrane Gplb/IX complex. Symptoms are consistent with low or dysfunctional platelets and include easy bruising, nosebleeds, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia and occasionally G.1. bleeding Factor XII deficiency It is not associated with clinical bleeding.",A

A 38 week pregnant primigravida with breech presentation is found to have cord prolapse. LEAST chances of cord prolapse are seen in:,Frank breech,Complete breech,Footling,Knee,"Umbilical cord compression and prolapse may be associated with breech delivery, paicularly in complete (5%) and footling (15%) presentations. This is due to the inability of the presenting pa to fill the maternal pelvis, either because of prematurity or poor application of the presenting pa to the cervix so that the umbilical cord is allowed to prolapse below the level of the breech. Frank breech presentation offers a contoured presenting pa, which is better accommodated to the maternal pelvis and is usually well applied to the cervix. The incidence of cord prolapse in frank breech is only 0.5% (the same as for cephalic presentations). Ref: Kish K., Collea J.V. (2007). Chapter 21. Malpresentation & Cord Prolapse. In A.H.

Conjugated equine estrogens are administered orally at dosages up to 10mg daily given in four divided doses. Similarly the drug can be given intravenously in 25mg doses every 4 hours for up to 3 doses. Once bleeding has slowed, patients can be transitioned to an oral taper using COCs.Androgens - Danazol - It is suitable for recurrent symptoms and in patients waiting for hysterectomy. A smaller dose tends to minimize the blood loss and higher dose produces amenorrhea.Gestrinone - can also be used like Danazol.Mifepristone - It is an antiprogesterone.

In pediatric advanced life suppo intraosseous access for drug/fluid administration is recommended for,<1 year,<6 years,<12 years,Any age,"Intraosseous infusion (IO) is the process of injecting directly into the marrow of a bone to provide a non-collapsible entry point into the systemic venous system. This technique is used in emergency situations to provide fluids and medication when intravenous access is not available or not feasible. A comparison of intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and intraosseous (IO) routes of administration concluded that the intraosseous route is demonstrably superior to intramuscular and comparable to intravenous administration (in delivering paediatric anesthetic drugs). Due to the rapid advance and adoption of superior intraosseous access technology, IO access has now become the preferred method of establishing vascular access for patients in whom traditional access is difficult or impossible.

Management should include which of the following?",Irrigation and antimicrobial prophylaxis,Tetanus booster immunization and tetanus toxoid in the wound,Copious irrigation,Primary rabies vaccination for the child,"Mammalian bites should be promptly and thoroughly scrubbed with soap and water and debrided. The decision to suture depends on the location, age, and nature of the wound. Antibiotic prophylaxis is extremely controversial. Most experts suggest a short course of antibiotics should be started for cat, human, or monkey bites. Only 4% of dog bites become infected (and therefore do not necessarily need antibiotic prophylaxis), compared with 35% of cat bites and 50% of monkey bites (which require antibiotics in most cases). Cat bites are usually deep punctures. Human bites almost invariably become infected.The etiologies of these infections are polymicrobial. Pasteurella multocida is a common organism in infected cat and dog bites. Infected human bites tend to have positive cultures for S viridans, S aureus, and Eikenella corrodens. Treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanate orally or ampicillin- sulbactam IV is recommended. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for any bite sustained by an infant, a diabetic, or an immunocompromised patient because of the higher risk of infection in these persons. Since the child is fully immunized, tetanus boosters are not required. Similarly, as the dog was provoked and was fully immunized, rabies should not be a concern.",C

Median chain acyl Co A dehydrogenase deficiency is characterised by all except,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Hypoketotic hypoglycemia,Cardiomyopathy,Episodes associated with fasting,"Clinical characteristics : Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) is one of the enzymes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid b-oxidation. Fatty acid b-oxidation fuels hepatic ketogenesis, which provides a major source of energy once hepatic glycogen stores become depleted during prolonged fasting and periods of higher energy demands. MCAD deficiency is the most common disorder of fatty acid b-oxidation and one of the most common inborn errors of metabolism. Most children are now diagnosed through newborn screening. Clinical symptoms in a previously apparently healthy child with MCAD deficiency include hypoketotic hypoglycemia and vomiting that may progress to lethargy, seizures, and coma triggered by a common illness. Hepatomegaly and liver disease are often present during an acute episode. Children appear normal at bih and - if not identified through newborn screening - typically present between age three and 24 months, although presentation even as late as adulthood is possible. The prognosis is excellent once the diagnosis is established and frequent feedings are instituted to avoid any prolonged periods of fasting. Reference: GHAI Essential pediatrics, 8th edition",C

"A lady of 150 cm height with Hb of 11gm%, BP of 160/110 mm Hg and 12 kg gain during her pregnancy delivered an IUGR baby, the causes in this cases are:",Maternal infection,Short stature,HTN,| Weight gain,"Ans. is c, i.e. HTN (hypertension)Ref. Dutta Obs. 7/e, p 97, p 260, 51Friends, It is a tricky question which needs only common sense. Answer is hidden in the question itself. So, lets read the question once again and rule out each option one by one.The lady in our question is of 150 cm height ( 5 feet).""While an arbitrary measurement of 5 ft. is considered as short stature in western countries, it is 4' 7"" in India considered the low average height"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 98So, the lady is not constitutionally small, i.e. options 'b' is ruled out.Her Hb is 11 gm%.""According to the standards laid down by WHO. anemia in pregnancy is present when the hemoglobin concentration in the peripheral blood is 11gm% or less"". --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 262So, according to the WHO standard 11gm% is borderline for anemia.Anemia leads to IUGR when it is moderately severe i.e. Hb<8 gm% or if it is sickle cell anemia (Fernando arias, 3/e, p 41)So, option 'e' is ruled out.Her BP is 160/110 mm HgHypertension is an absolute rise of BP of at least 140/90 mm Hg, if the previous BP is not known. So, there is no doubt that the patient is hypertensive.Prolonged hypertension leads to placental insufficiency which ultimately results in IUGR.So, option 'c' is correct.Her weight gain is 12 kg.""Ideally weight gain should depend on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) level. Weight gain for a woman with normal BMI (20-26) is 11 to 16 kg"" --Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 51So, the weight gain comes under normal range, option 'd' ruled out.Though maternal infection during pregnancy also causes IUGR, here in our question no such history has been mentioned.So, option 'a' is also ruled out. Hence the answer of this question is, IUGR is due to hypertension.",C

All of the following are seen with Sheehan's syndrome, EXCEPT:",Obesity,Amenorrhoea,Failure to lactate,Absence of secondary sexual characteristics,"Severe intrapaum or early postpaum hemorrhage and associated hypotension is followed by pituitary failure or Sheehan syndrome. It refers to panhypopituitarism. Abrupt, severe hypotension leads to pituitary ischemia and necrosis. It is characterized by failure of lactation, amenorrhea, breast atrophy, loss of pubic and axillary hair, hypothyroidism, and adrenal coical insufficiency. Also know: The pituitary cell types are differentially sensitive to damage. For this reason, prolactin secretion deficiency is the most common, followed by loss of gonadotropin and growth hormone release, loss of ACTH production, and least commonly, by decreases in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion.

Which is seen in nephrotic syndrome,Low serum calcium,Raised AT-III,Low lipid,Platelet activation,"NEPHROTIC SYNDROME:-

 Characterised by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema, hyperlipidemia is often associated.

Some patients show hematuria and hypertension.

Heavy proteinuria( more than 1g/metre square/day) is the underlying abnormality leading to hypoalbuminemia ( serum albumin below 2.5g/dl).
The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure leads to interstitial edema and hypovolemia. This stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and ADH secretion that enhances sodium and water retention.

Hypoalbuminemia also induces hepatic synthesis of beta-lipoproteins resulting in hypercholesterolemia.
 
Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with minimal change disease. Other causes include amyloidosis, vasculitis, SLE, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and hepatitis B nephropathy.

Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome:-

MCNS accounts for 80% cases of nephrotic syndrome. Electron microscopy shows non-specific obliteration of epithelial foot processes. Immunofluorescence studies show deposits of occasional mesangial IgM. 

 Lab findings- urine examination shows heavy proteinuria. Hyaline and granular casts are present. Serum albumin is low. Hypercholesterolemia imparts a milky appearance to plasma. Blood urea and creatinine values within normal range. Blood levels if IgG low and IgM elevated.

Low serum calcium level.

Coming back to question Sorry guys i could not find any reference which clearly mention the answer of this question. o According to me the best answer is 4 months because renal involvement may be seen up to 3 months after the onset of other symptoms (examiner is asking about the renal involvement after onset of disease, not after the onset of other symptoms). ""Renal manifestations usually sta at the onset or within 3 months of the onset of other symptoms"" - Pediatric nephrology o Other symptoms, e.g. rash, will also take some time to appear after the onset of disease.

However, most cases show that the first three months in a pregnancy are when most bih defects occur because that is when the organs of the fetus are beginning to form.One common cause is amniotic band syndrome, which occurs when the inner fetal membrane (amnion) ruptures without injury to the outer membrane (chorion).Fibrous bands from the ruptured amnion float in the amniotic fluid and can get entangled with the fetus, thus reducing blood supply to the developing limbs to such an extent that the limbs can become strangulated, the tissues die and are absorbed into the amniotic fluid.",A

Polyhydramnios not associated with,B/L renal agenesis,Anencephaly,Open spina bifida,Tracheo esophageal fistula,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. B/L renal agenesis Polyhydramnios is defined as a state where liquour amni exceeds 2000 ml.Amniotic fluid measures about 50 ml at 12 weeks, 400 ml at 20 weeks and reaches its peak of 1 litre at 36-38 weeks.There after the amount diminishes till at term it measures about 600-800 ml Amniotic fluid formation:- Early pregnancy - Ultrafiltrate of plasma Beginning of 2nd trimester - Composed largely of extracellular fluid that diffuses through the fetal skin. After 20 weeks - Cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and the amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.The fluid in the amniotic fluid is completely changed and replaced in every 3 hours.Causes of increase in amniotic fluid (Polyhydramnios)Because the fetus normally swallows the amniotic fluid and excretes it through urine it has been assumed that this mechanism is one of the ways by which the volume is controlled.Thus renal agenesis will lead to oligohydramnios not polyhydramnios.Anencephaly causes polyhydramnios because of transudation from exposed meninges and absence of fetal swallowing reflex.Open spina bifida leads to polyhydramnios because of transudation of meninges.Causes of polyhydramnios MaternalPh isoimmunisationDiabetes PlacentalPlacental chrioangiomaCircumvallate placenta syndrome FetalMultiple pregnancyFetal anomaliesCNS abnormalities (Anencephaly)G.L abnormalities (Oesophageal or duodenal atresia)G.

"""Conduplicato corpore"" indicates spontaneous_____",Version,Rectification,Evolution,Expulsion,"Ans. d (Expulsion) (Ref. Williams Obstetrics 22nd/Ch. 20)If the fetus is small--usually less than 800 g--and the pelvis is large, spontaneous delivery is possible despite persistence of the abnormal lie. The fetus is compressed with the head forced against the abdomen. A portion of the thoracic wall below the shoulder thus becomes the most dependent part, appearing at the vulva. The head and thorax then pass through the pelvic cavity at the same time, and the fetus, which is doubled upon itself, sometimes referred to as conduplicato corpore, is expelled.TRANSVERSE LIE# The long axis of the fetus is approximately perpendicular to that of the mother. When the long axis forms an acute angle, an oblique lie results. The latter is usually only transitory, because either a longitudinal or transverse lie commonly results when labor supervenes. For this reason, the oblique lie is called an unstable lie.# In transverse lies, the shoulder is usually over the pelvic inlet, with the head lying in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. In such a shoulder presentation, the side of the mother on which the acromion rests determines the designation of the lie as right or left acromial. Moreover, because in either position the back may be directed anteriorly or posteriorly, superiorly or inferiorly, it is customary to distinguish varieties as dorsoanterior and dorsoposterior.Diagnosis# The diagnosis usually is made easily, often by inspection alone.# On vaginal examination, in the early stages of labor, the side of the thorax, if it can be reached, may be recognized by the ""gridiron"" feel of the ribs. When dilatation is further advanced, the scapula and the clavicle are distinguished on opposite sides of the thorax. The position of axilla indicates the side of the mother toward which shoulder is directed.Etiology# Abdominal wall relaxation from high parity.# Preterm fetus.# Placenta previa.# Abnormal uterine anatomy.# Excessive amnionic fluid.# Contracted pelvis.Mechanism of Labor# Spontaneous delivery of a fully developed newborn is impossible with a persistent transverse lie. After rupture of the membranes, if labor continues, the fetal shoulder is forced into the pelvis, and the corresponding arm frequently prolapses. After some descent, the shoulder is arrested by the margins of the pelvic inlet, with the head in one iliac fossa and the breech in the other. As labor continues, the shoulder is impacted firmly in the upper part of the pelvis. The uterus then contracts vigorously in an unsuccessful attempt to overcome the obstacle. With time, a retraction ring rises increasingly higher and becomes more marked. The situation is referred to as a neglected transverse lie. If not promptly managed, the uterus eventually ruptures, placing the mother and fetus at grave risk. Even with the best of care, morbidity is T because of the frequent association with placenta previa, the T likelihood of cord prolapse, and the necessity for major operative efforts.Management# In general, the onset of active labor in a woman with a transverse lie is an indication for cesarean delivery. Once labor is well established, attempts at conversion to a longitudinal lie by abdominal manipulation will likely not be successful. Before labor or early in labor, with the membranes intact, attempts at external version are worthy of a trial in the absence of other complications that indicate cesarean delivery. If during early labor, the fetal head can be maneuvered by abdominal manipulation into the pelvis, it should be held there during the next contractions in an attempt to fix the head in the pelvis. If these measures fail, cesarean delivery is performed.# Because neither the feet nor the head of the fetus occupies the lower uterine segment, a low transverse incision into the uterus may lead to difficulty in extraction of a fetus entrapped in the body of the uterus above the level of incision. Therefore, a vertical incision is likely to be indicated.",D

"Apoptosis can occur by change in hormone levels in the ovarian cycle.

Shaws 13th/e page 47, (12th/e p 39& 38)After ovulation corpus luteum forms and starts secreting estrogen, progesterone and inhibin. (The increased LH at the time of ovulation is responsible for maintaining the corpus luteum).Continued increase in estrogen and progesterone exerts inhibitory effect on Hypothalamus and pituitary (Remember that increased estrogen plus moderate amount of progesterone exerts negative feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary whereas increased estrogen and small amount of progesterone exerts positive feedback on the pituitary and hypothalamus and cause LH surge).So due to negative feedback of increased estrogen and moderate amount of progesterone the LH and FSH secretion decreasesDue to decreased LH, the corpus luteum starts degenerating and degenerates completely by about 9 days after ovulation.Due to degeneration of corpus luteum estrogen and progesterone secretion decreases rapidly. Due to rapid decrease in estrogen and progesterone the endometrium is unable to sustain itself and sloughs off (this is the end of menstrual cycle)On the other hand if fertilization occurs placenta will be formed. The placenta starts secreting a hormone called b HCG which maintains the corpus luteum and thus corpus luteum continues secreting estrogen and progesterone.

True about 1 year old child with PDA is –,Symptoms similar to Aorto pulmonary window,Chances of spontaneous closure high,Indomethacin may help in closure,Endocarditis is rare,"Before comparing the symptoms of PDA & Aortopulmonary window let me discuss the C/F of PDA.

Patent ductus arteriosus is a communication between pulmonary artery and Aorta after fetal life.

PDA results in left to right shunt from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The flow occurs both during systole and diastole as a pressure gradient is present throughout the cardiac cycle between the 2 great arteries. This flow of blood results in continuous murmur it is usually heard at 2nd left interspace.
In patients with large left to right shunt a low pitched mitral mid diastolic murmur is audible at the apex, owing to the increased volume of blood flow across the mitral valve.
There are other conditions which can produce systolic and diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area such as Aortopulmonary window defect.



In Aortopulmonary window defect there is communication between the ascending aorta and main pulmonary artery. Usually the defect is large therefore the pressure between the two great arteries tends to equalize and flow is established only during systole when left ventricular contraction increases the aortic pressure. So the murmur in Aortopulmonary window defect is systolic with mid diastolic rumble due to increased blood flow through mitral valve.
Sometimes when the Aortopulmonary window defect is small, there is continuous blood flow from Aorta to pulmonary artery resulting in continuous murmur. In this condition symptoms of Aorticopulmonary window defect mimics the symptoms of PDA (Continuous murmur, wide pulse pressure,mid diastolic murmur). It is very difficult to distinguish between the 2 condition.
Chances of spontaneous closure in PDA in term infant is rare (chances of spontaneous closure of PDA is more in preterm infants.)
If diagnosis of PDA can be made within the first - two weeks, indomethacin can be given to close the defect. (But since the child is one year old Indomethacin is of no help).
In PDA there is increased risk of infective endocarditis.",A

What is the cause of Late deceleration on an NST?,Head compression,Uteroplacental insufficiency,Cord compression,All of the above,"Acceleration refers to an increase in fetal hea rate above baseline and deceleration to a decrease below baseline rate. The nomenclature most commonly used in the United States is based upon the timing of the deceleration in relation to contractions--thus, early, late or variable in onset related to the corresponding uterine contraction. The waveform of these deceleration is also significant for pattern recognition. In early and Late deceleration, the slope of fetal hea rate change is gradual, resulting in a curvilinear and uniform or symmetrical waveform. With variable deceleration, the slope of fetal hea rate change is abrupt and erratic, giving the waveform a jagged appearance. It has been proposed that deceleration be defined as recurrent if they occur with 50 percent or more of contractions in any 20-minute period (NICHD Research Planning Workshop, 1997). Another system now used less often for description of deceleration is based on the pathophysiological events considered most likely to cause the pattern. In this system, early deceleration are termed head compression, Late deceleration are termed uteroplacental insufficiency, and variable deceleration become cord compression patterns. The nomenclature of type I (early), type II (late), and type III (variable) ""dips"" proposed by Caldeyro-Barcia and co- workers (1973) is not used in the United States.",B

Best indicator for nutritional status for a child is –,Mid arm circumference,Head circumference,Rate of increase of height and weight,Chest circumference,"Health and development are intimately interconnected.
Proper nutrition of children is fundamental to the achievement of sustainable development.
Anthropometric measurements are the most widely used indicators of nutritional status in a community.
The commonly used anthropometric measurements are -
Weight  
Length / height   
Arm circumference                              
Chest circumference
Skinfold thickness          

Measurement of weight and rate in gain in weight are the best single parameters for assessing physical growth.

The comparison of a child's height and weight with the standard growth chart helps to determine if the particular child is within the expected normal range for his age, sex and socioeconomic status.
It does not indicate if the rate of growth of child was normal in the recent past.
The point to stress here is that it is very difficult to recognize a recent disturbance in growth by comparing weight or height with the reference standards because a clearly abnormal percentile position on the growth chart becomes evident only when the factors retarding growth are profound or if they have persisted for a considerable time.
Measurement of the velocity of growth or increment in unit time is a better tool for early identification of factors affecting growth and also for assessment of the usefulness of social and remedial measures.",C

Here the nucleotide triplet CTC for GAG in mRNA), which encodes glutamic acid, is changed to CAC (or GUG in mRNA), which encodes valine. This single amino acid substitution alters the physicochemical properties of hemoglobin, giving rise to sickle cell anemia.Sickle Cell DiseaseSickle cell disease is a common hereditary hemoglobinopathy that occurs primarily in individuals of African descentQ.Caused by a point mutation in the sixth codon of b-globin that leads to the replacement of a glutamate residue with a valine residueQ.In certain populations in Africa the prevalence of heterozygosity is as high as 30%. This high frequency probably stems from protection afforded by HbS against falciparum malariaQ.Pathogenesis:HbS molecules undergo polymerization when deoxygenated.Initially the red cell cytosol converts from a freely flowing liquid to a viscous gel as HbS aggregates form.With continued deoxygenation aggregated HbS molecules assemble into long needle-like fibers within red cells, producing a distorted sickle or holly-leaf shapeQ.Presence of HbS underlies the major pathologic manifestationsChronic hemolysisQMicrovascular occlusionsQTissue damageQMorphology:Peripheral blood demonstrates variable numbers of irreversibly sickled cells, reticulocytosis, and target cells, Howell-Jolly bodiesQ (small nuclear remnants).The bone marrow is hyperplastic as a result of a compensatory erythroid hyperplasiaQ.Expansion of the marrow leads to bone resorption and secondary new bone formation, resulting in prominent cheekbones and changes in the skull that resemble a crew-cut in X-raysQ.Increased breakdown of hemoglobin can cause pigment gallstones and hyperbilirubinemiaQ.Splenic infarction, fibrosis, and progressive shrinkage (autosplenectomy)Q.",B

In older children, exercise intolerance can be noted if the lesion is of significant size. On examination, the pulses are normal, a right ventricular systolic lift at the left sternal border is palpable, and a fixed splitting of the second heart sound is audible. For lesser degrees of ASD, surgical treatment is controversial.VSD commonly presents as a harsh or blowing holosystolic murmur best heard along the left lower sternum, often with radiation throughout the precordium. The auscultatory finding of tricuspid regurgitation is typically a blowing holosystolic murmur, augmented during inspiration, and best heard at the left lower sternal border; a middiastolic rumble may also be heard. A history of birth asphyxia or findings of other cardiac lesions may be present. Tetralogy of Fallot is a common form of congenital heart disease. The four abnormalities include right ventricular outflow obstruction, VSD, dextroposition of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy; the cyanosis presents in infants and in young children. Mitral valve prolapse occurs with the billowing into the atria of one or both mitral valve leaflets at the end of systole. It is a congenital abnormality that frequently manifests only during adolescence or later. It is more common in girls than in boys and seems to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. On clinical examination, an apical murmur is noted late in systole, which can be preceded by a midsystolic click. The diagnosis is confirmed with an echocardiogram that shows prolapse of the mitral leaflets during mid to late systole.",A

"A neonate presented with fever, lethargy, abdominal distension, vomiting and constipation. Clinically he was diagnosed as volvulus neonatarum with suspected perforation. The best investigation would be –",Plain x–ray,Barium enema,Upper GI endoscopy,Barium meal follow through,"Volvulus neonatorum 

The fetal alimentary canal returns from the extraembryonic coelom into the abdomen at 8-10 weeks and the bowel undergoes rotation and fixation at certain points by the attachment of its mesentery to the posterior abdominal wall.
When the process is incomplete or deviates from the normal plan, the result is malfixation or malrotation.
Commonly, the normal oblique attachment of the mesentery from duodenojejunal flexure of the caecum is absent, and the small bowel is attached to the posterior abdominal wall by a narrow stalk based around superior mesenteric vessels. The caecum is undescended, i.e., situated in the right hypochondrium and abnormally fixed by peritoneal bands running laterally across the second part of the duodenum.
The poorly attached small bowel undergoes volvulus around the axis of the 'universal mesentery', which is twisted so that the flow of blood is cut off, producing a strangulating obstruction of the small bowel. This typically occurs in the newborn, hence the term `Volvulus neonatorum'. The terminal ileum and caecum are drawn into the volvulus and are wrapped around the stalk of the mesentery in two or three tight coils.

Clinical feature 

A young infant, previously healthy, starts bile-stained vomiting during the first few days of the live. The abdomen is soft and non-distended; however, abdominal distension may occur which is limited to upper abdomen (epigastrium).
No obstruction may occur in the first day or two after birth and meconium may be passed normally. Then, with variable suddenness, bowel actions cease with onset of obstruction.
The signs vary, depending on the degree of intestinal obstruction versus ischemia. When strangulation occurs there are signs of shock, especially pallor and a vague mass of congested bowel may be palpable in the centre of the abdomen. Blood or blood-tinged mucus may be passed rectally.
Ischemia may result in gangrene and perforation.

Investigations  

Barium contrast studies with fluoroscopy (Barium meal follow through) is the investigation of choice as X-ray is not reliable in early stages of volvulus.
However, if the perforation is suspected, barium contrast should not be used because of the risk of peritonitis. Water-soluble contrast studies (iodine based) should be used. Plain X-ray of abdomen/chest is the initial investigation to demonstrate free air under the diaphragm in suspected cases of perforation.",A

Teenage pregnancy is associated with all except:,Caesarean Section is more common,Eclampsia more common,Post dated pregnancy,| Maternal moality rate,"Ans. is c i.e. Post dated pregnancy Friends- Teenage pregnancy is not only a new topic for PGME exams but has envolved as an emerging problem in our daily OPD'S Hence I am giving in detail about Teenage pregnancy. Defination Teenage pregnancy is defined as pregnancy occurring in a girl below the age of 19. It can be divided into two groups. (i) the 17-19 group and (ii) the below 17 group. All the complications are more in the later group. Incidence Teenage pregnancy accounts for about 10-12% of all bihs. There are two categories of teenage pregnancies, the unwed mothers and the married teenagers. The increasing incidence of the first category is due to changing social norms, permissive attitudes of society, influence of the media and poor access to contraception. The fast breaking down of the joint family system, increase in drug addiction and premarital sex are all responsible for the increase in unwed mothers in our society. However, another large contributing factor for teen pregnancies is child marriage, which still prevails in many Indian states like Rajasthan and Bihar. Complications Maternal In general , maternal moality and morbidity are more among teenage pregnancies especially in the below 15 group and the unwed mothers because there is lack of antenatal care and a tendency to conceal the pregnancy in many cases. Criminal and septic aboions are more in these girls in spite of aboion being liberalized in India. Antepaum complications like anaemia. malnutrition and pre- eclampsia are also much more in teenage pregnancy. Obstetric complications are also increased like, preterm labour, fetal prematurity and IUGR. Cephalopelvic dispropoion may be a problem in the very young teenagers. as they may not have attained complete skeletal maturity. Therefore. the incidence of caesarean section may be more in this group. Other labour complications are also increased if they present for the first time in labour, with out proper antenatal care. 4. Psychological problems. Pregnancy in a teenager is usually unplanned and the girl is undergoing severe mental and emotional trauma. Added to that , she may not be getting adequate family suppo. Depressive disorders and suicidal attempts are common in pregnancy. Even after delivery, maternal- fetal bonding may not be satisfactory. They are more prone to depressive problems and postpaum psychosis after delivery. Long-Term consequences Physical. Induced aboions may increase the risk of recurrent miscarriage, preterm labour and low bih weight babies in the subsequent pregnancy. There is also a higher chance of infeility later on due to infection and blocked tubes. Early age of onset of sexual intercourse and first pregnancy increases the risk of cancer cervix and preinvasive lesions of the cervix.

Cyanotic Congenitial hea diseases o Cyanotic CHDs are Right to Left shunts. o These are fuher divided into : ? 1) Cyanotic CHD with decreased pulmonary blood flow. This group includes TOF, Pulmonary atresia with intact septum, tricuspid atresia, total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction. These lesions have following components : - a)Obstruction to pulmonary blood flow at tricuspid right ventricular or pulmonary valve level. b)A pathway by which systemic venous blood enters the systemic circulation a patent foramen ovale or ASD or VSD. Degree of cyanosis depends on the degree of obstruction to pulmonary blood flow : - i) Mild obstruction Cyanosis is precipitaed by stress, but may be absent at rest. ii) Severe obstruction Pulmonary blood flow is dependent on patency of the ductus aeriosus. When the ductus closes (10-21 days), the neonate experience profound hypoxemia, cyanosis and shock. 2) Cyanotic CHD with increased pulmonary blood flow. This group of lesions is not associated with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow. Cyanosis caused by any of the following mechanisms. i) Abnormal ventricular-aerial connection (e.g., Transposition of great vessels) In this, aoa arises from ventricle, So that systemic venous blood returning to the right atrium is pumped directly back to the body, and oxygenated blood returning from lung is pumped back into the lungs. ii) Total mixing of systemic venous and pulmonary venous blood (e.g., total anomalous pulmonary venous return, truncus aeriosus, a common atrium or ventricle) Deoxygenated systemic venous blood and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood mix completely in the hea and, as a result, oxygen saturation is equal in the pulmonary aery and aoa. If pulmonary blood flow is not obstructed, these infants have a combination of Cyanosis and hea failure. In Contrast, if pulmonary stenosis is present, these infants have cyanosis alone.",C

The dose of folic acid per day for treating megaloblastic anaemia in pregnancy,400 μg,1 mg,5mg,2 mg,"Folic acid deficiency in Pregnancy

In nonpregnant women, the folic acid requirement is 50 to 100 μg/day
During pregnancy, requirements are increased and 400 μg/day is recommended 

The earliest biochemical evidence is low plasma folic acid concentrations 
Normal serum folate levels

Non Pregnant women: 5.4-18ng/ml
1st trimester: 2.6-15ng/ml
2nd trimester: 0.8-24ng/ml
3rd trimester: 1.4-20.7ng/ml


Early morphological changes usually include neutrophils that are hypersegmented and newly formed erythrocytes that are macrocytic
 As the anaemia becomes more intense, peripheral nucleated erythrocytes appear, and bone marrow examination discloses megaloblastic erythropoiesis
The fetus and placenta extract folate from maternal circulation so effectively that the fetus is not anaemic despite severe maternal anaemia

Treatment

 As little as 1mg of folic acid administered orally once daily produces a striking haematological response
By 4 to 7 days after beginning folic acid treatment, the reticulocyte count is increased, and leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are corrected

PCOD (Ref: Jeffcott 6/e p205; Shaw's 14/331-332, 13/e p353-354; Novaks 14/1077, 1082) Most likely etiology in a 20-year old average weight female with complains of oligomenorrhea and facial hair with raised free testosterone levels and normal morphology of ovaries on ultrasound is PCOD. Drug not given in PCOD in a 30-year-old lady with infertility is tamoxifen. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome/Stein Levinthal's Syndrome Diagnostic Criteria for PCOS Major Minor * Chronic anovulationQ * HyperandrogenemiaQ * Clinical signs of hyperandrogenemiaQ * Other etiologies excludedQ * Insulin resistanceQ * Perimenarchal onset of hirsutism and obesityQ * Elevated LH to FSH ratioQ * Intermittent anovulation with hyperandrogenemiaQ Clinical Features: Seen mostly in 15-25 years of ageQ It includes chronic non-ovulation and hyperandrogenemia associated with normal or raised estrogen (E2), raised LH, low FSH/LH ratio.Q The raised E2 level causes negative feedback to pituitary resulting in diminished FSH, but raised LHQ. The involvement of the adrenal gland is seen in raised androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. Much of the testosterone is secreted by the ovarian stromaQ Appearance: Macroseopically, the ovaries are often bilaterally enlarged, with thick capsuled The surface may be lobulated but the peritoneal surface is free from adhesions. Multiple cyst 0.5 to 1 mm and at times up to 20 mm in size are localized along the surface of the ovary giving a ""necklace"" appearance on ultrasoundQ. Theca cell hyperplasia is seen which produces excess testosterone secretion. Ultrasound shows several ""subcapsular cysts"" of varying size, diagnostic of PCOSQ. Laparoscopic evaluation is not only diagnostic, but also therapeuticQ. Treatment: Weight lossQ of more than 5% of previous weight is important. Cigarette smoking should be avoidedQ Estrogen best given with progesterone with no androgenic properties. Dexamethasone 0.5 mg at bedtime also reduces androgen production. Hirsutism is treated with cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. Infertility is treated with Clomiphene, 80% ovulate and 40% conceive. However, abortion rate of 25-40% is due to corpus luteal phase defect manifested by ClomipheneQ. In Clomiphene failed group, ovulation can be induced with FSH or GnRH analoguesQ Metformin treats the root cause of PCOSQ, rectifies endocrine and metabolic functions and improves fertility and is drug of choiceQ. Surgery (laparoscopic multiple puncture of cyst) is reserved for those in whom: Medical therapy fails Hyperstimulation occurs Use of GnRH analogue is a cost constraint Consequences of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Short-Term Consequences Long-Term Consequences * Menstrual dysfunctionQ (Irregular menses): - Amenorrhea.

HIV transmission in relation to pregnancy is maximum during:,Labor and delivery,First trimester,Second trimester,Breastfeeding,"Ans. A. Labor and deliverya. The maximum risk is at labor and delivery. A baby can become infected with HIV in the womb, during delivery or while breast-feeding. If the mother does not receive treatment, 25% of babies born to women with HIV will be infected by the virus.b. With treatment that percentage can be reduced to less than 2%. If no preventative steps are taken, the risk of HIV transmission during childbirth is estimated to be 10-20%.c. The chance of transmission is even greater if the baby is exposed to HIV-infected blood or fluids. Health care providers should avoid performing amniotomies (intentionally rupturing the amniotic sac to induce labor), episiotomies and other procedures that expose the baby to the mother's blood.d. The risk of transmission increases by 2% for every hour after membranes have been ruptured.e. Cesarean sections performed before labor and/or the rupture of membranes may significantly reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.f. About 15% of newborns born to HIV-positive women will become infected if they breastfeed for 24 months or longer.",A

So, the boy in question has portal hypertension.
Three most common causes of portal hypertension are:


Extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO)
Non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis (NCPF)
Cirrhosis.


In cirrhosis, jaundice & ascitis are prominent. So, this option is ruled out.
Now we are left with EHPVO and NCPF. Both these causes non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, i.e. portal hypertension without signs of liver dysfunction.
Both these have similar clinical picture except for the age of presentation.
EHPVO is usually' seen in young male children (1st and 2nd decade) while NCPF is a disease of adults (25-35 years).

A 20-year-old G2P1 patient comes to see you at 17 weeks gestational age to review the results of her triple test done 1 week ago. You tell the patient that her maternal serum a-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is 2.0 multiples of the median (MOM). The patient's obstetrical history consists of a term vaginal delivery 2 years ago without complications. What do you tell your patient regarding how to proceed next?,Explain to the patient that the blood test is diagnostic of a neural tube defect and she should consult with a pediatric neurosurgeon as soon as possible,Tell the patient that the blood test result is most likely a false-positive result and she should repeat the test at 20 weeks,Refer the patient for an ultrasound to confirm dates,Offer the patient immediate chorionic villus sampling to obtain a fetal karyotype,"The multiple marker screening test, also referred to as the expanded AFP test or triple screen, consists of maternal serum measurements of estriol, human chorionic gonadotropin, and a-fetoprotein. The multiple marker screening test is used to determine a pregnant patient's risk of having a baby with an- euploidy and a neural tube defect. The AFP test has the greatest sensitivity when done between 16 and 18 weeks. A maternal serum AFP level that is greater than or equal to 2.0 to 2.5 MOM indicates an elevated risk for a neural tube defect and indicates that further workup and evaluation are needed. The first step when an elevated serum AFP result is obtained is to have the patient undergo an ultrasound to verify that the gestational age of the pregnancy is correct. The sonogram can also identify a fetal death in utero, multiple gestation, or a neural tube or abdominal defect, which could all explain the elevated AFP level. A repeat serum AFP test can be done, because at a level of 2.0 MOM there is some overlap between normal and affected pregnancies. The repeat test should be done as soon as possible; waiting until 20 weeks decreases the sensitivity of the test and wastes valuable time in the workup. An amniocentesis is recommended if a neural tube defect is suspected, in order to measure amniotic fluid levels of AFP and therefore confirm the findings of the maternal serum AFP. The physician would not immediately refer the patient for a chorionic villus sampling because this procedure obtains placental tissue for fetal karyotyping and does not add to information regarding the presence of a neural tube defect. A cordocentesis or percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS) is a procedure whereby the umbilical vein is punctured under ultrasonic guidance and a fetal blood sample is obtained. Usually a PUBS is performed when rapid fetal karyotyping must be done, such as in a situation where severe growth restriction exists. PUBS is most commonly used in situations where fetal hydrops exists to obtain information regarding fetal platelet counts and fetal hematocrits.",C

"A 13-year-old patient with sickle-cell anemia presents with respiratory distress; she has an infiltrate on chest radiograph. The laboratory workup of the patient reveals the following: hemoglobin 5 g/dL; hematocrit 16%; white blood cell count 30,000/mL; and arterial blood (room air) pH 7.1, PO2 35 mm Hg, and PaCO2 28 mm Hg. These values indicate which of the following?","Acidemia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, and hypoxia","Alkalemia, respiratory acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, and hypoxia",Acidosis with compensatory hypoventilation,Long-term metabolic compensation for respiratory alkalosis,"While some texts use the terms acidosis and acidemia interchangeably, there are subtle differences. The low pH in the arterial blood can be called acidemia; it is caused by a metabolic acidosis that is a direct result of poor perfusion and lactic acid produced by anaerobic metabolism in tissues with inadequate oxygen delivery. Inadequate oxygenation is caused by the low PO2 , the low oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (Hgb 5 g/dL), and circulatory inadequacy due to the sickling itself and to the vascular disease it produces. The low PCO2 reflects the hyperventilation, which is secondary to the respiratory difficulty, and to the anemia, and is also respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis. Note that some texts distinguish the two terms by using acidemia to refer specifically to inborn errors of metabolism that lead to low serum pH.",A
Acetic acid staining of cervix shows the following EXCEPT :,Squamous metaplasia,Cervical carcinoma in situ,Cervical polyp,Cervical dysplasia,"Cervical polyp Ans. is c i.e. Cervical polyp Colposcopy is done in case of suspected CIN and Cervical dysplasias. Colposcope is a binocular microscope. In colposcopy after visualising the suspected area on cervix with naked eyes, acetic acid (3 - 5%) is applied for better visualization.deg Principle : Application of acetic acid to normal glycogen producing epithelium of cervix does not produce any effect and it appears pink during colposcopy. But when acetic acid is applied to dysplastic epithelium which have large nuclei with abnormally large amounts of chromatin (i.e. wtein) acetic acid coagulates the proteins of the nucleus and cytoplasm, making the proteins opaque and whitethus dysplastic cells and cancerous cells appear white (called as Aceto white) (i.e. option ""13- and ""d""are correctleck The immature metaplaIfcells have larger nuclei and also show some effects of the acetic acid.

In MOST cases, the disease process of this patient affects which of the following anatomic structures?",Cervix,Fallopian tube,Ovary,Peritoneal cavity,"Approximately 98% of the time, ectopic pregnancies are located in the fallopian tube. It is believed that improper transpo of the feilized ovum through the fallopian tube is the most common pathophysiology leading to ectopic pregnancy. Several risk factors are associated with such improper transpo, including pelvic inflammatory disease and prior tubal surgery. Pelvic inflammatory disease and prior tubal surgery result in intraperitoneal scarring and adhesions that can alter the finely tuned transpo mechanisms in the fallopian tubes that are responsible for ensuring that the feilized ovum makes it to the endometrial cavity. Occasionally an ectopic pregnancy can be located in the cervix but this is very uncommon. The cervix is one of the three segments of the uterus (the other two being the body and the fundus). An ectopic pregnancy in this location can be difficult to address surgically. Some ectopic pregnancies are located on or near the ovary. The ovary lies near the fallopian tube in the broad ligament. Ectopic pregnancies on the ovary are also very uncommon. Very rarely an ectopic pregnancy will be located in the peritoneal cavity where it may attach to the surrounding intestines. There are case repos of some of these pregnancies making it to term, although this is extremely rare.",B

Basal vacuolization is the earliest evidence of ovulation (36-48 hours after ovulation) and persists until the about 21st day of the cycle.
Pseudostratification of nuclei is characteristic of proliferation phase but persists until active progesterone secretion begins. Hence, it is noted until the 18th 19th day of the menstrual cycle.",B
A new born infant is diagnosed with phenylketonuria. The enzyme that is deficient is,Phenylamine oxidase,Tyrosine hydroxylase,Phenylalanine hydroxylase,Dihydropteridine reductase,"Phenylketonuria is a disorder of phenylalanine metabolism and occurs due to deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase.It is a recessive condition.Here,phenylalanine could not be conveed to tyrosine,so phenylalanine accumulates and alternate minor pathways are opened to produce and excrete phenylketone(phenyl pyruvate),phenyl lactate and phenyl acetate in urine. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is an enzyme your body uses to conve phenylalanine into tyrosine, which your body needs to create neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. PKU is caused by a defect in the gene that helps create phenylalanine hydroxylase. When this enzyme is missing, your body can't break down phenylalanine. This causes a buildup of phenylalanine in your body. Reference:Essential pediatrics-Ghai,8th edition,page no:652;Textbook of biochemistry-DM Vasudevan,6th edition,page no:207",C

"A 45 year old woman repos that she has been having increased involuntary loss of urine, which is especially pronounced when she is feeling nervous or while sitting at her desk. Jogging does not worsen the incontinence. She has not had these symptoms in the past and is otherwise healthy. She is not taking any medications and has never been pregnant. On physical examination, she is afebrile, with stable vital signs. Her abdomen is benign, and vaginal examination reveals no prolapse. Sensation in all extremities is intact, with good motor strength. Her gait is normal, and reflexes are intact. Her work-up reveals a negative urinalysis, and blood cultures and urine cultures are all negative. Serum glucose level and glycosylated hemoglobin level is normal. Which of the following tests would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",Intravenous pyelogram (IVP),Stress testing,Q-tip test,Cystometry,"The patient most likely has detrusor instability or dyssynergia. She does not seem to have a neurologic, infectious, or systemic (e. g. , diabetes) disorder. Since she can tolerate jogging without a problem, she probably does not have stress-induced incontinence (SUI). Thus, the diagnosis will probably be made by cystometry to assess her urodynamics. This test is also used to evaluate bladder capacity and tone. An IVP would be used in a patient with renal failure. It would help delineate the cause of reduced urinary output. Essentially, a dye is injected, and films are taken to track the uptake in the kidneys. This would not help in the evaluation of incontinence. Stress testing reveals leakage of urine coincident with increased intra-abdominal pressure, which is diagnostic of stress urinary incontinence. The Q-tip test is an indirect measure of the urethral axis (angle of inclination). A Q-tip is inseed into the urethra with the patient in the lithotomy position. If the Q-tip moves more than 30 degrees from the horizontal, there is abnormal urethral mobility. This would be helpful in the evaluation of stress urinary incontinence, since it would help indicate a distoion between the urethra and the bladder.

Most commonly performed type of tubal ligation in current practice:,Pomeroy's method,Irwing's operation,Yoon ring application,Madlener procedure,"Ans. a (Pomeroy's method). (Ref. Textbook of Gynecology by Shaw 13th ed. 236)TUBAL STERILIZATIONOperationa) Pomeroys technique: This technique involves grasping and elevating a 2-cm midsegment of tube, ligating the tubal loop with a 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then excising the distal portion of the loop,b) Parkland method: opening created in mesosalpinx and prox portion of tube is cut.c) Irving procedure: Begins similarly to the Parkland method. However, after the knot on the proximal tubal segment is secured, the ties are left longd) Uchida method : Tubal serosa is first separated from the muscularis by a subserosal injection of a dilute saline solution of epinephrine (1:100,000). A longitudinal incision is made in the ballooned serosa on its surface opposite the mesosalpinx. The serosal peritoneum then is grasped and dissected away from the underlying tubal muscularis. Following this dissection, a 5- cm midsegment of dissected fallopian tube is ligated proximally and distally with 2-0 chromic or plain catgut suture, and then resected. The raw serosal edges are reapproximated, burying the proximal cut tubal end within the leaves of the broad ligament and exteriorizing the distal end from the broad ligamentLaparoscopic# Tubal ligation and resection (removal) of a portion of the fallopian tube is the most frequent method of blocking the tubes.# This involves tying a segment of tube and removing it.# There are many variations of this technique.# The tubal ligation procedure described by Dr. Ralph Pomeroy a century ago is most commonly used today.Steps: With the Pomeroy method of tubal ligation, part of the tube is elevated to create a loop or knuckle. An absorbable ligature is tied around the base of the elevated segment, and the tubal segment is cut out.Within a few days, the peritoneum (tissue that lines the organs of the abdominal cavity) grows over and covers the cut ends of the tubal segments. The cut ends of the fallopian tube separate as the ligature dissolves. The peritoneal covering and separation of the remaining tubal segments prevent them from re-attaching to each other.The Pomeroy method of tubal ligation is good if tubal reversal surgery is to be considered later. Approximately two- thirds of women with a Pomeroy tubal ligation become pregnant following tubal ligation reversal.Laparoscopic tubal sterilization methods:# Unipolar coagulation (First method of LTD to achieve widespread use)# Bipolar coagulation (Least failure rate)# Silicone rubber bands (Yoon's clip)# Spring clips (Hulka's clip)# Filshie clipModified Pomeroy Method. Many modifications of the Pomeroy technique have been described. One technique creates an avascular window in the mesosalpinx at a midpoint along the tube. Through this window, suture similar to that used for the Pomeroy method is passed. The portion of tube that lies proximal to this window is ligated first. The long ends of this suture then are tied around the entire tubal loop, as in the Pomeroy method. The distal portion of the loop is excised.",A

Marker for the renal vasculitis in children is ?,Increased IgA level,Low complement level,| Antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody titre,Increase antinuclear antibody,"Ans is 'a' i.e., Increased IgA o IgA nephropathy or Berger's disease affects children and young adult and is perhaps the most frequent type of glomerulonephritis in children. IgA nephropathy (Berger nephropathy) C.) It is the most common type of glomerulonephritis world wide. Children and young adults are commonly affected. o It occurs after an upper respiratory tract infection or gastrointestinal infection. Clinical presentation Gross hematuria within 1-2 days after on upper respiratory tract infection. This feature distinguish it from PSGN. In PSGN hematuria occurs 7-21 days after respiratory infection. o Can also present with nephritic or nephrotic syndrome. o Mild to moderate hypeension. Pathology o Focal and segmental mesangial proliferation. o IgA deposition in mesangium. o Serum complement level is normal. This feature also differentiates it from PSGN. In PSGN complement (C3) level is decreased. o Whereas IgA nephropathy is an isolated renal disease, similar IgA deposits are also found in systemic disorders of children like Henoch shonlein purpura, which also have renal vasculitis as a component In view of the high frequency of IgA nephropathy in children, IgA can be used as marker for renal vasculitis.",A

Viral hepatitis (HAV, HBV)
Eclampsia, preeclampsia (HELLP syndrome)
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy
Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Let us discuss each option separately
Preeclampsia and eclampsia/HELLP syndrome:

It is the most common cause of abnormal liver function test in women.
Amniotransferases are modestly elevated.
But in these cases delivery of the fetus is followed by rapid normalization of the hepatic abnormalities.
Moreover the question does not mention any history of PIH, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia (HELLP syndrome).

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy:

Acute fatty liver develops in the third trimester.
Jaundice develops a few days after the onset. The serum bilirubin is rarely above 10 mg/dL.
Alkaline phosphate is markedly elevated.
Aminotransferases are moderately elevated.
A markedly raised serum ammonia is the most diagnostic finding in establishing the diagnosis of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and symptoms rapidly abate with parturition in most patients.

Fulminant hepatic failure:

The patient presents with features of severe acute hepatitis leading to the development of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of onset.
The bilirubin increases to 20-30 mg/dL.
The aminotransferase levels are very high (>1000)
Alkaline phosphatase moderately elevated.
Delivery is usually the best treatment.

Budd-Chiari syndrome:

It is a disorder characterized by thrombotic occlusion of the hepatitis veins.
It is a rare complication of pregnancy.
Most of the cases presents within few weeks of delivery but in several cases onset occurs during pregnancy.
Clinical triad of Budd-Chiari syndrome includes sudden onset of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites (ascites with high protein content is almost always present) near term or shortly after delivery.
Tender hepatomegaly is one of the hallmark of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Aminotransferases are mildly elevated.
Jaundice is seen in only half of the cases.",D
The amount of amniotic fluid at 12 weeks of pregnancy is:,50 ml,100 ml,200 ml,400 ml,"Amniotic fluid measures about 50 ml at 12 weeks, 400 ml at 20 weeks and reaches its peak of 1 litre at 36-38 weeks. Thereafter the amount diminishes, till at term it measures about 600-800 ml. As the pregnancy continues post term, fuher reduction occurs to the extent of about 200 ml at 43 weeks. In general, the volume increases by 10 mL per week at 8 weeks and increases up to 60 mL per week at 21 weeks, then declines gradually back to a steady state by 33 weeks.

All of the following statements regarding total anomalous pulmonary connection are true except –,The total pulmonary venous blood reaches the right atrium,Always associated with a VSD,The oxygen saturation of the blood in the pulmonary artery is higher than that in the aorta,Infracardiac type is always obstructive,"Hemodynamics of TAPVC 

TAPVC results in the pulmonary venous blood reaching the right atrium which also receives the systemic venous blood.
This results in volume overload to right atrium -p Right atrial enlargement.
Larger volume of blood reaches the right ventricle --> Right ventricle enlargement.
The blood flow to the left atrium is through patent foramen ovale or ASD.
Because there is mixing of unoxygenated blood from systemic circulation and oxygenated blood from pulmonary circulation in the right atrium —> The oxygen saturation of blood in pulmonary artery is higher or identical to that in Aorta.
TAPVC can be divided into : -

i) TAPVC with pulmonary venous obstruction

Pulmonary venous obstruction results in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary obstruction —> T back pressure —> 1' Pulmonary capillary pressure

T Pulmonary artery pressure
u Because of pulmonary venous obstruction oxygenated blood cannot reach heart —> Cyanosis and CHF during first week of life.
ii) TAPVC without obstruction (more common)

In TAPVC without obstruction, pulmonary blood flow is high.
Patients develops CHF at around 6-8 weeks when the fetal pulmonary resistance falls maximally and pulmonary circulation reaches the maximum.
Infracardiac type of TAPVC is always obstructive whereas cardiac and supracardiac type may be obstructive or nonobstructive.",B

None of the above criteria are being fulfilled. Presence of leucocytosis & fever can also go against it as even if there is intraamniotic infection causing preterm labour - features like : fever, leukocytosis, uterine tenderness and fetal tachycardia are absent. Rather if these features are present it means a final stage of uterine infection has reached. And here our patient is having fever, Leukocytosis without regular uterine contractions (off and on pair) but with acute pain in abdomen so it can be ruled out . Points in our Points against Patient has fibroid (Though no mention has * Torsion is not associated with fever been made whether it is pedunculated and leucocytosis. or not, Remember torsion is seen in subserous pedunculated Myomas)deg Patient is complaining of acute pain in abdomen.

Placenta with umbilical cord attached to its margin is called:,Battledore placenta,Circumvallate placenta,Succenturiate placenta,Velamentous placenta,"Ans. A. Battledore placentaIn Battledore placenta, the umbilical cord is attached to the margin of placenta. It is associated with low implantation of the placenta; there is chance of the cord compression in vaginal delivery leading to foetal anoxia and even death.Succenturiate placenta: An extra placenta separates from the main placentaVelamentous cord insertion is an abnormal condition during pregnancy. Normally, the umbilical cord inserts into the middle of the placenta as it develops. In Velamentous cord insertion, the umbilical cord inserts into the fetal membranes (chorioamniotic membranes), then travels within the membranes to the placenta (between the amnion and the chorion). The exposed vessels are not protected by Wharton's jelly and hence are vulnerable to rupture. Rupture is especially likely if the vessels are near the cervix, in which case they may rupture in early labor, likely resulting in a stillbirth. Early detection can reduce the need for emergency cesarean sections",A
