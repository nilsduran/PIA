Spontaneous CSF leak occurs in all except aEUR',Increased intracranial tension,Paial or complete empty sella syndrome,Pseudotumour cerebri,Low risk encephalocoele,"Increased intracranial tension ???? We are not sure of the answer.We have gone for increased intracranial tension because spontaneous C.S.F. leak is associated with intracranial hypotension. Increased intracranial tension is not associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak. All other options mentioned in the question are associated with spontaneous C.S.F. leak. Pseudotumor Cerebri Pseudotumour cerebri usually presents with triad of headache, papilledema and minimal or absent focal neurological signs, but rarely, the presenting feature may be a nasal C.S.F. leak. Empty sella syndrome In empty sella syndrome, the sella turcica (the bony structure which contains pituitary enlarges). In this disease there is a defect in tissue barrier that normally keeps the cerebrospinal fluid around the brain separate from the sella turcica. As a result cerebrospinal fluid puts increased pressure on the pituitary glands and the walls of the sella turcica. The sella turcica enlarges and the pituitary shrinks. The empty sella syndrome may produce no symptoms at all and seldom produces serious symptom. About half of those affected have headaches. In rare cases there is leaking of the cerebrospinal fluid from the nose. Encephathcele Encephalocele may present with C.S.F. leak. More on spontaneous C.S.F. leak or spontaneous intracranial hypotension Spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a condition where patient gets postural headache due to leak of the crebrospinal fluid in the spinal membrane. What happens is that the leak causes low C.S.F. pressure within the nervous system and thus causes a string of headache to the patient. The problem with SIH is that it is hard to diagnose and there is not a great deal of information on why it occurs. It has been associated with connective tissue diseases which may involve the dura causing tear in it. To summarize it, spontaneous C.S.F. leak is very rare and unlike other causes it does not occur due to any specific traumatic event or surgical procedure in the nervous system. Although there is not much information on the possible causes of C.S.F. leak, it is suspected that an intrinsic weakness of the spinal membrane or an abnormality of the brain structure causes the rare condition. The symptoms of 51H are so small and so common that it can often be misdiagnosed.",A

The mortality rate of emergency operation for abdominal aortic aneurysm is:,1%,5%,20%,50%,"In elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the operative mortality rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally approximates 45- 50%.
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the most common true arterial aneurysm.
An aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta with a diameter of at least 1.5 times that of the expected normal diameter of that given aortic segment; in the AA, enlargement of the aortic diameter of more than 3 cm is usually considered aneurysmal.
A most common site is infrarenal.
More common in males than females.
Incidence increases with age.
At least 90% of all abdominal aortic aneurysms >4.0 cm are related to atherosclerotic disease.
Prognosis is related to both the size of an aneurysm and the severity of coexisting coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease.
The risk of rupture is directly related to the size of an aneurysm.
An abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. They are usually detected incidentally on routine clinical examinations or investigation performed for some other reasons.
As abdominal aortic aneurysms expand, however, they may become painful. Aneurysmal pain is usually a harbinger of rupture and represents a medical emergency. More often, acute rupture occurs without any prior warning, and this complication is always life-threatening.
Contrast-enhanced CT is an investigation of choice. MRI is as sensitive and specific as CECT and is used if the use of contrast is precluded. Ultrasound is the screening study of choice and is useful for serial documentation of aneurysm size
Operative repair of an aneurysm with the insertion of a prosthetic graft or endovascular placement of an aortic stent graft is indicated for:
abdominal aortic aneurysms of any size that are expanding rapidly or are associated with symptoms.
for asymptomatic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is indicated if the diameter is >5.5 cm.
The decision to perform an open surgical operation or endovascular repair is based in part on the vascular anatomy and comorbid conditions.
Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms has a lower short-term morbidity rate but a comparable long-term mortality rate with open surgical reconstruction. (Harrison 18/e)
In Elective surgery of abdominal aortic aneurysm the operative mortality, rate approximates 1 to 2% whereas after acute rupture the mortality rate of emergency operation generally exceeds 50%.",D

In trauma to the neck which indicates immediate management,Sub cutaneous emphysema,Air bubbling,Stridor,Hypotension,"Trauma to neck Immediate Management Neck injuries can often require rapid intervention because of the vulnerability of the contained vital structures. The highest priority concern is establishment of a secure airway, especially given the rapidity with which deterioration can occur in the setting of a neck injury. Direct injury to the larynx or trachea is the most common cause of airway compromise. Expanding neck hemato- mas can quickly compress the upper airway, leading to inadequate ventilation. Immediate intubation should occur in the setting of an expanding neck hematoma or if there is concern about impend- ing airway compromise. Suspected laryngotracheal injury presents one of the most challenging airway management situations. Patients who are maintaining their own airway should have a planned approach to airway management that might include intu- bation or awake tracheostomy in the operating room. Attempted intubation could worsen a tenuous situation and should not be performed without a well-developed backup plan. A loss of airway requires emergent intervention that might include performing a surgical airway. The surgical airway of choice for an upper airway injury is a tracheostomy because injury to the larynx could make cricothyroidotomy ineffective. In the immediate setting, hemorrhage is the other major concern that might occur after neck injury. Direct pressure effec- tively manages most bleeding from the neck, at least during transpo to the operating room and initiation of neck explora- tion. Injury to the large vessels of the neck will often require control in the operating room. Bleeding should be immediately treated with digital pressure on the wound until operative expo- sure can be achieved. Large quantities of blood can be lost quickly, so resuscitation with blood products should be rapidly initiated. Patients with suspected injury should be rapidly trans- ferred to the operating room for surgical management of ongoing bleeding. Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pgno :423",C

ER/ PR status is used as a prognostic variable in -,Ca breast,Ca ovary,Ca endometrium,Ca cervix,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ca breast Prognostic factors of breast carcinoma:* The most important prognostic variables are provided by tumor staging.* The size of the tumor and the status of the axillary lymph nodes provide reasonably accurate information on the likelihood of tumor relapse.* There is rarely justification for adjuvant chemotherapy in most women with tumors <1 cm in size whose axillary lymph nodes are negative. HER2-positive tumors are a potential exception.* Detection of breast cancer cells either in the circulation or bone marrow is associated with an increased relapse rate.* Estrogen and progesterone receptor status are of prognostic significance. Tumors that lack either or both of these receptors are more likely to recur than tumors that have them.* Several measures of tumor growth rate correlate with early relapse. S-phase analysis using flow cytometry is the most accurate measure. Indirect S-phase assessments using antigens associated with the cell cycle, such as PCNA (Ki67), are also valuable.* Tumors with a high proportion (more than the median) of cells in S-phase pose a greater risk of relapse; chemotherapy offers the greatest survival benefit for these tumors.* Assessment of DNA content in the form of ploidy is of modest value, with nondiploid tumors having a somewhat worse prognosis.* Histologic classification of the tumor has also been used as a prognostic factor. Tumors with a poor nuclear grade have a higher risk of recurrence than tumors with a good nuclear grade.* Molecular changes in the tumor are also useful. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 (HER2/neu) or have a mutated p53 gene have a worse prognosis. Tumors that overexpress erbB2 are more likely to respond to higher doses of doxorubicincontaining regimens and predict those tumors that will respond to HER2/neu antibodies (trastuzumab) (herceptin) and HER2/ neu kinase inhibitors.* The presence of more microvessels in a tumor, particularly when localized in socalled hot spots, is associated with a worse prognosis.* Other variables that have also been used to evaluate prognosis include proteins associated with invasiveness, such as type IV collagenase, cathepsin D, plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator receptor, and the metastasissuppressor gene nm23. None of these has been widely accepted as a prognostic variable for therapeutic decision-making. One problem in interpreting these prognostic variables is that most of them have not been examined in a study using a large cohort of patients.",A

Induction agent of choice in bronchial asthma,Thiopentone,Methhexitone,Ketamine,Propofol,"Ketamine is a bronchial smooth muscle relaxant. When it is given to patients with reactive airway disease and bronchospasm, pulmonary compliance is improved. Ketamine is as effective as halothane or enflurane in preventing experimentally induced bronchospasm. The mechanism for this effect is probably a result of the sympathomimetic response to ketamine, but isolated bronchial smooth muscle studies showed that ketamine can directly antagonize the spasmogenic effects of carbachol and histamine. Because of its broncho-dilating effect, the administration of ketamine can treat status asthmaticus unresponsive to conventional therapy. A potential respiratory problem, especially in children, is the increased salivation that follows ketamine administration; this effect can be modulated by an anticholinergic drug such as atropine or glycopyrrolate. Racemic ketamine is a potent bronchodilator, making it a good induction agent for asthmatic patients; however, S(+) ketamine produces minimal bronchodilation.

55 yr old female patient presents with fungating breast mass of size 3 cm in diameter with palpable ipsilateral two axillary lymph nodes and no evidence of distant metastases?,Radical mastectomy,Modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection,Hormonal therapy,Palliative therapy,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection * 55 yr old female patient with fungating breast mass of size 3 cm in diameter with palpable ipsilateral two axillary lymph nodes and no evidence of distant metastases - is a case of stage IIA breast carcinoma.* This patient comes under the category of early invasive breast carcinoma so management with modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection is the appropriate treatment.Stage I & II breast cancers (Early invasive breast cancers) are managed by:1) Primary therapy for local management &2) Adjuvant therapy* Primary therapy consists of:# Mastectomy with assessment of axillary lymph node status (or modified radical mastectomy) or# Breast conservation (lumpectomy, wide local excision or quadrantectomy) with assessment of axillary lymph node status + radiotherapy.* Various trials have found both these methods to be equally effective. Breast conservation is the preferred form of treatment because of cosmetic advantages. However there are certain contraindications for conservative surgery (described in subsequent question).* Management of axillary lymph nodes :# Earlier dissection of axillary lymph nodes (level I and II) was performed to assess the lymph node status (i.e. presence or absence of occult metastasis)# Now Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the standard for evaluation of the axillary lymph nodes for metastasis in women who have clinically negative lymph nodes, (the sentinel lymph node is the first regional lymph node to receive tumor cells that metastasize along the lymphatic pathway from the primary breast cancer)# Axillary Lymph node dissection is performed for clinically palpable axillary lymphnodes or metastatic disease detected in sentinel lymph node biopsy.* Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to :# All node-positive cancers# Node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size# Node negative cancer > .5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as :* Blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion* High nuclear grade* High histological grade* HER 2/neu overexpression* Negative hormone receptor status* Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive tumors# HER-2/neu expression is determined for all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and may be used to provide prognostic information in patients with node-negative breast cancer and predict the relative efficacy of various chemotherapy regimens. Trastuzumab is the HER-2/neu-targeted agent that is added to the adjuvant therapy is the tumor shows overexpression of HER-2/neu receptors.Advanced Local-Regional Breast Cancer (Stage III)(Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + MRM + adjuvant radiation therapy +chemotherapy + antiestrogen therapy)* Here the disease is advanced on the chest wall or in regional lymph nodes (or both), with no evidence of metastasis to distant sites. Such patients are recognized to be at significant risk for the development of subsequent metastases, and treatment addresses the risk for both local and systemic relapse.* In an effort to provide optimal local-regional disease-free survival as well as distant disease-free survival for these women, surgery is integrated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.* Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (administration of therapeutic agents prior to the main treatment) should be considered in the initial management of all patients with locally advanced stage III breast cancer.* Surgical therapy for women with stage III disease is usually a modified radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen) is added for hormone receptor positive tumors.* Chemotherapy is used to maximize distant disease-free survival, whereas radiation therapy is used to maximize local-regional disease-free survival.* In selected patients with stage III A cancer, neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy can reduce the size of the primary cancer and permit breastconserving surgery.Distant Metastases (Stage IV)(mainly palliative treatment)* Treatment for stage IV breast cancer is not curative but may prolong survival and enhance a woman's quality of life.* Hormonal therapies that are associated with minimal toxicity are preferred to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Appropriate candidates for initial hormonal therapy include women with hormone receptor-positive cancers; women with bone or soft tissue metastases only; and women with limited and asymptomatic visceral metastases.* Systemic chemotherapy is indicated for women with hormone receptor-negative cancers, symptomatic visceral metastases, and hormonerefractory metastases.* Bisphosphonates, which may be given in addition to chemotherapy or hormone therapy, should be considered in women with bone metastases.",B

Pneumoperitoneum is created by: September 2009,O2,CO,CO2,N2 O,"Ans. C: CO2 Gases used for pneumoperitoneum include carbon dioxide (CO2), air, oxygen, nitrous oxide (N20), argon, helium and mixtures of these gases. CO2 gas insufflation is preferred by most laparoscopists because it has a high diffusion coefficient and is a normal metabolic end product rapidly cleared from the body. Also, CO2 is highly soluble in blood and tissues and does not suppo combustion. The risk of gas embolism is lowest with CO2. Cardiac arrhythmias can occur with CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Because of possible CO2 induced hypercarbia, N20 may be preferred in patients with cardiac disease. With prolonged procedures, CO2 retention is possible as evidenced by tachycardia and acidosis",C

Dissociated sensory loss in a case of tumor ofcentral spinal cord is due to lesion of:,Dorsal column fibres,Anterior Spinothalmic tract,Decussating fibres of lateral spinothalmic tract,Cilio spinal centre of spinal cord,"Decussating fibres of lateral spinothalmic tract Dissociated sensory loss is a pattern of neurological damage which involves selective loss of pain and temperature with preservation of fine touch and proprioception. Pain and temperature are carried by lateral spinothalmic tracts, which cross the central pa of the cord sholy after entering the spinal cord and ascend in the contralateral side. Fine touch and proprioception are carried in dorsal column fibres which do not cross the cord until medulla. Since fibers conducting pain and temperature sensation cross the cord in the anterior commissure, a lesion in this location will characteristically abolish these modalities on one or both sides over several segments but will spare the tactile sensation (fine touch and proprioception). This is known as dissociated sensory loss and is a characteristic feature of the Central spinal cord syndrome (Syringomyelic Syndrome). The central spinal cord syndrome is best exemplified by syringomyclia, hydromyelia, hematomyelia, and intramedullary cord tumors.",C

To differentiate between stress incontinence and detrusor instability investigation done is,Cystosurethroscopy,Urodynamic study,MCU,Retograde urethroscopy,Ans is 'b' ie Urodynamic study Genuine stress incontinence is defined as urinary leakage occuring during increased bladder pressure when this is solely due to increased abdominal pressure and not due to increased true detrusor pressure. - It is caused by sphincter weakness. Detrusor instability - this is phasic increase in detrusor pressure (due to phasic contraction of detrusor muscle) giving rise to sensation of urgency of micturition and urge incontinence. It is found in pts with several types of neurogenic bladder dysfunction such as multiple sclerosis (MS) Parkinson disease or following a stroke or ceain types of spinal injury when it is known as detrusor hyperreflexia. Usefulness of Urodynamic testing: 1) Distinguishing genuine stress incontinence from detrusor instability in women. 2) Classification of neurogenic bladder dysfunction 3) Distinguishing bladder outflow obstruction from idiopathic detrusor instability in men. 4) Investigation of incontinence.,B
Anti-TPO antibodies are present in: September 2007,Reidel's thyroiditis,Grave's disease,Hashimotos thyroiditis,DeQuervain's thyroiditis,"Ans. C: Hashimotos thyroiditis Laboratory investigation of hypothyroidism: In the presence of suggestive symptoms and physical findings, a serum TSH test is needed for the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, and it serves to assess the functional status of the thyroid. - This is a sensitive test of thyroid function; levels are invariably raised in hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis and in primary hypothyroidism of any cause. - The TSH level is also elevated in subclinical hypothyroidism and is usually the initial laboratory abnormality detected as the pituitary gland attempts to increase thyroid hormone production from the failing thyroid gland. The total T4 or free T4 usually remain within reference ranges in subclinical hypothyroidism. - The TSH level may also be elevated in the recovery phase of euthyroid sick syndrome. Medications that suppress TSH production include steroids, dopamine, dobutamine, and octreotide. A free T4 is usually needed to correctly interpret the TSH in some clinical settings. A low total T4 or free T4 level in the presence of an elevated TSH level fuher confirms the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. When a total T4 study, rather than a free T4 study, is performed, a T3 resin uptake helps to correct the total T4 and T3 values for protein binding, especially thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) abnormalities, but the FT4 is typically the test of choice. T3 levels are most often maintained within reference ranges (even in the very late stages of hypothyroidism), and T3 measurement has little value in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. The presence of thyroid autoantibodies, typically anti-TPO (anti thyroid peroxidase) and also anti-Tg (anti-thyroglobulin) antibodies, delineates the cause of hypothyroidism as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or its variant. However, 10-15% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be antibody negative.",C

"A pt. Ramu presents with hematuria for many days. On investigations he is found to have renal calculi, calcifications in the wall of urinary bladder and small contracted bladder; most probable cause is ?",Schistosomiasis,Amyloidosis,Tuberculosis,Ca urinary bladder,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Schistosomiasis Now here, is confusion in the question itself. There are two opinions among students (a) One group of students say that the question was small contracted bladder with calcified lesion in the kidney (b) Others opinion there is that the question was - small contracted bladder with calcification in the wall of bladder itself Ans to (a) is Tuberculosis Ans to (b) is Schistosomiasis Schistosomiasis of the bladder The common species of Schistosoma are - S. Japonicum (affecting mainely liver, S. intestine)* - S mansoni (affecting mainly large intestine)* - S. haematobium (affecting mainly the bladder)* The adult S. haematobium worm lives in the prostatovesical plexus of veins. The female worm lays her eggs in the subepithelial layers of the affected viscus. Massive egg deposition leads to severe local reaction with granuloma formation.these are later replaced by fibrous tissue that causes contraction of different pas of the bladder and stricture of ureter. Fibrosis and massive egg deposition interfere with the blood supply of area causing chronic bilharzial ulcerations. Epithelial metaplasia is common and squamous cell ca is a frequent sequela. Secondary inf. of the urinary tract is a common complication. The trapped dead ova become impregnated with calcium salts and forms sheets of subepithelial calcified layer in the bladder wall. This appear on xrays as dense concentric ring of calcification (may resemble featal head in pelvis). Profuse hematuria occurs in patients initially due to penetration of the urothelium by living ova (which are extruded in the urine) and later due to ulceration. Both renal and vesical calculi may form. Advanced ds. leads to small contracted bladder (having a capacity of only few millilitres) with varying degrees of dilatation of the upper urinary tract (hydroureteronephrosis) S. haematobium also involves ureters, seminal vesicles (and to a lesser extent male urethra and prostate gland) leading to strictures and extensive calcifications in these structures. Tuberculosis of kidney and bladder In TB of kidney, a group of tuberculous granulomas form in the renal pyramid. They coalesce and form an ulcer. Untreated the lesion enlarges and a tuberculous abscess may form in the parenchyma. Gradually the kidney is replaced by caseous material (putty kidney*), it may be calcified (cement kidney). Calcifications may appear on the x-ray as calculi (pseudocalculi) Renal tuberculosis is often associated with tuberculosis of the baldder. TB of bladder leads to fibrosis and thus contracture of bladder. Golf-hole ureters* are seen in TB bladder*.",A

A Toddler has few drops of blood coming out of rectum. Probable diagnosis is,Juvenile Rectal Polyp,Adenoid Polyposis Coli,Rectal Ulcer,Piles,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Juvenile Rectal Polyp 'The aetiology and management of rectal bleeding depends on the age of the child, the type and quantity of bleeding and the associated symptoms. Unlike adults, malignancy is exceptionally rare. In infants, an anal fissure, necrotizing enterocolitis, intussusception and allergic enterocolitis are possible causes. In older children, more common causes include an anal fissure, a juvenile polyp and certain gastroenteritides (e.g. Campylobacter infection); Meckel's diverticulum, duplication cyst and inflammatory bowel disease are less common. Bailey and LoveJuvenile polyps are the most common type of childhood polyp, occurring in up to 1% of preschool children. They are usually solitary polyps found in the rectum which most commonly present with rectal bleeding.These are hamartomatous polyps, which are usually pedunculated but can be sessile. 'The typical child with a juvenile polyp is 4 to 6 years of age, presents with intermittent painless rectal bleeding with bowel movements. Rudolph's PediatricsJuvenile polyps are usually are not premalignant.Because the gross appearance of these polyps is identical to adenomatous polyps, these lesions should also be treated by polypectomy.Juvenile polyposis is a term used when more than 5 to 10 juvenile polyps develop.Juvenile polyposis coli applies if the polyps are limited to the colon, whereas generalized juvenile polyposis describes the presence of polyps throughout the GI tract. Both have a significant malignant potential.Other mentioned options are rare in children.Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients present in Td to 3rd decade.Rectal ulcer (solitary rectal ulcer) is commonly seen in 20 to 40 yrs age group.Piles are rare in children.

Preferred fluid in a poly-traumatic patient with shock?,Ringer lactate,Normal saline,Dextran,Dextrose-normal saline,"Ans. (b) Normal salineRef.-.Harrison 18th ed. / 270Normal saline is the preferred fluid for volume expansion in a crashing patient with un-recordable BP. The main point to be noted is that if ringer lactate is infused in these patients, then lactate in the solution will never reach the liver where it is normally converted into bicarbonate. Hence the accumulated lactate will get broken into lactic acid that will worsen the status of patient of poly-trauma who is already acidotic. Dextran would not be indicated as it exhibits anti-thrombotic tendency.",B
"A 43-year-old woman develops acute renal failure following an emergency resection of a leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm.Three days after surgery, the following laboratory values are obtained:* Serum electrolytes (mEq/L): Na+:127;K+:5.9;Cl-:92;HCO3-:15* Blood urea nitrogen: 82 mg/dL* Serum creatinine: 6.7 mg/dLThe patient has gained 4 kg since surgery and is mildly dyspneic at rest. Eight hours after these values are reported, the electrocardiogram shown below is obtained. The initial treatment for this patient should be","10% calcium gluconate, 10 mL","Digoxin, 0.25 mg every 3 h for three doses",Oral Kayexalate,"Lidocaine, 100 mg","The electrocardiogram exhibited in the question demonstrates changes that are essentially diagnostic of severe hyperkalemia. Correct treatment for the affected patient includes administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the neuromuscular effect of potassium) and administration of sodium ions (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium- potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would not only be ineffective but contraindicated since they would further depress the myocardial conduction system.",A

The first gastrectomy was performed in 1881 by -,Mickuliz,Wolfer,Billroth,Moynihan,"• The first successful gastrectomy was performed by Theodor Billroth in 1881 for cancer of the stomach.
• Historically, gastrectomies were used to treat peptic ulcers. These are now usually treated with antibiotics, as it was recognized that they are usually due to Helicobacter pylori.
• In the past a gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease was often accompanied by a vagotomy, to reduce acid production, nowadays, managed with PPIs.
• Gastrectomies are performed to treat cancer and perforations of the stomach wall.
• In severe duodenal ulcers it may be necessary to remove the pylorus and the upper portion of the duodenum.
• If there is a sufficient portion of the upper duodenum remaining, a Billroth I procedure is performed, where the remaining portion of the stomach is reattached to the duodenum before the bile duct and the duct of the pancreas (Gastroduodenostomy)
If the stomach cannot be reattached to the duodenum, a Billroth II is performed, where the remaining portion of the duodenum is sealed off, a hole is cut into the jejunum and the stomach is reattached at this hole (Loop gastrojejunostomy).",C

This disorder develops most frequently in men <40 years of ageThe clinical features of thromboangiitis obliterans often include a triad of claudication of the affected extremity, Raynaud's phenomenon, and migratory superficial vein thrombophlebitis. Claudication usually is confined to the calves and feet or the forearms and hands because this disorder primarily affects distal vessels. In the presence of severe digital ischemia, trophic nail changes, painful ulcerations, and gangrene may develop at the tips of the fingers or toes. The physical examination shows normal brachial and popliteal pulses but reduced or absent radial, ulnar, and/or tibial pulses. Arteriography is helpful in making the diagnosis.

Diffusion hypoxia seen during ?,Induction of anesthesia,Reversal of anesthesia,Post operative period,None of the above,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Reversal of anaesthesia Second gas effect and diffusion hvpoxia In initial pa of induction, diffusion gradient from alveoli to blood is high and larger quantity of anaesthetic is entering blood. If the inhaled Concentration of anaesthetic is high (eg N20), Substantial loss of alveolar gas volume will occur and it creates negative intralveolar pressure that leads to removal of more gas from cylinder to alveoli Concentration effect. If another inhalation agent is (eg Halothane) is being given at the same time, it also will be delivered to lung from the cylinder (due to negative intraalveolar pressure) Second gas effect. During recovery reverse occurs - N20 having low blood solubility, rapidly diffuses into alveoli and dilutes the alveolar air --> paial pressure of oxygen in alveoli is reduced. The resulting hypoxia is known as diffusion hypoxia. Diffusion hypoxia can be prevented by continuing 100% 02 inhalation for a few minutes after discontinuing N20, instead of straight away switching over to air.",B

About 5% to 10% of cases are attributable to inheritance of autosomal dominant genes. Most hereditary cases of breast cancer are due to two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are tumor suppressor genes probably involved in DNA repair. There are additional rare 'susceptibility' genes, namely those causing Li-Fraumeni syndrome (mutations of p53), Cowden syndrome (mutations of a gene on chromosome 10), and ataxia-telangiectasia (mutations of ATM gene). Note, however, that 80% to 90% of women with breast cancer do not have a positive family history.

Trigger finger is caused by inflammation and constriction of the retinacular sheath through which the flexor tendons run as they pass from the palm of the hand into the finger. This causes irritation of the tendon, sometimes resulting in the formation of a nodule, which impinges on the pulley, causing pain and restricting movement. Treatment: Coicosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is usually the first line treatment. Up to 57% of cases resolve with one injection, and 86% with two. Surgery--Usually indicated if two coicosteroid injections six weeks apa have failed, or the finger is irreversibly locked in flexion.

Which drug of anesthetics causes hallucination,Ketamine,Trilene,Halothane,Trichioroethylene,"Ketamine causes postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Other organisms such as Chlamydia species may be responsible for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Clinical features The clinical features are extremely varied. Only men with symptoms of posterior urethritis, prostatic pain and perigen ital pain accompanied by intermittent fever and pus cells or bacteria in the post-prostatic massage specimen should be diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis. Diagnosis The three-glass urine test is valuable. If the first glass with the initial voided sample shows urine containing prostatic threads, prostatitis is present. Rectal examination of the prostate may be normal or may show a soft, boggy and tender prostate. Examination of the prostatic fluid obtained by prostatic massage should show pus cells and bacteria. Urethroscopy may reveal inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and pus may be seen exuding from the prostatic ducts. The verumontanum is likely to be enlarged and oedematous. In many men with the symptoms described above, all investi gations are normal. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be administered only in accordance with bacteriological sensitivity tests. Trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin penetrate well into the prostate. If Trichomonas or anaerobes are the responsible agent, a rapid response is obtained from administration of metronidazole (200mg t.d.s. for 7 days to both paners). Treatment is continued upto 10-12 weeks. If Chlamydia is suspected, doxycycline is the antibiotic treatment of choice. There is little evidence that prostatic massage helps in eradicating the infection. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1475",C

"A patient having multiple Gall stones and shows 8 mm dilation and 4 stones in CBD, best treatment modalities are -",Cholecystectomy with choledocholithotomy at same setting,ESWL,Cholecystectomy and wait for ERCP,All,"Answer (a) Cholecystectomy with choledocholithotomy done at same sitting Management of suspected or proven CBD stones associated with gall bladder stones For gallstones - laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure of choice. For CBD stones two things can be done: 1) If the surgeon is experienced in laparoscopic techniques of CBD stone removal then both cholecystectomy and choledocholithotomy is done in the same sitting. - CBD stones are first confirmed by an intraoperative cholangiogram - then the stones are removed laparoscopically the cystic duct or by choledochotomy. 2) If the surgeon is not experienced with laparoscopic methods of CBD stone removal, preoperative endoscopic sphincterotomy with stone removal and later laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with choledocholithotomy in the same sitting is the preferred technique (provided the surgeon is experienced) But one must keep in mind here that 'for elderly, poor-risk patients with gallstones and CBD stones some have recommended ERCP and sphincterotomy as the sole treatment, leaving gallbladder and stones in situ'. - Maingot's 10/e Usually the gallstones in these patients remain asymptomatic and if need arises can be managed by cholecystectomy",A

Postoperative--for example, thoracotomy, oesophagectomy. cardiac surgery10 To deliver intrapleural local analgesia in Flail chest CONTRAINDICATIONS OF TUBE THORACOSTOMYThe need for emergent thoracotomy is an absolute contraindication to tube thoracostomy. Relative contraindications include the following:1. Coagulopathy2. Pulmonary bullae3. Diaphragmatic hernia4. Pulmonary, pleural, or thoracic adhesions5. Loculated pleural effusion or empyema6. Skin infection over the chest tube insertion sitePatient position:The preferred position for drain insertion is on the bed, slightly rotated, with the arm on the side of the lesion behind the patient s head to expose the axillary area. An alternative is for the patient to sit upright leaning over an adjacent table with a pillow or in the lateral decubitus position.Drain insertion site: The most common position for chest tube insertion is in the fifth intercostal space in the mid axillary line, through the 'safe triangle'. This is the triangle bordered by the anterior border of the latissimus dorsi, the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle, a line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple, and an apex below the axilla. This position minimises risk to underlying structures such as the internal mammary artery and avoids damage to muscle and breast tissue resulting in unsightly scarring.In Open pneumothorax {'sucking chest wound')f A chest tube is inserted as soon as possible in a site remote from the injury site.In Tension pneumothorax a chest tube is inserted through the fifth intercostal space in the anterior axillarylineDrain size: Small bore drains are recommended as they are more comfortable than larger bore tubes but there is no e%ddence that either is therapeutically superior. A large-bore (32-36 French) chest tube should be used in adolescents and adult patientsProcedure:Local anaesthetic should be infiltrated prior to insertion of the drain.Skin incision is made in between the midaxillary and anterior axillary lines over a rib that is below the intercostal level selected for chest tube insertion. The incision for insertion of the chest drain should be similar to the diameter of the tube being inserted. The incision should be made just above and parallel to a rib.Blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle into the pleural cavity. A closed and locked Kelly clamp is used to enter the chest wall into the pleural cavity to develop the tract and then with finger. The index finger should be inserted into the pleural space before tube placement to ensure that the pleural cavity has been entered and is free of adhesions and that any intra-abdominal organs have not herniated through the diaphragm.The tube should be advanced (with or without trochar) posteriorly and superiorly in the pleural cavity. The position of the tip of the chest tube should ideally be aimed apically for a pneumothorax or basally for fluid. However, any tube position can be effective at draining air or fluid and an effectively functioning drain should not be repositioned solely because of its radiographic position.After insertion, the tube should be secured in the skin of the chest wall and connected to a collection system under suction. A chest radiograph is usually obtained after insertion of the chest tube to confirm adequate placement and positioning.All chest tubes should be connected to a single flow drainage system e.g. under water seal bottle or flutter valve. When chest drain suction is required, a high volume/lowr pressure system should be used.Avoid damping the ICD, as it may leads to tension pneumothorax, if forget to remove the clamp.Removal of the chest tube: Genera! criteria for chest tube removal include absence of air leak and less than 100 mL of fluid drainage over a 24-hour period. The chest tube should be removed either while the patient performs Valsalva's manoeuvre or during expiration with a brisk firm movement while an assistant ties the previously placed closure suture. In cases of pneumothorax, the chest tube should not be clamped at the time of its removal.",B

Which of the following has the highest potential of progression into cancer,Adenomatous polyp,Hyperplastic polyp,Juvenile polyp,Hamaomatous polyp,"Familial adenomatous polyposis Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is defined clinically by the presence of more than 100 colorectal adenomas, but is also characterised by duodenal adenomas and multiple extraintestinal manifestations. Over 80% of cases come from patients with a positive family history. The remainder arise as a result of new mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on the sho arm of chromosome 5. FAP is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and is consequently equally likely in men and women. The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 100% in patients with FAP. FAP can also be associated with benign mesodermal tumours such as desmoid tumours and osteomas. Epidermoid cysts can also occur (Gardner's syndrome); desmoid tumours in the abdomen spread locally to involve the intestinal mesentery and, although non-metastasising, they may become unresectable. Up to 50% of patients with FAP have congenital hyperophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), which can be used to screen affected families if genetic testing is unavailable. CLINICAL FEATURES Polyps are usually visible on sigmoidoscopy by the age of 15 years and will almost always be visible by the age of 30 years. Carcinoma of the large bowel develops 10-20 years after the onset of the polyposis. If there are no adenomas by the age of 30 years, FAP is unlikely. If the diagnosis is made duringadolescence, surgery is usually deferred to the age of 17 or 18 years unless symptoms develop. Malignant change is rare before the age of 20 years. Examination of blood relatives, including cousins, nephews and nieces, is essential; a family tree should be constructed and a register of affected families maintained. Referral to a medical geneticist is essential. If over 100 adenomas are present at colonoscopy, the diagnosis can be made confidently Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1259",A

Pseudoclaudication is caused by,Femoral Aery stenosis,Popliteal Aery stenosis,Lumbar canal stenosis,Radial Aery stenosis,"Pseudoclaudication is the term used for neurogenic claudication caused due to lumbar canal stenosis. Its symptoms mimic intermittent claudication of PVD. Neurogenic claudication, consists of back and buttock or leg pain induced by walking or standing and relieved by sitting or changing posture. Symptoms in the legs are usually bilateral. Unlike vascular claudication, symptoms are often provoked by standing without walking. Spinal stenosis can be acquired, congenital, or due to a combination of these factors. Congenital causes include achondroplasia, idiopathic. Acquired causes are degenerative diseases (spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, scoliosis), trauma, spine surgery, metabolic or endocrine disorders (epidural lipomatosis, osteoporosis, acromegaly, renal osteodystrophy, hypoparathyroidism), and Paget&;s disease.

Treatment of Anal canal stage 2 is,Chemoradiation,Abdominoperineal resection,Chemotherapy and surgery,Radiotherapy only,"AJCC staging for anal canal cancers is based on the size of the tumor and local invasion of adjacent organs or structures.A tumor that is 2 cm or smaller is designated T1, larger than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm is T2, and larger than 5 cm is T3. Any size tumor that invades a local structure is designated T4. Staging of disease includes CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and pelvic MRI. Positron emission tomography scanning should be considered for larger (T2 or greater) tumors or any node-positive disease. HIV testing and checking a CD4 count should also be considered if indicated. Historically, treatment consisted of surgery alone or radiation therapy alone. Epithelial or subepithelial tumors were locally excised, and more advanced lesions underwent APR. The introduction of multimodality therapy combining chemotherapy andradiation therapy promised to preserve continence, to avoid colostomy, and to offer similar or improved survival. Nigro was the first to promote radiation therapy with chemotherapy as definitive treatment for squamous cell cancers of the anal canal. The current protocol includes infusional 5-FU with mitomycin C and external beam radiation to the pelvis with a minimum dose of 45Gy. The inguinal nodes, pelvis, anus, and perineum should be included in the radiation fields. Patients with T2 lesions and residual disease after 45 Gy, T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease are usually treated with an additional 9 to 14 Gy for a total dose of 54 to 59 Gy. In patients treated with APR for persistent or locally recurrent disease, 5-year actuarial survival is repoed at 57%.46 Despite high success rates with definitive chemoradiotherapy, 15% to 30% of patients will have recurrence or fail to respondcompletely.47 Patients with persistent disease up to 6 months after treatment generally require APR. Those who have local recurrence are also recommended for APR. In the setting of isolated inguinal node recurrence, groin dissection is generally required with consideration for radiation therapy to the inguinal node basins if no prior radiotherapy was given. Up to 50% of patients treated with salvage APR can expect a 5-year cure. This is compared with approximately 27% of patients treated with salvage radiation and concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy who can expect cure. In those patients presenting with anal squamous cell carcinoma in the setting of HIV infection, disease severity (CD4 count and use of antiretroviral therapy) has a significant impact on success of standard chemoradiation. The current consensus is that standard protocols for chemoradiotherapy should be attempted, regardless of HIV status, and that medical management of the patient's HIV infection be optimized. The 2-year survival rates for HIV-positive patients have been repoed to be the same as for HIV-negative patients, 77% and 75%, respectively Ref: Sabiston 20th edition Pg no : 1415",A

"Regarding adhesive intestinal obstruction, TRUE is ?",Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours,Never operate,Operate after minimum 10 days of conservative treatment,Immediate operation,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Avoid surgery for initial 48-72 hours There are three main measures in the tit of acute intestinal obstruction. These are 1) Gastro intestinal drainage (Nasogastric suction) 2) Fluid and electrolyte replacement 3) Surgery for relief of obstruction The first two steps are always necessary prior to the surgical relief of obstruction. Surgical treatment is necessary for most cases of intestinal obstruction, but it should always be delayed until resuscitation is complete. The timing of surgical intervention is dependent on clinical picture. The classical clinical advice on a case of unrelieved intestinal obstruction is that 'Sun should not both rise and set' i.e., the operative procedure should not be delayed beyond 24 hrs. But, there are ceain exceptions to this rule. In some cases operation is delayed in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In adhesive intestinal obstruction, usually occuring after surgery the upto 72 hours in the hope of spontaneous resolution. In these cases continued radiological evidence of obstruction. Also know the four types of obstruction, where operation should be done a) Stangualtion b) Closed loop obstuction c) Colon obstruction d) Early simple mechanical obstruction More about adhesive intestinal obstruction - Commonest cause of intestinal obstruction, usually follows pelvic operations Obstruction due to postoperative adhesions commonly involve the lower small bowel.",A

"A 25-year-old man is involved in an automobile accident with resultant injuries including bilateral closed femur fractures, left pulmonary contusion, and closed head injury. On post-injury day 4, significant upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage begins. Endoscopic examination reveals an area of confluent ulceration with bleeding in the gastric fundus. Endoscopic hemostasis fails. Appropriate immediate management includes:",Lavage of gastric contents with iced saline,Urgent total gastrectomy,Selective aerial infusion of vasopressin the left gastric aery,Inseion of Sangstaken-Blakemore balloon,"Initial effos to control gastric hemorrhage consist of gastric lavage using warmed saline. Lavage serves to fragment existing clots and to remove any pooled blood, reducing fibrinolysis at bleeding sites. Over 80% of patients who present with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage stop bleeding using this approach. Definitive treatment of ongoing acute active stress bleeding by antacids is largely unsuccessful. Administration of H2-receptor blocking agents once active gastrointestinal bleeding has commenced is also usually ineffective as a definitive form of therapy. The endoscope has become the preferred therapeutic as well as diagnostic instrument with electrocautery and laser photocoagulation capabilities. If endoscopic therapy fails, angiography offers an additional means for the control of bleeding by selective infusion of vasopressin into the splanchnic circulation the left gastric aery. Vasopressin is administered by continuous infusion through the catheter at a rate of 0.2 to 0.4 IU/min for a maximum of 48 to 72 hours. About 10% to 20% of patients with acute stress ulcers continue to bleed or have recurrent bleeding despite these measures. In these patients, total gastrectomy has a moality ranging from 17% to 100%. In general, operative moality rates for acute stress-induced hemorrhage range from 30% to 60% regardless of the surgical procedure undeaken.",C

Rodent ulcer is seen in:,Basal cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Verrucous carcinoma,Ameloblastic carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma most often affects white adults, especially those with fair complexions. Although most patients are older than 40 years at diagnosis, some lesions are detected as early as the second decade of life, particularly in patients with red or blonde hair and blue or green eyes. Males are affected about twice as often as females; however, among young patients, there is a female predilection (possibly due to tanning bed use). Approximately 80% of lesions occur on the head and neck, with the remainder involving the trunk and limbs.
The most common clinicopathologic variant, nodular (nodulo-ulcerative) basal cell carcinoma, begins as a firm, painless papule that slowly enlarges and develops a central depression or umbilication. Telangiectatic blood vessels usually are evident within the rolled border surrounding the central depression. When the lesion is pressed, a characteristic pearly opalescent quality is discerned. Expanding ulceration often develops in the central depression, and the patient may show intermittent bleeding followed by healing. Untreated lesions continue to enlarge slowly with ulceration and destruction of underlying structures—hence the term rodent ulcer. Destruction of underlying bone or cartilage may occur, but metastasis is extremely rare.

All of the following are surgical options in management of esophageal carcinoma except -,Ivor Lewis Approach,Mckeown's Approach,Transhiatal removal,Sistrunk operation,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Sistrunk operation Surgery in Ca esophagus1 .Ivor lewis operation - is subtotal esophagectomy done for Ca esophagus in lower third of esophagus. Part of stomach and esophagus are resected and remnants of both anastomosed.2. In transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) the thorax dosen't needs to be opened. Esophagus is removed through the diaphragmatic hiatus by making incisions in the abdomen and the neck.# In this operation, first an upper abdominal incision is made. The surgeon mobilizes the esophagus by working upward through the diaphragmatic hiatus. With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis).# Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy:o The two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are:1. Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen. The pain of these combined incisions may make it difficult for the patient to take a deep breath early after the operation, and this allows pneumonia to set in; and2. Severe infection in the chest (mediastinitis) resulting due to a ''leak' from intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis.3. McKeowns Surgery-3 Incision Approach",D

When primary it is seen predominantly in well defined patient groups and the demographics therefore match those of said groups. Predisposing conditions include1.# AIDS# Coeliac disease# Organ transplant (see post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder# Helicobacter pylori positive patientsClinical presentationo Presentation is variable and includes:# Gastrointestinal haemorrhage# Perforation# Small bowel obstruction (uncommon)Radiographic featureso Typically small bowel lymphoma involves a single loop of bowel with 5-20cm of its length demonstrating :# Bowel wall thickening: 1-7 cm.# Aneurysmal dilatation: 30%, it occurs due to replacement of muscularis by tumour or infiltration of myenteric nerve plexus.o Despite the extensive involvement, small bowel obstruction is uncommon because of lack of desmoplastic reaction, and perforation is rare.o Regional lymph node enlargement is seen in approximately 50% of cases.o Less frequently the disease may manifest as a solid mass lesion (polypoidal/excentric). In such cases differentiation from adenocarcinoma may be difficult. However, presence of extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly favours lymphoma, while adjacent fat infiltration supports adenocarcinoma.Treatment and prognosis.o Most frequently the involved segment is resected, with subsequent chemoradiotherapy.",C

Ketamine is contraindicated in?,Status asthmaticus,Obstetric hemorrhage,Glaucoma,Shock,"Ans is 'c' i.e., Glaucoma Contraindications of Ketamine1. CNS - Ketamine increases cerebral blood flow, metabolism, oxygen consumption and intracranial tension, unlike thiopentone, propofol & etomidate which have cerebroprotective effect - Ketamine is contraindicated in head injury, Intracranial space occupying lesion and for neuro-anesthesia. Cerebrovascular responsiveness to CO2 is preserved, and reducing the arterial CO2 tension by hyperventilation attenuates the ketamine induced rise in ICT.2. Cardiovascular - Ketamine has direct myocardial depressant (negative ionotropic) & vasodilator effect. However, ketamine also has indirect sympathomimetic effect. Indirect sympathomimetic effect predominates over direct myocardial depressant & vasodilator effect; usual response is increased BP, cardiac output and heart rate - Cardiac O2 demand is increased - Ketamine is contraindicated in aortic aneurysm, hypertensive and ischemic heart disease.

True regarding 'Damage control surgery is:,Done during damage control surgery,Done during triage,Minimal intervention to stabilize patient so that definitive surgery can be done later on,Maximum possible surgical intervention considering the event,"Ref: Charles M. Court-Brown et al. Trauma. Lippincott, 2006, Page 16. Washington Manual of Surgery 2012. 6th edition, Page 514Explanation:DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERY (DCS)It is a form of surgery utilized in severe unstable injuries typically by trauma surgeons.This form of surgery puts more emphasis on preventing the trauma triad (Hypothermia, Coagulopathy and Acidosis) of death, rather than correcting the anatomy.DCS is about minimal intervention done to stabilize the patient and the definitive surgery later.DCS includes abbreviated laparotomy, temporary packing and closure of the abdomen in an effort to blunt the physiologic response to prolonged shock and massive hemorrhage.DC'S centers on coordinating staged operative interventions with periods of aggressive resuscitation to salvage trauma patients sustaining major injuries.These patients are often at limits of their physiological reserve when they present to operating room and persistent operative efforts results in exacerbation of their underlying hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis, initiating a vicious cycle that culminates in death.PHASES OF DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERYPhase 1 - Initial ExplorationTo attain rapid control of active hemorrhage and contamination.The abdomen is entered via a midline incision and if exsanguinating hemorrhage is encountered four quadrant packing should be performed.Any violations of GI tract should be treated w ith suture closure or segmental stapled resection.External drains are placed to control any major pancreatic or biliary injuries.Phase 2 - Secondary ResuscitationFollowing completion of the initial exploration, the critically ill patient is transferred to the ICU.Invasive monitoring and complete ventilator support needed.This phase focuses on secondary resuscitation to correct hypothermia, coagulopathy and acidosis.Phase 3 - Definitive OperationIt consists of planned re-exploration and definitive repair of injuries.Occurs 48 - 72 hours following initial and after successful secondary resuscitation.The abdomen should be closed primarily if possible.Risky GI anastomoses or complex reconstruction should be avoided.INDICATIONS FOR DAMAGE CONTROL SURGERYPolytrauma and thoracic trauma.Polytrauma with severe abdominal/pelvic trauma and hemodynamic shock (BP < 90 mm Hg).Bilateral lung contusions.Initial mean pulmonary artery pressure > 24 mmHg.Pulmonary artery pressure increase > 6 mm Hg during long bone intramedullary nailing.",C

Given immediately in hemorrhagic shock:,Packed RBC,Colloids,Crystalloids,Isotonic fluids,"Ans. (c) CrystalloidsRef: Bailey & Love 26th ed. /16-17* Crystalloid is the first fluid of choice for resuscitation. Immediately administer 2 L of isotonic sodium chloride solution or lactated Ringer's solution in response to shock from blood loss. Fluid administration should continue until the patient's hemodynamics become stabilized. Because crystalloids quickly leak from the vascular space, each liter of fluid expands the blood volume by 20-30%; therefore, 3 L of fluid needs to be administered to raise the intravascular volume by 1 L.* About the use of RL and NS in hemorrhagic shock, it has been shown that Resuscitation with NS modulates hypercoagulability after trauma and results in increased fluid requirements Administration of RL during resuscitation appears to have no effect on the hypercoagulable state induced by trauma. This hypercoagulable state may reduce bleeding and be protective initially, but may lead to thromboembolic complications later in the course of trauma admission. Due to this reason RL may be preferred in the trauma (hemorrhagic shock) in the initial phase over NS.* As the RL is a little hypotonic solution large volume of RL in patients with head injury may lead to cerebral oedema therefore NS may be preferred over LR in patients of hemorrhagic shock with head injury. (Also remember that head injuries may also precipitate hyponatremia. The most common metabolic abnormality after head injury is SLADH).",C

"All of the following are FALSE in case of hyperophic pyloric stenosis, EXCEPT:",Symptomatic within one week,Lump is always clinically palpable,Treatment of choice is Finney's pyloroplasty,Ultrasonography is the diagnostic test,"In hyperophic pyloric stenosis, the musculature of the pylorus and adjacent antrum is grossly hyperophied, the hyperophy being maximum in the pylorus itself. It occur in approximately 3 in 1000 live bihs and is the most common surgical cause of vomiting in infancy. Males are affected more commonly as compared to females and characteristically the first born male child is affected. The condition is most commonly seen at 4 week after bih ranging from 3rd week to 7th week in rare occasions. Only 20% of infants are symptomatic from bih. The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on clinical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen. In healthy infants when palpation is difficult, feeding can help in the diagnosis. After feeding peristalsis waves may be visible. After the infants vomits, the abdominal musculature is more relaxed and the mass is easier to palpate.

Maximum tissue reaction in associated with which suture material?,Polypropylene,Polyglyconate,Polydioxanone,Plain catgut,"Ans. D. Plain catgut. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 36. Table 18.1).While plain Catgut or Chromic catgut often causes bacterial infection due to inflammatory tissue reaction. Reaction to catgut depends on the stage of absorption and is mainly histocytic in type. Nonabsorbable sutures are encapsulated by a rim of connective tissue, while near the suture histocytes, giant cells and lymphocytes are found. This is most marked with silk and cotton, less so with Dacron, and least with nylon and wire.# All the natural sutures, silk, cotton, linen and catgut, are being replaced by polymeric synthetic materials that cause minimal inflammatory reactions, are of predictable strength and absorb at an appropriate rate. They can be manufactured as monofilaments or braids, and can be coated with wax, silicone or polybutyrate to allow them to run smoothly through tissues and to knot securely. The absorbables cause a minimal tissue reaction as they are resorbed. To aid in the prevention of postoperative infection, particularly after prosthetic surgery, absorbable synthetic sutures may be impregnated with an antiseptic (Vicryl Plus, a polyglactin, is impregnated with triclosan).# The integrity of some synthetic non-absorbables in holding healing tissues together can last indefinitely, such as the use of polypropylene in arterial anastomosis. Polyamide (nylon) is slowly biodegradable and therefore not suitable for this purpose. Many nonabsorbables are presented as monofilaments, which eliminates interstices in the thread and makes knots less likely to be a nidus for infection by reducing the risk of bacterial biofilms and adherence, but requires more skill in tying secure knots# Polyglyconate is newest synthetic monofilament absorbable suture. It is sterile, noncollagenous, nonantigenic, nonpyrogenic. It elicits only slight tissue reaction during absorption, absorption is by nonenzymatic hydrolytic process.Absorbable suturesSutureTissue reactionHow suppliedCommon indicationsContraindicationsCatgut plainHigh6/0-1 with needles; 4/0-3 without needlesLigate superficial vessels, suture subcutaneous tissuesStomas and other tissues that heal rapidlyNot for use in tissues which heal slowly and require prolonged supportCatgut chromicModerate6/0-3 with needles;5/0-3 without needlesAs for plain catgut PolyglactinMild8/D--2 with needles;5/0-2 without needlesGeneral surgical use where absorbable sutures required, e.g. gut anastomoses, vascular ligatures.

Which of the following approach of brachial block is most suitable for catheter placement:-,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,All,"The infraclavicular brachial plexus blocks are an alternative to axillary block for anaesthetizing the elbow, forearm, and hand when positioning is compromised by limited abduction at the shoulder, for example, rheumatoid ahritis or an immobilized/traumatized arm. It is also an alternative to supraclavicular block for anaesthetizing the upper arm. The veical infraclavicular is better than the lateral approaches in this respect and has similar rates of pneumothorax but less frequent phrenic nerve paresis. The lateral approach performed with ultrasound control has a minimal risk of phrenic nerve paresis or pneumothorax and so may be a better choice in those with respiratory compromise, but provides less reliable upper arm anaesthesia. Complications are rare and less frequent than supraclavicular approaches and vary depending on the specific infraclavicular technique used. Although the axillary block provides safe and straightforward regional anaesthesia of the arm, the infraclavicular approach does offer an alternative in some specific situations and can be considered a ble routine alternative in experienced hands.

"A 35 yr old lady with normal PT and increased a PIT. 2 year back, she was operated for cholecystectomy & did not have any bleeding episoe. What is next investigation for clinical diagnosis aEUR'",Factor VIII assay,Anti viper venom assay,Platelet aggregation test,Ristocetin Cofactor assay,"Anti viper venom assay The only clue given in the question is patient with prolonged APTT and no clinical bleeding. First we, look at the causes of isolated prolongation of APTT. Causes of isolated prolongation of PT Heparin - Lupus anticoagulant - Coagulation factor deficiency (factor V111, IX and XI, XII, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) Specific coagulation factor inhibitors (antibodies against .factor VIII or IX) Now we look for those causes of prolonged APTT which are not associated with bleeding Now we move on to the options and find out which among them will cause prolongation of PTT with no bleeding. Factor Ville assay:- Factor Ville or intrinsic factor VIII can be ruled out because its deficiency is associated with bleeding. Platelet aggregation tests :? Platelet aggregation test measures platelet function Any defect in platlet function will cause clinical bleeding Platelet .function defect does not affect PTT (it affects bleeding time, BT) Ristocetin co-factor assay :- Ristocetin co:factor assays are used to detect Von wilebrand's disease Von wilebrands disease cause prolongation of PTT but it is also associated with clinical bleeding so it can be ruled out. Russel viper venom test (Dilute Russel viper venom test) (dRVVT) Dilute Russel viper venom test is one of the test to detect lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulant is associated with prolongation in PTT and thrombosis (no bleeding) Lupus anticoagulant Lupus anticoagulants are acquired inhibitors directed against phospholipid binding proteins and are a common cause of APTT prolongation In Vivo, Lupus anticoagulant do not interfere with coagulation factor complex .formation on the platelet surface and are not usually associated with bleeding tendency, instead they are frequently associated with thrombosis. In Vitro, This prolongation results in paradoxical prolongation of phospholipid based clotting assays such as P77, kaolin clotting time and Dilute Russel viper venom antibody (dRVVT testing). A panel of test is required to confirm the presence of lupus antico- agulant These are:? - PTT - Kaolin clotting time - Dilute Russel viper Venom test (DRVT) These are phospholipid dependent tests We have already discussed that Lupus anticoagulant act against phospholipids and in vitro this inhibition leads to prolongation of phospholipid dependent assays. Follow up testing is performed to confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant:-These may include :- Mixing study - An equal volume of patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and a PTT or DRVVT is performed on this mixture. The basic principle is that the normal plasma contributes a sufficient amount of clotting factor to correct .for a factor deficiency. - A mixing study that corrects the APTT is characteristic of a coagulation factor where as one that does not correct indicates a factor inhibitor. Correction neutralization (with phospholipids) :? - An excess of pho.spholipid is added to the patient sample and APII, DRVVT is performed. - The basic principle behind this is that lupus anticoagulant is directed against phospholipid. Hence phospholipid dependent assays are prolonged. - When excess phospholipid is added it overcomes the LA inhibition and corrects the test.",B

Which of the following is not true about the pleomorphic adenoma of parotid gland?,Facial nerve involvement indicate malignancy,It occurs most commonly in parotid gland,Malignant disease is most common variety,Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice,"Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice The ratio of malignant to benign tumors by the as well: parotid gland, 80% benign and 20 % malignant; Submandibular gland and sublingual gland, 50% benign and 50% malignant; and minor salivary glands, 25% benign and 75% malignant Facial nerve palsy is an infrequent presenting complaint and indicate malignancy. Pleomorphic adenoma (mixed tumor): This is the commonest tumor of the major salivary gland and its marked feature id histological diversity. It is called mixed because beside epithelial element there is also myxoid, hyline, chondroid (cailaginous) and even osseous bone. About 90% of pleomorphic adenoma is seen in parotid gland ,7% is seen in submandibular gland. tail of the parotid is commonest location in the tail of parotid. Nature of tumor: It is basically a benign tumor. Recurrence rate, which is repoed to be high, was mostly due to fault in the surgical technique in the form of simple enucleation which was often used earlier. The incidence of malignant transformation increases with the duration of the tumor, being 2% for tumors present with less than 5 years duration and 10% for those of more than 15 years duration. Treatment: This tumor is radioresistant, so excision is treatment of choice. Superficial parotidectomy is the treatment of choice, this operation is known as patey's operation. In case of submandibular gland neoplasm, the whole gland is excised with paicular care to preserve the lingual and hypoglossal nerve.

A Child presents with complaints of abdominal colic and hematuria USG showed a renal stone 2.5cm in diameter in renal pelvis the next step in management of this case -,ESWL,PCNL,Nephroureterostomy,Conservative,"ESWL is the treatment of choice for most of the renal calculi which are not able to pass spontaneously, however PNL is the preferred method for larger (>2 cm) renal stones.
Campbell's Urology writes- 'In summary, for patients harboring nonstaghorn stones smaller than 10 mm, SWL is usually the primary approach. For patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm, SWL can still be considered a first-line treatment unless factors of stone composition, location, or renal anatomy suggest that a more optimal outcome may be achieved with a more invasive treatment modality (PNL or ureteroscopy). Patients with stones larger than 20 mm should primarily be treated by PNL unless specific indications for ureteroscopy are present (e.g., bleeding diathesis, obesity).'
Spontaneous passage of stones — Most stones <5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously. For stones larger than 5 nun in diameter, there is a progressive decrease in the spontaneous passage rate, which is unlikely with stones >10 mm in diameter.
The choice of intervention for stones that are unlikely to pass spontaneously varies with the location and size of the stone.
Three minimally invasive surgical techniques currently available are:

Shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
Rigid and flexible ureteroscopy (URS)

CMV infections may occur as either primary or reactive infections and have a peak incidence at about 6-week post-transplant. The classic signs include fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, and leukopenia. CMV infection can affect several organ systems and result in pneumonitis; ulceration and hemorrhage in the stomach, duodenum, or colon; hepatitis; esophagitis; retinitis; encephalitis; or pancreatitis. The risk of developing posttransplant CMV depends on donor-recipient serology, with the greatest risk in seronegative patients who receive organs from seropositive donors.

The finger is held flexed at the distal interphalangeal joint. There is no active movement but passive movement is unimpaired. In time, the proximal phalanx may become hyperextended. o An x-ray should be obtained to look for any associated chip fracture. o Most injuries are treated conservatively. A mallet finger splint is applied to hold the distal interphalangeal extended whilst permitting movement at the proximal interphalangeal joint. o If conservative treatment fails then pa of the tendon is excised over the terminal phalanx and the joint held extended with aKirschner wire. o Extensor expansion (dorsal expansion, dorsal hood) refers to the flattened tendons (aponeurosis) of extensor muscles that run into the back of the hand. o At the distal end of the metacarpal, the extensor tendon will expand to form a hood, which covers the back and sides of the head of the metacarpal and the proximal phalanx. o The expansion soon divides into three bands: * Two lateral bands pass on either side of the proximal phalanx and stretch all the way to the distal phalanx.

Generally, these are indications of locally invasive or even metastatic disease manifest by tracheoesophageal fistulas, and vocal cord paralysis.* Even when detected as a small lesion, esophageal cancer has poor survival because of the abundant esophageal lymphatics leading to regional lymph node metastases.* Benign esophageal tumors are uncommon and usually discovered incidentally.

A child is posted for operative repair of exostrophy of bladder with renal failure. Which anesthetic should be preferred?,Pancuronium,Vecuronium,Ataracurium,Rocuronium,"C i.e. Ataracurium In pediatric patients the choice of non depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on side effects and duration of action. The method of excretion of atracurium and cisatracurium (Hofman elimination and ester hydrolysis) makes these relaxants paicularly useful in newborns and children with liver or renal diseaseQ. If tachycardia is desired (eg with fentanyl anesthesia), pancuronium would be an appropriate choice. Vecuronium, atracurium, rocuronium & cisatracurium are useful for shoer procedures. Rocuronium offers an advantage that it can be administered intramuscularly (like Sch) preferably in deltoid however, the duration of action is - 1 hour, which could be a distinct disadvantage for a brief procedure. Vecuronium is valuable because no histamine is released; however, its duration of action is prolonged in newborns, which makes it similar to pancuronium The potential for rhabdomyolysis & hyperkalemia (paicularly in boys < 8 yrs who may have unrecognized muscular dystrophy), as well as for masseter spasm (jaws of steel), malignant hypehermia, cardiac arrhythmias, and myoglobinemia after administration of succinyl choline suggests that Sch should not be used routinely in children. Unlike adult patients profound bradycardia & sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following 1st dose of Sch without atropine pretreatment. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following Sch administration, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. Howeve, it is the only available ultrasho acting muscle relaxant that provides a dependable, rapid onset of action. IV use of Sch should be limited to children who have full stomach or to treat laryngospasm. Intramuscular, intralingual (Submental) use is indicated for children with difficult intravenous access when control of airway is deemed essential. Mivacurium is an alternative to Sch when profound neuromuscular block of sho duration is required but rapid onset of action is unnecessary. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade in all neonates & small infants, is recommended, even if they have recovered clinically, because any increase in work of breathing may cause fatigue and respiratory failure. Sugammadex, a cyclodextrin whose endoskeleton forms a water soluble complex with exoskeleton of rocuronium, is designed to antagonize the effects of rocuronium. As it is made of sugars and antagonize by covalent bonding the side effects are minimal. Antagonism is more rapid than neostigmine/atropine. It also reverse the other steroidal relaxants vecuronium & pancuronium to a lesser extent. The mechanism of reversal is lowering of plasma conentation & thus reversing the concentration gradient and pulling the rocuronium off the myoneural junction.",B
what % of testicular carcinoma is associated with crytorchidism?,10%,30%,70%,90%,"Testicular Tumours: Epidemiology and Risk Factors Of all primary testicular tumours, 90-95% are germ cell tumours (seminoma and nonseminoma) More common in whites and individuals of higher socioeconomic class Slightly more common on the right side than on the left, which parallels the increased incidence of cryptorchidism on the right side. Of primary testicular tumours, 1-2% are bilateral, and about 50% of these tumours occur in men with a history of unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism Seminoma is the most common germ cell tumour in bilateral primary testicular tumours, while malignant lymphoma is the most common bilateral tumour of the testis The strongest association has been with the cryptorchid testis. Approximately 7-10% of testicular tumours develop in patients who have a history of cryptorchidism; seminoma is the most common form of tumor these patients have.

Insulinoma is most commonly located in which part of the pancreas -,Head,Body,Tail,Equally distributed,"“Insulinomas invariably occur only in the pancreas, distributed equally in the pancreatic head, body and tail'. — Harrison 17/e

Insulinomas are a β cell endocrinal tumur of the pancreas.
Insulinomas are the most common pancreatic endocrine neoplasms.
The symptoms are produced due to excessive secretion of insulin causing hypoglycemia
Most of the insulinomas are solitary and benign,
Only about 10-15% of insulinomas are malignant. (keep in mind that all other endocrine tumours of pancreas are usually malignant).

Symptoms of insulinoma

The most common symptom is due to the effect of hypoglycemia on the central nervous system.
These symptoms are - confusion, disorientation, visual difficulties, irrational behaviour, coma
Other symptoms are due to increased secretion of catecholamines which includes sweating, tremor and palpitations.
Classic diagnostic criteria is - Whipple's triad
Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia during fasting.
Blood glucose below 2.8 mmol/L (50mg/dl) during symptomatic episodes.
Relief of symptoms by intravenous administration of Glucose.
The most useful diagnostic test and the only one indicated in almost all patients is demonstration Wasting hypoglycemia in the presence of inappropriately high level of insulin.
The patient is fasted for 72 hrs or till the symptoms of hypoglycemia develop.
When hypoglycemia develops, serum level of insulin is measured. A ratio of plasma insulin to glucose > 0.3 is diagnostic.

Localization of the tumour

Once the diagnosis has been made, localization of the tumour is must for surgery.
The most important examination for localization of tumour is intraoperative ultrasound, which can indentify pancreatic tumour in all cases.
It is more sensitive than any other method

Other important methods of localization -

High resolution CT and MN.
Endoscopic ultrasound examination of pancreas.
Selective arteriography

Treatment of Simple rib fracture includes following EXCEPT,Analgesics,Physiotherapy,Early ambulation,Strapping of chest,"Ans. d. (Strapping of chest) (Ref Bailey and Love 25th/343)Localised rib fracture due to direct trauma. A simple rib fracture may be serious in elderly people or in those with chronic lung disease who have little pulmonary reserve. Uncomplicated fractures require sufficient analgesia to encourage a normal respiratory pattern and effective coughing. Oral analgesia may suffice but intercostal nerve blockade with local anesthesia may be very helpful. Chest strapping or bed rest is no longer advised and early ambulation with vigorous physiotherapy (and oral antibiotics if necessary) is encouraged. A chest radiograph is always taken to exclude an underlying pneumothorax. It is useful to confirm the skeletal injuries but routine chest radiography may miss rib fractures. However, once a pneumothorax and major skeletal injuries are excluded, the management is the same - the local control of chest pain.THE COMPONENTS OF CHEST INJURY IN BLUNT TRAUMAMajor chest wall traumaa. Flail chest: This occurs when several adjacent ribs are fractured in two places either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum. The flail segment moves paradoxically, that is, inwards during inspiration and outwards during expiration, thereby reducing effective gas exchange. The net result is poor oxygenation from injury to the underlying lung parenchyma and paradoxical movement of the flail segment. This creates a right-to-left shunt and prevents full saturation of arterial blood. In the absence of any other injuries and, if the segment is small and not embarrassing respiration, the patient may be nursed on a high-dependency unit with regular blood gas analysis and good analgesia until the flail segment stabilises. In the more severe case, endotracheal intubation is required with positive pressure ventilation for up to 3 weeks, until the fractures become less mobile. Thoracotomy with fracture fixation is occasionally appropriate if there is an underlying lung injury to be treated at the same time. An anterior flail segment with the sternum moving paradoxically with respiration can be stabilised by internal fixation but operative management is not usual for either.b. First rib fracturec. Fractures of the sternum.d. Vertebraee. Pleuraf. Traumatic pneumothoraxg. Continuing blood loss in excess of 200 mL/hour may require urgent thoracotomy within the first few hours.h. Lung contusion.It is important to prevent infection of the underlying lung by early mobilisation (if the patient's condition permits), prophylactic antibiotics, suction drainage and physiotherapy.MANAGEMENT OF BLUNT CHEST TRAUMAMost chest injuries where the heart is not injured are managed conservatively with underwater seal drainage if necessary, and oxygen and physiotherapy to help the patient to expectorate while the underlying lung parenchyma heals. In about 10 per cent of cases a thoracotomy is required. The indications for thoracotomy following blunt thoracic trauma are the following:# 50--1000 mL of blood at the time of initial drainage is common and may need no further action, but greater volumes, especially if the blood is fresh, require intervention;# continued brisk bleeding (>100 mL/15 minutes) from the intercostal drains indicates a serious breach of the lung parenchyma and urgent exploration is required;# continued bleeding of >200 mL/hour for 3 or more hours may require thoracotomy under controlled conditions;# rupture of the bronchus, aorta, esophagus or diaphragm;# cardiac tamponade (if needle aspiration is unsuccessful).All explorations following trauma should have double-lumen tube endotracheal intubation to facilitate surgery on the injured side and to protect the undamaged lung.",D
Which of the following represents the concentration of adrenaline which is used with lidocaine ?,0.180555556,1.430555556,1:20000,1:200000,"Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Epinephrine, in concentrations of 5 mcg/ml, is commonly used to decrease the absorption of local anesthetics. A 5 mcg/ml (1:200,000) dose of epinephrine will significantly reduce the peak blood levels of lidocaine and mepivacaine regardless of the site of administration. Epinephrine does not affect the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine in the epidural space. However, the addition of epinephrine does significantly reduce the vascular absorption of etidocaine and bupivacaine when utilized for peripheral nerve blocks. Benefits of decreased absorption include increased neuronal uptake, enhanced quality of analgesia/anesthesia, prolonged duration of action, and decreased risk of toxicity. A concentration of 1:200,000 (5 mcg/ml) is commonly used for peripheral nerve blocks to reduce vascular absorption.",D

Which of the following is true regarding medullary carcinoma of the thyroid -,Arises from parafollicular cells,Secretes calcitonin,Occurs in families,All,"Ans. is 'a' Arises from parafollicular cells, 'b' Secretes calcitonin, 'c' Occurs in families Medullary Ca of thyroid are neuroendocrine neoplasms derived from the calcitonin secreting parafollicular cells (C cells) of thyroid which in turn are derived from the ultimobranchial bodies (These C cells are concentrated superlaterally in the thyroid lobes, which is where MTC usually develops) Most MTCs (75-80%) arise sporadically. The remainder occurs in the setting of MEN syndromes 2A or 2B or as familial tumors without an associated MEN syndrome. - The sporadic MTCs tend to originate in one lobe, whereas bilaterality and multicentricity is common in familial cases. The familial cases are also associated with C-cell hyperplasia, which is considered premalignant lesion of MTC. - Familial cases occur at a younger age, even childhood. Sporadic cases are seen in 6th decade. RET proto-oncogenes are known to play an impoant role in the development of both familial & sporadic MTCs. Patients with MTC often present with a neck mass that may be associated with palpable cervical lymphadenopathy (early spread to lymphatics is common) Diarrhoea is a feature in 30% of cases and this may be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine or prostaglandins produced by the tumour cells. (Ref B & L 25/e p797) Distal blood-borne metastasis to the liver, bone (frequently osteoblastic), and lung occur late in the disease. Diagnosis is established by FNAC - presence of amyloid stroma is diagnostic. raised serum calcitonin and CEA levels (Calcitonin is a more sensitive tumor marker, but CEA is a better predictor of prognosis) As it is not possible to distinguish sporadic from familial disease at initial presentation, all new patients with MTC should be screened for RET point mutations - pheochromocytoma (24 hr urinary levels of VMA, catecholamine & metanephrine) - hyperparathyroidism (serum calcium) (It is impoant to rule out a coexisting pheochromocytoma to avoid precipitating a hypeensive crisis & death during surgery) Also remember - MTC tumors don't take up radioiodine and are not hormone dependent.",D

Tec 6 vaporizer is used with.........,Halothane,Desflurane,Isoflurane,Trielene,"The most common such vaporizer is the Ohmeda Tec 6, designed specifically for use with desflurane. Desflurane has two physical propeies, making it unsuitable for use with a conventional vaporizer. First, it has a very high SVP (88.5 kPa at 20degC). A conventional vaporizer would require high fresh gas flows to dilute it to within clinically useful concentrations, making it uneconomical. Secondly, it has a low boiling point (23.5degC). At room temperature, it will intermittently boil resulting in large fluctuations in agent delivery. When boiling, there will be excessive agent delivery; however, it will then cool due to a large loss of latent heat of vaporization, resulting in an exponential decrease in SVP and under-delivery of agent. The Ohmeda Tec 6 overcomes these problems by using an electrical filament that heats the desflurane to 39degC, raising its SVP to 194 kPa, that is, nearly 2 atm. In addition to providing a stable SVP, this high pressure removes the need for a pressurized carrier gas--instead, the fresh or diluent gas is entirely separate from the vaporizing chamber",B
Treatment of bupivacaine toxicity includes: (PGI May 2011),Isoprenaline,Calcium channel blockers,Bretylium,Metoprolol,"Ans: C (Bretylium) TREATMENT OF BUP1VACA1NE INDUCED CARDIOTOXIC1TY MILLER 6TH/933'Many resuscitation drugs, including atropine, epinephrine, bretylium, lidocaine, amrinone, and phenytoin, have been used in animal studies and occasionally in humans for the treatment of bupivacaine overdose and cardiovascular collapse. In our view, beyond the established uses of epinephrine, vasopressin, and atropine in their designated steps in the advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocol and beyond the use of Intralipid as detailed later, there is no established role for anti arrhythmic drugs or other traditional resuscitation drugs in the setting of bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest It is not recommended that bupivacaine-induced ventricular arrhythmias be treated with iidocaine or amiodaroneThe clinical implications for cardiac resuscitation after intravascular injection or overdose of local anesthetic are the following: Miller 6th/933No medications are uniformly effective in facilitating resuscitation from bupivacaine-induced cardiac arrest or severe ventricular tachycardia. Basic principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be emphasized first, including attention to securing the airway; providing oxygenation and ventilation, and performing chest compressions if needed.Because resuscitation after local anesthetic-induced circulatory collapse is so difficult, prevention of massive intravascular injection or excessive dosing is crucial.Negative aspiration of the syringe does not always exclude intravascular placement, incremental, fractionated dosing should be the rule for all patients undergoing major conduction blockade. Although changes on the ECG are not always present before circulatory collapse, they often are, and continuous attention to the ECG (including changes in QRS morphology, rate, rhythm, or ectopy) may be lifesaving by terminating injection before a lethal dose is administered.If a patient experiences profound cardiovascular depression or circulatory arrest after the administration of bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or by extrapolation, other local anesthetics, then along with initiation of basic life support and theACLS protocol we support the recommendation of Weinberg and colleagues that a rapid bolus of Intralipid 20%<t\ 1.5 mL/kg (or roughly 100 mL in adults), be administered without delay, followed if necessary by an infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min for the next 10 minutesTreatment of Bupivacaine Induced Cardiotoxicity Barash Anesthesia 6th/545'Potent local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine! can produce profound cardiovascular depression and malignant dysrhythmias that should be promptly treated. Oxygenation and ventilation must be immediately instituted, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation if needed. Ventricular dysrhythmias may be difficult to treat and may need large and multiple doses of electrical cardioversion, epinephrine, vasopressin, and amiodarone. The use of calcium channel blockers in this setting is not recommended, as its cardiodepressant effect is exaggerated'A novel and promising treatment for cardiac toxicity is the administration of intravenous lipid to theoretically remove bupivacaine from sites of action. Administration of 100 mL of 20% lipid solution has been reported to allow successful resuscitation of a patient from bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias refractory to conventional therapy.These findings raise the question of whether standard propofol in a 10% lipid solution would be a preferred treatment for cardiac toxicity. However, the dose of lipid in a standard induction dose of propofol would be too small and the dose of propofol would lead to unacceptable cardiac depression",C

All of the following drugs are commercially marketed as racemic mixture except-,Bupivacaine,Thiopentone,Ropivacaine,Thiamylal,"Ropivacaine is pure s-isomer of bupivacaine. Enantiomers exist in two different spatial configurations, like right- and left-handed gloves, and are present in equal amounts in a racemic solution. They are optically active and can be differentiated by their effects on the rotation of the plane of a polarised light into dextrorotatory or levorotatory stereoisomers. The physicochemical propeies of the two enantiomeric molecules are identical, but the two enantiomers can have substantially different behaviours in their affinity for either the site of action or the sites involved in the generation of side effects. R(+) and S(-) enantiomers of local anaesthetics have been demonstrated to have different affinity for different ion channels of sodium, potassium, and calcium; this results in a significant reduction in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac toxicity (cardiotoxicity) of the S(-)enantiomer as compared with the R(+)enantiomer. The technological advancements have made it possible to develop Ropivacaine as an optically pure S(-) enantiomeric from the parent chiral molecule propivacaine. It belongs to the group of local anaesthetics, the pipecoloxylidides and has a propyl group on the piperidine nitrogen atom compared to bupivacaine, which has a butyl group.",C

A male with azoospermia found to have normal FSH & testosterone levels & normal size testes. Probable cause is,Vas obstruction,Kallman syndrome,Undescended testis,Klinefelter's syndrome,"Bilateral vas obstruction can cause azoospermia with normal FSH and testosterone levels and normal sized testis. Kallmann syndrome results from defective hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) synthesis. It is characterized by low luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimu- lating hormone (FSH) levels and low concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol). Patients with undescended testis have different FSH and LH levels with the level of sperm density and spermatogenesis. The FSH levels in men are usually inversely correlated with sperm counts and indicate the integrity of seminiferous tubules, a marker of spermatogenesis. Patients with bilateral undescended testes have significantly lower sperm motility, sperm concentration, testicular volume and inhibin B levels, while showing higher FSH and LH levels than those with unilateral undescended testis. Klinefelter's Syndrome is characterized by small testes, infeility, gynecomastia, tall stature/increased leg length, and hypogonadism in phenotypic males.Plasma concentrations of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) are increased in most adults with 47,XXY, and plasma testosterone is decreased (50-75%), reflecting primary gonadal failure.

A 20-year-old male finds a mass in his scrotum. The first step in evaluating this mass is,Palpation and transillumination,HCG and a-fetoprotein,Scrotal ultrasonography,Evaluation for inguinal adenopathy,"The first step in evaluating a scrotal mass is to determine whether the mass is in the testis or outside it. Most solid masses arising from within the testis are malignant. Palpation of the scrotal mass and transillumination (holding a flashlight directly against the posterior wall of the scrotum) will distinguish testicular lesions from other masses within the scrotum, such as hydrocele. Ultrasonography will confirm a solid testicular mass. The tumor markers b-HCG and a-fetoprotein are not used in the initial evaluation of a scrotal mass, but may be impoant when a solid mass suggestive of testicular carcinoma is found. b-HCG or AFP will be elevated in about 70% of patients with disseminated nonseminomatous testicular cancer. Seminomas are usually associated with normal tumor cell markers. Choriocarcinomas produce b-HCG. Endodermal sinus tumors or embryonal cell carcinomas are often associated with elevated AFP levels. The lymphatic drainage of the testis is into the periaoic nodes, not to the inguinal nodes. The periaoic nodes must be assessed radiographically, usually by CT scanning, if a testicular neoplasm is strongly suspected.",A

A 68 yr old man came with pain and swelling of right knee. Ahlback grade 2 osteoahritic changes were found on investigation. What is the fuher management?,Ahroscopic washout,High tibial osteotomy,Total knee replacement,Conservative,"Conservative [Ref: Campbell Operative Ohopaedics 11/e, p 916; Apley's Ohopaedics 9/e, p 572573; Turek's Ohopedics 6/e, p 616-621; Imaging of the knee : Techniques & application by A. Mark Davies et al 2003, p 12; Harrison 17/e, p 2163-21651 Initial management of most of the patients of knee OA is conservative or non-operative. Campbell operative ohopaedics writes ? 'Osteoahritis of the knee can cause symptoms ranging from mild to disabiling. Initial management of most patients should be nonoperative'. Surgical management is needed when the conservative management fails. Surgical management in brief : The choice of surgical procedure depends on the patient's age and activity demand, severity of the disease and the number of knee compaments involved. Ahroscopic washout or debridement: - It consists of trimming of degenerate meniscal tissue and osteophytes - It may delay the need for a more definitive procedure, especially in younger, active patients with localised degenerative ahritis that causes pain at rest without malalignment or instability - It may also be considered in active, older adults with mild to moderate OA Realignment osteotomy: High or proximal tibial osteotomy (HTO)? High tibial osteotomy is a procedure for the treatment of unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee (medial or lateral compament osteoahritis; usually it is medial; lateral compament osteoahritis is uncommon). Medial osteoahritis is associated with varus deformity of the knee. Varus deformity causes stresses to be concentrated medially, accelerating degenerative changes in the medial pa of the joint (similarly if the deformity is of valgus position, changes are accelerated in the lateral pa). The biomechanical rationale for proximal tibial osteotomy in patients with unicompamental osteoahritis of the knee is 'unloading' of the involved joint compament by correcting the malalignment and redistributing the stresses on the knee joint. Thus medial osteoahritis is treated by a varus correcting osteotomy (k/a valgus osteotomy) and the uncommon lateral osteoahritis corrected by valugus correcting osteotomy (k/a varus osteotomy). According to Ebnezar (3/e p547) High tibial osteotomy is done for varus deformity less than 15deg and valgus deformity less than 12deg. Supracondylar or distal femoral osteotomy? - distal femoral osteotomy is done for correction of valgus deformity more than 12 to 15deg (Ref Campbell's Ohopaedics 1/e chapter 25) Total knee ahroplasty: - It is done for older patients with advanced OA that causes incapacitating pain and disability or young patients with tricompamental (medial and lateral tibio femoral and patellofemoral) disease. But it should be delayed in young patients as long as possible as prostheses may wear out over time and may need fuher revision surgery. Unicompamental ahroplasty: - In carefully selected patients with either medial or lateral osteoahritis, it is becoming a ble alternative to TKA and HTO. Knee ahrodesis: - Ahrodesis is indicated less commonly than ahroplasty. If the patient is young and involved in heavy occupation, ahrodesis is indicated to give him a stable and strong knee. - This procedure provides permanent pain relief and allows the patient to return to durable, active work. However ahrodesis results in a stiff knee which is a severe disability. Ahlback's grading of osteoahritis Ahlback's grading is radiological grading of osteoahritis. Standard textbooks of Ohopaedics (Campbell, Turek, Apley's) and of Radiology (Grainger, Sutton, Greenspan's Ohopedic Imaging) do not mention anything about it. Treatment of osteoahritis depends on symptoms and clinical profile of pt and not on radiological grading. Still we are describing the grading below. Grading of osteoahritis Apa from Ahlback grading, other commonly used grading system is by Kellgren and Lawrence. The two grading system are compared as follows: Classification of knee OA Ahlback Kellgren and Lawrence Grade Definition Grade Definition Grade 1 'doubtful' Minute osteophytes doubtful significant Grade 2 'minimal' Definite osteophytes (unimpaired air space) Grade 1 Joint space narrowing (< 3 mm) Grade 3 'moderate' Moderate diminution of joint spaces Grade 2 Joint space obliferation Grade 4 ' severe ' Joint space great impaired with sclerosis of subchondral bone Grade 3 Minor bone attrition (0-5 mm) Grade 4 Same as above Grade 4 Moderate bone attrition (5-10 mm) Grade 4 As above Grade 5 Severe bone attrition (> 10 mm) Grade 4 As above Note- Grade I of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 3 of Kellgren and Lawrence& grade 2,3,4&5 of Ahlback is equivalent to grade 4 of Kellgren and Lawrence. It must be noted that the radiological grading may not correlate with clinical symptomology of the patients. The treatment is based on the symptoms of patient (and not merely on radiographic appearances)",D

Also, seminomas are relatively common in men (30% of testicular germ cell tumors), while dysgerminomas are rare in women (1% of ovarian tumors). Both of these tumors are composed of sheets of uniform polyhedral cells with intervening fibrous septa of connective tissue, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. The number of mitoses per high-power field and ultrastructural appearance do not differ greatly between the two tumors.

"A 72-year-old man with diabetes, renal insufficiency, and coronary aery disease presents in septic shock from emphysematous cholecystitis. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 6-L nasal cannula and his hemoglobin is 7.2 mg/dL. His mixed venous oxygen saturation is 58%. Which of the following treatment options will improve his oxygen delivery the most?",Increase his inspired oxygen concentration,Transfer him to a hyperbaric chamber,Administer an erythropoietic agent,Transfuse two units of packed red blood cells,"Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells will increase the patient's oxygen delivery the most. Mixed venous oxygen saturation reflects the difference between the oxygen delivered to the tissues and the oxygen taken up by the tissues. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac index and oxygen content of blood (CaO2 ), the latter of which is determined primarily by hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) and the paial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 ) contribute much less. The formula for oxygen content (CaO2 ) can be expressed as CaO2=1.36*Hb*SaO2/100+0.0031*PaO2. Since the patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, increasing his inspired oxygen concentration is unlikely to increase his oxygen delivery. Since the contribution of PaO2 is so low, hyperbaric oxygen is also not the treatment of choice. Fuhermore, transpoing unstable patients to the hyperbaric chamber can be dangerous.

Associated with urinary bladder carcinoma are all of the following except: September 2009,Smoking,Human papilloma virus infection,Schistosomiasis,Cyclophosphamide,"Ans. B: Human papilloma virus infection Up to 80% of bladder cancer cases are associated with environmental exposure, which suggests that bladder cancer is potentially preventable. Smoking is the most commonly associated risk factor and accounts for approximately 50% of all bladder cancers. Nitrosamine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-aminobiphenyl are possible carcinogenic agents found in cigarette smoke. Bladder cancer is also associated with industrial exposure to aromatic amines in dyes, paints, solvents, leather dust, inks, combustion products, rubber, and textiles. Therefore, higher-risk occupations associated with bladder cancer include painting, driving trucks, and working with metal. Several medical risk factors are associated with bladder cancer. Patients with prior exposure to radiation treatment of the pelvis have an increased risk of bladder cancer. Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer exposure to acrolein, a urinary metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Patients with spinal cord injuries who have long-term indwelling catheters have a 16- to 20-fold increased risk of developing carcinoma of the bladder.

The biochemical propeies that promote cqoprecipitation are not well understood but three different types of cryoglobulins have been described. Type I This type of moglobulin contains a monoclonal inununoglobulin (IgM) and is most often due to underlying multiple myeloma or waldenstroms macroglobulinetnia. Type II or Essential ,nixed cryoglobulinemia (contains mixture of two antibodies) This type of cryoblobulin contains both a polytonal IgGdeg (which may either act as on antigen or be directed against an antigen) and a monoclonal(' IgM rheumatoid factor directed against the IgG. Most cases are due to chronic infection with hepatitis C virus('. Type III This also has mixed cryoglobulin but both the IgG and the rheumatoid factor IgM are polyclonalQ. This condition is often seen in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders (such as lupus and leucocytoclastic vasculitis) lymphoproliferative malignancies and in as many as one half of cases HCV infection. Cryoglobulinemia may also be classified based on the association with an underlying disease : -Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia When the cryoglobulins are a mixture of various antibody types and forms for unknown reasons, the condition is called essential mixed cryoglobulinemia. However the discovery of a close association between hepatitis virus (HCV) and mixed cryoglobulinemia has tasted doubt on the existence of essential or idiopathic cryoglobulinemia. Current evidence suggests that in majority of cases essential mixed cryoglohulinemia occurs when an aberrant immune response to Hepatitis C infection leads to formation of immune complexes consisting of :-- Hepatitis C antigen - Polyclonal hepatitis C specific IgG - Monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor These immune complexes are thought to outstrip reticuloendohelial clearing activity.

Minimum &;starvation time&; required in general anaesthesia,4 hours,8 hours,12 hours,24 hours,"Traditionally, patients are considered to be at risk if their gastric volume is greater than 25 mL (0.4 mL/kg) and their gastric pH is less than 2.5. Some investigators believe that controlling acidity is more impoant than volume and that the criteria should be revised to a pH less than 3.5 with a volume greater than 50 mL. Patients who have eaten immediately prior to emergency surgery are obviously at risk. Traditionally, 'NPO after midnight' implied a preoperative fast of at least 6 h. The current opinion allows clear liquids until 2 h before the induction of anesthesia. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guideline, breast milk is permitted up to 4 h before anesthesia. Infant formula, nonhuman milk, and a light meal are permitted up to 6 h before induction. Patients consuming a heavy meal including meat, fats, and fried foods should fast for 8 h. Ceain patient populations are paicularly likely to have large volumes of acidic gastric fluid: patients with an acute abdomen or peptic ulcer disease, children, the elderly, diabetic patients, pregnant women, and obese patients. Fuhermore, pain, anxiety, or opioids may delay gastric emptying. Note that pregnancy and obesity place patients in double jeopardy by increasing the chance of aspiration (increased intraabdominal pressure and distoion of the lower esophageal sphincter) and the risk of aspiration pneumonia (increased acidity and volume of gastric contents). Aspiration is more common in patients undergoing esophageal, upper abdominal, or emergency laparoscopic surgery. Ref: Morgan & Mikhail&;s clinical anesthesiology 6e",B
True about thermal burn injury:,Zone of stasis is the innermost layer,Zone of hyperaemia is the middle layer,Zone of coagulation is the outermost layer,Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage,"Ans is D (Zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage) Pathophysiology of Burns Burn causes coagulative necrosis of the epidermis and underlying tissues, with the depth depending on the temperature to which the skin is exposed and the duration of exposure. The area of cutaneous injury has been divided into three zones: zone of coagulation, zone of stasis, and zone of hyperemia Zone of coagulation: The volume injured most severely, in the center of the wound, is the zone of coagulation. This is the area of necrosis where the cells have been disrupted. The tissue is irreversibly damaged at the time of injury. Zone of stasis: Outside the zone of coagulation is the zone of stasis. The zone of stasis is ischemic but potentially salvageable. Depending on the wound environment, can either survive or progress to coagulative necrosis. The zone of stasis is associated with vascular damage and vessel leakage.. Zone of hyperaemia: Beyond the zone of stasis lies the zone of hyperaemia This area is characterized by minimal cell injury but with vasodilatation due to neighboring inflammation-induced mediators. This region contains clearly ble tissue from which the healing process begins and is generally not at risk for fuher necrosis. In practice, attentive wound care and careful fluid resuscitation may salvage the zone of stasis and prevent a superficial injury from becoming full thickness",D
Which drug reduces intraocular pressure by decreasing the formation of the aqueous humor?,Timolol,Behothiophate,Pilocarpine,Isofluorphate,"When applied topically to the eye, both the direct-acting cholinomimetic agents (e.g., pilocarpifle) and those cholinomimctic drugs that act by inhibition of AChE (e.g.. echothiophate, isofluorphate. and physostigmine) cause miosis by contracting the sphincter muscle of the iris and reducing ocular pressure by contracting the ciliary muscle. In patients with glaucoma, this latter effect permits greater drainage of the aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork in the canal of Schlemm and a reduction in resistance to outflow of the aqueous humor. Ceain b-adrenergic blocking agents (e.g., timolol and levobunolol) applied to the eye are also very useful in treating chronic wide-angle glaucoma. These drugs appear to act by decreasing the secretion (or formation) of the aqueous humor by antagonizing the effect of circulating catecholamines on 13- b-adrenergic receptors in the ciliary epithelium",A

Features of hypehyroidism are all except: March 2007,Voracious appetite,Cold intolerance,Emotional disturbance,Sleeplessness,"Ans. B: Cold intolerance Causes Functional thyroid tissue producing an excess of thyroid hormone occurs in a number of clinical conditions. The major causes are: - Graves' disease (the most common etiology with 70-80%) - Toxic thyroid adenoma - Toxic multinodular goitre High blood levels of thyroid hormones/hypehyroxinemia can occur for a number of other reasons: - Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. There are a number of different kind of thyroiditis including Hashimoto's (immune mediated), subacute (inflammatory), and DeQuervain's (granulomatous). These may be initially associated with secretion of excess thyroid hormone, but usually progress to gland dysfunction and thus, to hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism. - Struma ovarii (a teratoma of the ovary) can produce excess thyroid hormone. - Amiodarone, a hea medication, can sometimes cause hypehyroidism. - Postpaum thyroiditis (PPT) occurs in about 7% of women. Major clinical signs include weight loss (often accompanied by a increased appetite), anxiety, intolerance to heat, fatigue, hair loss, weakness, hyperactivity, irritability, apathy, depression, polyuria, polydipsia, and sweating. Additionally, patients may present with a variety of symptoms such as palpitations and arrhythmias (notably atrial fibrillation), shoness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Long term untreated hypehyroidism can lead to osteoporosis Neurological manifestations can include tremor, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (paicularly of asian descent) periodic paralysis. Minor ocular (eye) signs, which may be present in any type of hypehyroidism, are eyelid retraction ('stare') and lid-lag. In hypehyroid stare (Dalrymple sign) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal (the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus, where the 'white' of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris). In lid-lag (von Graefe's sign), when the patient tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hypehyroidism. Neither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball) which occurs specifically and uniquely in Graves' disease. This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune mediated inflammation in the retroorbital (eye socket) fat. Measuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the blood is usually all that is required. A low TSH indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited by increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood, and is therefore a reliable marker of hypehyroidism. Measuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, may also contribute to the diagnosis. Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test to distinguish between causes of hypehyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis.",B

The radial aery lies between the brachioradialis tendons and flexor carpi radialis tendons, approximately 1-2 cm from the wrist, medial to the bony head of the distal radius. Before cannulation of radial aery The Modified Allen's Test has been the most frequently used method to clinically assess adequacy of ulnar aery collateral flow despite the lack of evidence that it can predict ischemic complications in the setting of radial aery occlusion. Doppler ultrasound can be used to evaluate collateral hand perfusion in an effo to stratify risk of potential ischemic injury from cannulation.",A

Large no. of patients have associated aoic aneurysms. Like aoic aneurysms, they are silent until critically symptomatic. However, unlike aoic aneurysms, they rarely rupture. The presenting manifestations are due to peripheral embolization and thrombosis leading to distal limb ischemia. Peripheral aneurysms rarely may also produce symptoms by compressing the local vein or nerve. Imaging: Duplex color ultrasound is inv of choice to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral aneurysms. Treatment Indications for treatment include acute lower limb ischemia, or transverse diameter greater 2 cm or presence of mural thrombus. Treatment consists of open surgery with prosthetic interposition grafting for femoral aneurysms and saphenous vein grafting for popliteal aneurysms. endovascular repair with stent grafts Pseudoaneurysm of the femoral aery due to aerial punctures can be successfully treated using ultrasound-guided compression of the neck of the aneurysm with or without thrombosis of the aneurysm by thrombin injection",D

Embolism is ruled as there is no likely source of emboli in this pt. (i.e. any hea ds as hea is the source of emboli for leg in 90% of the cases.) Aeritis rarely involves the lower limb vessels. Now Atherosclerosis Vs TAO Atherosclerosis is seen over 40 yrs of age (the highest incidence of atherosclerotic occlusive aerial ds in 6th & 7th decade) Where as TAO is seen in young male below 40 yrs of age. Atherosclerosis causes occlusion of large and medium sized vessels (Abdominal aoa, iliac aeries, femoral aeries, poplitial, tibial & peroneal aeries). TAO involves aeries of small & medium size (i.e. tibial aeries, plantar aries, radial aery) Symptoms of peripheral aerial insufficiency due to atherosclerosis is predominantly seen in lower extremity whereas TAO may cause symptoms in both upper or lower limbs.

Metastasis from follicular carcinoma should be treated by: September 2007,Radioiodine,Surgery,Thyroxine,Observation,"Ans. A: Radioiodine Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) is a well-differentiated tumor. In fact, FTC resembles the normal microscopic pattern of the thyroid. FTC originates in follicular cells and is the second most common cancer of the thyroid, after papillary carcinoma. Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are considered to be differentiated thyroid cancers; together they make up 95% of thyroid cancer cases. Papillary/follicular carcinoma must be considered a variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (mixed form), and Huhle cell carcinoma should be considered a variant of FTC. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, follicular carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, FTC tumors may spread easily to other organs. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years. Patients with FTC are more likely to develop lung and bone metastases than are patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The bone metastases in FTC are osteolytic. Older patients have an increased risk of developing bone and lung metastases. The initial treatment for cancer of the thyroid is surgical. The exact nature of the surgical procedure to be performed depends for the most pa on the extent of the local disease. A total thyroidectomy is performed if the primary tumor is larger than 1 cm in diameter or if there is extrathyroidal involvement or distant metastases. Clinically evident lymphadenopathy should be removed with a neck dissection. If the primary tumor is less than 1 cm in diameter, a unilateral lobectomy might be considered. About 4-6 weeks after surgical thyroid removal, patients must have radioiodine to detect and destroy any metastasis and any residual tissue in the thyroid.",A

Malignancy is usually a squammous cell carcinoma and has not been mentioned as a complication of lymphoedema. Features of chronic lymphoedema of limb Initially the lymphoedema is soft and pits on pressure but with time the skin becomes thickened & non-pitting due to fibrosis, dermal thickening and hyperkeratosis. Frequent episodes of lymphangitis and cellulitis may occur. this is believed to be due to loss of local immune defence mechanism. Chronic eczema, fungal infection of skin (dermatophytosis) and nails (onychomycosis), fissuring, verrucae and papillae (was) are frequently seen in advanced disease. Rarely malignancy (lymphangiosarcoma or angiosarcoma) may occur in chronic lymphoedema. This neoplastic transformation of blood vessels and lymphatics is called Stewa - Treves syndrome.",C

"A 20-year-old male presented with a midline soft tissue swelling in front of neck. On examination it is a cystic mass of 2 x 2 cm in size, which moves with deglutition and swallowing. No other significant finding observed. Which of the following is the definitive management for this condition:",Reassure the patient and regular follow-up,Surgical removal of cyst,Steroid injection into the cyst,Sistrunk's operation,"Ans. D. Sistrunk's operationExplanationThe thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base of the tongue towards its position in the lower neck with the isthmus lying over the second and third tracheal rings.At the time of its descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed and the track of the descent of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body.Thyroglossal duct cysts represent a persistence of this track and may therefore be found anywhere in or adjacent to the midline from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus.The cysts almost always arise in the midline but, when they are adjacent to the thyroid cartilage, they may lie slightly to one side of the midline. Classically, the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and with tongue protrusion.Thyroglossal cysts may become infected and rupture onto the skin of the neck presenting as a discharging sinus.Often occur in children, they may also present in adults, even as late as the sixth or seventh decade of life.TreatmentIncludes excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, which involves removal of the body of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum, together with a core of tissue on either side (Sistrunk's operation).",D

Initial blood chemistry values include normal glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels; initial blood gas values reveal a pH of 7.53, paial pressure of oxygen (PO2) normal at 103 mmHg, and paial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) decreased at 27 mmHg. Which of the following treatment strategies is indicated?",Administer alkali to treat metabolic acidosis,Administer alkali to treat respiratory acidosis,Decrease the respiratory rate to treat metabolic acidosis,Decrease the respiratory rate to treat respiratory alkalosis,"Tachypnea in term infants may result from brain injuries or metabolic diseases that irritate the respiratory center. The increased respiratory rate removes ('blows off') carbon dioxide from the lung alveoli and lowers blood CO2, forcing a shift in the indicated equilibrium toward the left: CO2 + H2O H2CO2 H+ + HCO3- Carbonic acid (H2CO2) can be ignored because negligible amounts are present at physiologic pH, leaving the equilibrium: CO2 + H2O H+ + HCO3- The leftward shift to replenish exhaled CO2 decreases the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration and increases the pH (- log10) to produce alkalosis (blood pH above the physiologic norm of 7.4). This respiratory alkalosis is best treated by diminishing the respiratory rate to elevate the blood , force the above equilibrium to the right, elevate the , and decrease the pH. The newborn does not have acidosis, defined as a blood pH below 7.4, either from excess blood acids (metabolic acidosis) or from increased (respiratory acidosis). The baby also does not have metabolic alkalosis, caused by loss of hydrogen ion from the kidney (e.g., with defective tubular filtration) or stomach (e.g., with severe vomiting).",D

Cause of nephrocalcinosis in granulomatous ds aEUR',Increased absorption,"Increased conversion to 1,25 OH",Dystrophic calcification,Mutation in calcium sensing receptor,"Increased calcium absorption [Ref: Robbin's 7/e p. 2387; Harrison 17/e p. 23871 Hypercalcemia associated with sarcoidosis The predominant mechanism for the development of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria is the increased intestinal absorption of calcium induced by elevated calcitriol (1,25 hydroxyvitamin D). Sarcoidosis is associated with ectopic and unregulated synthesis of calcitriol by steroid tissue in response to sunlight or ingestion of vitamin D. The macrophage monocyte line of immune cells express the enzyme la hydroxylase which is identical to the I a hydroxylase present in kidney. - 1 a hydroxylase conves 25 hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 hydroxy vitamin D. (calcitriol) la hydroxylase 25 hydroxy vitamin D > 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D (Calcitriol) - (Normally this conversion takes place in kidney) 1,25 hydoxyvitamin D in turn causes increased absorption of calcium in intestine. Activity of I a hydroxylase enzyme is under negative feedback control in normal tissues. - However, in granulomatous disorder normal feed hack inhibition is abolished, probably by the effects of interferon gamma. - Interferon gamma induces the activity of la hydroxylase this leads to increased production of calcitriol (1,25 hydroxyvitamin D). - Increased production of calcitriol causes augumented intestinal absorption of calcium. Hypersensitivity to vitamin D remains despite b/I nephrectomy indicating that increase in serum calcitriol is not mediated by renal I a hydroxylase.",A

The initial fluid rate in burns patient for first 24 hours is -,TBSA x wt x 8,TBSA x wt x 4,TBSA x wt x 3,TBSA x wt x 2,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., TBS A x wt x 4 * Proper fluid management is critical to survival in a burn patient.* The hypovolemic shock in burn patient is special in the sense that the total body water remains unchanged in a burn patient. The thermal injury leads to a massive fluid shift from intravascular compartment to the extravascular compartment (interstitial + intracellular) leading to edema formation (in both burned parts and non burned parts of body)* This fluid shift is maximum in the first 24 hrs.* Fluid resuscitation begins with an isotonic crystalloid solution - Ringer's lactate solution (RL) is the preferred solution (Normal saline should be avoided as the volumes required for resuscitation may lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis). The concept behind the continuous fluid resuscitation is that the burn (and/or inhalation injury) drives an inflammatory response that leads to capillary leak; as the plasma leaks into the extra vascular space, crystalloid administration would maintain the intravascular volume.# The quantity of crystalloid needed for adequate resuscitation is determined by Parkland formula i.e. 4 mL/kg per % of TBSA burn. (Note that a number of formulas exist for calculating fluid needs during burn resuscitation, suggesting that no one formula benefits all patients. Parkland is one of the most commonly used formulas)# Half of the calculated fluid is given in first 8 hrs and half in next 16 hrs.* Colloids are given in the next 24 hrs. The reason behind it being the observation that in the initial period, the vascular permeability is so large that even larger protein molecules leak from the capillaries. (But some workers, prefer to use colloids after 8 to 12 hrs, while there are some who use it from the very beginning)* A number of parameters are widely used to assess burn resuscitation, but the most common remain the simple outcomes of blood pressure and urine output. As in any critically ill patient, the target MAP is 60 mmHg to ensure optimal end-organ perfusion. Goals for urine output should be 30 mL/h in adults and 1 to 1.5 mL/kg per hour in pediatric patients.* There is no use of diuretics in burn resuscitation.* Children under 20 kg have the additional requirement that they do not have sufficient glycogen stores to maintain an adequate glucose level in response to the inflammatory response. Specific pediatric formulas have been described, but the simplest approach is to add maintenance IV fluid with glucose supplementation in addition to the calculated resuscitation fluid with lactated Ringer's.",B

When performing surgical excision of the primary tumour, a 1 cm margin in all planes should be attempted in seeking a complete excision with pathologically clear (>5mm) margins. Resection resulting in paial or hemiglossectomy can be performed with either a cutting diathermy or laser if available. Advanced tumours (T3 and T4) often encroach upon the floor of the mouth and, occasionally, the mandible. In these circumstances a resection of the tongue and floor of the mouth and mandible is required. T4 tumours of the oral tongue may cross the midline, for which (sub)total glossectomy is the only option to achieve adequate tumour clearance. Decisions regarding elective neck dissections on the contralateral side will be dictated by radiological and clinical findings, in paicular proximity of the tumour to the midline.

In the typical morphology' epithelial.'' myoepithelial areas (right arrowhead) are punctuated by myxochondroid areas (arrows). The epithelial elements resembling ductal cells or myoepithelial cells are arranged in duct formations, acini, irregular tubules, strands, or sheets of cells. These elements are typically' dispersed within a mesenchyme-like background of loose myxoid tissue containing islands of chondroid and, rarely, foci of bone. Sometimes the epithelial cells form well-developed ducts lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with an underlying layer of deeply' chromatic, small myoepithelial cells. In other instances there may be strands or sheets of myoepithelial cells. Islands of well-differentiated squamous epithelium may also be present. In most cases there is no epithelial dysplasia or evident mitotic activity.(B) WARTHIN'S TUMOR:Most Warthin tumors are round to oval, encapsulated masses, 2 to 5 cm in diameter, usually arising in the superficial parotid gland, where they are readily palpable. Transection reveals a pale gray' surface punctuated by narrow' cystic or deftlike spaces filled with a mudnous or serous secretion.On microscopic examination there is Papillary projections lined by a double layer of neoplastic epithelial cells resting on a dense lymphoid stroma sometimes bearing germinal centers. Outer oncocytic layer of columnar cells having an abundant, finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm (red arrow'). Secretory cells are dispersed in the columnar cell layer, accounting for the secretions within the cystically dilated lumens. Inner oncocytic lay'er of cuboidal to polygonal cells (green arrow) resting on lymphoid stroma (yreilow arrow)(C) MUCOEPIDERMOID CARCINOMA: Mucoepidermoid carcinomas can grow as large as 8 cm in diameter and although they are apparently circumscribed, they lack well-defined capsules and are often infiltrative at the margins. Pale and gray-white on transection, they frequently contain small, mucin-containing cysts. The basic histologic pattern is that of cords, sheets, or cystic configurations three distinct cell lines of squamous/ epidermoid cells (long white arrow), mucous cells (black arrow), or intermediate cells (short white arrow). The hybrid cell types often have squamous features, with small to large mucus-filled vacuoles, best seen when highlighted with mucin stains. The tumor cells may be regular and benign appearing or, alternatively, highly anaplastic and unmistakably malignant. Accordingly, mucoepidermoid carcinomas are subclassified into low, intermediate, or high grade.(D) ADENOID CYSTIC CARCINOMA: In gross appearance, they are generally small, poorly encapsulated, infiltrative, gray-pink lesions. On histologic evaluation, they are composed of multiple basaloid epithelial cells having dark, compact nuclei and scant cytoplasm arranged in cribriform architecture (arrow A) with perineural invasion (arrow B). The spaces between the tumor cells are often filled with a hyaline material thought to represent excess basement membrane. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign, encapsulated mixed tumor of parotid gland. Malignant mixed tumors include both cancers originating from pleomorphic adenomas, termed carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, and de novo malignant mixed tumors. The risk for malignant transformation of benign pleomorphic adenomas is 1.5% within the first 5 years but increases to 9.5% once the benign tumor has been present for more than 15 years.",A

Tinel sign is seen in ?,Nerve degeneration,Nerve regeneration,Muscle degeneration,Muscle regeneration,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Nerve regeneration Pathological changes after nerve injury After nerve injury, nerve first degenerates and then tries to regenerate. Nerve degeneration The pa of the neurone distal to the point of injury undergoes secondary or Wallerian degeneration; the proximal pa undergoes primary or retrograde degeneration upto a single node. Nerve regeneration As regeneration begins, the axonal stump from the proximal segment begins to grow distally. If the endoneural tube with its contained Schwann cells is intact, the axonal sprout may readily pass along its primary course and reinnervate the end-organ. The rate of recovery of axon is 1 mm per day. The muscles nearest to the site of injury recovers first, followed by others as the nerve reinnervates muscles from proximal to distal, the so-called motor march.

"During the course of an operation on an unstable, critically ill patient, the left ureter is lacerated through 50% of its circumference. If the patient's condition is felt to be too serious to allow time for definitive repair, alternative methods of management include",Ligation of the injured ureter and ipsilateral nephrostomy,Ipsilateral nephrectomy,Placement of a catheter from the distal ureter through an abdominal wall stab wound,Placement of a suction drain adjacent to the injury without further manipulation that might convert the partial laceration into a complete disruption,"If time and the patient's condition permit, primary ureteral reconstruction should be carried out. In the middle third of the ureter, this will usually consist of ureteroureterostomy using absorbable sutures over a stent. If the injury involves the upper third, ureter pyeloplasty may be necessary. In the lower third, ureteral implantation into the bladder using a tunneling technique is preferred. If time does not permit definitive repair, suction drainage adjacent to the injured segment alone is inadequate; either ligation and nephrostomy or placement of a catheter into the proximal ureter is an acceptable alternative that would allow reconstruction to be performed later. The creation of a watertight seal is difficult and nephrectomy may be required if the injury occurs during a procedure in which a vascular prosthesis is being implanted (e.g., an aortic reconstructive procedure) and contamination of the foreign body by urine must be avoided.",A
Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007,Ankylosing spondylitis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Reiter's syndrome,Osteoahritis,"Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools. The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.",A

Commonest ligament injured in ankle injury ?,Anterior talofibular ligament,Calcaneofibular ligament,Posterior talofibular ligament,Spring ligament,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Anterior talofibular ligament The ankle is one of the most common sites for acute musculoskeletal injuries. Sprains constitute 85% of all ankle injuries, and 85% of those involve a lateral inversion mechanism. Inversion Sprain - Inversion ankle sprains occur when the foot turns in or out to an abnormal degree relative to the ankle. The most common mechanism of an ankle sprain is a combination of plantarflexion and inversion where the foot is pointing downward and inward. The lateral ligaments are involved in an inversion ankle sprain and hence most commonly damaged. These ligaments are on the outside of the ankle, which includes the anterior talofibular (ATFL), calcaneofibular (CFL) and posterior talofibular ligaments (PTFL). Injury to the ATFL is the most common. When both the ATFL and CFL are injured together, ankle instability will be more noticeable. The PTFL is the strongest of the three ligaments and is rarely injured in an inversion sprain.",A

Best treatment of cystic hygroma is ?,Radiotherapy,Sclerotherapy,Surgical excision,Chemotherapy,"Cystic hygroma usually present in the neonate or in early infancy, and occasionally may present at bih and be so large as to obstruct labour. The cysts are filled with clear lymph and lined by a single layer of epithelium with a mosaic appearance. Swelling usually occurs in the neck and may involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue and floor of mouth areas. The swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent. The cheek, axilla, groin and mediastinum are other less frequent sites for a cystic hygroma. The behaviour of cystic hygromas during infancy is unpredictable. Sometimes the cyst expands rapidly and occasionally respiratory difficulty ensues, requiring immediate aspiration andeven occasionally a tracheostomy. The cyst may become infected. Definitive treatment is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage.

Paralytic ileus is a state in which there is failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure.
The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel with associated distention, vomiting, absent or diminished bowel sounds and absolute constipation.
Radiological picture shows dilated gas filled bowel loops with multiple air-fluid level.
The picture is similar to mechanical small bowel obstruction; the only differentiating point is presence of gas in colon and rectum in paralytic ileus.
Other clinical differentiating features of paralytic ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction are.

Most of the anaesthetic drugs are detectable by entropy monitoring except:,Isoflurane,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,Sevoflurane,"Entropy monitoringis a method of assessing the effect of ceain anaesthetic drugs on the brain's EEG. It was commercially developed by Datex-Ohmeda, which is now pa of GE Healthcare. Entropy is a quantitative EEG device which captures a single-lead frontal EEG a 3-electrode sensor applied to the patient's forehead. The system relies on a method of assessing the degree of irregularity in electroencephalogram(EEG) signals. The principle is that the irregularity of an EEG signal decreases with increasing brain levels of anaesthetic drugs and that the entropy is a measure of that irregularity. Entropy monitors generate two numbers that are derived from different to frequency bands used. The State Entropy (SE) is calculated from the 0.8Hz to 32Hz range, whereas the Response Entropy (RE) uses frequencies up to 47Hz. Electromyogram activity is more predominant in those higher frequencies, and so the Response Entropy may respond more quickly when muscle activity is present. Published studies show that Entropy values do relate to clinical levels of anaesthetic depth. Most of the commonly-used anaesthetic drugs are detectable by Entropy monitoring, a notable exception being nitrous oxide, in common with BIS monitoring. Other vital signs such as pulse, hea rate, blood pressure, and movement are indirect indicators of consciousness, but are unreliable. When these are combined with expired gas analysis of inhalational anaesthetic agents, an experienced anaesthetist can be confident a patient is unconscious and not aware of their surroundings.",C

"A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent. She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Persistent foramen ovale,Patent ductus aeriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Pulmonary stenosis,"Patent ductus aeriosus. The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-like murmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",B

They always result in some degree of cailage damage. Ideally the joint surface should be restored to their original position and held there strongly enough that movement may be staed in the early postoperative period. some permanent loss of motion is to be expected and joint may develop degenerative ahritis as a result of the injury. Principles of intra aicular fracture Immobilization of intra aicular fracture results in joint stiffness Immobilization of aicular fracture, treated by open reduction and internal fixation, results in much greater stiffness. Depressed aicular fragments, which do not reduce as a result of closed manipulation and traction, are impacted and will not reduced by closed means. Major aicular depression do not fill with fibrocailage and the instability which results from their displacement, is permanent. Anatomical reduction and stable fixation of aicular fragment is necessary to restore joint congruity. Immediate motion is necessary to prevent joint stiffness and to ensure aicular healing and recovery. This require stable internal fixation. Radius fracture treatment ( of distal end i.e. intra aicular pa) K wire fixation may be helpful for smaller fragments. cast immobilization is indicated for nondisplaced fracture, displaced fractures with a stable fracture pattern. The cast should be worn approximately 6 weeks or until radiographic evidence of union has occured. Ahrodesis In this operation, fusion is achieved between the bones forming a joint so as to eliminate any motion at the joint. An ahrodesis is used most often for a painful, stiff joint. It is also performed for grossly unstable joints in polio etc. It is also used for grossly unstable joint due to trauma. Excision and aspiration of hematoma excision of damaged poion of bone and aspiration of intra aicular hematoma, are also included in management of intra aicular fracture.

After Hyperventilating for some time holding the breath is dangerous because –,Decrease CO2 shift the O2 dissociation curve to the left,Alkalosis can lead to tetany,It can lead to CO2 Narcosis,"Due to lack of stimulation by CO2, anoxia can go into dangerous levels","In our body its not O2, but CO2 that maintains the respiratory drive (though main function of respiration is to maintain adequate oxygen level in the body)
Thus its not hypoxia but hypercarbia that is required to inform the brain that respiration is inadequate.
If normally a person holds his breath he will soon have decrease O2 level (hypoxia) and increase CO2 level (hypercarbia)
Hypercarbia will stimulate the brain and increase the respiratory drive, forcing the person to take breath.

Lets see what happens when a person hyperventilates

Decreased PaCO2 of blood
Normal O2 saturation (despite hyperventilation arterial O2 saturation remains same as blood is almost fully saturated at normal ventilation rate)

Lets see what happens when such a person holds his breath.
● Soon his blood O2, level will fall (hypoxia) but his blood CO2 level will be normal or below normal (as he was hypocapnic due to hyperventilation)
● His blood O2 level will continue to fall, but his CO2 level will still be not high enough to stimulate the brain for respiratory drive.

The person will continue to hold his breath and his O2 level may fall to lethal levels without any respiratory drive (his brain is still unaware that he is in danger of dying from hypoxia).",D

C,Herpes simples,"The question indirectly asks most common viral infection post transplant . The risk of viral infection is highest during the first 6 months after transplantation and the most common problem is CMV infection. CMV disease may arise because of either reactivation of latent infection or primary infection that can be transmitted by an organ from a CMV-positive donor. Recipients at most risk from CMV infection are those who are CMV seronegative and receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor (about half of all UK donors are CMV seropositive). CMV disease typically presents at 4-8 weeks with a high swinging fever, lethargy and leukopenia. The severity of the disease is variable and the clinical picture depends on the organ system most affected. It may present as: pneumonia , gastrointestinal disease , hepatitis , retinitis , encephalitis. Severe CMV disease is potentially fatal. Prophylaxis for CMV consists of administration of antiviral agents but less effective alternatives.

Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min.

Most common lobe involved in BPH is,Lateral,Median,Anterior,Posterior,"BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA Aetiology Hormones Serum testosterone levels slowly but significantly decrease with advancing age; however, levels of oestrogenic steroids are not decreased equally. According to this theory, the prostate enlarges because of increased oestrogenic effects. It is likely that the secretion of intermediate peptide growth factors plays a pa in the development of BPH Pathology BPH affects both glandular epithelium and connective tissue stroma to variable degrees. These changes are similar to those occurring in breast dysplasia , in which adenosis, epitheliosis and stromal proliferation are seen in differing propoions. BPH typically affects the submucous group of glands in the transitional zone, forming a nodular enlargement. Eventually, this overgrowth compresses the PZ glands into a false capsule and causes the appearance of the typical 'lateral' lobes. When BPH affects the subcervical CZ glands, a 'middle' lobe develops that projects up into the bladder within the internal sphincter. Sometimes, both lateral lobes also project into the bladder, so that when viewed from within, the sides and back of the internal urinary meatus are surrounded by an intravesical prostatic collar.

All the following statements about lobular carcinoma of breast are true EXCEPT:,Easily detectable in mammography,30% bilateral,Lobectomy is less preferred,Difficult to detect in mammography.,"Ans) a (Easily...) Ref: Sabiston 18th ed, 17th ed p890, Robbins 7th ed p 1144Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) may be found by mammography, However, ILCdoes not always show up well on a mammogram because of the cells' tendency to grow in a single-file line, rather than form a mass. If mammogram does find invasive lobular carcinoma, the tumor may appear smaller than it actually is. Whenever a screening mammogram highlights an area of concern, additional mammograms often will be done to gather more information about that area. Mammography will be performed on both breasts. So ILC is difficult to detect in mammogram.Infiltrating lobular carcinomaInfiltrating lobular carcinoma accounts for about 5 percent of all malignant invasive cancers. It occurs most frequently in women between the ages of 45 and 56. The tumor grows in the terminal (last part) of the lobules where milk is produced. It usually does not show up on mammography and may feel like a thickening in the upper-outer quarter of the breast (from the nipple to under the arm) as it infiltrates the walls of the lobules.In about 30% of cases, this cancer is frequently found in the opposite breast.It is often found in other parts of the same breast (multicentric).Most tumors are positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors and thus respond well to hormonal therapy.Infiltrating lobular carcinoma sometimes has an increased incidence of spreading to the uterus and ovaries.Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) occurs bilaterally in 50 70% of cases, while ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) occurs bilaterally in 10 - 20% of cases.Invasive lobular carcinomaFrequently multifocal, multicentric and bilateral.Incidence increased in post menopausal women (related to post menopausal HRT)Histological hallmark - pattern of single infiltrating tumor cells, often only one cell in width (Indian File Pattern) or in loose clusters or sheets.Most lobular carcinoma show a loss of a region on chromosome 16 (e-cadherin and b catenin genes are lost)Lobular carcinoma have a different pattern of metastasis compared to other breast carcinoma (less likely to metastasis to lung and pleura)Well/moderately differentiated lobular carcinomaDiploidExpress hormone receptorsAssociated with LCIS in majority of casesHER 2/neu over expression is very rare.Poorly differentiated lobular carcinomaAneuploidOften lack hormone receptorsMay over express HER 2/neuUltrasound bounces sound waves off of the breast to create additional images of the tissue.

There is relative absence of inflammatory cells.

Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome

The pathogenesis of mucosal prolapse syndrome or solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is unclear. It has been postulated that there is a dysfunction of the neuromuscular control of defecation. This necessitates an increase in intraabdominal pressure to achieve expulsion of the stool. The pressure then forces a rectal mucosal fold to prolapse into the anal canal. Localized ischemia of the prolapsed mucosa as a result of local vascular compromise then produces the characteristic histological change of SRUS.
SRUS affects both sexes, over a wide range, but is most common in women 20-40 years of age.
Most lesions occur on the anterior or anterolateral rectal wall, but SRUS may involve the bowel anywhere from the sigmoid to the anorectal junction.
Despite the designation solitary rectal ulcer, in 10 to 15% of cases multiple ulcers may be present within a single patch of diseased mucosa.
Endoscopically only about half of the patients with SRUS have an actual ulcer. The remaining patients have an area of mucosal erythema, mucosal nodules, or frank polyps, which may or may not have surface ulceration.
The histological features can be correlated to the underlying pathogenesis of the disorder. Prolapsed mucosa becomes ischemic due to compression of the vascular supply, particularly the small veins. This leads to detachment of the surface epithelium and withering of the superficial portion of the crypts, similar to ischemia from any cause. Since the prolapse is typically intermittent, during intervals of normal blood flow regrowth of the mucosa is stimulated, resulting in mucosal hyperplasia due to elongation of the crypts. As an additional response to the ischemic injury, fibrosis of the lamina propria occurs. There may be crypt architectural distortion and branching similar to that evident in idiopathic irritable bowel syndrome, but without the dense lamina propria inflammation. The muscularis mucosa also becomes thickened and disorganized and tongues of muscle extend upwards from the muscularis mucosa to the surface epithelium.
In some cases the ischemia is severe enough to lead to erosion or ulceration, often with a scanty overlying pseudo membrane. The cells show enlarged, hyper chromatic nuclei, excess mitotic activity, and mucin-depleted goblet cells.",C

The underlying anal canal is covered by a bar of skin with atrack running forwards to the perineal raphe. The track should be opened with scissors, followed by routine dilatation of the anus.> Ectopic anus. The anus is situated anteriorly and may open in the perineum in boys, or more commonly in the vulva in girls, or rarely into thevagina. A plastic 'cut back' operation isrequired (Pena).> Stenosed anus. The anus is microscopic, but careful examination usually reveals a minute opening which responds to regular dilatation.> Membranous stenosis. Here the anus is normally sited, but is covered with a thin membrane which bulges with retained meconium. It is rare, and an incision will cure the condition.# High abnormalities:> These are often associated with a fistulous connection between the blind rectal stump and the bladder, or other abnormalities of the pelvic structures.> Anorectai agnesis. A blind rectal pouch lies just above the pelvic floor -- its anterior aspect in the male is attached to the bladder and often there is a rectovesical fistula manifested by the passage of gas or meconium in the urine. In the female, the fistula is usually into the posterior fornix.> Rectal atresia. The anal canal is normal but ends blindly at the level of the pelvic floor. The bowel also ends blindly above the pelvic floor without a fistulous opening. This anomaly is rare but must be treated by mobilisation of the rectum and excision of the stricture. After that, end-to-end anastomosis of the anus and rectum must be attempted.> More conservative measures are followed by an intractable stricture.> Cloaca.

But still I could give some help on a repeatedly asked topic - Solitary Pulmonary nodule (SPN)'When apt: presents with an asymptomatic SPN (defined as an X-ray density of any shape usually 1 to 6 cm in greatest diameter) a decision to resect or to follow the nodule must be made.Approximately 35% of all such lesion in adults are malignant, most being primary lung cancer; while < 1% are malignant in nonsmokers under 35 years of age.If no diagnosis is immediately apparent the following risk factors would all argue strongly in favour of proceeding with resection to establish a histological diagnosis -a h/o Cigarette smokingage 35 year or oldera relatively large lesionlack of calcificationchest symptomsassociated atelectasis, pneumonitis or adenopathyAt present, only 2 radiographic criteria are reliable predictors of the benign nature of a solitary pulmonary noduleLack of growth over a period of 2 yrs.Certain characteristic pattern of calcification (calcification alone does not exclude malignancy). Calcification patterns which are highly suggestive of a benign lesion -a dense central nidusmultiple punctate focibulls eye (granuloma)popcorn calcification (hamartoma)When old X-ray are not available and the characteristic calcification patterns are absent the following approach is reasonable -Non smoking patients younger than 35 yrs can be followed and any significant growth should lead to its resection.'For pts older than 35 yrs and all pts with smoking history, a histological diagnosis must be made.' - Harrison 15/e, Size - Masses larger than 4 cm are predominantly primary malignancies. -Sutton, 6/eCavitation - common cavitating lesion are tuberculosis, staphylococcal inf & carcinoma.Peripheral location - The maximum I could get is that Metastasis have predilection for the periphery but they are usually multiple nodules (75%)So much of B.C., but still we are not certain of the answer, but this text will certainly help you for future questions on this imp. topic.Cavitation was the answer of consensus in my circle.",C

Such decisions are based on tumor stage (TNM), grade, size, multiplicity, and recurrence patterno First see the staging (TNM)o The primary bladder cancer is staged according to the depth of invasion into the bladder wall or beyond The urothelial basement membrane separates superficial bladder cancers into Ta (noninvasive) and T1 (invasive) tumors. The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3. If the tumor involves contiguous structures such as the prostate, the vagina, the uterus, or the pelvic sidewall, the tumor is classified as stage T4.# Tis Ca in situ# Ta Ca confined to mucosa# T1 Ca confined to submucosa# T2 Muscle invasion# T3 perivescical fat invasion# T4 invasion of adjacent structures (prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abd. wall)o Now the histological grading.# There are 3 histological gradeso Grade I, II & IIIo There is a strong correlation between tumor grading and tumor recurrence progression and survival.Treatment options for bladder cancersCancer stageInitial treatment optionsTisComplete TUR followed by intravesical BCGTa (single, low-to- moderate grade, not recurrent)Complete TURTa (large, multiple, high grade, or recurrent)Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo-or immunologyT1Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo- or immunotherapy or radical cystectomyT2-T4Radical cystectomyNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cytectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapyConcomitant chemotherapy and irradiationAny T, N+, M+Systemic chemotherapy followed by selective surgery orirradiationo Intravesical therapy : Common agents used for intravesical therapy are# Mitomycin C# Thiotepa# BCGo Among these agents, BCG is the most effective.o The patient in question has T1 stage (Tumor upto submucosa)",B

Type of anaemia caused by pulmonary TB,Iron-deficiency,Megaloblastic,Sideroblastic,Microcytic Hypochromic anaemia,"Microcytie hypochromic anaemia Tuberculosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder. It is associated with anemia of chronic disease Anemia that is often observed in patients with infectious inflammatory or neoplastic disease that persists for more than 1 or 2 months is called anemia of chronic disease. - The characteristic feature of this group is occurrence of anemia in the presence of ample storage iron. The erythrocytes in anemia of chronic disease are usually normocytic and nonnochronic, however hypochromia and microcytosis may also be observed. The morphological features are determined by the primary disease. - 'For instance many patients with cancer have anemia that is typically normocytic and normochromic. In contrast patients with long standing active rheumatoid ahritis or chronic infections such as tuberculosis will have a microc tic hypochromic anemia'. The key pathological feature in anemia of chronic disease is failure to mobilize stored irony (ferritin). Ferritin is present in the macrophages of bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system. Under normal circumstances, iron can be mobilized back from the ferritin into the circulation. When developing erythrocytes require iron, the iron stored as ferritin is presented to the plasma from where it is carried to the developing erythrocytes. Why there is failure of iron mobilization in anemia of chronic disease? Anemia of chronic disease occurs in ceain inflammatory conditions or chronic disease. In these conditions macrophages are activated and they release ceain cytokines e.g. IF, IL-1, TNF. These cytokines stimulate synthesis of hepcidin in the liver. Increased hepcidin synthesis inhibits release of iron from the storage pool. Thus in anemia of chronic diseases, the macrophages, despite being rich in stored iron cannot provide iron to developing erythrocyte. The other impoant effect of cytokines released by rnacrophages in chronic inflammatory disorders is inhibition of CFUE (colony forming units erythroid). The inhibition leads to decreased synthesis of erythropoletin which in turn decreases erythropoiesis and produces anemia. The Hematological Parameters in Anemia of Chronic disease Serum iron --> Normal to decreased Serum ferritin --> Normal to increased TIBC --> Decreased % saturation Normal to increase Bone marrow iron stores --> Normal to increase MCV (MCH) --> Decreased",D

More about Pituitary adenomas 

It is the most common cause of hyperpituitarism.
Pituitary adenomas can be

- functional (i.e. associated with hormone excess and their clinical manifestations) or
- silent (i.e. without clinical symptoms of hormone excess. May or may not produce hormone)

Prolactinomas are the most common adenomas
Some pituitary adenomas can secrete two hormones - Growth hormone and prolactin being the most common combination
Rarely adenomas are plurihormonal
Age : usually found in adults
Gender

Prolactinomas have 4-5 : 1 female/male ratio
GH secreting adenomas have 2:1 male predominance.

Clinical signs & symptoms - occur due to hormone excess or mass effect (visual field disturbances, elevated intracranial pressure or occasionally hypopitutarism - d/t silent adenomas compressing normal pituitary)

A girl presented with severe hyperkalemia and peaked T waves on ECG. Fastest way of shifting potassium intracellularly is aEUR',Calcium gluconate IV,Oral resins,Insulin + glucose,Sodium bicarbonate,"Insulin + glucose Tall T waves on ECG indicate cardiac manifestation of hyperkalemia. - Intravenous calcium gluconate is the first drug to be administered in a patient with hyperkalemia having E.C.G. abnormalities. - It stabilizes the myocardium immediately. - It acts within minutes and is characterized by improvement in E.C.G. appearance. But an impoant point to note - It does not affect transcellular movement of potassium. Thus it won't help in reducing the hyperkalemia. Among the agents which cause transcellular (intracellular) movement of potassium. - 'Intravenous insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levels'. The goals of the therapy for the tit of acute hyperkalemia in chronological order are as follows:? i) Antagonize the affect of IC on excitable cell membranes ii) Redistribution of extracellular potassium into cells iii) Enhance elimination of potassium from the body i) Antagonize the effect of potassium on excitable cell membrane Calcium directly antagonizes the myocardial effect of hyperkalemia. It does so by reducing the threshold potential of cardiac myocytes. Calcium. for injection is available as chloride or gluconate salt. The preferred agent is the gluconate salt since it is less likely than calcium chloride to cause tissue necrosis. The onset of action is < 3 minutes. The duration of action is 30-60 minutes during which time fuher measures may be undeaken to lower p1{. ii) Redistribution of potassium into cells :? Insulin Insulin shifts potassium into cells. Potassium shift inside the cells is mediated by Na+ IC ATPase. I.V. insulin is the fastest way to lower serum potassium levelr2. The onset of action is < 15 minutes and the effect is maximal b/w 30-60 minutes. Dextrose is given along with insulin to prevent hypoglycemia. It was believed that administration of dextrose alone, can cause shift of potassium inside the cells by promoting insulin release. * The administration of hypeonic dextrose alone for hyperkalemia is not recommended for two reasons:- Endogenous insulin levels are unlikely to rise to the level necessary for a therapeutic effect. - There is a risk of exacerbating hyperkalemia by inducing hypeonicity. 5' adrenoceptor agonists These drugs can also cause movement of potassium inside the cell. High dose albuterol shows their effect in 30 minutes and persists for at least 2 hours. The effect of insulin is additive with that of albuterol. Patients taking nonselective 18 adrenoceptor blockers will be unlikely to manifest the hypokalemic effects of albuterol. - Even among patients not taking ft blockers as many as 40% seem to be resistant to the hypokalemic effect of albuterol. - The mechanism .for this resistance is unknown and currently, there is no basis for predicting which patients will respond. - For this reason albuterol should never be used as a single agent for the treatment of urgent hyperkalemia. Bicarbonate Bicarbonate (as a bolus injection) was used in the emergency t/t of hyperkalemia. Ironically this dogma was based on studies using a prolonged (4-6 hrs) infusion of bicarbonate. It has now been demonstrated that sho term bicarbonate infusion does not reduce pK in patients with dialysis dependent kidney failure, implying that it does not cause IC+ shift into cells. Sodium bicarbonate seems to have no effect to shift IC into cells even after several hours. It is likely to be effective especially in combination with a diuretic drug in enhancing urinary IC' elimination in patients with some kidney. function, although it use for this purpose has not been evaluated. iii) Elimination of potassium from the body Hyperkalemia occurs most often in patients with renal insufficiency. - However renal potassium excretion may be enhanced even in patients with significant renal impairment by increasing the delivery of solute to the distal nephron. Sodium bicarbonate A sodium bicarbonate infusion administered during 4-6 hrs at a rate designed to alkalinize the urine may enhance urinary K+ excretion and would be desirable especially in patients with metabolic acidosis. The risk of volume expansion with the bicarbonate infusion can be mitigated by use of loop acting diuretics which would, be likely to enhance the kaliuresis. Exchange resin Sodium polysterene sulfonate is a cation exchange resin. In the lumen of intestine it exchanges sodium for secreted potassium. Most of this exchange takes place in the colon, the site of most potassium secretion in the gut. There are two concerns with the use of resin in the t/t of urgent hyperkalemia The first is its slow effect - When given orally, the onset of action is at least 2 hrs and the maximum effect may not be seen for more than 6 hrs. The second is its adverse effect - It can cause intestinal necrosis Dialysis -'Hemodialysis is the method of choice for removing potassium from the body'. - The rate of potassium removed with peritoneal dialysis is much slower than with hemodialysis.",C

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas-,Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Mucinous cystadenoma is macrocystic, not the microcystic adenoma.
MCN: MC cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.
Frequently seen in young women, mean age 5th decade.
More common in the body and tail of the pancreas.

Pathology

MCNs contain mucin-producing epithelium, macrocystic.
Histology: Presence of mucin-rich cells and ovarian-like stroma.
Estrogen and progesterone staining are positive in most cases.

Clinical Features

Incidental MCN is becoming increasingly common.
Up to 50% of patients present with vague abdominal pain.
A history of pancreatitis may be found in up to 20% of patients, which explains the common misdiagnosis of pseudocyst.

Diagnosis

CT scan: Presence of a solitary cyst with fine septations and rim of calcification.
Cross-sectional imaging may not be able to distinguish between benign and malignant MCNs.
Presence of eggshell calcification, larger tumor size, or a mural nodule on cross-sectional imaging is suggestive of malignancy.
Cyst fluid analyses: Mucin-rich aspirate, high CEA and low amylase levels.
These fluid analyses provide accurate diagnosis in up to 80% of cases.

Treatment

Exclusion of malignancy can’t be obtained by biopsy alone, so surgical excision is indicated for all mucinous cystic neoplams, because extensive histological sampling is required for confirmation.

Surgical treatment of anal canal carcinoma is largely replaced by -,Nigro protocol,UW protocol,Mootz protocol,Williams protocol,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Nigro protocol * Nigro protocol includes combined radiation and chemotherapy with 5FU and mitomycin C. It is commonly used in management of anal canal carcinoma.Management of Anal canal carcinoma:* Since its introduction in 1974, radiation and chemotherapy with 5FU and mitomycin C (Nigro Protocol) have largely replaced surgery in the treatment of anal cancer.* Data demonstrates equivalent local control, survival rates with preservation of sphincter function.* Approximately 30% of patients have persistent or recurrent disease after chemoradiation for anal SCC. Salvage abdominoperineal resection is reserved for recurrent or residual pelvic disease after chemoradiation.* The management of inguinal node disease is variable. Due to the high morbidity rate, prophylactic groin dissection is not recommended. Clinically significant inguinal adenopathy can be included in the field of radiation.* The overall response to chemoradiation should be assessed clinically at about 8 weeks after the completion of treatment. At this point, up to 85% of patients will have complete clinical response.* Those with good partial response may be observed closely to ensure that complete response does occur.* Any lesions suspicious for residual disease or progression of disease should be biopsied at that time.* For those patients with complete clinical response, surveillance entails DRE and examination of inguinal nodes every 3-6 months for the first 2 years and annually there after up to 5 years.",A

Etiology. of peptic ulcer


Acute Peptic Ulcer




NSAIDS Ingestion


Stress


Cushing ulcer after cerebral trauma
Curling ulcer* after burn injury, any kind of shock


Sepsis  — Undrained pus may be responsible for an acute ulcer.


Steroids 




Chronic Gastric Ulcer




NSAIDs Ingestion


NSAIDs disrupt the prostaglandin driven support of the mucosal barrier.
Prostaglandins are responsible for the prodn. of mucosal gel layer in the stomach, which provide a protective barrier to the gastric and duodenal lining.
So disruption of this mucosal barrier allows even minimum amount of acid to cause ulceration.


Helicobacter pylori


H.Pylori is seen in almost 90% of cases of duodenal ulcer and 70% of cases of gastric ulcer.


Pyloroduodenal reflux


Regurgitate bile & other duodenal juices.


Mucosal trauma


by mechanical effect of food.


Diet & smoking


Irregular diet, spicy food excessive drinking of tea & coffee, alcohol, Cigarette smoking has a definite relation with both gastric & duodenal ulcers.


Emotional factors


Anxiety, Stress & strain.


Liver disease


Ulceration of both stomach and duodenum have co-existed with the disease of the liver, particularly cirrhosis.
It may be due to increase in blood supply to the gastric mucosa and overproduction of histamine in the stomach wall to stimulate the parietal cell.


Chronic Duodenal Ulcer




Acid hypersecretion


Genetic factors


Persons of blood group 'O' who do not possess AB antigen are peculiarly apt to develop a duodenal ulcer.
iii.Endocrinal disorders

Zollinger Ellison syndrome
Hyperparathyroidism
Multiple adenoma syndromes (MEN-I)
Cushing. syndrome (b/c of the high level of endogenous steroids)



Chronic liver diseases


Chronic lung disease


Chronic pancreatitis


Emotional factor

The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin A is best described by:,Postsynaptic receptor blockade,Acetylcholinesterase inhibition,Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release,Slowing of myelinated nerve fiber transmission,"Presynaptic blockade of acetylcholine release Botulinum toxin is an effective inhibitor of presynaptic acetylcholine exocytosis. Acting at the neuromuscular junction, cellular uptake is believed to occur through an active cell surface receptor-mediated process. This three-step chemical denervation is initiated by the toxin selectively binding to sites on the surface membrane of cholinergic nerve endings. An energy-dependent endocytotic process ensues internalizing the cell membrane with bound protein. The final step is presumed to act on calcium-mediated exocytosis, preventing the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. It is also believed that Botulinum toxin acts as a zinc-dependent metalloendo protease to inhibit exocytosis.",C

They are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. The submucosal layer consists of a highly cellular stroma of spindle cells with elongated nuclei similar to the ovarian stroma, which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions.

Which of the following is the main mechanism by which the mechlorethamine exes its cell killing?,"Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands",Blocking microtubular assembly and mitosis during M-phase,"Inhibiting topoisomerase, preventing repair of DNA strand breaks","Intercalating in DNA strands, there by preventing DNA replication by Mrna","Alkylating DNA, causing cross-links between parallel DNA strands Vincristine and the other vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin and impair microtubular assembly, preventing mitosis (M-phase-specific). Mechlorethamine, like cyclophosphamide (and carmustine and several others), is an alkylating agent. They are called bifunctional alkylating agents because they can covalently bind to DNA in two places ('nucleophilic attack'), thereby forming cross-links between two adjacent strands or between two bases in one strand. This ultimately disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis or may cause strand breakage. Cyclophosphamide (which can be considered the prototype of the alkylating agents) is actually a pro- drug--it requires metabolic activation in order for its effects to occur. Cyclophosphamide (and other alkylating agents) are cell cycle-nonspecific, although their efficacy is greater when cells are not in G0.Bleomycin, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are good examples of drugs that intercalate in DNA strands. Thus, the altered DNA no longer serves as an adequately precise template for eventual synthesis of more functional DNA and RNA. They are classified as antitumor antibiotics. Etoposide and topotecan are examples of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase 11. The consequence is inhibited ability of affected cells to repair DNA strand breaks. This stops the cell cycle in G2 - The taxoid (e.g., paclitaxel) impairs mitosis, but by stabilizing assembled microtubules rather than by exeing a vinca alkaloid-like inhibition of microtubular assembly.",A

What is next step in management:,Nephrectomy,Open Gerota's fascia and explore proximal renal vessels,Perform Retrograde pyelography,Perform on table angiography,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Perform on table angiography 'nonvisualization of the kidney requires immediate aeriography or CT scan to determine whether renal vascular injury exists.'- Smith's Urology 'Absence of kidney perfusion is an indication for renal aery angiography'- Sabiston The major causes of nonvisualization on an IVU are total pedicle avulsion, aerial thrombosis, severe contusion causing vascular spasm, and absence of the kidney. Aeriography would help identify major aerial and parenchymal injuries.Aerial thrombosis and avulsion of the renal pedicle are best diagnosed by aeriography. Also know: Best imaging study to detect and stage renal and retroperitoneal injuries is - computed tomography with contrast media. It can define the size and extent of the retroperitoneal hematoma, renal lacerations, urinary extravasation, and renal aerial and venous injuries; additionally, it can detect other intra-abdominal injuries. Management: Blunt injuries--Minor renal injuries from blunt trauma account for 85% of cases and do not usually require operation. Bleeding stops spontaneously with bed rest and hydration. Cases in which operation is indicated include those associated with persistent retroperitoneal bleeding, urinary extravasation, evidence of nonble renal parenchyma, and renal pedicle injuries (less than 5% of all renal injuries). Aggressive preoperative staging allows complete definition of injury before operation. Penetrating injuries--Penetrating injuries should be surgically explored. A rare exception to this rule is when staging has been complete and only minor parenchymal injury, with no urinary extravasation, is noted. In 80% of cases of penetrating injury, associated organ injury requires operation; thus, renal exploration is only an extension of this procedure. In the above question, the patient had non pulsatile hematoma. A pulsatile or expanding hematoma is an indication for surgical exploration.",D

"In follow up of BPH, most important indication of surgery is:",Prostate size >75gm,Single episode of UTI requiring 3 day antibiotics,Cannot use medication due to hypertension,Bilateral hydronephrosis,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Bilateral hydronephrosis 'Surgery should be recommended for patients who continue to be bothered by their symptoms or who experience urinary retention despite medical therapy. Surgery should also be recommended for patients with upper tract dilation, renal insufficiency secondary to BPH, or bladder stones. '- Schwartz 8/e p1530About other options:Prostate Size: Treatment of BPH is primarily dictated by patient's symptoms and not by the prostate size. However the size of prostate can decide whether to go for endoscopic method of treatment or open surgical procedure. Open surgery is more effective than endoscopic methods for prostates weighing >100gm (ref: Schwartz 9/e p1471; Smith's Urology 17/e p354)UTI: Recurrent episodes of UTI (and not a single episode) are an absolute indication for surgery of prostate. Hypertension: Alpha blockers which are first line medical therapy for BPH lower the blood pressure and thus are helpful in hypertensive persons.Management of BPHManagement is primarily directed by symptoms. Mild symptoms can be managed with watchful waiting. More severe symptomatic patients are treated with medicines (alpha blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors or combination of both). Surgery is recommended if the patient is having problems despite medical therapy. Absolute indications for surgery as listed in Smith's Urology are given below.Absolute indications for surgical treatment of BPHRefractory urine retention (failing at least one attempt at catheter removal)Recurrent UTI from BPHBladder stones d/t BPHRenal insufficiency d/t BPHLarge bladder diverticula 'secondary to BPH 6) Recurrent gross hematuria from BPH Upper tract dilatation is an indication for surgery according to Schwartz.Medical therapyAlpha-blockers (terazosin, doxazosin, and tamsulosin)Alpha-blockers help is reducing the symptoms of BPH by blocking the alpha 1 adrenoreceptor present in human prostate and bladder base.5-Alpha-reductase inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride) - 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. This thus results in reduction in the size of the gland and improvement in symptoms (after several months of use).5 alpha reductase inhibitors are found to be effective only in men with enlarged prostates (>40 gm ) Ref: Smith's Urology 17/e.SurgerySurgery for BPH is most commonly performed endoscopically; however, if the prostate gland is quite large (approx >100 g), an open prostatectomy should be performed.The standard endoscopic procedure for BPH is a transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate.Conventional surgical methods:Transurethral resection of the prostate (most commonly used method)Transurethral incision of the prostateOpen simple prostatectomy (simple suprapubic prostatectomy, simple retropubic prostatectomy) --- When the prostate is too large to be removed endoscopically, an open enucleation is necessary. What constitutes 'too large' is subjective and varies depending upon the surgeon's experience with TURP. Glands >100 g are usually considered for open enucleation. Open prostatectomy may also be initiated when concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone is present or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.- Open prostatectomies can be done with either a suprapubic or retropubic approach. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy is performed transvesically and is the operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology.Minimally invasive methods:Laser therapy (Nd:YAG and holmium:YAG)Transurethral electro vaporization of the prostateMicrowave HyperthermiaTransurethral needle ablation of the prostate--High-intensity focused ultrasound for thermal tissue ablationIntraurethral stents--stents are endoscopically placed in the prostatic fossa and are designed to keep the prostatic urethra patent.

Clinical presentation

average age is 50 to 60 yrs.
nonspecific symptoms are seen → bleeding, pain or anal mass.
usually misdiagnosed as thrombosed hemorrhoids.

Treatment

Melanoma is resistant to chemotherapy & radiotherapy
Surgery offers the only cure but by the time the symptoms appear, the level of invasion precludes surgical cure in most patients. In these patients, the disease has metastasized or is deeply invasive.
A few patients present with isolated local or locoregional disease that is potentially resectable for cure.
The two surgical procedures used are

Wide local excision and APR

Recurrence is common and usually occurs systemically regardless of the initial surgical procedure. Local resection does not increase the risk of local or regional recurrence and APR offers no survival advantage over local excision. Because of the morbidity associated with APR, wide local excision is recommended for initial t/t of localized melanoma.

As the testis descends from its retroperitoneal position to beyond the internal ring, it carries with an anteromedial diveiculum of peritoneum (the processus vaginalis). The process of obliteration of the processus vaginalis begins at 32 weeks gestation and may continue for the first two years of life. A narrowly patent processus vaginalis which allows the passage of peritoneal fluid results in a communicating hydrocele. Congenital hydrocele resolve spontaneously upon completion of the process of obliteration of the processus vaginalis.

Extravasated urine following rupture of bulbar urethra collects in all the following regions except,Penis,Scrotum,Inguinal canal,Beneath the superficial facia in the abdominal wall,"Rupture of the bulbar urethra There is a history of a blow to the perineum, usually due to a fall astride injury. The bulbar urethra is crushed upwards onto the pubic bone, typically with significant bruising. He subsequently developed urinary retention and sepsis secondary to infection of the haematoma and he died some days after the accident. Extravasation of urine is common if the urine is not diveed and the extravasated urine is confined in front of the mid-perineal point by the attachment of Colles' fascia to the triangular ligament and by the attachment of Scarpa's fascia just below the inguinal ligament. The external spermatic fascia stops it getting into the inguinal canals. Extravasated urine collects in the scrotum and penis and beneath the deep layer of superficial fascia in the abdominal wall. CLINICAL FEATURES The signs of a ruptured bulbar urethra are perineal bruising and haematoma, typically with a butterfly distribution. There is usually bleeding from the urethral meatus and retention of urine is also typically present. MANAGEMENT If the diagnosis is suspected, the patient should be treated with appropriate analgesia and antibiotics should be administered. He should be discouraged from passing urine. A full bladder should be drained with a catheter placed by percu taneous suprapubic puncture using a Seldinger technique. This reduces urinary extravasation and allows investigations to establish the extent of the urethral injury. Diagnosis is made by urethrography using water-soluble contrast. If there is significant extravasation, then the perineal collection should be drained. The suprapubic catheter should remain in situ while the bruising and extravasation settle down and a stricture will typically develop at the site of the injury. The optimal treatment is delayed anastomotic urethroplasty after the swelling and bruising have settled down (typically 8-12 weeks later), with excision of the traumatised section and spatulated end-to-end reanastomosis of the urethra.

GRAWITZ'S TUMOR)# This is an adenocarcinoma.# It is the most common neoplasm (75 per cent) of the kidney.# It arises from renal tubular cells.# most commonly the upper pole.# Spread : The tumor is prone to grow into the renal vein.# Highly vascular metastases may pulsate.# If the tumour extends beyond the renal capsule it is liable to metastasise via the lymph nodes in the hilum of the kidney to the para-aortic nodes and beyond.# CF: M:F = 2:1.# Hematuria is the most common symptom.# In men, a rapidly developing varicocele is a rare but impressive sign, occurring most often on the left side because the left gonadal vein is obstructed where it joins the left renal vein.# Atypical C/f: Hyperpyrexia, Extreme anemia, or Polycythemia (occurs in 4%of cases), Hypercalcemia, Nephrotic synd.# Investigation: US is generally initial or screening too of choice, while CECT demonstrate the extent of the lesion more clearly and will show whether there is hilar lymphadenopathy or renal vein involvement. MRV remains the best choice for detecting renal vein invasion.# Treatment- If the tumor is confined to the kidney, treatment is nephrectomy with removal of the perinephric fat.- Nephrectomy can be performed through a loin or a transverse or oblique upper abdominal incision. The transab- dominal approach has the advantage that the renal pedicle and the IVC can be widely exposed.- The vascular pedicle should be ligated before the kidney is mobilised because handling the tumor may cause malignant cells to be released into the circulation.- Adenocarcinoma of the kidney does not respond well to radiotherapy or conventional chemotherapy. There have been early promising results from clinical trials of the cytokine interleukin-2 in this condition.- Conventional surgical treatment is by nephroureterectomy.- Percutaneous resection of these cancers is controversial.Also know:WILMS' TUMOR (Syn. NEPHROBLASTOMA)# This is a mixed tumor containing epithelial and connective tissue elements arising from embryonic nephrogenic tissue.# The tumors are usually discovered during the first 4 years of life.# Abdominal tumor. An abdominal tumor appears which grows rapidly while the general well being of the child deteriorates.# Pyrexia, which is a feature in half of these patients, disappears when the tumor is removed.# Initial Imaging is by ultrasonography,however CECT is best for evaluation.# Metastasis occurs early, mainly to the lungs. Liver and bone metastases are rare; and brain metastases even more so.# Lymphatic spread is uncommon.# The presence of bone secondaries favours a diagnosis of nephroblastoma, another renal tumor of childhood.# Rx: Nephrectomy should be performed as soon as possible and followed by radiotherapy with or without chemo- therapy.- Partial nephrectomy may be possible in patients with bilateral disease.# Prognosis- Under 1 year of age 80 per cent survive for 5 years, but the prognosis is less good in older children.- Recurrences usually occur within a year, so a child surviving for 18 months or more is probably cured.- NATIONAL WILMS' TUMOR STUDY GROUP (NWTS) STAGING SYSTEM (post-chemotheraphy based staging system in Wilms tumor).

Complication of total parenternal nutrition is -,CHF,Hvpochloremia,Metabolic acidosis,Leukopenia,"Ans. is 'c' i.e.. Metabolic acidosis Complications of Parenteral NutritionMechanical complicationsMechanical complications may occur during central line placement. These include pneumothorax, brachial plexus injury, subclavian or carotid artery puncture, hemothorax, and chylothorax etc. Thrombosis or pulmonary embolism may occur secondary to central venous catheter use.Infectious complicationsSepsis occurs secondary to contamination of the central venous catheterMetabolic complicationsMetabolic complications can be divided into Early or nutrient related and Late or related to long term administration. Early complications include, among others, hyperglycemia, refeeding syndrome, and lipid metabolism abnormalities. Complications associated with long-term PN infusion include steatosis, cholestasis, and metabolic bone disease.Hyperglycemia-is the most common metabolic complication associated with PN administration.Hypoglycemia- Abrupt discontinuation of TPN can produce rebound hypoglycemia in patients with limited oral intake.HyperlipidemiaRefeeding syndrome -Refeeding syndrome is defined as severe electrolyte and fluid shifts that may result from refeeding after severe weight loss (protein-calorie malnutrition).In starvation, energy is derived principally from fat metabolism. TPN results in a shift from fat to glucose as the predominant fuel, and rapid anabolism increases the production of phosphorylated intermediates of glycolysis. These intermediates trap phosphate, producing profound hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia is the hallmark of the refeeding syndromeand has been reported in patients being repleted both parenterally and enteral ly.Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia also occur.The lack of phosphate and potassium lead to a relative ATP deficiency, resulting in the insidious onset of respiratory failure and reduced cardiac stroke volume. The refeeding syndrome can be life threatening if not promptly treated.Because of these risks, the rate ofTPN administration in a severly malnourished patient should be slowly increased over several days.Hepatobiliary complications -Hepatic dysfunction is a common manifestation of long-term parenteral nutrition support. It includes elevated serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Steatosis, steatohepatitis, lipidosis, chloestasis, fibrosis and cirrhosis can occur. Although these abnormalities are usually benign and transient, more serious and progressive disease can develop in a small subset of patients, usually after 16 weeks of PN.Biliary complications include acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder sludge, and cholelithiasis.Metabolic Bone disease - Including osteomalacia or osteopenia may be seen with long-term TPN.

All are true regarding Xenon anesthesia except,Slow induction and recovery,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side-effects,Low blood solubility,"Xenon is a 'noble' gas that has long been known to have anesthetic propeies. It is an ine element that does not form chemical bonds. It is an odorless, nonexplosive, naturally occurring gas with a MAC of .71 and a blood/gas coefficient of 0.115, giving it very fast onset and emergence parameters. Xenon's anesthetic effects seem to be mediated by NMDA inhibition by competing with glycine at the glycine binding site. Xenon seems to have little effect on cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal systems and has been found to be protective against neuronal ischemia. Cost and limited availability have prevented its widespread use.

Pain due to post-amputation neuroma is best treated by:,Infrared therapy,Interference therapy,Ultrasound therapy,Surgical Excision,"D i.e. Surgical Excision A painful neuroma can be prevented by gentle traction on the nerve followed by sharp proximal division, allowing the cut nerve end to retract deep into the soft tissue away from the end of amputated limb. A painful neuroma usually is palpable and often has a positive Tinel sign. Initial treatment consists of socket modification. If this fails to relieve symptoms, simple neuroma excision or a more proximal neurectomy may be required and the severed nerve is replaced into healthy tissue. Some authors recommended neuroma excision combined with centrocentral anastomosis of the proximal stump or a procedure to seal the epineural sleeve. Phantom limb pain, although rarely when is significant, can be extremely difficult to treat. More that 50 different methods of treatment are in use. Although no one specific method is universally beneficial, some patient may benefit from such diverse measures as massage, ice, heat, increased prosthetic use, relaxation training, biofeed back, sympathetic blockade, local nerve block, epidural block, ultrasound, trans cutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), placement of dorsal column stimulator, interferential therapy, and acupuncture etc.",D

He is transferred to the ICU for treatment of his pneumonia because of clinical deterioration. Which of the following is a sign of early sepsis?",Respiratory acidosis,Decreased cardiac output,Hypoglycemia,Peripheral vasodilation,"It is impoant to identify and treat occult or early sepsis before it progresses to septic shock and the associated complications of multiple organ failure. An immunocompromised host may not manifest some of the more typical signs and symptoms of infection, such as elevated temperature and white cell count; this forces the clinician to focus on more subtle signs and symptoms. Early sepsis is a physiologically hyperdynamic, hypermetabolic state representing a surge of catecholamines, coisol, and other stress-related hormones. Changing mental status, tachypnea that leads to respiratory alkalosis, and flushed skin are often the earliest manifestations of sepsis. Intermittent hypotension requiring increased fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate urine output is characteristic of occult sepsis. Hyperglycemia and insulin resistance during sepsis are typical in diabetic as well as nondiabetic patients. This relates to the gluconeogenic state of the stress response. The cardiovascular response to early sepsis is characterized by an increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased peripheral utilization of oxygen, which yields a decreased aeriovenous oxygen difference.",D

"In a patient with gouty ahritis, strongly birefringent needle-shaped crystals with negative elongation in synl fuid aspiration are composed of:September 2007",Monosodium urate,Calcium pyrophosphate,Homogentisic acid,Sodium pyrophosphate,"Ans. A: Monosodium UrateGout is a metabolic disease most often affecting middle-aged to elderly men and postmenopausal women. It is the result of an increased body pool of urate with hyperuricemia.It is typically characterized by episodic acute and chronic ahritis, due to deposition of Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints and connective tissue tophi, and the risk for deposition in kidney interstitium or uric acid nephrolithiasis.If the clinical appearance strongly suggests gout, the diagnosis should be confirmed by needle aspiration of acutely or chronically involved joints or tophaceous deposits.Acute septic ahritis, several of the other crystalline-associated ahropathies, palindromic rheumatism, and psoriatic ahritis may present with similar clinical features.During acute gouty attacks, strongly birefringent needle-shaped MSU crystals with negative elongation are typically seen both intracellularly and extracellularly.Synol fluid cell counts are elevated from 2000 to 60,000/",A

Older age groups are most often affected, and coexisting gallstones are present in the vast majority of cases. The symptoms at presentation are vague and are most often related to adjacent organ invasion. Imaging studies may reveal a mass replacing the normal gallbladder, diffuse or focal thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a polypoid mass within the gallbladder lumen. Adjacent organ invasion, most commonly involving the liver, is typically present at diagnosis, as is biliary obstruction. Peripoal and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, hematogenous metastases, and peritoneal metastases may also be seen. The vast majority of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas.

Commonest operation done for gastric outlet obstruction with peptic ulcer is: March 2007,Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy,Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomy,Highly selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty,Gastrojejunostomy,"Ans. A: Truncal vagotomy with gastrojejunostomyGastric outlet obstruction is manifested by obstruction at the level of the pylorus, which is the outlet of the stomach. Patients may develop vomiting, which may be projectile but non-bilious in nature, nausea or abdominal pain. An unusual finding that may lead to the diagnosis is the succussion splash, a splash-like sound heard over the stomach in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen on shaking the patient, with or without the stethoscope.The diagnosis is typically made by X-ray, which will show an absent air bubble in the stomach, or by CT scan.Causes of gastric outlet obstruction include peptic ulcer disease; tumours of the stomach, including adenocarcinoma (and its linitis plastica variant), lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours; infections, such as tuberculosis; and infiltrative diseases, such as amyloidosis.Metabolic alkalosis may develop as a result of loss of acid.Traditionally severe cases of Gastric outlet obstruction are treated usually by a gastroenterostomy rather than a pyloroplasty. Truncal vagotomy leads to reduction of the maximal acid output by 50% as vagus nerves are sectioned which critically controls the secretion of gastric acid.",A

"In the clotting process, as the hemostatic plug develops, fibrin polymerizes into monomeric threads which are held together by noncovalent bonds. Which clotting protein increases the strength of the clot by crosslinking the newly formed fibrin threads?",Factor XIII,High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK),Plasminogen,von Willebrand Factor (vWF),"Fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin twice as it is activated to form fibrin. The initial cleavage causes it to polymerize and the second causes it to branch. Thrombin also activates Factor XIII to XIIIa, which crosslinks the fibrin strands and strengthens the clot. HMWK is a cofactor in the intrinsic pathway that conves Factor XI to XIa. Plasminogen is a central proenzyme in clot lysis. When plasminogen is conveed to plasmin, it digests fibrin threads, as well as a number of protein factors including Factors V, VIII, XII, and prothrombin. Thrombin is an enzyme derived from prothrombin. It conves fibrinogen to fibrin, and activates factor XIII. vWF is a tissue-bound protein which is exposed with vascular trauma and helps in the process of platelet adhesion.",A

The development of a clinically significant metabolic alkalosis is secondary not only to the loss of acid or addition of alkali but also to renal responses that maintain the alkalosis (paradoxical aciduria). The normal kidney can tremendously augment its excretion of acid or alkali in response to changes in ingested load. However, in the presence of significant volume depletion and consequent excessive salt and water retention, the tubular maximum for bicarbonate reabsorption is increased. Correction of volume depletion alone is usually sufficient to correct the alkalosis, since the kidney will then excrete the excess bicarbonate. HCl infusion is usually unnecessary. Acetazolamide can be utilized to increase renal excretion of bicarbonate but should be avoided in volume-depleted individuals.

Hyperkalemia with no ECG finding. The drug that should not be used isaEUR',Sodium bicarbonate,Calcium gluconate,Glucose with insulin,Resins,"Calcium gluconate (Also see AIIMS May 2010) . Calcium gluconate is the fastest acting agent used in t/t of hyperkalemia. . In acts within nzinutes but an impoant point to note is that it does not cause transcellular movement of potassium, instead it acts on cell membrane. - It stabilizes the cardiac cell membrane and reduces chances of cardiac arryhthmia. - Thus it has no use when there are no E.C.G. features. NaHCO3 NaHCO3 has been routinely used in the treatment of hyperkalemia. It was believed that NaHCO3 caused movement of potassium inside the cells by causing alkalosis. But studies do not suppo this - They claim that NaHCO3 do not cause movement of potassium inside the cells in acute cases of hyperkalemia. - It only decreases potassium when there is coexisting acidosis. - NaHCO3 can decrease potassium level in chronic hyperkalemia. It increases potassium delivery to the kidney. But the use of NaHCO3 still continues in most hospitals and institutes across the world. - It is now hypothesized that NaHCO3 does not cause IC* entry inside the cell by mechanism earlier believed to be, but by another mechanism. The question does not say anything about acidosis. Don't think that acidosis occurs only in severe hyperkalemia. Most patients with C.R. F. present with acidosis and mild moderate hyperkalemia. In hyperkalemia with no E.C.G. feature, calcium prophylaxis is not indicated - Calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize the cardiac membrane - Instability of the cardiac membrane is indicated by E.C.G. changes - Absence of E.C.G. changes suggest that the cardiac membrane is stable.

"Smoking may be associated with all of the following cancers, except:",Ca Larynx,Ca Nasopharynx,Ca Bladder,None.,"Ans is None > Ca Nasopharynx All the given options are mentioned by Harrison: Harrison 17/e p2737 writes- 'Tobacco smoking causes cancer of the lung, oral cavity, naso-, oro-, and hypopharynx, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, larynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, kidney (body and pelvis), ureter, urinary bladder, and uterine cervix and also causes myeloid leukemia. There is evidence suggesting that cigarette smoking may play a role in increasing the risk of colorectal and possibly premenopausal breast cancer, but there is no association with postmenopausal breast cancer. There does not appear to be a causal link between cigarette smoking and cancer of the endometrium, and there is a lower risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women who smoke.' Thus the answer should be none, however Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is found to be least associated with smoking. Head & Neck Cancers by Enslow Jacobs 2003e p492 writes-'Association between smoking and nasopharyngeal carcinoma has been shown only by a few studies. If the association of tobacco and NPC is real, the possible mechanism of tumor induction would be the nitrosamines and its precursors in tobacco.'",D
Investigation of choice for esophageal rupture is?,Dynamic MRI,Rigid esophagoscopy,Barium contrast swallow,Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallow,"ANSWER: (D) Water soluble low molecular weight contrast swallowREF: with textUse of non ionic water soluble contrast medium instead of barium is warranted when there is any risk of aspiration or esophageal leak. (Ref: Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites By Giles W. Boland 4th ed page 2)Careful endoscopic assessment at the end of any procedure combined with a chest X-ray will identify many cases of perforation immediately. If not recognised immediately, then early and late suspected perforations should be assessed by a water-soluble contrast swallow. If this is negative, a dilute barium swallow should be considered. A CT scan can be used to replace a contrast swallow or as an adjunct to accurately delineate specific fluid collections. (Bailey 25th ed page 1015)Diagnosis of an esophageal perforation may be made radiographically. A chest roentgenogram may demonstrate a hydropneumothorax. A contrast esophagram is done using barium for a suspected thoracic perforation and Gastrografin for an abdominal perforation. Barium is inert in the chest but causes peritonitis in the abdomen, whereas aspirated Gastrografin can cause life-threatening pneumonitis. A surgical endoscopy needs to be performed if the esophagram is negative or if operative intervention is planned. (Ref: Sabiston 18th ed chapter 41)",D

Correct treatment for the affected patient includes discontinuation of exogenous sources of potassium, administration of a source of calcium ions (which will immediately oppose the myocardial effects of potassium), and administration of sodium bicarbonate (which, by producing a mild alkalosis, will shift potassium into cells); each will temporarily reduce serum potassium concentration. Infusion of glucose and insulin would also effect a temporary transcellular shift of potassium. However, these maneuvers are only temporarily effective; definitive treatment calls for removal of potassium from the body. The sodium-potassium exchange resin sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) would accomplish this removal, but over a period of hours and at the price of adding a sodium ion for each potassium ion that is removed. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is probably required for this patient, since these procedures also rectify the other consequences of acute renal failure, but they would not be the first line of therapy, given the acute need to reduce the potassium level. Both lidocaine and digoxin would be not only ineffective but contraindicated, since they would fuher depress the myocardial conduction system.",A

"A male executive, 50 year of age is seen in casualty with hypotension and hematemesis. There is previous history suggestive of alcohol intake of 100 ml. daily. The blood loss is around 2 litres. Most probable diagnosis is ?",Gastritis,Duodenal ulcer,Mallory-Weiss tear,Esophageal varices,"Ans. is 'b' ie. Duodenal Ulcer Hematemesis is suggestive of massive upper GI bleed, the impoant causes of which in descending order are Peptic ulcer Duodenal ulcer (MC cause) Gastric ulcer Esophageal varices Gastritis Mallory weiss tear Neoplams of esophagus, stomach and duodenum Duodenal ulcer : Peptic ulcer is the most common cause of upper GI bleeding, present in one-half to two-third of pts. with upper GI bleed. Bleeding may be the initial presenting symptoms in up to 10 percent of pts with peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcer bleeding is four times more common than gastric ulcer bleeding. Esophageal varices : Bleeding esophageal varices or gastric varices in the presence of liver disease account for about 10-20% of massive upper GI bleeding. In this pt. esophageal varices appears to be the cause as the pt. is a chronic alcoholic But here the amount he drinks daily should be taken into consideration. In men 40 - 80 g/day of ethanol --> produces fatty liver 80 - 160 g/day of ethanol for 10 - 20 yrs --> causes hepatitis or cirrhosis (Women exhibit increased susceptibility* to alcoholic liver disease at quantities > 20 g/day) He drinks 100 ml daily. Different types of drinks contain varied amounts of alcohol. What this pt. drinks is not known but even strong drinks such as 86-proof beverage contains 80 gm of ethanol in 250 ml of drinks (Wine contain 80 gm of ethanol in 1000 ml of drinks) Thus this patient is unlikely to have an alcoholic liver disease and so esophageal varices can be ruled out. Moreever even in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, varices are cause of massive GI bleed in only 1/2 the cases. Peptic ulcer or gastritis form rest of the half. Mallory-Weiss tear It accounts for a small percentage (5 to 10%) It presents in a classic pattern - initially vomitting is without blood, but after retching and vomitting with epigastric pain, bleeding and haematemesis begin. Gastritis Acute gastritis can presents as massive bleeding (though rarely) It is most commonly associated with intake of NSAIDS, alcohol, coicosteroids and oral potassium supplements. I do not have any valid reason to rule out gastritis. But duodenal ulcer is much more common cause.",B

Bishop-Koop operation done for,Meconium ileus,Hirhsprung's disease,Duodenal atresia,Meckel's diveiculum,".Meconium ileus is neonatal manifestation of fibrocystic disease of the pancreas wherein thick meconium, which is viscid and paste like, gets collected in the terminal ileum. Because of inspissation it forms a firm bolus leading to obstruction of the ileum. Neonates present with features of ileal obstruction as well as respiratory dysfunction, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and high salt in the sweat (Na+ and Cl- more than 90 mmol/L).When patient's condition is critical with obstruction, Bishop-Koop operation is done. Proximal dilated segment is resected and resected end is anastomosed to side of the distal collapsed ileum. End of the distal ileum is brought out as ileostomy. Through the ileostomy gastrografin or acetyl cystine wash is given regularly to dissolve meco- nium pellets. This ileostomy can be kept for long time. Continuity is maintained at later period.Reference : page 927-28 SRB's manual of surgery 5th edition",A

The incidence is 1--2% in full-term infants and up to 30% in premature babies. Operation is indicated after 1 year. Prior to age one, the testis may continue to descend into the scrotum. The cause is unknown. Undescended testes fail in spermatogenic function, but may continue to secrete androgens. Spermatogenic failure is progressive; therefore, surgical exploration and scrotal placement of the testis should be performed before 2-years of age. If placement of the testicle into the scrotum is not possible, then orchiectomy is indicated because of the high risk of testicular cancer when the testis is left in an intraabdominal position.The incidence of testicular cancer in an abdominal testis is 30 times higher than the normal population. After 2- years of age orchiectomy is the treatment of choice because of the cancer risk and poor spermatogenesis.",C

Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated in all of the following surgeries except ?,Cochlear implant,Microlaryngeal surgery,Vitreoretinal surgery,Exentration operation,"Exentration operation One major problem with N20 is that it will exchange with N2 in any air containing cavity in the body. Moreover, because of their differential blood : gas paition coefficients, nitrous oxide will enter the cavity faster than nitrogen escapes, thereby increasing the volume and/or pressure in the cavity. Examples of air collections that can be expanded by nitrous oxide are : - Pneumothorax - Air embolus - Obstructed middle ear - Obstructed loop of bowel - lntracranial air - A pulmonary (bleep) Nitrous oxide should be avoided in these clinical settings: Now lets move on to the options Nitrous oxide in vitreoretinal surgery The use of nitrous oxide anaesthesia in patients with an intraocular gas bubble is potentially sight threatening. Patients who have vitreoretinal surgery often have a gas bubble deliberately left within the eyes as it helps keep the retina attached while adhesions develop. Filtered room air, Sulfur hexqfluoride and perfluoropropane are the most commonly used gases. By varying the concentration volume and type of gas used, bubbles can be produced that will last upto 70 days before being completely absorbed. If nitrous oxide is administered during this time the bubble will rapidly expand with the risk of retinal and optic nerve ischemia. Nitrous oxide and middle ear surgeries Middle ear cavity is connected to eustachian tube. When nitrous oxide is inhaled in large quantities N20 replaces the N2 in the middle air cavity thereby increasing the pressure in the cavity. After discontinuation of N20 the gas is rapidly reabsorbed from the cavity thus creating negative pressure in the cavity this may cause: ? - Serous otitis media - Disaiculation of stapes - Impaired hearing N20 anaesthesia is hazadrous to hearing iu patients who have previously undergone reconstructive middle ear surgery. Microlaryngeal surgery CO2and (Nd : YAG) lasers are frequently used for microsurgery on the upper airway and trachea. Lasers can ignite materials used in anaesthesia. The CO2 laser can penetrate an endotracheal tube and ignite a fire. Nitrous oxide suppos combustion just like 02 and and may ignite fire.",D

Emergence delirium is associated with,Pentothal sodium,Ketamine,Droperidol,Halothane,"Ketamine causes postoperative delirium and hallucinations. It is also contraindicated in delirium tremens and head injury. Ketamine increases cerebral metabolism, CBF, and ICP. So contraindicated in neurosurgeries. Ketamine, like other phencyclidines, produces undesirable psychological reactions, which occur during awakening from ketamine anesthesia and are termed emergence reactions. The common manifestations of these reactions, which vary in severity and classification, are vivid dreaming, extracorporeal experiences (sense of floating out of body), and illusions (misinterpretation of a real, external sensory experience). These incidents of dreaming and illusion are often associated with excitement, confusion, euphoria, and fear. They occur in the first hour of emergence and usually abate within 1 to several hours. These psychic emergence reactions are secondary to ketamine-induced depression of auditory and visual relay nuclei, thus leading to misperception or misinterpretation of auditory and visual stimuli. The incidence of the psychic emergence reactions ranges from 3% to 100%. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B
Effect of inhalational agent on neuromuscular system which is true -,They relax skeletal muscle and decreases the effect of neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBD),They contract skeletal muscle and potentiate the effect of NMBD,They directly relax skeletal muscle and they potentiate the action of NMBD,No effect on neuromuscular system,"Halogenated volatile anesthetics have a potentiating effect on nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. The mechanism appears to be incompletely understood, but is likely a combination of: effect on central motor neurons augmentation of the NMB's affinity for the receptor site inhibition of post-synaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors Clinically, the presence of inhaled anesthetics will decrease the ED50, as well as both prolong the duration of action and recovery from neuromuscular blockade. The degree of potentiation depends on the specific agent and concentration used. For example, desflurane > sevoflurane > isoflurane. With deeper planes of anesthesia, the degree of potentiation is enhanced due to a dose-dependent inhibition of current through the nicotinic receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Studies attempting to quantify the magnitude of these effects have led to conflicting results due to the time factor, or duration of anesthesia. The older halogenated agents (halothane, enflurane, isoflurane) may take up to 2 hours to equilibrate with muscle, so in practice the potentiating effects of these vapors might not be immediately apparent. In contrast, newer agents such as sevoflurane and desflurane equilibrate more rapidly with muscle, and the effects may be seen after as little as 30 minutes. Nitrous oxide has largely been considered as having no effect on neuromuscular blockade.",C

Not only is physeal growth inhibited, but also the Hueter-Volkmann effect upon the entire epiphysis prevents its normal expansion. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle, continuous or excessive compressive forces upon the epiphysis have an inhibitory effect upon growth. Consequently, growth in the lateral condyle of the femur is suppressed globally, resulting in a shallow femoral sulcus and a propensity for the patella to tilt and subluxate laterally.",B

Corkscrew oesophagus is seen in :,Achalasia cardia,Diffuse esophageal spasm,Carcinoma esophagus,Reflux oesophagitis,"DES is characterized by substernal chest pain and/or dysphagia. DES differs from classic achalasia in that it is primarily a disease of the esophageal body, produces a lesser degree of dysphagia, causes more chest pain, and has less effect on the patient's general condition. Nonetheless, it is impossible to differentiate achalasia from DES on the basis of symptoms alone. Esophagogram and esophageal manometry are required to distinguish these two entities. In patients with advanced disease, the radiographic appearance of teiary contractions appears helical, and has been termed corkscrew esophagus or pseudodiveiculosis. Ref :Jobe B.A., Peters J.H.

"All of the following are impoant causes of hyponatremia, EXCEPT:",Gastric fistula,Excessive vomiting,Excessive sweating,Hypothyroidism,"Excess sweating is associated with the development of hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is defined as a sodium concentration > 145 mEq/L. All patients with hypernatremia have hyperosmolality. The hypernatremic patient is typically hypovolemic due to free water losses. Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium concentration < 135 mEq/L. Cause of hyponatremia depends on patient's volume status and serum osmolality. It is classified into hypervolumeic, euvolemic and hypovolemic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia reflects excess water retention relative to sodium rather than sodium deficiency. Causes of hyponatremia are indicated in the table given below. Ref: Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 2012, Chapter 21",C

Feature of 3deg burn:,Pain present,Transudation of fluid present,Whole dermis destroyed,Eryhtematous in appearance,"Ans: C (Whole...) FULL-THICKNESS BURNS(3rd BURN) L & B 25th/381The whole of the dermis is destroyed in these burns.Clinically, they have a hard, leathery feel. The appearance can vary from that similar to the patient's normal skin to charred black, depending upon the intensity of the heat.There is no capillary' return. Often, thrombosed vessels can be seen under the skin.These burns are completely anaesthetised: a needle can be stuck deep into the dermis without any pain or bleeding.BURN CSDT 11th/267-72# Traditionally, burns have been classified as first-, second-, and third-degree, but the current emphasis on burn healing has led to classification as partial-thickness burns, which can heal spontaneously, and fall-thickness burns, which require skin grafting, although deep partial-thickness burns are usually excised and grafted as well.A first-degree burn involves only the epidermis and is characterized by e rythem a a nd m inor mi crosco pi c changes; tissue damage is minimal, protective functions of the skin are intact, skin edema is minimal, and systemic effects are rare. Pain, the chief symptom, usually resolves in 48-72 hours, and healing takes place uneventfully.Second-degree or partial-thick ness burns are deeper, involving all of the epidermis and some of the corium or dermis. The systemic severity of the burn and the quality of subsequent healing are directly related to the amount of undamaged dermis. Superficial burns are often characterized by blister formation, while deeper partial- thickness burns have a reddish appearance or a layer of whitish nonviable dermis firmly adherent to the remaining viable tissue. Blisters, when present, continue to increase in s ize in the postburn period as the osmoticaliy active particles in the blister fluid attract water.Deep dermal burns heal over a period of 25-35 days with a fragile epithelial covering that arises from the residual uninjured epithelium of the deep dermal swreat glands and hair follicles. Severe hypertrophic scarring occurs when such an injury heals; the resulting epithelial covering is prone to blistering and breakdown, evaporative losses after healing remain high compared with losses in normal skin.full thickness (third degree] burns have a characteristic white, waxy appearance and may appear to the untrained eye as unburned skin. Bums caused by prolonged exposure, whth involvement of fat and underlying tissue, may be browm, dark red, or black. The diagnostic findings of fullthickness burns are lack of sensation in the burned skin, lack of capillary refill, and a leathery texture that is unlike normal skin. All epithelial elements are destroyed, leaving no potential for reepithelialization.Fig: Layers of the skin showing depth of first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree burns.",C

Approximately 5 to 25 % of children have pathological lead points (percentages vary from book to book). 'The most common pathologic lead point is a Meckel's diveiculum followed by polyps and duplications. Other benign lead points are the appendix, hemangiomas, carcinoid tumors, foreign bodies, ectopic pancreas or gastric mucosa, hamaomas from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and lipomas.

Still this is our best option. We have confirmed this from a Prof. of Surgery.",B
Gene therapy is given in aEUR',Cystic fibrosis,Thalassemia,Sickle cell anemia,Severe combined,"Severe combined immunodeficiency [Ref KDT 6m/e p. 843, 8441 Gene therapy Gene therapy refers to introduction of functional genetic material usually D.N.A. into target cells to replace or supplement defective genetic material. In contrast to all other therapies or drugs, gene therapy impas, new functions to a cell. Gene defects result in.fallure to synthesize a functional protein or in the synthesis of a dysfunctional protein. Equipping the cell with a normal copy of the defective gene would overcome the deficieny at the site where it is needed on a long term. Approaches in gene therapy :? Gene therapy tries to either modify or transfer the genes. Gene modification This involves correction of the defective poion of a genomic sequence or removal of the whole defective gene and its replacement by a normal copy. Gene transfer This involves introduction of genes without removing or altering the existing ones. Gene transfer is carried out in the following ways? i) Injection of naked D.N.A. ii) Transfer of generic material using virus as a carrier with D.N.A. incorporated into its genome. iii) Transfer of D.N.A. encapsulated within a liposome Applications of Gene therapy (where genetherapy is being considered) :?

Post transplant lymphoma is ?,T cell,B cell,Null cell,NK cell,"B cell Nearly 1 to 20% of people who receive a solid organ transplant develop a lymphoma. - Lymphomas have also been repoed (though less .frequently) after bone-marrow transplants .for other disorders. Why does it happen? - Post-transplant lymphomas are almost always related to infection by the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). - Infection by the Epstein Barr Virus causes a transformation of B-cells which becomes cancerous. In normal individuals other cells of the immune system can tackle the EBV infection, but for organ transplants high doses of drugs that suppress the immune system must be administered. With nothing to control the infection, the chances of developing lymphomas increase. The two main factors that determine the chances of getting lymphoma are: How much immunosuppressive treatment is required - The more the immunosuppression, the more the chances of EBV infection. The status of EBV serology of the recipient of the transplant - If this individual has previously been infected by EBV the chances are that the body remembers the infection and the blood already has called antibodies that can identify and kill the virus. Clinical features Post-transplant lymphomas are usually different .from the usual Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While most patients have involvement mainly of lymph nodes, other organs are very commonly affected as well. These include the brain, lungs and the intestines. The transplanted organ can also get involved. Treatment Whenever possible, immunosuppressive treatment has to be reduced or stopped. In those who have small and localized disease, surgery or radiation may be attempted. If not, the first line of treatment is usually Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets lymphoma cells. Only when this. fails is chemotherapy attempted. Chemotherapy is deferred until necessary as in paially immunosuppressed individuals, chemotherapy may fuher increase the risk of infections. In those who develop lymphomas after bone marrow transplants, donor leukocyte transfusions can be highly effective. Prognosis of Post transplant lymphomas In general, non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring after organ transplants have a poorer outcome than other NHLs. Around 60-80% of the victims ultimately succumb to their lymphoma. Involvement of brain has poor prognosis",B

Long occlusions may be treated by the technique of subintimal angioplasty where the guide wire crosses the lesion in the subintimal space (in the arterial wall) and a new lumen is created by inflation of the balloon. Complications occur in about 5 per cent of cases and include failure, haematoma, bleeding, thrombosis and distal embolisation.Autogenous saphenous vein gives the best results and can be used reversed or in situ after valve disruption.If the long saphenous vein is not available from either leg, short saphenous or arm veins may be used.If no vein is available, a prosthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft may be employed, although patency rates are less; many surgeons construct the lower anastomosis using a small collar of vein (Miller cuff) between the PTFE and the recipient artery, which may improve patency.If no suitable vein is available, prosthetic material (usually PTFE) may be used, with or without a small vein collar (Miller cuff) at its distal end.A femoro-femoral crossover graft involves tunneling a prosthetic graft subcutaneously above the pubis between the groins.An axillo-femoral graft is tunneled subcutaneously between the axillary artery proximally, to reach one or both of the femoral arteries; the patency rates of an axillo-bifemoral bypass is better than an axillo (uni) femoral bypass.Results of operation:Long-term results of aortoiliac reconstructive surgery are good, usually marred only by progressive infrainguinal disease.Femoropopliteal surgery is less successful.Immediate postoperative success for vein bypass exceeds 90%, but the five-year patency is around 60%.PTFE-covered stents are engineered with a 30-100 micron pore size to allow for endothelial lining of the stent-graft and vessel healing. Only self-expanding covered nitinol stents should be used in femoropopliteal interventions.",B

Tests for anterior shoulder instability: Anterior shoulder drawer test: with the patient supine, the scapula is stabilized with one hand while the upper arm is held firmly with the other so as to manipulate the head of the humerus forward and backward (like a driver). Apprehension test: this is a provocative test in which the examiner cautiously lifts the arm into abduction, external rotation and then extension, at the crucial moment the patient senses that the humeral head is about to slip out anteriorly and his body toutens in apprehension. Relocation test: this test involves placing the shoulder in the position of apprehension and applying a posteriorly directed force on the humeral head. The result is considered positive if this relieves the patient's apprehension. Fulcrum test: with the patient supine. The clinician takes the shoulder into 90 degree abduction and adds lateral rotation and extension. The test indicate anterior instability if the patient becomes apprehensive.

"Regarding neonatal circumcision, which one of the following is true –","It should be done without anaesthesia, as it is hazardous to give anaesthesia","It should be done without anesthesia, as neonates do not perceive pain as adults",It should be done under local anaesthesia only,General anaesthesia should be given to neonate for circumcision as they also feel pain as adults,"Neonates have immature brain, however they feel pain and analgesia is required.
Circumcision is a painful procedure, therefore the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using some type of local anesthesia for newborn circumcision. Several types of anaesthesia are available, including numbing cream or injecting a small amounts of anaesthetic around the penis. These are generally considered safe.
Some text books (like S. Das operative surgery and Lee's have) different opinion. According to them neonatal circumcision should be done in general anaesthesia. But following statement will clear all doubts :-

'Local anaesthesia is all that is required for circumcision in neonate. General anaesthetics present unnecessary risks, including neurotoxicity that may affect the development of neuronal structures in brain. This adds to general advice that circumcision is best done using a local anesthetic'.",C

A patient undergoing surgery suddenly develops hypotension. The monitor shows that the end tidal CO2 has decreased abruptly by 155mm Hg. What is the probable diagnosis?,Hypothermia,Pulmonary embolism,Massive fluid deficit,Myocardial depression due to anaesthetic agent,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. pulmonary embolism Ref: Miller's anesthesia 5th/e p1276First what is end tidal CO2The air exhaled during normal respiration initially consists of the dead space. Then a mixture of dead space air plus alveolar air comes out. The air coming out at the end consists purely of alveolar air.Measurement of concentration of gases in this alveolar air is useful for analysis. The CO2 concentration in the last 10ml. of tidal volume is known as end tidal CO2In pulmonary embolism the blood supply to certain parts of the lung is cut off due to the emboli in circulation. This reduces the exchange of gases between the alveoli and pulmonary capillaries, as a result the cone, of CO2 in alveolar air decreases (CO2 is carried from tissues to the lung by blood and is transferred to the alveoli in exchange of O2). The decrease in alveolar CO2 will lead to decrease in end tidal CO2.Other conditions in which end tidal CO2 decreasesIncrease in dead space (decrease in end tidal CO2 in pulmonary embolism can be explained by this also. Pulmonary embolism causes increase in physiological dead space hence decreases the end tidal CO2)HyperventilationMalignant hyperthermia.",B

The main current roles of ultrasound include the assessment of intraperitoneal fluid and haemopericardium (focused assessment with sonography for trauma, FAST), the evaluation of pneumothoraces in supine patients and in guiding intervention'FAST ultrasound is a limited examination directed to look for intraperitoneal fluid or pericardial injury as a marker of underlying injury. This avoids the invasiveness of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. In the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid and an unstable patient, the ultrasound allows the trauma surgeon to explore the abdomen as a cause of blood loss. In the presence of fluid and a haemodynamically stable individual, further assessment by way of CT can be performed. Occasionally, a second ultrasound scan may show free fluid in the presence of an initially negative FAST scan.",D

These tubes are commonly used for head and neck surgery.RAE endotracheal tubes, named after the inventors of the tube (Ring, Adair, and Elwyn), have a preformed shape to fit the mouth or nose. The 'armoured' endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced, silicone rubber tubes which are quite flexible but yet difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Armoured endotracheal tubes are frequently used during anaesthesia when bending or compression of the tube is likely to occur as in neurosurgery or head and neck and oral surgery.

The fetal hea rate has a baseline in the 150s and is reactive. The patient desires an epidural for pain relief. Which of the following should be given orally sholy before the epidural is placed?,Antacid,Antibiotic,Aspirin,Clear liquid meal,"Aspiration pneumonitis is a major cause of anesthesia-related death in obstetrics. Most often, these aspiration events occur with the use of general anesthesia. Pregnant patients are at greater risk for aspiration because of the delayed gastric emptying that occurs during pregnancy and labor. Pregnancy is associated with increased levels of progesterone and displacement of the pylorus by the pregnant uterus. Labor is associated with pain and stress. All of these factors lead to delayed gastric emptying. Aspiration pneumonitis is caused by acidic gastric juices entering the lungs and inducing a sometimes-lethal chemical pneumonitis. When epidural anesthesia is administered, there is a risk of complications, including the development of total spinal anesthesia. The treatment for this complication is positive-pressure ventilation with 100% oxygen administered through an endotracheal tube. Therefore, when an epidural is going to be placed, the patient should be given an antacid to increase the stomach pH. This will help to prevent aspiration pneumonitis should an aspiration event take place during the administration of general anesthesia. It is not necessary to give an antibiotic prior to the administration of an epidural. Antibiotics are used during labor for the prevention of group B Streptococcus sepsis, for patients with chorioamnionitis, for patients in need of valve or endocarditis prophylaxis, or during cesarean delivery for the prevention of infection. Aspirin is not given prior to the placement of an epidural. A clear liquid meal should not be given to patients prior to the placement of an epidural. Intake of food or liquids during labor places the patient at greater risk of aspiration pneumonitis. Patients in labor should be allowed small sips of water or ice chips.",A

"Increased lipolysis of fat stores, which can result from starvation, diabetesmellitus, or coicosteroid use, is most likely to cause steatosis (fattyliver) through which one of the listed mechanisms?",Decreased free fatty acid excretion from the liver leads to free fatty acid accumulation in hepatocytes,"Excess NADH (high NADH/NAD ratio) causes excess production of lactate from pyruvate, which accumulates in hepatocytes",Increased free fatty acid delivery to the liver leads to triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes,Inhibition of apoprotein synthesis by the liver leads to phospholipid accumulation in hepatocytes,"Free fatty acids are normally taken up by the liver and esterified to triglyceride, conveed to cholesterol, oxidized into ketone bodies, or incorporated into phospholipids that can be excreted from the liver as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Abnormalities involving any of these normal metabolic pathways may lead to the accumulation of triglycerides within the hepatocytes. This accumulation of triglycerides is called fatty change or steatosis. Examples of abnormalities that produce hepatic steatosis include diseases that cause excess delivery of free fatty acids to the liver or diseases that cause impaired lipoprotein synthesis. Excess delivery of free fatty acids occurs in conditions that increase lipolysis of adipose tissue, such as starvation, diabetes mellitus, and coicosteroid use. Increased formation of triglycerides can result from alcohol use, as alcohol causes excess NADH formation (high NADH/NAD ratio), increases fatty acid synthesis, and decreases fatty acid oxidation. Impaired apoprotein synthesis occurs with carbon tetrachloride poisoning, phosphorous poisoning, and protein malnutrition.

"Neurocardiagenic syncope, the least useful investigation is :",Tilt table,Carotid sinus massage,Carotid duplex scan,Ohostatic blood pressure recording,"Carotid duplex scan Neurocardiogenic syncope is also called vasovagal syncope or vasodepressor syncope. It is considered to be an abnormality in the complex neurocardiovascular interactions responsible for maintaining systemic and cerebral perfusion. Under normal circumstances, upright posture causes venoul polling and a transient decrease in aerial pressure, resulting in unloading of baroreceptors. Reflex augumentation of sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawl results in peripheral aerial vasoconstriction, venoconstriction and an increase in hea rate and contractility. These adaptive mechanisms serve to maintain normal systemic and cerebral perfusion. Individuals susceptible to neurocardiogenic syncope are unable to maintain the adaptive neurocardiovascular response to upright posture for prolonged periods. In these patients due to incompletely understood mechanisms the cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptors are stimulated resulting in increased neural stimulus to vasomotor centre. This results in reflex paradoxical vasodilation and bradycardia. The final result is hypotension, cerebral hypopeifusion, cerebral hypoxia and syncope. Diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope : Tilt table study It is used to evaluate patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. In a tilt table study the patient is strapped to a table which is then mechanically tilted to an upright position. While monitoring the pulse, blood pressure, electrocardiogram and sometimes blood oxygen saturation, the patient is left in a 'motionless standing position' for 20 to 30 minutes. When the patient's syncope is reproduced during the test a 'positive' tilt table study is said to have occurred. During an upright tilt, a patient's cardiovascular system has to adjust itself in order to prevent a significant poion of the blood volume from pooling in the legs. These adjustments consists of a mild increase in hea rate and a constriction of blood vessels in the legs. When a normal individual is placed in an upright tilt, these cardiovascular adjustments occur very quickly, and there is no significant drop in the blood pressure. However, in patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, these adjustments do not occur. Carotid sinus massage In patients with neurocardiogenic syncope, the symptoms can be elicited by carotid sinus massage. Ohostatic blood pressure recording Supine and upright blood pressure monitoring should be done in all patients with neurocardiogenic syncope. Carotid duplex scan Carotid duplex scan is a non-invasive study to estimate the presence and severity of carotid narrowing due to atherosclerosis. In neurocardiogenic syncope, no organic cause is present, so carotid duplex scan has no role.",C

It may be difficult to effectively ventilate and resuscitate the patient. If a CDH is suspected, mask and bag ventilation must be avoided. The patient should be intubated and a sump/replogle tube placed as soon as possible to prevent air from filling the stomach and bowel and thus compromising ventilation fuher.

In carcinoma cheek what is the best drug for single drug chemotherapy,Cyclophosphamide,Vincristine,Danorubicin,Cisplatin,"Single-agent chemotherapy is used as palliative therapy in head and neck cancers with the recurrent or metastatic form of cancer. The drugs which are used are - Cisplatin Methotrexate 5 Fu Paclitaxel Docetaxel Sometimes combinations of these drugs are used . a) Treatment of localized head and neck cancers - These tumors are treated with curative intent either with surgery or radiotherapy. The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expeise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used. Concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy appear to be most effective. c) Recurrent or metastatic disease - chemotherapy is used. Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection/Modified neck dissection/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy. For N2 or N3 neck disease, neck dissection with planned postoperative radiation therapy is performed.",D
Complications of aerial catheterization for a 96-h period of monitoring include all the following EXCEPT,Aerial thrombosis,Infection at the catheter site,Hemorrhage,Septicemia,"Aerial catheterization in the critically ill patient is an impoant method of monitoring changes in blood pressure and permitting frequent sampling of aerial blood. Aerial thrombosis is especially common with smaller aeries such as the radial or dorsalis pedis. This problem can be reduced by the use of continuous heparin flow rather than intermittent flushing. Infection at the catheter site can be minimized by careful management of the wound and by percutaneous placement of the catheter without aerial cutdown. Hemorrhage can occur if the system becomes disconnected. Septicemia is extremely unusual if the catheter is not left in situ for more than 4 days, but it becomes an increasing problem with longer use. Wound hematoma can occur especially if there is difficulty with (he aerial puncture. This complication may be dangerous when catheterization of the femoral aery is used because the blood loss in pelvis or thigh may not be appreciated.

Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

A i.e. Septic shock Harrison's Medicine, 16th ed., p-1604 states that capillary refill time is prolonged in hypovolemic shock Capillary refill It is the rate at which blood refills empty capillaries. It can be measured by holding a hand higher than hea-level (prevents venous reflux), pressing the soft pad of a finger or toe until it turns white, and taking note of the time needed for the color to return once pressure is released. Normal refill time is less than 2 seconds. In newborn infants, capillary refill can be measured by pressing on the sternum for five seconds with a finger or thumb, and noting the time needed for the colour to return once the pressure is released. The upper normal limit for capillary refill in newborns is 3 seconds. The capillary refill time (C) is a common indication of dehydration and decreased peripheral perfusion. It is very useful as suppoing evidence for a positive sign of poor perfusion to the extremities. The C test is often referred to as the Nail blanch test.

Which of the following is NOT TRUE about intermittent claudication?,Most common in calf muscle,Pain is positional,Atherosclerosis is impoant predisposing factor,Relieved by rest,"Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. Intermittent claudication: It refers to the pain or fatigue in muscles of the lower limb caused by walking and relieved by rest. Claudication is derived from the latin word for 'liping, lame', strictly speaking, the term should be used only for symptoms in the lower extremities. The pain is a deep seated ache usually in the calf muscle, which gradually progressive until the patient is compelled to stop walking. Patient occasionally describe 'cramping'or 'tiredness'in the muscle. Typically, symptoms are completely relieved after 2-5 min of inactivity. Claudication is distinguished from other types of pain in lower extremity in that some exeion is always required before it appears; it is reproducible; it does not occur at rest; and it is relieved by cessation of walking. Relieve of symptoms is not dependant upon sitting or other positional changes. The distance a patient can walk varies with the rate of walking, the level of incline, and the degree of aerial obstruction. The average patient with involvement of a single aerial segment can walk 90-180 meters on a level terrain at a moderate pace before pain appears. Regardless of which aerial segment is involved, claudication most commonly involves the calf muscles due to their high workload with normal walking. The correct diagnosis should be easily established by determining the location of pain (calf), the quality of the pain, the length of the time required for relief of symptoms, the reproducibility of symptoms, the distance walked before symptoms begin (initial claudication distance), and the type of rest or position required for relief of symptoms. Although most patients with the disorder do not develop gangrene or require amputations, adverse outcomes of systemic atherosclerosis, including death are common. There is increasing interests in the use of the ankle- brachial index ( ABI ). Normal is >1. Claudication are in the 0.6- 0.9 range. with the rest pain and gangrene occurring at rest <0.3. Indications for surgery include disabling claudication (severely limiting work or lifestyle), rest pain, limb threatening ischemia, and microembolization of the toes in which no other source is identified. Claudication distance will vary from day to day and will altered by walking up hill, and speed of walking of against the wind. Characteristically this pain is worse at night and is worsened by elevation of the extremity, whereas it is somewhat relieved by hanging the foot out of the bed or by sleeping in a chair. Tis rest pain is mainly due to ischemic changes in the somatic nerves, so it is the cry of the dying nerves. Ref: L & B 25/e, page 899 ; Textbook of Surgery By S. Das 5/e, page 151",B

All are true about Boerhaave's syndrome except,Oesophagus bursts at its weakest point in the lower third,Barotrauma,Vomiting occurs against a closed glottis,Veical split in the gastric mucosa,"In Boerhaave's syndrome, vomiting occurs against a closed glottis and pressure builds up in the oesophagus. The pressure in the oesophagus increases rapidly, and the oesophagus bursts at its weakest point in the lower third, sending a stream of material into the mediastinum and often the pleural cavity as well. In Mallory-eiss syndrome, forceful vomiting may produce a mucosal tear at the cardia rather than a full perforation. A veical split in the gastric mucosa, immediately below the squamocolumnar junction at the cardia is seen in 90% of cases. In only 10% is the tear in the oesophagusRef: Bailey and love 27e pg: 1072",D

Primitive streak remanants give rise to ?,Neuroblastomas,Wilm's tumour,Sacrococcygeal teratoma,Hepatoblastoma,"Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is a type of tumor known as a teratoma that develops at the base of the coccyx (tailbone) and is thought to be derived from the primitive streak. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are benign 75% of the time, malignant 12% of the time, and the remainder are considered 'immature teratomas' that share benign and malignant features. Benign sacrococcygeal teratomas are more likely to develop in younger children who are less than 5 months old, and older children are more likely to develop malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas. The Currarino triad (OMIM 176450), due to an autosomal dominant mutation in the MNX1 gene, consists of a presacral mass (usually a mature teratoma or anterior meningocele), anorectal malformation and sacral dysgenesis.

Drug of choice for Bier's block ?,Bupivacaine,Etidocaine,Ropivacaine,Lidocaine,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Lidocaine Intravenous regional Anaesthesia (Bier's block) Intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) is used most often for surgery of the forearm and hand, but can also be used for distal leg and foot. First IV canula is inseed usually in the dorsum of hand. Then tourniquet cuff is applied to proximal arm. Limb is elevated and exsanguinated with the help of an elastic bandage (Esmarch). Now tourniquet cuff is inflated above systolic pressure (so that no blood can enter in that limb and the limb remains exsanguinated). Now the local anaesthetic solution is slowly injected into cannula. The veins are filled with only local anaesthetic as there is no blood -ocal anaesthetic can not be drained out from upper limb and can not enter in systemic circulation because of inflated cuff in proximal arm. The arm is anaesthetized in 6-8 minutes. Lidocaine without adrenaline is the DOC for this technique. --Goodman & Gilman llthie 381 o A few clinician prefers prilocaine over lidocaine because of its higher therapeutic index - least toxic LA. Torniquet cuff deflation, premature release or failure of torniquet can cause release of LA into circulation and toxicity may occur- So, cardiotoxic LAs like bupivacaine and etidocaine are contraindicated for Bier's block.",D

"In order to expose the coeliac axis, left renal aery, superior mesenteric aery and abdominal aoa in a case of trauma, which of the following is performed :Left medial visceral rotation",Left medial visceral rotation,Right medial visceral rotation,Cranial visceral rotation,Caudal visceral rotation,"Ans. is 'a' i.e. Left medial visceral rotation The major abdominal vessels are retroperitoneal structures that lie posterior to the contents of peritoneal sac & close to the midline. The vessels which are notoriously difficult to expose are : retrohepatic vena cava, suprarenal aoa; the coeliac axis; the proximal superior mesentric aery; the junction of the superior mesentric, splenic and poal veins and the bifurcation of the vena cava. Rapid exposure of these vessels can be accomplished during abdominal trauma by following maneuvers : - The principle behind visceral rotation is to rotate the viscera of one side towards the midline after freeing their lateral peritoneal attachments so as to expose the vessels of that side A left medial visceral rotation (Mattox maneuver) provides excellent exposure of the aoa, coeliac axis, superior mesentric aery, left renal aery and iliac aeries. A right medial visceral rotation (Catell maneuver) readily exposes the vena cava (with a combined Kocher maneuver), right renal vessels and iliac veins. The infrarenal aoa may be approached a transperitoneal incision at the base of the mesocolon. The junction of the superior mesentric, splenic and poal veins can be readily exposed in trauma surgery by dividing the neck of the pancreas. The bifurcation of the vena cava is obscured by the right common iliac aery. This vessel is to be divided to expose extensive vena caval injuries of this area.",A

The thyroid scan shown below exhibits a pattern that is most consistent with which of the following disorders?,Hypersecreting adenoma,Graves' disease,Lateral aberrant thyroid,Papillary carcinoma of thyroid,"The thyroid scan illustrated in the question shows a single focus of increased isotope uptake, often referred to as a 'hot' nodule; the remainder of the thyroid gland has not taken up radioactive iodine. Hyperfunctioning adenomas become independent of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) control and secrete thyroid hormone autonomously, which results in clinical hypehyroidism. The elevated thyroid hormone levels ultimately diminish TSH levels severely and thus depress function of the remaining normal thyroid gland. An isolated focus of increased uptake on a thyroid scan is viually diagnostic of a hyperfunctioning adenoma. Carcinomas usually display diminished uptake and are called 'cold' nodules. Graves' disease would probably manifest as a diffusely hyperactive gland without nodularity. Multinodular goiter would display many nodules with varying activity.",A

These glands are predominately mucous secreting. The minor salivary glands contribute to the mucous blanket of the respiratory tract which traps and clears particulate matter. In the oral cavity, the minor salivary glands produce most of the saliva not secreted at mealtime, which moistens and protects the mucous membranes; They facilitate taste deglutition and guard against cavities.
Approximately 450 to 750 minor salivary glands are present intraorally, located in the mucosa of the lips and cheeks, hard and soft palate, uvula, floor of mouth, posterior tongue, retromolar trigone, and peritonsillar area. The largest concentration of intraoral salivary glands is on the hard palate.

Best investigation for ureteric stones is ?,USG,CT,CECT,IVP,"The diagnostic approach to ureteric colic has changed due to the introduction of new radiological imaging such as non-contrast CT. The role of intravenous urography, which is regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of ureteric colic, is being challenged by CT, which has become the first-line investigation in a number of centres.CT has the following advantages over IVU: it has higher sensitivity and specificity for calculus detection, it does not use intravenous contrast medium, it permits alternative diagnoses, and requires a shoer examination time.CT can visualise all radiopaque stones, as well as radiolucent stones such as uric acid and cystine calculi. An impoant limitation of CT is the fact that it does not permit functional evaluation of the kidneys and it is unable to assess the degree of obstruction.

Which of the following statement about volvulus is False:,More common in psychiatric patients,Sigmoid volvulus is more common than caecal volvulus,Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus,All,"Ans is 'c'' i.e. Lower GI scopy is contraindicated in sigmoid volvulus Volvulus describes a condition in which there is rotation of a segment of the intestine on an axis formed by its mesentery resulting in paial or complete obstruction of the lumen and may be followed by circulatory impairment of the bowel. Most common site is colon, among which following are involved in descending order - Sigmoid volvulus (- 75%) - Cecal volvulus (< 25%) - Transverse colon - Splenic flexure - Sigmoid volvulus Most common site of volvulus Volvulus can occur in any segment of large bowel that is attached to a long and floppy mesentery that is fixed to the retroperitoneum by a narrow base of origin. The mesenteric anatomy is such that volvulus is most commonly seen in sigmoid colon. Associated predisposing factors are : - age : average age of presentation is 60-70 yrs. - chronic constipation - institutionalized or neurologically impaired or psychiatric patients (their medication may decrease intestinal motility, or they may fail to pass stool regularly, leading to fecal loaded large bowel predisposing to volvulus) - diet high in fibre and vegetables (as in third world countries) Signs and symptoms are those of acute or subacute intestinal obstruction. X-ray picture is dramatic - there is a markedly dilated sigmoid colon with the appearance of a bent inner tube or coffee bean appearance. Inferior convergence of the dilated loop points towards left side of pelvis. - contrast enema demonstrates the point of obstruction with the pathognomic 'birds beak' or 'bird of prey' or 'ace of spades' sign. Management of sigmoid volvulus Unless there are obvious signs of gangrene or peritonitis, the initial management is resuscitation followed by endoscopic decompression and detorsion. Decompression/detorsion can be achieved by placement of rectal tube through a proctoscope or the use of a colonoscope. If detorsion / decompression cannot be achieved with either the rectal tube or colonoscope, laprotomy with resections of the sigmoid colon is done. Even if detorsion of the sigmoid volvulus is successful, risk of recurrence is high (approx. 50%). Hence an effective sigmoid colectomy is indicated after the pt. has stabilized. Any evidence of bowel gangrene or perforation contraindicates non-operative decompression and an immediate surgical exploration is done. Cecal volvulus The condition commonly referred to as cecal volvulus is actually a cecocolic volvulus and consists of an axial rotation of the terminal ileum, cecum and ascending colon. Cecal bascule - is a condition in which the cecum folds in a cephalad direction anteriorly over a fixed ascending colon. This causes intermittent bouts of abdominal pain because the mobile cecum causes intermittent episodes of Isolated cecal obstruction. It is relieved spontaneously as the cecum falls back into its normal position. Cecocolic volvulus is possible because of lack of fixation of the cecum to the retroperitoneum. Associate predisposing factors are: - previous surgery - pregnancy - malrotation - obstructing lesion of the left colon Cecocolic volvulus affects a younger age group (late 50s) than sigmoid volvulus (60s & 70s). X-ray picture - dilated cecum usually occupying the left upper quadrant. - haustral markings can be seen in the distended cecocolic segment and is a distinguishing feature from sigmoid colon in which generally there are no haustra. Management According to Schwaz Surgery - Cecal volvulus, unlike sigmoid volvulus can almost never be detorsed / decompressed endoscopically. As vascular compromise occurs early in the course of cecal volvulus, surgical exploration is necessary when the diagnosis is made. Right hemicolectomy is the procedure of choice. Sabiston surgery writes that - 'Although there have been repos of detorsion of cecocolic volvulus with a colonoscope most cases require operation to correct the volvulus and prevent ischemia.' An aicle published in the journal 'Diseases of Colon and Rectum' - The management of Cecal Volvulus writes'Non-operative decompression of cecal volvulus is rarely achievable'",C

The abdomen is soft and bowel sounds are normally heard. As an attending physician, what should be your best possible advice?",Order an urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and biliary stenting,Urgent laparotomy,Order an urgent hepatic imino diacetic acid scintigraphy (HIDA),Clinical observation,"Ans. is (d) i.e. Clinical observation 100 ml. of Bile output from the patient on the 1st postop. day without any other abnormality is of no clinical significance, so does not warrant any action from the surgeon. But remember if passing of 100 ml of bile continues for 5-6 days then it is considered abnormal. It denotes bile duct injury. Oxford textbook of Surgery writes ? 'Even after a straightforward cholecystectomy there may be a little bile in the drain the following day.' Textbook of Liver and Biliary Surgery writes ? 'A small amount of biliary drainage following cholecystectomy should cause no alarm because it usually disappears within 1 or 2 days. However, excessive biliary draingae through the wound or drain site, jaundice, sepsis, or a combination of these events early in the post op. period should suggest a bile duct injury, as should copious biliary drainage for more than a few post-op days'.",D

About Mallory Weiss syndrome true is -,Gastrointestinal reflux,Obesity,Tumour at gastroesophageal junction,Seen in alcoholics,"Mallory - Weiss syndrome is characterized by a mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction following a bout of forceful retching (or vomiting, coughing or straining.
- The tear is partial thickness, extends through the mucosa and submucosa, but not through the muscular layer (compare this with Boerhaave syndrome in which the tear is full thickness penetrating completely through all the layers of esophageal wall with spillage of contents into the mediastinum)

The clinical picture consists of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding following bouts of retching or vomiting
'The mean age of patients is older than 60 years. 80% are men' - Sabiston 17/e, p 1254.
Majority of patients are alcoholics
Other frequent associations with Mallory-Weiss tears are

Disease-related bleeding diathesis.

Management

In the majority (-90% of patients the bleeding stops spontaneously and only supportive therapy is required.

Persistent bleeding is managed by
Endoscopic electrocoagulation

if fails

Angiographic techniques (embolization)

if fails
Surgery: Laparotomy with high gastrotomy with oversewing of the linear tear.

It is important to rule out the diagnosis of variceal bleeding in cases of failed endoscopic therapy by a thorough examination of the GE junction. Recurrent bleeding from a Mallory-Weiss tear is uncommon.
Note that the Sengstaken - Blakemore tube will not be able to stop the bleeding in Mallory-Weiss syndrome as the bleeding is arterial and the pressure in the balloon is not sufficient to overcome the arterial pressure.",D

Optimal management of bilateral undescended testicles in an infant is,Immediate surgical placement into the scrotum,Chorionic gonadotropin therapy for 1 month; operative placement into the scrotum before age 1 if descent has not occurred,Observation until the child is 2 years old because delayed descent is common,"Observation until age 5; if no descent by then, plastic surgical scrotal prostheses before the child enters school","By the second year, a testicle not in the cooler environment of the scrotal sac will begin to undergo histologic changes characterized by reduced spermatogonia. Testicles left longer in the undescended state not only have a higher incidence of malignant degeneration but are inaccessible for examination. If a malignancy should occur, diagnosis will be delayed. There is also a substantial psychological burden when children reach school age or are otherwise subjected to exposure of their deformed genitalia. Gel-filled prostheses are generally inserted when a testicle cannot be placed in the scrotum. Close follow-up by a physician until the late teens is indicated in all patients who have had an undescended testicle. Since these patients may be at increased risk for malignancy throughout life, careful training should be given in self-examination.",B

Most common presentation of Wilm's tumour?,Fever,Hematuria,Abdominal mass,UTI,"Ans. C. Abdominal mass. (Ref. Robin's Pathology 8th/pg. 271; Love and Bailey 26th/pg.l24; 1304).Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumour)# Usually presents in the first five years of life# Typically presents with an abdominal mass# May cause haematuria, abdominal pain or fever# It extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs.# Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery.Wilms' tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from 1 to 4 years. A mutation in the Wilms' tumour suppressor gene (WT1) is responsible for some cases. It usually presents as an abdominal mass. The tumour extends into the renal vein and vena cava and metastasises to lymph nodes and lungs. Treatment is with chemotherapy and surgery. Survival depends on tumour spread, completeness of surgical excision and histology but exceeds 70% even among patients with advanced tumours.Wilms' Tumor (nephroblastoma)# Most common primary tumor of the kidney in children.# malignant renal tumour derived from embryonal cells; it typically affects children aged from one to four years. Following are associated with an increased risk of developing Wilms' tumor:- WAGR syndrome: aniridia, genital abnormalities, and mental retardation, have a 33% chance of developing Wilms' tumor.- Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS):extremely high risk (?90%) of developing Wilms' tumor. Characterized by gonadal dysgenesis and renal abnormalities.- Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS): enlargement of individual body organs (e.g., tongue, kidneys, or liver) or entire body segments (hemihypertrophy); enlargement of adrenal cortical cells (adrenal cytomegaly) is a characteristic microscopic feature. BWS is an example of a disorder of genomic imprinting. The genetic locus that is involved in these patients is in band pi5.5 of chromosome 11 distal to the WT1 locus.- Microscopically, Wilms' tumors are characterized by recognizable attempts to recapitulate different stages of nephrogenesis. The classic triphasic combination of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial cell types is observed in most lesions. Sheets of small blue cells, with few distinctive features, characterize the blastemal component.- Nephrogenic rests are putative precursor lesions of Wilms' tumors.- The prognosis for Wilms' tumor is generally very good, and excellent results are obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy.- Anaplasia is a harbinger of adverse prognosis, but careful analyses by the National Wilms' T\imor Study group in the United States have shown that as long as the anaplasia is focal and confined within the resected nephrectomy specimen, the outcome is no different from tumors without evidence of anaplasia. In contrast, Wilms' tumor with diffuse anaplasia the prognosis is poor.Additional Educational points:Neuroblastoma is a malignancy of neuroblasts in the adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia and typically presents as an abdominal or paravertebral mass. It metastasises to lymph nodes, bones and liver and causes elevated urinary catechola- mines. Small-localised tumours are excised. More advanced tumours are treated by chemotherapy and surgery. Survival is related to tumour biology and stage (>90% for small localised tumours, < 50% for advanced tumours).Neuroblastoma is the most common abdominal tumor of infancy. It is much less common than the relatively common hydronephrosis. The most common abdominal mass in a newborn infant is hydronephrosis. It is a common finding in prenatal ultrasounds. It will usually resolve without therapy. Hepatomas and Wilms tumors are even rarer than neuroblastoma.",C

Most common complication seen with prostatitis is,Epididymitis,Orchitis,Sterility,Seminal vesciculitis,"PROSTATITIS In both acute and chronic prostatitis, the seminal vesicles and posterior urethra are usually also involved. Acute prostatitis Aetiology Acute prostatitis is common, but underdiagnosed. The usual organism responsible is Escherichia coli, but Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia may be responsible. The infection may be haematogenous from a distant focus or it may be secondary to acute urinary infectionClinical features General manifestations overshadow the local: the patient feels ill, shivers, may have a rigor, has 'aches' all over, especially in the back, and may easily be diagnosed as having influenza. The temperature may be up to 39degC. Pain on micturition is usual, but not invariable. The urine contains threads in the initial voided sample, which should be cultured. Perineal heaviness, rectal irritation and pain on defaecation can occur; a urethral discharge is rare. Frequency occurs when the infection involves the bladder. Rectal examination reveals a tender prostate; one lobe may be swollen more than the other, and the seminal vesicles may be involved. A frankly fluctuant hygiene abscess is uncommon. Treatment Treatment must be rigorous and prolonged or the infection will not be eradicated and recurrent attacks may ensue. Spread of infection to the epididymides and testes may occur. Prolonged treatment with an antibiotic that penetrates the prostate well is indicated (trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin) Chronic prostatitis Many urologists find the diagnosis of chronic prostatitis and 'prostatodynia' very difficult, for many men present with perigenital pain, testicular pain, prostatic pain exacerbated by sexual intercourse or pain that apparently renders sexual intercourse out of the question. Psychosexual dysfunction in such patients may be the underlying problem. The diagnosis of chronic prostatitis has to be based on: * persistent threads in voided urine; * prostatic massage showing pus cells with or without bacteria in the absence of urinary infection. Aetiology This is thought to be the sequela of inadequately treated acute prostatitis. While pus is present in the prostatic secretion, the responsible organism is often difficult to find. Other organisms such as Chlamydia species may be responsible for chronic abacterial prostatitis. Clinical features The clinical features are extremely varied. Only men with symptoms of posterior urethritis, prostatic pain and perigenital pain accompanied by intermittent fever and pus cells or bacteria in the post-prostatic massage specimen should be diagnosed as having chronic prostatitis. Diagnosis The three-glass urine test is valuable. If the first glass with the initial voided sample shows urine containing prostatic threads, prostatitis is present. Rectal examination of the prostate may be normal or may show a soft, boggy and tender prostate. Examination of the prostatic fluid obtained by prostatic massage should show pus cells and bacteria. Urethroscopy may reveal inflammation of the prostatic urethra, and pus may be seen exuding from the prostatic ducts. The verumontanum is likely to be enlarged and oedematous. In many men with the symptoms described above, all investigations are normal. Treatment Antibiotic therapy should be administered only in accordance with bacteriological sensitivity tests. Trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin penetrate well into the prostate. If Trichomonas or anaerobes are the responsible agent, a rapid response is obtained from administration of metronidazole (200mg t.d.s. for 7 days to both paners). If Chlamydia is suspected, doxycycline is the antibiotic treatment of choice. There is little evidence that prostatic massage helps in eradicating the infection.

What is the coagulation factor involved exclusively in the extrinsic coagulation system? SELECT ONE.,Factor II (prothrombin),Factor V,Factor VII,Factor VIII,"There are two coagulation pathways - extrinsic and intrinsic. In the extrinsic system, tissue thromboplastin (a lipoprotein) interacts with factor VII. The intrinsic pathway requires factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Factor XII is the initial step in the coagulation cascade. Factor XII, activated by contact with a nonendothelial substance, will activate factor XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent). However, factor XI can be activated even when factor XII is deficient. Calcium is required for nearly all of the enzyme reactions in both the intrinsic and extrinsic systems. The amount of ionized calcium required for these reactions is extremely small, and clinical hypocalcemia itself is not a cause of abnormal bleeding. Fibrin split products are not part of the normal pathway in either the intrinsic or extrinsic system. The excessive breakdown of fibrinogen results in measurable amounts of the breakdown products of fibrinogen in the blood. Their presence may signal DIC if the PT and platelet count are deranged. In pure fibrinolysis, fibrinogen breakdown product levels also may be increased.",C

Which of the following regarding branchial cyst is true?,Seen deep to lower 1/3rd of sternocleidomastoid,Wall consists of lymphoid tissue,Filled with keratinized fluid,Presents at birth,"BRANCHIAL CYST

It arises from the remnants of second branchial cleft. Normally, 2nd, 3rd, 4th clefts disappear to form a smooth neck. Persistent 2nd cleft is called as cervical sinus (of His) which eventually gets sequestered to form branchial cyst. 
Six branchial arches with five pharyngeal pouches (endoderm lining) inside and five pharyngeal clefts (ectoderm lining) outside are present. 
Swelling in the neck beneath the anterior border of upper third of the sternomastoid muscle. It is smooth, soft, fluctuant, often transilluminant with a sensation of ‘Half-filled double hot water bottle’.
It is equal in both sexes. Even though congenital, it is seen in late adolescents and early 3rd decade.
In 3% cases, it is bilateral; it can be familial also.

A diet high in saturated or polyunsaturated fats increases risk of colorectal cancer, while a diet high in oleic acid (olive oil, coconut oil, fish oil) does not increase risk.
consumption of fish (including fresh, canned, salted and smoked fish decrease the risk of colon cancer. This is because of the anti-cancer activity of omega-3 fatty acids found in fishes.
note that consumption of chicken has no effect on colon cancer.

Fibres

though Harrison writes that dietary fibres play no role in colon cancer, all other books i.e. Schwartz, CSDT & Maingot's are of the view that a high fibre diet has protective effect and a low fibre diet increases the risk.


Alcohol - is also a risk factor
Ingestion of calcium, selenium, vitamin A, C & E, carotenoids, and plant phenols decrease the risk of colon cancer.
Insulin resistance

a high calorie diet coupled with physical inactivity leads to excess weight gain and insulin resistance which further causes increased levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors type I (IGF-I). This growth factor appears to stimulate proliferation of intestinal mucosa",D

The course of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is best described by which of the following statements?,Metastases are rare; local growth is rapid; erosion into the trachea and large blood vessels is frequent,"Local invasion and metastases almost never occur, which makes the term carcinoma misleading",Bony metastases are frequent and produce an osteolytic pattern particularly in vertebrae,Metastases frequently occur to cervical lymph nodes; distant metastases and local invasion are rare,"Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes, but distant metastasis is uncommon. The nonaggressive nature of this tumor locally and the infrequency of distant metastases combine to produce an 80-95% 5-year survival rate. A contributing factor to the success of thyroid surgery for papillary carcinoma is the easy accessibility of cervical nodes for examination and dissection.

Characteristic features of the acute compament syndrome in the lower leg include all of the following except,Acute pain on employing the stretch test,Normal pulses,Normal sensation distally,Venous occlusion,"C i.e. Normal sensation distally Compament Syndrome - Tibial diaphyseal fractures is the most common cause of compament syndromeQ (overall and in adults); in children the most common cause is fracture supracondylar humerusQ. In a recent study it has been repoed that 69% of compament syndromes are associated with fracturesQ and 36% of all compament syndrome are associated with tibial diaphyseal fractureQ. With the improved results associated with intramedullary nailing of tibial fractures, compament syndrome has become the commonest serious complication of closed tibial fractures. An open fracture does not protect the patient from compament syndrome. It mainly affects young male and is best detected by compament pressure monitoringQ. Most of the classical symptoms of compament syndrome only occur only after there has been irreversible soft tissue damageQ. If the surgeons wait for paresthesia, paralysis, or pulselessness, the patient is highly unlikely to recover full function and it is probable that myonecrosis will already have staed. If clinical suspicion is to be used for diagnosis, the diagnosis must be based on increased painQ (dispropoionate) and pain on passive muscle stretchQ, as these clinical signs usually occur at an earlier stage. It is extremely difficult to diagnose compament syndrome clinically, and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that a number of patients will be pain free, unconscious, on ventilators, or anesthetized when compament syndrome becomes clinically impoant. When monitoring it is only necessary to record the pressure in the anterior compament (as it is involved in all cases). The pressure is highest nearer the fracture site, it is there fore impoant to locate the tip of the catheter near to the fracture site to ensure that the muscle with the highest pressure is monitored. Continuous pressure monitoring is better than single reading. Surgeons use a single pressure level, usually 30 mm He, or a difference between intra compament pressure and diastolic blood pressure (diastolic BP - ICP) < 30 mmHgQ as an appropriate criteria to base the decision to undeake fasciotomy. Subtotal fasciotomy should never be undeaken. All four compaments should be decompressed. Compament decomression (fasciotomy) should be performed immideatelyQ as delay carries risk of permanent dysfunction.",C

These bands progressively contract so that ultimately mouth opening is severly limited. Tongue movements may also be limited. This conditon is almost entirely confined to Asians. Histologically it is characterized by juxtaepithelial fibrosis with atrophy or hyperplasia of the overlying epithelium which also shows areas of epithelial dysplasias. The etiology is abscure. Hypersensitivity to chilli ; betel nut, tobacco and vitamin deficiencies have been implicated. The scar bands of submucous fibrosis, which result in difficulty in opening can be treated either by intralesional injection of steroids or by surgical excision and grafting, but this has little effect in preventing the onset of squamous cell Ca in the generally atrophic oral mucosa (Submucous oral fibrosis is a precancerous conditon for squamons cell Ca).'- Bailey & Love",A

Gleason score is used for prognosticating outcome of?,Gastric cancer,Bladder cancer,Colonic cancer,Prostatic cancer,"Ans. D. Prostatic cancer. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 98; 1352)Gleason scoreAdenocarcinomas are also often classified as Gl, 2 or 3, but prostate cancer is an exception with widespread use of the Gleason system. The Gleason system grades prostate cancer according to the degree of differentia- tion of the two most prevalent architectural patterns. The final score is the sum of the two grades and can vary from 2 (1 + 1) to 10 (5 + 5). With the higher scores indicating poorer prognosis.A classification of the histological pattern based on the degree of glandular de-differentiation and its relation to stroma has been devised by Gleason. Prostate cancers exhibit heterogeneity within tissue, and so two histological areas of prostate are each scored between 1 and 5. The scores are added to give an overall Gleason score of between 2 and 10; this (and the volume of the cancer) appears to correlate well with the likelihood of spread and the prognosis.Educational points:Treatment and stage of Ca prostate:# Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on stage of disease, life expectancy of the patient and patient preference# PSA, DRE and biopsy Gleason grade are used to predict pathological stage# Localised cancer can be treated by radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy and active monitoring# Treatment of advanced disease is palliative, and hormone ablation remains the first-line therapy",D

The drug which is not suitable for patients with acute porphyria for intravenous induction is –,Thiopentone sodium,Propofol,Midazolam,Etomidate,"All barbiturates (including thiopentone) are absolutely contraindicated.
There is controversy regarding etomidate because some text books (miller) consider it safe, while other (Lee, Wylie), consider it unsafe :-


Miller (7th/e 1115) has given etomidate amongst the safe drugs.
Lee and Wylie have opinion different to Miller :-

'Etomidate is potentially porphyriogenic in animal models and at least one crisis has followed its use in human subjects, although its safe use has also been reported, on balance, etomide should be considered unsafe'.
─ Wylie
'Etomidate should probably be avoided because it is potentially porphyrinogenic in animals, although reports in humans are conflicting'.
─ Lee

Anyways, whatever opinion about etomidate, the answer of this question is thiopentone for sure as there is no confusion about contraindication of barbiturates in porphyria.",A
Commonest treatment of Branchial cyst,Cystectomy,Aspiration,Excision,Nothing done,"A branchial cyst probably develops from the vestigial remnants of the second branchial cleft, is usually lined by squamous epithelium, and contains thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. The cyst usually presents in the upper neck in early or middle adulthood and is found at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. It is a fluctuant swelling that may transilluminate and is often soft in its early stages so that it may be difficult to palpate. If the cyst becomes infected it becomes erythematous and tender and, on occasions, it may be difficult to differentiate from a tuberculous abscess. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration both aid diagnosis and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undeaken when the lesion is quiescent. Although the anterior aspect of the cyst is easy to dissect, it may pass backwards and upwards through the bifurcation of the common carotid. Bailey & Love,5th,727",C

Schwartz 'An epigastric hernia is a defect in the abdominal wall in the midline junction of the aponeuroses of the abdominal wall musculature from the xiphoid process superiorly to the umbilicus inferiorly.' MaingotEpigastric herniaAn epigastric hernia occurs through the linea Alba anywhere between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus.The mouth of the hernia is too small; consequently, in most cases contain only preperitoneal fat, or rarely may contain only a small portion of greater omentum.These may be congenital and due to defective midline fusion of developing lateral abdominal wall elements.It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age.Epigastric hernias are two to three times more common in men. The defects are small and often produce pain out of proportion to their size owing to incarceration of preperitoneal fat.They are multiple in up to 20% of patients although most are associated with one dominant defect. Repair usually consists of excision of the incarcerated preperitoneal tissue and simple closure of the fascial defect similar to umbilical hernias.Umbilical herniasUmbilical hernias occur at the umbilical ring and may either be present at birth or develop gradually during the life of the individual.Umbilical hernias are present in approximately 10 percent of all newborns and are more common in premature infants.Most congenital umbilical hernias close spontaneously by age 5 years. If closure does not occur by this time, elective surgical repair usually is advised.Adults with small, asymptomatic umbilical hernias may be followed clinically. Surgical treatment is offered if a hernia is observed to enlarge, if it is associated with symptoms, or if incarceration occurs.Spigelian herniaA spigelian hernia occurs through the spigelian fascia, which is composed of the aponeurotic layer between the rectus muscle medially and the semilunar line laterally.Nearly all spigelian hernia occur at or below the arcuate line (Arcuate line lies midway b/w the umbilicus and the pubic symphysis) Spigelian hernias are variety of intraparietal hernia with the hernial sac dissecting beneath the internal oblique muscles. More often, it advances through the muscle and spreads out like a mushroom between the internal and external oblique aponeurosis.It is seen in older age group (>50 yrs of age)Most spigelian hernias are small and present with localized pain in the area without a bulge because the hernia lies beneath the intact external oblique aponeurosis - Ref. SabistonSpigelian hernias have a high incidence of strangulation (because of the narrow & rigid neck) and should be repaired.",B

Investigation of choice for pneumoperitoneum is:,Chest X-ray Erect,Abd X-ray Erect,CT Abdomen,Left lateral decubitus X-ray,"Ref: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery 19th Edition & Radiology for Surgeons in Clinical Practice, First Edition, Pg: 42.Explanation:Erect abdominal X-ray is the first test ordered for suspected pneumoperitoneum.However CT abdomen is the most sensitive test for demonstrating pneumoperitoneum.Upright chest radiographs can detect as little as 1 ml of air.Lateral decubitus abdominal radiographs can also detect pneumoperitoneum effectively in patients who cannot stand: as little as 5 to 10 mL of gas may be detected with this technique.Approximately 75% of these patients will have a large enough pneumoperitoneum to be visible on X-rays.Where the plain radiographs are equivocal, then CT is the most sensitive imaging technique for diagnosis of free intraperitoneal air.Signs of free intraperitoneal air on a supine abdominal radiograph areAir overlying or outlining solid organs such as liver and spleen (Lucent liver sign)A triangle of air outlining Morrison's pouch (Doges cap sign)Air outlining intraabdominal structures such as falciform ligament, umbilical median, medial and lateral ligaments (Inverted V sign)Bowel wall outlined by air both inside and outside (Rigler's sign)Centrally placed intraperitoneal free air (football sign)Scrotal air in childrenCupola sign of air under the central diaphragmConditions mimicking pneumoperitoneumIt is very important to be able to recognize conditions that can simulate pneumoperitoneum because an observational error may lead to unnecessary surgery.Chilaiditi's syndrome in which the colon is interposed between the liver and the diaphragm can mimic pneumoperitoneum, but usually haustral folds can be seen that will allow- identification of the colon.A gas-containing subphrenic abscessBasal pulmonary atelectasis.On the left side, a gas-distended fundus of the stomach may cause confusion, and clarification by a decubitus film may be necessary.Postoperative air may sometimes cause confusion, but this should have resolved by 5 to 7 days and should decrease in size with time.",C

It usually affects children and adolescents. It commonly involves diaphysis of long bones, paicularly in the proximal humerus. Patients usually presents with pain with nocturnal exacerbations. It is usually relieved with NSAIDS. On X ray it appears as dense coical sclerosis surrounding a radiolucent nidus. Ewing's sarcoma affects long bones such as femur, tibia or humerus in young and affects flat bones in young patients. In the long bones, tumor almost always affects the metaphysis or diaphysis. X ray shows onion peel appearance due to alternate layers of reactive new bone formation and the tumor tissue. Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant bone tumor, it affects metaphysis of long bones.

Both mechanisms lead to formation of Laudanosine. Laudanosine depends on liver for clearance (70% bile excretion). Laudanosine at high plasma levels can cause cerebral excitation and seizure activity in animals, (but this has not been a clinical problem in humans.)In animals receiving Laudanosine infusion who are anaesthetised: Plasma cone. > 6 mcg/ml causes hypotension, >10 mcg/ml cause EEG epileptic spike, >17 mcg/ml causes seizures (Chappie et al 1987).A full paralyzing dose of Atracurium (0.5mg/kg) causes Laudanosine levels of only 0.3 mcg/ml. Also, in presence of anaesthetic agents, CNS depression is present, & Atracurium induced muscle relaxation will prevent muscle movement due to seizure activity.However, in the ICU, where anaesthetic agents are not present, there is a theoretical possibility of laudanosine-induced CNS stimulation.

This is one of the most aggressive malignancies in humans. 
Thankfully it is rare. It may develop de novo, or present as dedifferentiation of a papillary or poorly differentiated carcinoma. The disease is characterised by rapid growth, visceral invasion  and  distant  metastases. The  surgeon’s  role  in  this disease is crucial. Thyroid lymphoma can be incorrectly diagnosed as anaplastic cancer and so biopsy is critical. This can be done using a core or open technique.

Most common type of hypospadias?,Glandular,Coronal,Penile,Perineal,"Ans. A. Glandular. (Ref. Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 1360.)HypospadiasHypospadias occurs in one in 200-300 boys and is the most common congenital malformation of the urethra. The external meatus opens on the underside of the penis or the perineum, and the ventral aspect of the prepuce is poorly developed ( hooded prepuce').Hypospadias is classified according to the position of the meatus:# * Glanular or distal hvpospadia: most common form and does not usually require treatment. Opening is found near the head of the penis. The normal site of the external meatus is marked by a blind pit, although it occasionally connects by a channel to the ectopic opening on the underside of the glans.# * Coronal hypospadias. The meatus is placed at the junction of the underside of the glans and the body of the penis.# * Penile and penoscrotal hypospadias. The opening is on the underside of the penile shaft (.# * Perineal hvpospadias.This is the most severe abnormality.The scrotum is bifid and the urethra opens between its two halves. There may be testicular maldescent, which may make it difficult to determine the sex of the child.The more severe varieties of hypospadias represent an absence of the urethra and corpus spongiosum distal to the ectopic opening. The absent structures are represented by a fibrous cord, which deforms the penis in a downward direction (chordee).Rx: Glanular hypospadias does not need treatment unless the meatus is stenosed, in which case a meatotomy is performed. Surgery is indicated for other forms of hypospadias to improve sexual function, to correct problems with the urinary stream and for cosmetic reasons. A variety of plastic surgical procedures is described to correct the chordee and to re-site the urethral opening. Most procedures use preputial skin and so circumcision should be avoided until the hypospadias has been repaired.",A

These tumors may arise sporadically or be inherited as features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The 'rule of tens' for pheochromocytomas states that about 10% are bilateral, 10% are extraadrenal, and 10% are malignant. However, these percentages are higher in the inherited syndromes. The clinical presentation is so variable that Pheochromocytoma has been termed 'the great masquerader'. The dominant sign is hypeension. Classically, patients have episodic hypeension, but sustained hypeension is also frequent. CLINICAL FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA Headaches Sweating attacks Palpitation and tachycardia Hypeension, sustained or paroxysmal Anxiety and panic attacks Pallor Nausea Abdominal pain Weakness Weight loss Paradoxical response to antihypeensive drugs Polyuria and polydipsia Constipation Ohostatic hypotension Dilated cardiomyopathy Erythrocytosis Elevated blood sugar Hypercalcemia",D

True regarding indirect inguinal hernia are all except:March 2008,Most common type of hernia,Always unilateral,Inguinal herniotomy is the basic operation,Transillumination distinguishes it from hydrocele,"Ans. B: Always unilateralIndirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of hernia and occurs commonly in the youngIn the first decade it is more common on the right side.The hernia is bilateral in 12% of cases.In boys, differentiating between a hernia and a hydrocele is not always easy.Transillumination has been advocated as a means of distinguishing between the presence of a sac filled with fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele) and the presence of bowel in the scrotal sac.However, in cases of inguinal hernia incarceration, transillumination may not be beneficial because any viscera that is distended and fluid-filled in the scrotum of a young infant may also transilluminate.A rectal examination may be helpful if intestine can be felt descending through the internal ring.* Silk sign: When the hernia sac is palpated over the cord structures, the sensation may be similar to that of rubbing 2 layers of silk together.

By excluding pancreatic juice from the pseudocyst, this bridging intraductal stent may permit the duct disruption to heal and the pseudocyst to resolve without drainage (analogous to the use of common bile duct stents in the setting of a cystic duct leak).",C

"Virchow's triad includes all of the following, EXCEPT-",Venous stasis,Injury to veins,Blood hypercoagulability,Venous thrombosis,"Virchow's triad refers to three primary influences that predispose to thrombus formation.


Endothelial injury (or vascular injury)
Stasis or turbulence of blood flow
Blood hypercoagulability


Virchow's triad should be the cornerstone for assessment of risk factors for deep venous thrombosis.
Stasis can occur with venous insufficiency, severe heart failure, or prolonged bed rest or immobility of an extremity following coma, pelvic or limb fracture, paralysis, extended aeroplane travel, or a lengthy operation.
Endothelial injury can result from direct trauma (severed vein, venous cannulation, or transvenous pacing) or local irritation secondary to the infusion of chemotherapy, previous DVT, or phlebitis.

Damaged endothelium leads to platelet aggregation, degranulation and formation of thrombosis as well as vasoconstriction ad activation of the coagulation cascade.
The hypercoagulable state can be inherited or acquired.
These are

def. of antithrombin III, protein C or S
increased homocysteine
factor V Leiden mutation
prothrombin gene mutation
antiphospholipid syndrome
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
malignancy (lung cancer - most commonly pancreas, prostate, breast, ovary etc...)
nephrotic syndrome
pregnancy, high dose estrogen therapy or OCPs.

Triangle of Doom is bounded by all of the following except:,Cooper's ligament,Vas deferens,Gonadal vessels,Peritoneal reflection,"Triangle of doom is an important anatomical area in the inguinal region when seen laparoscopically from inside.
In both open and laparoscopic preperitoneal approaches to hernia repair, a good understanding of the anatomical structures in the inguinal region from a reversed perspective is very necessary. The preperitoneal space is bounded internally by the peritoneum and externally by the transversalis fascia. There are 3 potentially dangerous areas : 2 triangles and one circle.

Triangle of doom :

Triangle of doom is formed by the gonadal vessels laterally and the vas deferens medially. Both these entities meet at the deep inguinal ring and the base of triangle is formed by the peritoneal reflection. This triangle contains external iliac artery and vessels. So no dissection or other activity whatsoever should be performed
in this area, as an injury to either of these vessels could be fatal. Moreover the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve lies in this area and is equally in danger in case of careless dissection

Triangle of pain :

Triangle of pain lies lateral to the triangle of doom and is defined as gonadal vessel medially, the iliopubic tract laterally and inferiorly the inferior edge of skin incision. This triangle contains femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and anterior femoral cutaneous nerve of thigh. Stapling in this area during laparoscopic hernia repair may cause nerve entrapment and result in painful neuralgias.

Circle of death :

This is also called as corona mortis and refers to vascular ring formed by an arterial network, the common iliac artery, internal and external iliac arteries, Obturator artery, abberant Obturator artery, and inferior epigastric artery. The venous counterparts are similar in name, course, and position.",A

Who coined term anaesthesia,Moon,Holmes,Morgan,Priestly,"Oliver Wendell Holmes coined the term anesthesia. In 1846, Holmes coined the word anesthesia. In a letter to dentist William T. G. Moon, the first practitioner to publicly demonstrate the use of ether during surgery, he wrote: 'Everybody wants to have a hand in a great discovery. All I will do is to give a hint or two as to names--or the name--to be applied to the state produced and the agent. The state should, I think, be called 'Anaesthesia.' This signifies insensibility--more paicularly ... to objects of touch.' Ether was used for frivolous purposes ('ether frolics'), but not as an anesthetic agent in humans until 1842, when Crawford W. Long and William E. Clark independently used it on patients for surgery and dental extraction, respectively. However, neither Long nor Clark publicized his discovery. Four years later, in Boston, on October 16, 1846, William T.G. Moon conducted the first publicized demonstration of general anesthesia for surgical operation using ether. The dramatic success of that exhibition led the operating surgeon to exclaim to a skeptical audience: 'Gentlemen, this is no humbug!' Joseph Priestley produced nitrous oxide in 1772, and Humphry Davy first noted its analgesic propeies in 1800. Gardner Colton and Horace Wells are credited with having first used nitrous oxide as an anesthetic for dental extractions in humans in 1844.

Over 80% of patients had associated renal stones, significant neuromuscular dysfunction and muscle weakness.This led to the traditional mnemonic that patients with PHPT presented with 'bones, stones, abdominal groans and psychiatric oveones'.Currently, most of the patients might be asymptomatic.Ref: Bailey and Love 27e pg: 825",C
Horner's syndrome. All true exceptaEUR',Miosis,Anhydrosis,Hyperchromatic iris,Apparent exophthalmos,"Apparent exophthalmoses [Ref: Adams victor principles of neurology 8/e p. 2541 Horner's syndrome is a classic neurologic syndrome whose signs include: -- Miosis, - Ptosis, and - Anhidrosis Also called oculosympathetic paresis, a Horner's syndrome can be produced by a lesion anywhere along the sympathetic pathway that supplies the head, eye, and neck. Neuroanatomy Horner's syndrome can result from a lesion anywhere along a three-neuron sympathetic (adrenergic) pathway that originates in the hypothalamus - The first-order neuron - Descends caudally from the hypothalamus to the first synapse, which is located in the cervical spinal cord (levels C8-12, also called ciliospinal center of Budge). - The second-order neuron - Travels .from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex. It then ascends to the superior cervical ganglion, located near the angle of the mandible and the bifurcation of the common carotid aery. - The third-order neuron - Then ascends within the adventitia of the internal carotid aery, through the cavernous sinus, where it is in close relation to the sixth cranial nerve. The oculosympathetic pathway then joins the ophthalmic (VI) division of the ,fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve). In the orbit and the eye, the oculosympathetic fibers innervate the iris dilator muscle as well as Muller's muscle, a small smooth muscle in the eyelids responsible for a minor poion of the upper lid elevation and lower lid retraction. Clinical features The classic signs of a Horner's syndrome are: ? - PtosisQ - Miosise - A n hidrosisQ The degree of anisocoria is more marked in the dark than in light. - There is associated dilation lag, an asymeetry in papillary redilation between the two eyes when the light source is moved away .from the eye. - The homer's pupil will redilate more slowly (by 15 to 20 seconds) than the normal pupil. The ptosis is minor (less than 2 mm) and occurs as a result of paralysis of the Muller's muscle, which is innervated by the sympathetic pathway. The lower as well as the upper lid is affected producing the so-called 'upside-down ptosis'. Anhidrosis is present in central or preganglionic (first or second order) lesions. The sympathetic fibers responsible for facial sweating and vasolidation branch off at the superior cervical ganglion from the remainder of the oculosympathetic pathway; thus, anhidrosis is not a feature of postagangkonic or third-order lesions. This sign is .frequently not apparent to patients or clinicians. A congenital Horner's syndrome should be suspected when anisocoria is associated with heterochromia (unequal iris color, with the affected iris being lighter). - This occurs because formation of iris pigment in the first several months of age is under sympathetic control. This may only be apparent if the natural color is relatively dark. ETIOLOGY The etiology of Horner's syndrome in adults relates to the lesion location. First-order syndrome (central) Lesions of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem or cervicothoracic spinal cord can produce a first-order Homer's syndrome. Lateral medullary syndromes (M.C.) - Brainstem disease (stroke, tumour, demyelinating disorder) - Syringomyelia - Cervical cord trauma (including surgery) - Spinal cord tumour - Diabetic autonomic neuropathy - Multiple sclerosis Second-order syndrome (preganglionic) - Trauma or surgery involving spinal cord, thoracic outlet lung apex. - Pancoast tumour - Carotid and Aoic aneurysm and dissection - Lumbar epidural anaesthesia. Third-order syndrome (Postganglionic) - Lesions of internal carotid aery such as - Dissection, thrombosis - Otitis media - Cavernous sinus mass Surgery for raynaud's syndrome (cervical sympathectomy) may cause trauma to cervical spinal cord.",D
Majority of lung cysts occur in -,Mediastinum,Near carina,Base of the lung,Peribronchial tissue,"The bronchogenic cyst is a congenital lung lesion which arises from the anomalous development of foregut or tracheobronchial tree.
Characteristics of Bronchogenic Cysts -

Most of the Bronchogenic cysts arise in the mediastinum but ~15% occur in pulmonary parenchyma.
In the mediastinum, they are usually located just posterior to the carnia or main stem bronchi.
Mediastinal bronchogenic cysts do not communicate with the bronchi but those situated within the lung may communicate with the airways and consequently are prone to abscess formation.
When located in the lung, they are more common in right lung and lower lobes
These are lined by cuboidal or ciliated columnar epithelium and are usually filled with mucoid material.

Complication: -

Infection of the cyst leads to abscess
Compression can produce either hyper infection of the lung or atelectasis due to obstruction

May be performed at the time of mastectomy (immediate) or sometime subsequently (delayed) because the presence of reconstruction may interfere with the accurate planning and administration of radiation therapy, reconstruction is generally delayed if the use of local or regional radiation therapy is anticipated. Timing of breast reconstruction is of no oncologic significance. Because most local recurrences occur in the skin's subcutaneous tissues, the presence of a reconstruction will not interfere with detection. Similarly, a reconstruction does not complicate the administration of chemotherapy. Utilize either autogenous tissue or synthetic prostheses to recreate a breast mound.

Patients tend to be hypotensive and ohostatic, about 90% have systolic blood pressure under 110 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure is also decreased, the B.P. is usually in the range of 80/50 or less. In addison's diseases the hea is usually smallQ. In addison's disease the plasma renin activity is usually elevated, - It indicates the presence of depleted intravascular volume. Addison's disease The predominant manifestations in Addison's disease occur due to mineralocoicoid deficiency but the symptoms are also contributed by glucocoicoid deficiency and increased ACTH FEATURES OF:- Mineralocoicoid deficiency lack of aldosterone secretion greatly decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorption and consequently allows sodium ions, chloride ions and water to be lost into urine in great profusion. The net result is greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume. Fuhermore, hyponatremia2, hyperkalemia0 and mild acidosis0 develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption. Glucocoicoid deficiency Loss of coisol secretion leads to hypoglycaemia because of decreased gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral utilization of glucose. Fuhermore, lack of coisol reduces0 the mobilization of both proteins and fats from the tissues thereby depressing many other metabolic functions of the body. This sluggishness of energy mobilization when coisol is not available is one of the major detrimental effects of glucocoicoid lack. Increased ACTH When coisol secretion is depressed the normal negative feedback to the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland is also depressed, therefore allowing tremendous rates of ACTH secretion as well as simultaneous secretion of increased amount of MSH. Probably the tremendous amount of ACTH cause most of the pigmenting effect because they can stimulate formation of melanin by the melanocytes in the same way that MSH does. REMEMBER The clinical features and laboratory features described above are characteristically seen only in primary addison's disease because in primary addison's disease both aldosterone and glucocoicoid are deficient, whereas In secondary addison's disease only glucocoicoid deficiency is seen.' ALSO KNOW The basis for acute adrenal deficiency or addisonian crisis During conditions of physical or mental stress, large amount of glucocoicoids are secreted to cope up with the situation. But in persons with addison's disease, the output of glucocoicoids does not increase during stress. Thus the deficiency of glucocoicoids, when a person actually has acute need for the excessive amount of glucocoicoids produces addisonian crisis. The manifestations are produced due to extracellular fluid dehydration and low blood volume leading to circulatory shock.",D

In a patient who is comatose either NG feeding or feeding through a gastrostomy tube may lead to vomiting and aspiration. This can be avoided by using a nasoenteric tube with the tip placed in jejunum under fluoroscopic guidance or endoscopic control. Alternatively, a catheter may be placed directly into the proximal jejunum through a small upper abdominal incision. Enteral Nutrition Enteral feeding means delivery of nutrients into the GIT. The alimentary tract should be used whenever possible. This can be acheived with oral supplements (sip feeding) or with a variety of tube-feeding techniques delivering food into the stomach, duodenum or jejunum.

Diagnosis of traumatic rupture of diaphragma) Laparoscopyb) Chest X rayc) Diagnostic peritoneal lavaged) IPPV,ab,a,ad,bc,"• Diaphragmatic injuries are often caused by penetrating injuries.
• Patients sustaining penetrating injuries below the nipples and above the costal margins should be investigated to rule out diaphragmatic injury.
Etiology
• Penetrating trauma (knife, bullet, repair of hiatus hernia)
• Blunt trauma (motor vehicle accident, fall from height, bout of hyperemesis):
−− Caused by compressive force applied to the pelvis and abdomen.
−− Rupture is usually large, with herniation of abdominal content into chest
Clinical Features
• Most diaphragmatic injuries are silent and the presenting features are those of injury to the surrounding organs.
• Late complication: Herniation of abdominal contents in to the chest.
• Herniation of organ: Stomach >Colon >Small intestine >Omentum >Spleen >Kidney and pancreas.
Diagnosis
• There is no single standard investigation to diagnose diaphragmatic injuries.
• Chest X-ray after placement of a nasogastric tube may be helpful (as this may show the stomach herniated into the chest)
• Contrast study of upper or lower GIT, CT scan and diagnostic peritoneal lavage all lack positive or negative predictive value.
• Most accurate evaluation is by video assisted thracoscopy (VATS) or laparoscopy, offering the advantage of allowing the surgeon to proceed to repair and additional evaluation of the abdominal organs.
Treatment
• Operative repair is recommended in all cases.
• All penetrating diaphragmatic injury must be repaired via the abdomen and not the chest, to rule out penetrating hollow viscus injury.

In these cases emergency airway management is essential. The patient require immediate oxygen. - These patients needs to be intubated immediately. - But an impoant point to note is that severe maxillofacial trauma makes intubation very difficult. -Some believe that nasotracheal intubation is contraindicated in patients with severe maxillofacial injury because nasotracheal intubation in these patients can result in nasocranial intubation or severe nasal hemorrhage. - Nasotracheal intubation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with midfacial injury and C.S.F. rhinorrhoea. Orotracheal intubation in patients with severe maxillofacial injury In patients with severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation is also difficult. Presence of blood clots, .fractures make the passage of the tube quite difficult. Moreover when the surgeons perform operation for mandibular or maxillary fractures they wires both these together. If surgery is required with severe maxillofacial injury surgeons usually prefer nasotracheal intubation or tracheostomy. Tracheostomy in patient with severe maxillofacial injury : ? Tracheostomy does not have much role in 'emergency airways management'. - Tracheostomy is a time taking procedure compared to intubation. - If the airways of the patient is severely compromised and he requires immediate oxygenation, tracheostomy has no role. - Immediate oxygenation can only be delivered by rapid intubation. In case, intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. -In emergency management of the airway, cricothyroidotomy is done if intubation is not possible. Tracheostomy is only done when immediate oxygen requirements are taken care of and a surgical procedure is planned. In the question the Sp02 of the patient is 80% when on oxygen. He requires immediate emergency management of the airway which can be achieved through intubation, If intubation is impossible, cricothyroidotomy is an alternative. The better option of intubation in this patient is orotracheal intubation. The ideal management in this patient is cricothyroidotomy. Since that is not mentioned in the question intubation in the next best option. 'Orotracheal intubation would be preferred over nasotracheal intubation in these cases'",B

A congenital hydrocele is treated by?,No treatment before 5 years,Herniorraphy,Herniotomy,Eversion of sac,"'Congenital hydrocele will resolve spontaneously within 1 year. The operation is required only when it persists for longer than 1 year” In congenital hydrocele, the processes vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Ascites should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.
'Congenital hydroceles are treated by herniotomy if they do not resolve spontaneously” Treatment usually, no treatment of congenital hydrocele is indicated because this condition typically resolves spontaneously by age 1. Most surgeons advocate observation in the majority of infants less than 12 months. Others may continue to be observed for longer, as the majority of patent processes vaginalis will close within the first 12-24 months of life",C

Which of the following is the best way of preventing development deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postoperative period?,Early ambulation,Physiotherapy,Prophylactic heparin,Low dose aspirin,"Deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a well-known and, when complicated by pulmonary embolus, potentially fatal complication of surgery. All hospitals must have a process for screening all surgical patients to identify those at risk and for implementing prophylactic measures. There is international agreement on risk and therapeutic options. Methods of prevention are guided by the risk score and include the use of compression stockings, calf pumps and pharmacological agents, such as low molecular weight heparin. The symptoms and signs of DVT include calf pain, swelling, warmth, redness and engorged veins. However, most will show no physical signs. On palpation the muscle may be tender and there may be a positive Homans' sign (calf pain on dorsiflexion of the foot), but this test is neither sensitive nor specific. Duplex Doppler ultrasound and venography can be used to assess flow and the presence of a thrombosis. Other investigations include D-dimer. If a significant DVT is found (one that extends above the knee), treatment with parenteralanticoagulation initially, followed by longer-term warfarin or new oral anticoagulant. In some patients with a large DVT, a caval filter may be required to decrease the possibility of pulmonary embolism. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 296",C

A 40 yr old patient of pelvic injury presents with stricture bulbar urethra of 1.5 cm length. What would be the management?,Urethral dilatation,Excision and end to end urethroplasty,Patch graft urethroplasty,Urethrotomy,"Anastomotic urethroplasty is the procedure of choice in the totally obliterated bulbar urethra after a straddle injury. The typical scar is 1.5 to 2 cm long and should be completely excised. The proximal and distal urethra can be mobilized for a tension-free, end-to-end anastomosis. This is a highly successful procedure in more than 95% of cases. Endoscopic incision (urethrotomy) through the scar tissue of an obliterated urethra is a hopeless procedure and uniformly fails. Paial urethral narrowing can initially be treated by endoscopic incision with higher success. It is now recognized that repeated urethrotomy and dilation is neither clinically effective nor cost-effective for the treatment of urethral strictures. Fuher, patients who have had repeated endoscopic procedures are also more likely to require complex reconstructive procedures such as grafts' -- Campbell's Urology 'Urethroplasty should be considered when the stricture has arisen following trauma, and when a stricture has recurred following endoscopic treatment.

Steroid is injurious to wound when given,On 1st day,< 2 weeks,2-4 weeks,>4 weeks,"Wound healing is delayed in patients who are malnourished, or have vitamin A and C deficiency. Steroids also inhibit the adequate healing of wounds as they inhibit protein synthesis and fibroblast proliferation. Poorly-controlled diabetes delays wound healing and increases the risk of infection at the surgical site. Wound Healing This is variously described as taking place in three or four phases, the most commonly agreed being: the inflammatory phase; the proliferative phase; the remodelling phase (maturing phase). Occasionally, a haemostatic phase is referred to as occurring before the inflammatory phase, or a destructive phase following inflammation consisting of the cellular cleansing of the wound by macrophages The inflammatory phase begins immediately after wounding and lasts 2-3 days. Bleeding is followed by vasoconstriction and thrombus formation to limit blood loss. Platelets stick to the damaged endothelial lining of vessels, releasing adenosine diphosphate (ADP), which causes thrombocytic aggregates to fill the wound. When bleeding stops, the platelets then release several cytokines from their alpha granules. These are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), platelet factor IV and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb). These attract inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and macrophages. Platelets and the local injured tissue release vasoactive amines, such as histamine, serotonin and prostaglandins, which increase vascular permeability, thereby aiding infiltration of these inflammatory cells. Macrophages remove devitalised tissue and microorganisms while regulating fibroblast activity in the proliferative phase of healing. The initial framework for structural suppo of cells is provided by fibrin produced by fibrinogen. A more historical (Latin) description of this phase is described in four words: rubor (redness), tumor (swelling), calor (heat) and dolor (pain). The proliferative phase lasts from the third day to the third week, consisting mainly of fibroblast activity with the production of collagen and ground substance (glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans), the growth of new blood vessels as capillary loops (angioneogenesis) and the re-epithelialisation of the wound surface. Fibroblasts require vitamin C to produce collagen. The wound tissue formed in the early pa of this phase is called granulation tissue. In the latter pa of this phase, there is an increase in the tensile strength of the wound due to increased collagen, which is at first deposited in a random fashion and consists of type III collagen. This proliferative phase with its increase of collagen deposition is associated with wound contraction, which can considerably reduce the surface area of a wound over the first 3 weeks of healing. The remodelling phase is characterised by maturation of collagen (type I replacing type III until a ratio of 4:1 is achieved). There is a realignment of collagen fibres along the lines of tension, decreased wound vascularity, and wound contraction due to fibroblast and myofibroblast activity. This maturation of collagen leads to increased tensile strength in the wound which is maximal at the 12th week post injury and represents approximately 80% of the uninjured skin strength.

Most likely cause of this patient's enuresis is",Glycosuria from under-insulinization overnight,Stress of chronic disease,Urinary tract infection,Somogayi phenomenon,"The development of enuresis in this child not previously enuretic is most likely related to hyperglycemia and resultant increased urine volume due' to osmotic diuresis. During the day, this may present as increased frequency of urination (polyuria). At night, in some children, it presents as bedwetting (enuresis). Most children require a split-dose (every 12 hours) of insulin to maintain good glycemic control. Emotional stress of chronic disease is an unlikely cause of enuresis. A urinary tract infection typically presents as other signs and symptoms, such as unexplained fever and abdominal complaints. If an evening dosage of insulin is too high, hypoglycemia (without obvious signs or symptoms) may occur during sleep, resulting in the release of counter regulatory hormones and an elevated blood sugar in the morning. These events, termed the Somogyi phenomenon, are unlikely to cause enuresis. Hypoglycemia may be associated with early morning lethargy, pallor, sweating, and a seizure. Enuresis is not a feature.",A
Vasopressor of choice in hypotension produced during sub-arachnoidblock,Ephedrine,Mephenteramine,Adrenaline,Dopamine,"A i.e. Ephedrine Most common complication of spinal anesthesia is hypotensionQ, which can be prevented by preloading with crystalloid. In spinal anesthesia autonomic preganglionic sympathetic fibresQ are the earliest blocked fibres. Block of sympathetic nerves causes vasodialation of venous capacitance vessels, pooling of blood and HypotensionQ (most common complication of spinal anesthesiaQ). It is prevented by preloading with crystalloid. Following spinal subarachnoid block most common complication is hypotensionQ. During sub-arachnoid block, there is sympathetic blockade producing decreased venous return & hence, cardiac output and BP falls. So the patient can be managed by all the four means but the least effective & most controversial mean is lowering head end. The specific gravity (baricity) of CSF is 1.003 - 1.008Q at 37degC. A hyper baric solution of LA is denser than CSF & hypobaric solution of LA is Lighter than CSF. A LA solution can be made hyperbaric by adding glucose & hypobaric by addition of sterile water. Most impoant factors affecting level of spinal anesthesia are: BaricityQ, Position of patient - during & immediately after injection,Q drug dose & site of injection. Thus with a head down position a hyperbaric solution spreads cephald & hypobaric solution moves caudad and vice versa. And in this Q baricity of LA & time passed after injecting spinal anesthesia is not mentioned, so lowering the head end is weakest option.",A

"Sho acting anesthetic agent used for day care surgery is: September 2005, 2010",Diazepam,Ketamine,Propofol,Sevoflurane,"Ans.: C: Propofol Propofol is a sho-acting, intravenously administered hypnotic agent. Its uses include the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia, sedation for mechanically ventilated adults, and procedural sedation. Propofol is unrelated to barbiturates, and has largely replaced sodium thiopental (Pentothal) for induction of anaesthesia because recovery from propofol is more rapid and 'clear' when compared with thiopental. Propofol is not considered an analgesic, so opioids such as fentanyl may be combined with propofol to allete pain and it is the agent of choice for total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is used to produce sedation in ICU. It is the agent of choice for induction in susceptible individuals for malignant hypehermia.

Which of the following substances is not used as an irrigant during transurethral resection of the prostate?,Normal Saline,1.5% Glycine,5% Dextrose,Distilled Water,"Ans. is (a) i.e. Normal Saline 'TUR is performed with a nonhemolytic fluid such as 1.5% glycine. Saline cannot be used because electrolytes in the irrigation fluid will dissipate the electric current used to resect the prostate.' - Schwaz 8/e p1530 (not given in 9/e) During transurethral resection of prostate strips of tissue are cut from the bladder neck down to the level of veru mon tan um. This cutting is performed by a loop mounted on the hand held trigger of the resectoscope in which Diathermy current is being passed. We all know that normal saline is a very good conductor of electricity (as it contain ions - Na+ & CI ions). So if it is used while performing TURF, the diathermy current used in the procedure will cause electrolyte diassociation of normal saline and the current will not be localized in the loop and hence cutting of the tissue will not be proper. You can put up a question that the same can occur with the use of distilled water too. Distilled water can also conduct electricity-but the current used during TURP is not very strong and distilled water is not as good conductor of electricity as Normal saline. (You must be aware that distilled water is a worse conductor of electricity than normal water.) There were also arguments that distilled water causes fluid overload and therefore should not be used in TURP. True, distilled water causes fluid overload or TURP syndrome but this complication is not common Distilled water is being replaced by 1.5% glycine but still can be used for TURP (and is used in many centres when glycine is not available) Do not get confused by what is written in Bailey 241' /e p. 1377, 1378 (23/e, p1245, 1246) - If you go through it carefully, you will find that Bailey states that normal saline is used after the operation i.e. it is used for post operative irrigation.",A

Differentiating features between sepsis and trauma are,Energy requirement,Catabolism,Insulin resistance,Fluid loss,"Patients compensate for volume loss in the early stages of hypovolaemia, so an apparently resuscitated patient may still have a significant volume deficit. The aim for immediate resuscitation should he normal measures of pulse, blood pressure and CVP, urine output > 0.5 mI/kg/hour with normal urinary osmolality and sodium concentration. Any metabolic acidosis should be seen to be correcting. There-after, one must try to maintain normovolaemia. This is a continuous process. Critically ill patients may have capillary leak and will therefore have a continuing colloid requirement. Gelatins, being small molecules, are poorly retained and can be replaced by hydroxyethyl starch, plasma or blood at this stage. In sepsis this requirement may be very large . The impoance of blood in immediate resuscitation, the threshold at which one should transfuse urgently (i.e. con-sider using group compatible, uncross-matched blood or even Group 0 blood) and even the target haemoglobin level are controversial. Resuscitation should not be delayed whilst waiting for blood to be grouped; if acute anaemia is secondary to the bleeding resuscitation should be with Group 0 blood or group-compatible blood as it becomes available.

"Gene for the ryanodine receptor, mutation in which is responsible for malignant hypehermia is located on which chromosome-",Chromosome 19,Chromosome 17,Chromosome 18,Chromosome 16,"Malignant hypehermia is a genetic(autosomal dominant) hypermetabolic muscle disease. Malignant hypehermia is a genetic disorder; there is a defect in the gene that codes for the protein ryanodine receptor (RyR) in skeletal muscle. Ryanodine receptor is a Ca2+-release channel present in the membrane of L-tubule of skeletal muscle. When it couples with dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)from T Tubules , there is release of Ca2+ into the sarcoplasm, initiating muscle contraction.So Increased Ca++ transpo L-type calcium channels in T-tubules leads to malignant hypehermia DHPR is an L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?",Barium enema,Upper gastrointestinal series,Angiography,Ultrasonography,"In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival.

Five-year survival rates in excess of 20% may be expected following resection of pulmonary metastases if,Other organ metastases are present,Lung lesions are solitary,Local tumor recurrence is found,The tumor doubling time is less than 20 days,"Resection of metastases of lung, liver, and brain can result in occasional 5-year cures. In general, surgery should be undertaken only when the primary tumor is controlled, diffuse metastatic disease has been ruled out, and the affected patient's condition and the location of the metastasis permit safe resection. Five-year survival rates as high as 18% have been reported for selected patients with liver metastases from colorectal primary tumors. However, the best results have come from resection of pulmonary metastases, in which 5-year survival rates exceed those of resection for primary bronchogenic carcinoma. Autopsy reviews have demonstrated that many patients with pulmonary metastases have no other evidence of tumor, which suggests that resectional treatment may be justified even when the lung foci are not solitary. Selection of patients for pulmonary resections may be aided by measurement of tumor doubling times; patients with doubling times greater than 40 days appear to benefit most, while those with doubling times less than 20 days are not significantly helped.",B

Bone Metastasis is common in which thyroid tumor -,Follicular,Papillary,Huhle cell tumour,Anaplastic,"Ans is C ie.

'One subtype of Follicular Ca, the Huhle cell turner, tends to be more invasive, to metastasize frequently to bone, and to have an unourable clinical course.' - Harrison, I4/e, p2031 Also remember More about Huhle cell Ca Histopathologically Huhle cell Ca are dominated by cells with abundant, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm (Huhle cells). Huhle cells have this eosinophilic appearance because of an abundance of mitochondria in the cytoplasm. They differ from follicular carcinomas in that they are more often multifocal and bilateral (-- 30%) usually do not take up RAL are more likely to metastasize to local nodes and distant sites. and are associated with a higher moality rate. Management is similar to that of follicular neoplasm (explained ahead) with lobectomy and isthmectomy being sufficient for unilateral Huhle cell adenomas. when Huhle cell neoplasms are found to be invsive on intraoperative, frozen section or definitive paraffin section histology, the total thyroidectomy is performed. These patients should also undergo routine central neck node removal and modified radical neck dissection when lateral neck nodes are palpable (similar to patients with medullary carcinoma). Although RAI scanning and ablation usually are ineffective, they probably should be considered for ablation of any residual normal thyroid tissue and, occasionally, for ablation of tumors, because there is no other good therapy.",C

Which of the following can replace N2O as O2 carrier,Argon,Xenon,Helium,None.,"Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects.15,332 For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

"A female infant is born approximately 10 weeks prematurely (at 30 weeks) and weighs 1710 gm. She has respiratory distress syndrome and is treated with endogenous surfactant. She is intubated endotracheally with mechanical ventilation immediately after bih. Over the first 4 days after bih the ventilator pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen are reduced. Beginning on the fifth day after bih, she has brief desaturations that become more persistent.She needs increased ventilator and oxygen suppo on the seventh day after bih. She becomes cyanotic. Fuher examination, echocardiogram, and x-rays reveal left atrial enlargement, an enlarged pulmonary aery, increased pulmonary vasculature, and a continuous machine-like murmur. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Persistent foramen ovale,Patent ductus aeriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Pulmonary stenosis,"Patent ductus aeriosus.The presence of a murmur could be indicative of any of the conditions. The presence of a continuous machine-likemurmur is indicative of a patent ductus aeriosus (PDA). Usually, as in this case, the premature baby with PDA does not acutely become cyanotic and ill, although brief desaturations can occur that become more persistent. An atrial septal defect (ASD), such as a persistent foramen ovale, could be eliminated from the diagnosis because the murmur would be heard as an abnormal splitting of the second sound during expiration (answer a). A patent foramen ovale is a common echo finding in premature babies and is usually not followed up unless it appears remarkable to the pediatric cardiologist or there is a persistent murmur. A patent foramen ovale might result in only minimal or intermittent cyanosis during crying or straining to pass stool. A murmur caused by a ventricular septal defect (VSD, answer c), occurs between the first and second hea sounds (S1and S2) and is described as holosystolic (pansystolic) because the amplitude is high throughout systole. Pulmonary stenosis would be heard as a harsh systolic ejection murmur (answer d). PDA refers to the maintenance of the ductus aeriosus, a normal fetal structure. In the fetus, the ductus aeriosus allows blood to bypass the pulmonary circulation, since the lungs are not involved in CO2/O2exchange until after bih. The placenta subserves the function of gas exchange during fetal development. The ductus aeriosus shunts flow from the left pulmonary aery to the aoa. High oxygen levels after bih and the absence of prostaglandins from the placenta cause the ductus aeriosus to close in most cases within 24 hours. A PDA most often corrects itself within several months of bih, but may require infusion of indomethacin (a prostaglandin inhibitor) as a treatment, inseion of surgical plugs during catheterization, or actual surgical ligation.",B

Following a successful popliteal embolectomy, with restoration of palpable pedal pulses, the patient is still unable to dorsi- flex his toes. The next step in management should be",Electromyography (EMG),Measurement of anterior compartment pressure,Elevation of the left leg,Immediate fasciotomy,"This case illustrates two (among many) conditions that lead to the anterior compartment syndrome, namely, acute arterial occlusion without collateral inflow and rapid reperfusion of ischemic muscle. Treatment for a compartment syndrome is prompt fasciotomy Assessing a compartment syndrome and proceeding with fasciotomy are generally based on clinical judgment. Inability to dorsiflex the toes is a grave sign of anterior compartment ischemia. EMG studies and compartment pressure measurements would probably be abnormal but are unnecessary in view of the known findings and would delay treatment. Mere elevation of the leg would be an ineffective means of relieving compartment pressure, although elevation should accompany fasciotomy.

One is not the feature of obstructive jaundice ?,Pruritis,Elevated level of S.bilirubin,Raised alkaline phosphatase,Raised Urinary urobilinogen,"Ans is d ie Raised urinary urobilinogen Urobilinogen is produced by the action of ileal and colonic bacteria on conjugated bilirubin in the intestines. It is absorbed and excreted in bile and urine Thus any condition which decreases the bile excretion into intestine, decreases urinary urobilinogen Urinary urobilinogen is a useful tool for distinguishing possible causes of jaundice. Urinary urobilinogen is increased - when production of bilirubin is greatly increased (eg with hemolysis) - when the hepatic uptake and excretion of urobilinogen is impaired (eg in hepatocellular diseases) Urinary urobilinogen is decreased in ? - cholestasis or extrahepatic biliary obstruction (obstructive jaundice)",D

The plaques may be calcified.* The presence of the unyielding plaque tissue within the normally elastic wall of the corpus cavernosum causes the erect penis to bend, often dramatically, towards the side of the plaque.* The aetiology is uncertain but it may be a result of past trauma - there is an association with Dupuytren's contracture.* Disease may continue to progress or remit after 3-5 years.* When the deformity of the penis is causing distress, it may be possible to straighten it by placing non- absorbable sutures in the corpus cavernosum opposite the plaque. This reduces the elasticity in this region to balance that caused by the plaque (Nesbitt's operation).",A

Most common cause of painful defecation is associated with,Fissure in ano,Fistula in ano,External haemorrhoid,Internal haemorrhoid,"ANAL FISSURE Definition An anal fissure (synonym: fissure-in-ano) is a longitudinal split in the anoderm of the distal anal canal, which extends from the anal verge proximally towards, but not beyond, the dentate line. Clinical features Although simple epithelial splits, acute anal fissures are, because of their location involving the exquisitely sensitive anoderm, characterised by severe anal pain associated with defaecation, which usually resolves spontaneously after a variable time only to recur at the next evacuation, as well as the passage of fresh blood, normally noticed on the tissue after wiping. Chronic fissures are characterised by a hyperophied anal papilla internally and a sentinel tag externally (both consequent upon attempts at healing and breakdown), between which lies the slightly indurated anal ulcer overlying the fibres of the internal sphincter. When chronic, patients may also complain of itching secondary to irritation from the sentinel tag, discharge from the ulcer or discharge from an associated intersphincteric fistula, which has arisen through infection penetrating the fissure base. Although most sufferers are young adults, the condition can affect any age, from infants to the elderly. Men and women are affected equally. Anterior fissures account for about 10% of those encountered in women (and many of these may occur postpaum) but only 1% in men. A fissure sited elsewhere around the anal circumference or with atypical features should raise the suspicion of a specific aetiology, and the inability to be able to conduct an adequate examination in the clinic should prompt early examination under anaesthesia, with biopsy and culture to exclude Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related ulcers (syphilis, Chlamydia, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, HSV, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi's sarcoma, B-cell lymphoma) and squamous cell carcinoma.

The gold standard of labour analgesia is which of the following:-,Continuous lumbar epidural,IV opioid infusion,Continuous inhalational agent,Nerve block,"Continuous lumbar epidural analgesia is the most versatile and most commonly employed technique because it gives good analgesia in both the stages of labour. It is safe on mother and fetus. Continuous lumbar epidural analgesiais the most commonly used technique to produce labor analgesia as it can provide analgesia during the first stage of labor and also provide anesthesia for vaginal delivery or for cesarean section if necessary. For adequate pain relief, the sensory block ofT10-L1is required during thefirst stageof labor andS2-S4 (Pudendal nerve block) is required during thesecond stage.

True about ranula,Retention cyst,Arises from submandibular gland,Incision and drainage is treatment of choice,Can resolve spontaneously,"The term 'ranula' is applied to a mucous extravasation cyst that arises from the sublingual gland.It produces a characteristic translucent swelling that takes on the appearance of a 'frog's belly' (ranula). A ranula can resolve spontaneously, but many also require active treatment. The traditional and effective way is to remove the sublingual gland. Incision and drainage, however tempting, usually results in recurrence.Plunging ranula is a rare form of mucous retention cyst that arises from the sublingual salivary glands. Mucus collects below the gland and perforates through the mylohyoid muscle diaphragm to enter the neck.

Stage 2 block (Phase II block) is seen with:,Suxamethonium,Isoflurane,Sevoflurane,Enflurane,"Ref: Miller Textbook of Anaesthesia. 6th edition.Explanation:Succinyl Choline - Mechanism of action1. Phase 1 block (depolarizing)Succinylcholine is the only clinically useful depolarizing blocking drug.Its neuromuscular effects are like those of acetylcholine except that succinylcholine produces a longer effect at the myoneural junction.Succinylcholine reacts with the nicotinic receptor to open the channel and cause depolarization of the motor end plate, and this in turn spreads to the adjacent membranes, causing contractions of muscle motor units.Because succinylcholine is not metabolized effectively at the synapse, the depolarized membranes remain depolarized and unresponsive to subsequent impulses (ie, in a state of depolarizing block).Furthermore, because excitation-contraction coupling requires end plate repolarization ('reprintmg') and repetitive firing to maintain muscle tension, a flaccid paralysis results.This so-called phase 1 (depolarizing) block is thus augmented, not reversed, by cholinesterase inhibitors.2. Phase II block (desensitizing)With continued exposure to succinylcholine, the initial end plate depolarization decreases and the membrane becomes repolarized.Despite this re polarization, the membrane cannot easily be depolarized again because it is desensitized.The mechanism for this desensitizing phase is unclear, but some evidence indicates that channel block may become more important than agonist action at the receptor in phase II of succinylcholine' s neuromuscular blocking action.Later in phase II. the characteristics of the blockade are nearly identical to those of a nondepolarizing block (ie, a nonsustained twitch response to a tetanic stimulus), with reversal by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",A

Both soft and hard palates are repaired. Ref: SRB's Manual of Surgery, 4th Edition, pg. no. 368,372",A
Least soluble anaesthetic agent is,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Halothane,Methoxyflurane,"Blood-gas paition coefficient, also known as Ostwald coefficient for blood-gas, is a term used in pharmacology to describe the solubility of inhaled general anesthetics in blood. The coefficient is defined as the ratio of the concentration in blood to the concentration in gas that is in contact with that blood when the paial pressure in both compaments is equal. Newer anesthetics (such as desflurane) typically have smaller blood-gas paition coefficients than older ones (such as ether); these are preferred because they lead to faster onset of anesthesia and faster emergence from anesthesia once application of the anesthetic is stopped. If an anesthetic has a high coefficient, then a large amount of it will have to be taken up in the body's blood before being passed on to the fatty (lipid) tissues of the brain where it can exe its effect.

Treatment of femoral artery aneurysm,Ultrasound guided compression of the neck of aneurysm,Thrombin injection,Bypass graft repair,All of the above,"Femoral and Popliteal artery aneurysms 

Femoral and Popliteal artery aneurysms constitute about 90% of peripheral aneurysms. Femoral 20% and Popliteal 70%.
The majority of these aneurysms are the degenerative type.
More common in men. Popliteal artery aneurysms are almost always seen in men (97%)
More than 50% are bilateral.
Large no. of patients have associated aortic aneurysms.
Like aortic aneurysms, they are silent until critically symptomatic. However, unlike aortic aneurysms, they rarely rupture. 
The presenting manifestations are due to peripheral embolization and thrombosis leading to distal limb ischemia.
Peripheral aneurysms rarely may also produce symptoms by compressing the local vein or nerve.

Imaging:

Duplex color ultrasound is inv of choice to confirm the diagnosis of peripheral aneurysms.

Treatment

Indications for treatment include
acute lower limb ischemia, or
transverse diameter greater 2 cm or
presence of mural thrombus.
Treatment consists of
open surgery with prosthetic interposition grafting for femoral aneurysms and saphenous vein grafting for popliteal aneurysms.
endovascular repair with stent grafts
Pseudoaneurysm of the femoral artery due to arterial punctures can be successfully treated using ultrasound-guided compression of the neck of the aneurysm with or without thrombosis of the aneurysm by thrombin injection",D

Most probable diagnosis would be Chronic pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis.Chronic Pyelonephritis* Insidious in onset, may present with clinical manifestations of acute recurrent pyelonephritis with back pain, fever, frequent pyuria, and bacteriuria.* Gross examination: Irregularly scarred kidney; if bilateral, the involvement is asymmetric.* Hallmark of chronic pyelonephritis: Coarse, discrete, corticomedullary scar overlying a dilated, blunted, or deformed calyx.* Most of the scars are in the upper and lower poles, consistent with the frequency of reflux in these sites.* Microscopic changes: Predominantly involve tubules and interstitium.* Dilated tubules with flattened epithelium may be Ailed with colloid casts (thyroidization).* Glomeruli may appear normal except for periglomerular fibrosis, but a variety of glomerular changes may be present, including ischemic fibrous obliteration as well as secondary changes related to hypertension.Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease* Gross Appearance: Kidneys are usually bilaterally enlarged and may achieve enormous sizes.* The external surface appears to be composed solely of a mass of cysts, up to 3 to 4 cm in diameter, with no intervening parenchyma.* Microscopic examination reveals functioning nephrons dispersed between the cysts.* The cysts may be filled with a clear, serous fluid or, more usually, with turbid, red to brown, sometimes hemorrhagic fluid.Renal Cell Carcinoma* Usually presents as a yellowish, spherical mass in one pole of the kidney.* In clear cell carcinoma, the growth pattern varies from solid to trabecular (cordlike) or tubular (resembling tubules). The tumor cells have a rounded or polygonal shape and abundant clear or granular cytoplasm; the latter on special stains contains glycogen and lipids.* Papillary carcinoma is composed of cuboidal or low columnar cells arranged in papillary formations. Psammoma bodies may be present. The stroma is usually scanty but highly vascularized.* Chromophobe renal carcinoma is made up of pale eosinophilic ceils, often with a perinuclear halo, arranged in solid sheets with a concentration of the largest cells around blood vessels.* Collecting duct carcinoma is a rare variant showing irregular channels lined by highly atypical epithelium with a hobnail pattern.* Sarcomatoid changes arise infrequently in all types of renal cell carcinoma and are a decidedly ominous feature of these tumors.Cystic Dysplastic Kidney* Dysplasia can be unilateral or bilateral and is almost always cystic.* Gross appearance: Kidney is usually enlarged, extremely irregular, and multicystic.* The cysts vary in size from microscopic structures to some that are several centimeters in diameter.* The characteristic histologic feature is the presence of islands of undifferentiated mesenchyme, often with cartilage, and immature collecting ducts.",A

Dukes classification is used for,Pancreas carcinoma,Gastric carcinoma,Urinary bladder carcinoma,Colo-rectal carcinoma,"Dukes' classification was originally described for rectal tumours but has been adopted for histopathological repoing of colon cancer as well. Dukes' classification for colon cancer is as follows: A: confined to the bowel wall; B: through the bowel wall but not involving the free peritoneal serosal surface; C: lymph nodes involved.Dukes himself never described a D stage, but this is often used to describe either advanced local disease or metastases to the liver.Dukes classified carcinoma of the rectum into three stages: A: The growth is limited to the rectal wall (15%); prognosis excellent. B: The growth is extended to the extrarectal tissues, but no metastasis to the regional lymph nodes (35%): prognosis reasonable. C: Secondary deposits in the regional lymph nodes (50%); prognosis is poor. These are subdivided into C1, in which the local pararectal lymph nodes alone are involved, and C2, in which the nodes accompanying the supplying blood vessels are implicated up to the point of division.A stage D is often included, which was not described by Dukes which signifies the presence of widespread metastases, usually hepatic.Reference : page 1180 and 1230 Bailey and Love's sho practice of surgery 25th edition",D

Which of the following is not an absolute contraindication for extraction of teeth is,Uncontrolled diabetes,Uncontrolled hypertension,Leukemia,Acute abscess with tooth,"Contraindications
Even if the tooth is indicated for removal, the presence of certain factors makes the tooth contraindicated for extraction. They may be relative or absolute contraindications. They can be considered relative, if the contraindication is provided with additional care, one can overcome the complication. In other words, given the situation, the patient is made fit to undergo extraction, once the underlying condition is treated.
On the contrary, there are a few conditions which are absolute contraindications. These factors will be the impediments for extraction, even if care is taken. If extraction is carried out in the presence of such absolute contraindications, the outcome may be even fatal. Hence, it is essential to differentiate between these two types of contraindications. To avoid legal consequences, it is preferable to avoid extraction, if the contraindication is absolute.
The contraindications may also be classified as systemic or local factors. The presence of absolute systemic contraindications indicates that this group of diseases exists in an uncontrolled state. No attempt should be made by the dental surgeon to thrust extraction on such patients. By doing so the clinician will be inviting disaster, e.g.

metabolic disorders like uncontrolled diabetes,
uncontrolled cardiac problems,
leukemia,
renal failure and
liver disorders like cirrhosis of liver.

Local contraindications: The most common local contraindication is an ongoing acute inflammatory or infectious process. The acute infection/inflammation should first be treated before proceeding with the extraction, depending on the location of the acute process. Extraction of a third lower molar during an ongoing acute pericoronitis could lead to a lifethreatening postoperative infection. However, there are also situations where an acute abscess is best drained by extraction of the tooth even in an acute phase. An acute infectious process caused by pulpal disease is resolved most quickly by extraction of the tooth. Therefore an acute infectious and inflammatory process should not be considered as an absolute contraindication for extraction",D

Bailey and Love 26th/pg. 973; Fig. 61.6)Diffuse (generalised) peritonitis# Diffuse (generalised) peritonitis may present in differing ways dependent on the duration of infection.# Early- Abdominal pain is severe and made worse by moving or breathing.- It is first experienced at the site of the original lesion and spreads outwards from this point. Vomiting may occur. The patient usually lies still. Tenderness and rigidity on palpation are found typically when the peritonitis affects the anterior abdominal wall. Abdominal tenderness and rigidity are diminished or absent if the anterior wall is unaffected, as in pelvic peritonitis or, rarely, peritonitis in the lesser sac. Patients with pelvic peritonitis may complain of urinary symptoms; they are tender on rectal or vaginal examination. Infrequent bowel sounds may still be heard for a few hours but they cease with the onset of paralytic ileus.- The pulse rises progressively but, if the peritoneum is deluged with irritant fluid, there is a sudden rise. The temperature changes are variable and can be subnormal.# Late- If resolution or localisation of generalised peritonitis does not occur, the abdomen remains silent and increasingly distends.- Circulatory failure ensues, with cold, clammy extremities, sunken eyes, dry tongue, thready (irregular) pulse and drawn and anxious face (Hippocratic facies).

Bascom technique is employed in surgery of,Rectal prolapse,Anal incontinence,Pilonidal sinus,Fistula- in- ano,"Pilonidal sinus(Jeep bootom or Driver's bottom) is epithelium lined tract, situated sho distance behind the anus, containing hairs and unhealthy diseased granula- tion tissue. It is due to penetration of hairs through the skin into subcutaneous tissue; occurs in sacral region between the buttocks, umbilicus, axilla. Bascom technique of excision through lateral approach is a good method of treatment. Through small lateral incision or multiple small lateral incisions 2-4 mm sized sinus is approached and pus is drained; hairs are removed with only minimal excision of sinus. Cavity walls are not excised. Lateral small wounds are either sutured or left open for spontaneous healing. Reference : page 968 SRB's manual of surgery 5th edition",C

All of the following investigations are used in FIGO staging of carcinoma cervix except ?,CECT,Intravenous pyelography,Cystoscopy,Proctoscopy,"CECT According to the FIGO guidlines for clinical staging of cervical carcinoma, diagnostic studies include :-Intravenous urography (pyelography). - Cystoscopic examination of bladder and urethra Proctosigmoidoscopic study - Barium enema Colposcopic study of the vagina and vaginal formices in early stage disease. Colposcopic findings may be used for assigning a stage to the tumour for instance FIGO stage HA. - Chest radiograph and electrocardiographic studies are used to determine cardiopulmonary disease paicularly in oder patients. Pulmonary function studies can be impoant especially for evaluating patients who are candidates for extensive surgery. Remember CT scan, MRI lymphangiography and PET scan may offer information helpful for treatment planning but these findings do not change the FIGO stage of the disease. Pelvic examinations and clinical staging as defined by FIGO cannot detect metastasis such as paraaoic lymph node metastasis. Consequently there is growing body of literature showing the superiority of cross-sectional imaging computed Tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over clinical staging in delineating the extent of the disease in patient with cervical cancer. The official FIGO guidelines do not incorporate the use of either CT or MRI findings into the staging of cervical cancer. This is due to the FIGO guideline that staging methods should be universally available so that staging can be standardized means of communication between different institutions wordwide.",A

Most common cause of urethral stricture is,Trauma,Infection,Congenital,Post endoscopy,"Urethral stricture CAUSES The common causes of urethral stricture are: * Inflammatory * Secondary to urethritis * Secondary to balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) * Traumatic (MC) * Bulbar urethral injury * Pelvic fracture urethral disruption injury * Iatrogenic * Secondary to urethral instrumentation including cath- eterisation and transurethral prostatectomy * Secondary to radical prostatectomy * Secondary to radiotherapy for prostate cancer * Idiopathic CLINICAL FEATURES Symptoms are usually hesitancy of micturition, straining to void and a poor urinary stream. The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1482",A
The most common complication of ERCP,Acute pancreatitis,Acute Cholangitis,Duodenal perforation,Acute cholecystitis,"ERCP carries additional risks. Pancreatitis occurs in about 5% of patients undergoing ERCP and is seen in up to 25% of patients with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Young anicteric patients with normal ducts are at increased risk.

Appropriate management should include which of the following?",Urgent upper gastrointestinal contrast study to delineate site of bleeding,Immediate selective aeriography the left gastric aery to diagnose and treat presumed stress ulceration,Urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy to diagnosis the cause of bleeding,Urgent intravenous infusion of vasopressin at 0.2-0.4 IU/min,"Patients who have sustained a major thermal burn of 35% or more of their body surface area are at a predictably high risk for the development of gastric erosions and hemorrhage. Endoscopy has demonstrated that gastric erosions are present in 93% of these patients, whereas the occurrence of severe acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in severely burned patients ranges between 25% to 50%. At least 60% of patients at risk develop stress erosions within 1 to 2 days after the precipitating event. Painless upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be the only clinical sign. The onset of hemorrhage is often delayed, usually occurring 3 to 10 days after the onset of the primary disease. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is the diagnostic modality of choice to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate stress erosion from other sources of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Correct identification of the bleeding source is made in greater than 90% of instances. If endoscopy is not diagnostic, visceral angiography through selective catheterization of the left gastric or splenic vessels may provide information regarding the primary vessel supplying the bleeding site. In contrast, barium examinations are usually of little value, due to the superficial nature of stress erosions, and in fact may be detrimental by interfering with the interpretation of subsequent aeriography.",C

"All of the following cause myocardial depression, except",Halothane,Propofol,Etomidate,Ketamine,"The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. The minimal effect of etomidate on cardiovascular function sets it apa from other rapid-onset anesthetics. Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. In patients receiving etomidate during induction of anesthesia, more hypeension and tachycardia occur after etomidate compared with propofol. The myocardial oxygen supply-to-demand ratio is well maintained. Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate lacks analgesic efficacy, however, and must be combined with an opiate to prevent hemodynamic peurbations during laryngoscopy and intubation. In the setting of hemorrhagic shock, etomidate has advantages for the induction of anesthesia. In contrast to other drugs, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of etomidate were minimally altered in a pig model of hemorrhagic shock.

A 54 year old woman presents with complaints of abdominal fullness and early satiety. She denies a change in bowel habits and says that constipation is her normal state. A radiographic bowel series shows an 'apple core' lesion in her sigmoid colon. Which of the following markers is expected to be elevated in this patient?,Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),actate dehydrogenase (LDH),"CEA is a glycoprotein (200,000 daltons) that is found in the gastrointestinal mucosal cells and pancreatobiliary system secretions. It becomes elevated when breaks in the mucosal basement membrane occur due to tumor growth. Some other conditions can also cause elevations of CEA (e.g., cirrhosis, pancreatitis). The patient described above has colonic carcinoma, and the 'apple core' lesion is the classic radiographic finding of this tumor. Although CEA is not used for screening because of the large number of false positives, it can be used to guide treatment in known cases. It returns to normal levels 30-45 days after tumor resection. If it begins to rise again, tumor recurrence is likely. AFP, or alpha-fetoprotein, is an alpha globulin (70,000 daltons) made by the liver and yolk sac of the human fetus. It is elevated with hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell neoplasms. It is not paicularly specific. hCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, is a glycoprotein secreted by trophoblastic epithelium of the placenta. It is useful (sensitive and specific) for germ cell tumors of the testis and ovary.

They are generally divided into two types: (1) simple or capillary lymphangioma and (2) cavernous lymphangioma or cystic hygroma. They are thought to represent isolated and sequestered segments of the lymphatic system that retain the ability to produce lymph. As the volume of lymph inside the cystic tumor increases, they grow larger within the surrounding tissues. Most of these benign tumors are present at bih, and 90% of them can be identified by the end of the first year of life. The cavernous lymphangioma almost invariably occur in the neck or the axilla and rarely in the retroperitoneum. The simple capillary lymphangioma also tend to occur subcutaneously in the head and neck region as well as the axilla. Rarely, however, they can be found in the trunk within the internal organs or the connective tissue in and around the abdominal or thoracic cavities. The treatment of lymphangioma is surgical excision, taking care to preserve all normal surrounding infiltrated structures. Lymphangiosarcoma is a rare tumor that develops as a complication of long-standing (usually more than 10 years) lymphedema. Clinically, patients present with acute worsening of the edema and appearance of subcutaneous nodules that have a propensity toward hemorrhage and ulceration. The tumor can be treated, as other sarcomas, with preoperative chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgical excision, which usually takes the form of radical amputation. Overall, the tumor has a poor prognosis",C

Sevoflurane is used in N2O+O2 gas mixture. Halothane is second choice inhalational agent for induction. Isoflurane and desflurane are not used for induction as they are more pungent and associated with more coughing 8c laryngospasm.Intravenous induction* Intravenous induction is preferred when induction by mask is contraindicated i.e., in full stomach patients or of child comes in the operation theatre with IV line in situ.* Thiopentol or propofol are commonly used agents. Propofol is particularly suitable for out patient surgery. Ketamine is preferred in children with hypovolemia. Etomidate can be used in child with unstable cardiovascular status as it is most cardio-vascular stable intravenous inducing agent.Maintenance* As sevoflurane cause emergence delirium and agitation, it is not used for maintenance. After induction with sevoflurane anaesthesia, isoflurane or Halothane are used for maintenance anaesthesia. During maintenance, anaesthetic gas mixture contain N2O+O2 +Halothane or isoflurane. Halothane is commonly used for induction and maintenance in children.* If sevoflurane is continued for maintenance, administration of an opioid (Fentanyl) 15-20 min before the end of the procedure can reduce the incidence of emergence delirium and agitation.Muscle relaxantsDepolarizing blockers* Children are more susceptible to cardiac arrhythmia, Hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis after administration of succinylcholine. If a child unexpectedly experiences cardiac arrest following administration of sucinylcholine, immediate treatment for hyperkalemia should be instituted. For this reason, succinylcholine is best avoided for routine elective surgery in children.* Generally accepted indications for succinylcholine are1) Rapid sequence induction, 2) Laryngospasm, and 3) Rapid muscle relaxation prior to intravenous access (e.g., regurgitation).* Profound bradycardia and sinus node arrest can develop in pediatric patients following first dose of succinyl choline, if given without pretreatment with atropine. Therefore, atropine must always be administered prior to succinylcholine in children.* Children with muscular dystrophy are more prone to develop hyperkalemia: Arrhythmia and cardiac arrest may occur - Should be avoided in such patients.Non-depolarizing muscle relaxants* Functional maturation of NM junction is not complete unti 12 months of age, therefore new born sarevery sensitive to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants.* Kidney and liver functions are immature in neonate - Atracurium/cisatracurium is the muscle relaxant of choice in newborn as it does not require renal or hepatic elimination. For the same reason mivacurium can also be used.* In older children the choice of non-depolarizing muscle relaxant depends on the side effects, and onset & duration of action: -i) Mivacurium for procedures lasting 10-15 min.ii) Atracurium/cisatracurium for precedures lasting around 30 min.iii) Pancuronium when tachycardia is desired e.g., with fentanyliv) Vecuronium (fastest acting non-depolarizing NM blocker) for intubation in place of SCH.v) Atracurium/cisatracurium in patients with renal or hepatic disease.",A

After gynecologic surgeries, colorectal surgery is the most common cause of iatrogenic ureteral injuries. Intraoperatively, intravenous administration of methylene blue or indigocyanine green may facilitate identification of an injury. However, delay in diagnosis is common, and patients may present with flank pain, fevers, and signs of sepsis, ileus, or decreased urine output. CT scan may demonstrate hydronephrosis or a fluid collection (urinoma). Initial diagnosis and management should include urinalysis, although hematuria may not always be present; percutaneous nephrostomy tube or retrograde ureteral catheterization; percutaneous drainage of fluid collections; and identification of the location of ureteral injury. Surgical management should be delayed if diagnosis is late (10-14 days), and operative strategy is dependent on the location of the injury. Diagnostic imaging such as a pyelogram or nuclear medicine scan may be helpful to identify the site of the injury.",A

"All of the following are TRUE about cleft palate, EXCEPT:",Surgery should be done at 1 year,50% recover speech after operation,A/w hearing loss,A/w cleft lip in 45%,"Option 1 Cleft lip is repaired at 3 months, cleft palate by 12 months and alveolar bone grafting at 9 years which coincides with paial eruption of the canine teeth. Option 2 Satisfactory speech following surgical repair of cleft palate is achieved in 70-90% of cases. Significant speech defects usually require secondary operations when the child is older. The most widely used technique is the pharyngeal flap operation, in which the palatopharyngeal space is reduced by attaching a flap of posterior pharyngeal muscle and mucosa to the soft plate. This permits voluntary closure of the velopharyngeal complex and thus avoids hypernasal speech. Option 3 Eustachian tube dysfunction plays a central role in pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion in babies and children born with a cleft palate. It has been recently recognized that a child with craniofacial anomaly including cleft lip and palate is at the increased risk of sensorineural hearing deficit.

Staging The stages are assessed as follows: Stage I - Cancer has only affected the glans and/or foreskin. Stage II - Cancer has spread to the shaft of the penis. Stage III - Cancer has affected the penis and surrounding lymph nodes. Stage IV - Cancer has moved beyond the groin area to other pas of the body. Recurrent - Cancer that has returned after treatment. The most common treatment is one of five types of surgery: Wide local excision - The tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed Microsurgery - Surgery performed with a microscope is used to remove the tumor and as little healthy tissue as possible Laser surgery - laser light is used to burn or cut away cancerous cells Circumcision - cancerous foreskin is removed Amputation (penectomy) - a paial or total removal of the penis, and possibly the associated lymph nodes. This is the most common and effective treatment. Radiation therapy is usually used adjuvantly with surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence.

Charles Phillips procedure?,Small bowel atresia,Meconium ileus,Recurrent small bowel obstruction,Sigmoid volvulus,"Ans. C. Recurrent small bowel obstruction. (Ref LB 25th pg. 1198)Rx of acute intestinal obstruction# GI drainage# Fluid and electrolyte replacement# Relief of obstruction# Surgical Rx is necessary for most cases of intestinal obstruction but should be delayed until resuscitation is complete, provided there is no sign of strangulation or evidence of closed-loop obstruction.Indications for early surgical intervention# Obstructed or strangulated external hernia# Internal intestinal strangulation# Acute obstructionRX OF RECURRENT INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION DUE TO ADHESIONSSeveral procedures may be considered in the presence of recurrent obstruction, including:# Repeat adhesiolysis (enterolysis) alone;# Noble's plication operation;# Charles Phillipss transmesenteric plication;# intestinal intubation.Their relative efficacy remains unclear.In Noble's intestinal plication all involved intestine is freed. Adjacent coils (average length 15-20 cm) are sutured with serosal sutures to form gentle curves. If only a proportion of the small bowel is plicated, the mesentery must be united to prevent internal hernias. This procedure is time-consuming, and associated with a high morbidity and recurrent symptoms.In the Charles-Phillips operation. following adhesiolysis, the bowel is placed in an orderly fashion and three long synthetic sutures are passed through the mesentery of the plicated bowel, each doubled hack upon itself and tied loosely. The stitch should pass a few centimetres from the bowel wall and not be adjacent to it. The resultant bowel should look like a packet of sausages. Results from this procedure are relatively good.Intraluminal tube insertion (Baker), via a Witzel jejunostomv or gastrostomy, may facilitate the formation of gentle curves. Most tubes have an inflatable balloon near the tip to facilitate placement within the caecum. This procedure is associated with a long postoperative ileus, and reports of outcome are conflicting.RX OF VOLVULUS:# May involve the small intestine, Caecum, or sigmoid colon; neonatal nidgut volvulus secondary to midgut malrotation is life-threatening.# The commonest spontaneous type in adult is sigmoid volvulus.# Sigmoid volvulus can be relieved by decompression per anum# Surgery is required to prevent or relieve ischemia.Rx of MECONIUM ILEUS# Uncomplicated meconium ileus may respond to Rx with hyperosmolar gastrografin enema; this draws fluid into the gut lumen and also has detergent properties, which help to liquefy the meconium.# Meconium ileus complicated by intestinal perforation, volvulus, or atresia, or unresponsive to enemas, demands surgery.# Various surgical procedures are used including intestinal resection and temporary stoma formation, resection and primary anastomosis, and, in uncomplicated cases, enterostomy and irrigation of the bowel.# The Bishop-Koop operation with its irrigating stoma is now only rarely used.Rx of INTESTINAL ATRESIA# In most cases of jejunal or ileal atresia, the distal end of the dilated proximal small bowel is resected and primary end- to-end anastomosis is possible.# Ocassionally, a temporary stoma is required before definitive repair.",C

Capecchi, Main J. Evans and Oliver Smithies for their discoveries of 'principles for introducing specific gene modifications in mice by the use of embryonic stem cells'. Summary This year's Nobel Laureates have made a series of ground breaking discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and DNA recombination in mammals. Their discoveries led to the creation of an immensely powerful technology referred to as gene targeting in mice. It is now being applied to viually all areas of biomedicine - from basic research to the development of new therapies. Gene targeting is often used to inactivate single genes. Such gene 'knockout' experiments have elucidated the roles of numerous genes in embryonic development, adult physiology, aging and disease. To date, more than ten thousand mouse genes (approximately half of the gene in the mammalian genome) have been knocked out. Ongoing international effos will make 'knockout mice' for all genes available within the near future. With gene targeting it is now possible to produce almost any type of DNA modification in the mouse genome, allowing scientists to establish the roles of individual genes in health and disease. Gene targeting has already produced more than five hundred different mouse models of human disorders, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer.",B

When the pretest probability of gastrinoma is high, the sensitivity and specificity of this modality approach 100%. Gastrinoma cells contain type II somatostatin receptors that bind the indium-labeled somatostatin analogue (octreotide) with high affinity, making imaging with a gamma camera possible. Currently, angiographic localization studies are in frequently performed for gastrinoma.",C

Neck of the sac of femoral hernia lies,Above and medial to pubic tubercle,Below and lateral to pubic tubercle,At saphenous opening,At the level of inguinal ligament,"Ans. b (Below and lateral to pubic tubercle) (Ref. Bailey and Love 25lh/pg. 971).FEMORAL HERNIA# A femoral hernia occurs through the femoral canal that is bounded superiorly by the iliopubic tract, inferiorly by Cooper's ligament, laterally by the femoral vein, and medially by the junction of the iliopubic tract and Cooper's ligament (lacunar ligament).# A femoral hernia produces a mass or bulge below the inguinal ligament.# Femoral hernias are difficult to diagnose clinically because of their deep location in the femoral canal.- Laugier's is through the gap in the lacunar (Gimbemat's) ligament.- Narath's occurs only in patients with CDH and is due to lateral displacement of psoas muscle.# Account for 1% of all abdominal wall hernia# Female: male ratio is 4:1# Commonest in middle-aged and elderly women, more common in parous# Rare in children# Much less common than inguinal hernias but are as common as inguinal hernias in older women# They always remain below the inguinal ligament and lateral to the pebic tubercle and are more prone to incarceration and strangulation than inguinal hernias.# This type of hernia occurs more commonly in females and usually contains preperitoneal fat, omentum, and/or small bowel.# Clinically, saphena varix is its closest DD.Femoral hernia : Protrudes below inguinal ligament through femoral canal below and lateral to pubic tubercle.More common in women.Direct inguinal hernia: Protrudes through the internal (Hesselbach's) triangle. Bulges directly through abdominal wall medial to inferior epigastric artery. Goes through the external (superficial) inguinal ring only. Covered by transversalis fascia. Usually in older men.Indirect inguinal hernia: Goes through the INternal (deep) inguinal ring, external (superficial) inguinal ring, and Into the scrotum. Enters internal inguinal ring lateral to inferior epigastric artery. Occur in Infants owing to failure of processus vaginalis to close. Much more common in males.Management:# All uncomplicated femoral hernias should be repaired as an urgent elective procedure- A femoral hernia can be repaired using:# The standard Cooper's ligament repair,# A preperitoneal approach, or# A laparoscopic approach.# Three classical approaches to the femoral canal have been described:- Low (Lockwood).- Transinguinal (Lotheissen)- High (McEvedy)# Irrespective of approach used the following will be achieved:- Dissection of the sac- Reduction/inspection of the contents- Ligation of the sac- Approximation of the inguinal and pectineal ligaments",B
"A 43-year-old man presents with signs and symptoms of peritonitis in the right lower quadrant. The clinical impression and supportive data suggest acute appendicitis. At exploration, however, a tumor is found; frozen section suggests carcinoid features. For each tumor described, choose the most appropriate surgical procedure. A 2. 5-cm tumor at the base of the appendix (SELECT 1 PROCEDURE)",Appendectomy,Segmental ileal resection,Cecectomy,Right hemicolectomy,"Carcinoid tumors are most commonly found in the appendix and small bowel, where they may be multiple. They have a tendency to metastasize, which varies with the size of the tumor. Tumors <1 cm uncommonly metastasize. Tumors >2.0 cm are more often found to be metastatic. Metastasis to the liver and beyond may give rise to the carcinoid syndrome. The tumors cause an intense desmoplastic reaction. Spread into the serosal lymphatics does not imply metastatic disease; local resection is potentially curative. When metastatic lesions are found in the liver, they should be resected when technically feasible to limit the symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. When extensive hepatic metastases are found, the disease is not curable. Resection of the appendix and cecum may be performed to prevent an early intestinal obstruction by locally encroaching tumor.",D

Which of the following solution is a colloid:September 2007,Normal saline,Albumin,Ringer lactate,dextrose 5%,"Ans. B: AlbuminThere are two types of fluids that are used for intravenous drips; crystalloids and colloids.Crystalloids are aqueous solutions of mineral salts or other water-soluble molecules.Colloids contain larger insoluble molecules, such as albumin; blood itself is a colloid.Colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood, while, on the other hand, this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution.Another difference is that crystalloids generally are much cheaper than colloids.The most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which is close to the concentration in the blood (isotonic).Ringer's lactate or Ringer's acetate is another isotonic solution often used for large-volume fluid replacement.A solution of dextrose 5% in water, sometimes called D5W, is often used instead if the patient is at risk for having low blood sugar or high sodium.",B

A young man weighing 65 kg was admitted to the hospital with severe burns in a severe catabolic state. An individual in this state requires 40 kcal per kg body weight per day and 2 gms of protein/kg body weight/day. This young man was given a solution containing 20% glucose and 4.25% protein. If 3000 ml of solution is infused per day -,The patient would not be getting sufficient protein,The calories supplied would be inadequate,Both protein and calories would be adequate,Too much protein is being infused,"Let's see the amount of calories and proteins supplied by the infused solution.

First the calories

Note here that the calories are calculated by catabolism of glucose, not proteins. (Proteins are given for anabolic processes of the body, it's not meant for catabolic production of energy).
So calories are produced from 20% glucose in 3000 ml of solution.
Percentage of glucose in solution → 20%
Amount of glucose in 3000 ml → 3000 x 20/100 = 600 gms.
1 gm of Glucose on catabolism produces → 4.2 kcal.
600 gms of glucose would produce → 600 x 4.2 = 2520 kcal.

Now the amount of protein provided by the solution.

Percentage of protein in fluid 4.25%
Percentage of protein in 3000 ml of fluid → 3000 x (4.25/100)=127.5 gm

Now, let's find out the amount of calories and proteins required by the patient per day.

Calories required → 40 x 65 = 2600 Kcal
Amount of protein required → 2 x 65 = 130 gms",C
All are helpful for the diagnosis of CSF rhinorrhea except:,High glucose,High protein,Tram line,Beta transferrin,"Following trauma of the midface, CSF may emanate from a dural tear, resulting in rhinorrhea, otorrhea, or both. 
The  disruption  usually  occurs  lateral  to  the  cribriform plate but may also result from disruption of the sphenoidal,  ethmoidal,  and  frontal  sinuses  producing  a  dural tear and communication with the subarachnoid space.
Diagnosis of CSF leakage is often complicated by mixture with nasal secretions, lacrimal  secretions, and blood. Clear CSF should be collected in a vial, an absence of sediment and a glucose level of approximately 45 mg/dL is usually confirmatory. 
A more specific, albeit slower, laboratory examination is the CSF-specific beta-2 transferrin test.
CSF  will  also  form  concentric  rings  when poured on linen or soft filter paper. 
CSF has a more rapid diffusion than blood, leading to a larger, clearer CSF ring surrounding a sanguineous central ring. This is termed the double-ring or halo sign. When bleeding is present, one should suspect the presence of a CSF leak until proven otherwise. Once a provisional diagnosis is made, the patient should be placed in a semirecumbent position and instructed on how to minimize increases in intracranial pressure, including straining, sneezing and blowing of the nose.
Meningitis  is  a  potential  complication  of  skull  base fracture with a concomitant dural tear. The absence of leakage does not imply the absence of a tear.

Most common congenital anomaly of the face is: March 2009,Cleft lip alone,Isolated cleft palate,Cleft lip and cleft palate,All have equal incidence,"Ans. C: Cleft lip and cleft palate The typical distribution of cleft types is: Cleft lip alone-15% Isolated cleft palate-40% Cleft lip and cleft palate-45% Cleft lip alone (hare lip): It is due failure of fusion between the frontonasal (philtrum) and the maxillary processes. Types : - Unilateral 85% usually on the left side 75%, bilateral 15%. - Upper or lower: lower cleft lip is very rare and is due to failure of fusion between the mandibular processes. Complete or incomplete: according to whether it extends to the nostrils or not. - Simple or alveolar: if it involves the bony alveolus. - Complicated or not: If it is associated with cleft palate. Complications: - Disfigurement. - Difficult suckling if it is complicated. Treatment: - Timing of surgery for cleft lip alone: Unilateral-one operation at 5-6 months Bilateral-One operation at 4-5 months. - (Millard's operation- When the patient is 10 weeks old, Hb = 10 gm% and the weight is 10 pounds (rule of ten)). II. Isolated cleft palate: The palate is developed from - Premaxilla from the frontonasal process. - Two maxillary shelves: from the maxillary process Cleft palate occurs due to failure (total or paial) of fusion between the maxillary and frontonasal process or the 2 maxillary processes. Types : - Soft palate only, usually asymptomatic. - Intermaxillary : the cleft is only between the 2 maxillary shelves. - Bipaate : as intermaxillary but extends to one side of the premaxilla. Tripaate : as intermaxillary but extends to both sides of the premaxilla. Complications: - Impaired feeding due to: Difficult suckling. Wide pharynx : so the soft palate can't close the nasopharynx during swallowing leading to nasal regurgitation of food, leading to pharyngitis, rhinitis, otitis media and deafness. Difficult speech : specially consonant e.g. D, P, T, B, K, J. - Teeth malformation. Pierre Ribon syndrom : Cleft palate with receding lower jaw (micrognathia) and posterior displacement of the tongue which obstruct air way. - Malformed nose. Treatment : In cases of cleft palate alone, surgical correction is indicated Soft palate only-One operation at 6 months Soft and hard palate-Two operations. One for soft palate at 6 months and another for hard palate at 15-18 months. - In case of cleft lip and palate, surgical correction is done at; Unilateral- two operations-Cleft lip and soft palate at 5-6 months and hard palate and gum pad with or without lip revision at 15-18 months. Bilateral- two operations-Cleft lip and soft palate at 4-5 months and hard palate and gum pad with or without lip revision at 15-18 months.",C

"All of the following are the indications for PAIR treatment in hydatid cysts, EXCEPT:",Size > 5cm,Multiloculated,Cyst in lung,Recurrence after surgery,"Treatment of the hydatid cysts: The treatment of hydatid disease involve the use of oral anthelmintics such as albendazole. Albendazole therapy is the mainstay of treatment in the majority of patients with hydatid disease. It is given alone and for prolonged periods of time in patients who are poor candidates for cyst-directed interventions. However, liver-directed treatment is prefered. The treatment of hepatic cysts is primarily surgical.In General, most cysts are treated. Packing off of the abdomen is impoant because rupture can results in anaphylaxis and diffuse seeding. Usually the cyst is then aspirated through a closed suction system and flushed with a scolicidal agent such as hypeonic saline. The cyst is then unroofed, which can be followed by a number of possibilities, such as excision (or pericystectomy), marsupialization procedures, leaving the cysts open, draining of the cyst, omentoplasty, or paial hepatectomy to encompass the cyst. Total pericystectomy or formal paial hepatectomy can also be performed without entering the cysts. In patients with anatomically appropriate lesions, PAIR ( puncture,aspiration,injection, and reaspiration) is the preferred initial treatment. The efficacy of PAIR in managing hydatid cysts is greater than 75%. For patients whose disease is refractory to PAIR, laparoscopic or open complete cyst removal with instillation of a scolicidal agent generally is curative.

Which fibers are affected earliest in spinal anaesthesia?,Sensory,Motor,Sympathetic preganglionic,Vibration,"Local anaesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space blocks conduction of impulses along all nerves with which it comes in contact, although some nerves are more easily blocked than others. Stimulation of the motor nerves causes muscles to contract and when they are blocked, muscle paralysis results. Sensory nerves transmit sensations such as touch and pain to the spinal cord and from there to the brain, whilst autonomic nerves control the caliber of blood vessels, hea rate, gut contraction and other functions not under conscious control. Generally, autonomic and sensory fibres are blocked before motor fibres.",C

The treatment of hydrocele in children is :,Herniotomy,Eversion of sac,Herniorrhaphy,Drainage,"A hydrocele is fluid within the remnant processus vaginalis. It is characteristically an oblong, nontender soft mass. It may be around the testicle only (testicular hydrocele), extend up from the testicle into the inguinal region (inguino scrotal hydrocele), or be contained within a segment of the processus adjacent to the spermatic cord (hydrocele of the cord) or communicated with the peritoneal cavity (communicating hydrocele). In general, hydroceles that do not communicate with the peritoneal cavity are physiologic, and the vast majority resolve by 18 months of age. Those that persist after 1 year or those that demonstrate changes in size (communicating hydroceles) should be repaired by herniotomy. Ref :Albanese C.T., Sylvester K.G. (2010). Chapter 43.

Most common bone involved in haemangioma?,Femur,Tibia,Pelvis,Veebrae,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Veebrae Haemangioma This benign lesion, probably a hemaoma, is composed of vascular spaces lined by endothelial cells. They constitute 1-1.5% of all primary bone neoplasms. It has a peak incidence in the fifth decade (according to Maheshwari, young adults). About 50% of hemangiomas of bone occur in veebrae and are most commonly situated in lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions. Other common site of involvement (20%) is skull. Small bones of hands and feets may also be affected. Haemangioma of the veebra has a typical radiographic picture in the form of loss of horizontal striations and prominence of veebral striations. There is Polka dot appearance on CT. In the skull, hemangioma generally affects the calverium and is seen as an expansile lytic lesion which has a sunburst appearance with striation radiating from the centre. A hemangioma may be identified due to associated phlebolith and it may cause local gigantism of the invovled area. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as rare. Treatment is radiotherapy.",D

They are three to four times more frequent in women than men. The impoance of discrete swellings lies in the increased risk of neoplasia compared with other thyroid swellings. Some 15% of isolated swellings prove to be malignant, and an additional 3040% are follicular adenomas. The remainders are non-neoplastic. Isotope scan Isotope scanning used to be the mainstay of investigation of discrete thyroid swellings to determine the functional activity relative to the surrounding gland according to isotope uptake. On scanning, swellings are categorised as 'hot' (overactive), 'warm' (active) or 'cold' (underactive). About 80% of discrete swellings are cold. The risk of malignancy is higher in 'cold' lesions (20%) compared to 'hot' or 'warm' lesions (<5%). FNAC is the investigation of choice in discrete thyroid swellings. But it is unable to distinguish between follicular adenoma from carcinoma. Treatment Approximately 50% of these nodules decrease in size in response to the TSH suppression, and others may not continue to grow, but it is most effective for nodules <3 cm The main indication for operation is the risk of neoplasia.

Metacarpophalangeal joints are most commonly affected in: March 2005,Osteoahritis,Psoriatic ahritis,Rheumatoid ahritis,Rheumatic fever,"Ans. C: Rheumatoid Ahritis RA is characterized by diffuse cailage loss and erosion of bone and cailage. It stas in the synol membrane, with the initial processes of edema, neovascularization, and hyperplasia of the synol lining. Proliferation of synoviocytes and macrophages causes thickening of the synol lining and, together with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mast cells, develops into pannus. Pannus is a sheet of invasive cellular tissue that is continuous with the synol lining. As a result of the higher propoion of synoviocytes and macrophages, pannus causes erosion of bone and cailage at the margin of joints. In the hands, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and thumb interphalangeal (IP) joints are most frequently involved. The distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved only in the presence of a coexisting MCP or PIP disease. Tenosynovitis of the flexor tendons causes a reduction in finger flexion and grip strength. Nodular thickening in the tendon sheath may also produce a trigger finger. In osteoahritis and psoriatic ahritis, DIP is commonly involved.",C
Which of the structural domains of mammalian regulatory factors may be called intracellular receptors?,Response elements,Antirepressor domains,Transcription-activating domains,Ligand-binding domains,"Mammalian regulatory factors are much more diverse than those of bacteria, possessing several types of structural domains. Activators of transcription, such as steroid hormones, may enter the cell and bind to regulatory factors at specific sites called ligand-binding domains; these intracellular 'receptors' are analogous to G protein-linked membrane receptors that extend into the extracellular space. Response elements are not regulatory factors but DNA sequences near the transcription site for ceain types of genes (e.g., steroid-responsive and heat shock- responsive genes). Regulatory factors interact with specific DNA sequences through their DNA-binding domains, and with other regulatory factors through transcription-activating domains. Some regulatory factors have antirepressor domains that counteract the inhibitory effects of chromatin proteins (histones and nonhistones).",D

The most common site of spontaneous perforation is the left lateral wall of the distal oesophagus because of relative weakness of wall in this region' REF: The Esophagus byJoel E. Richter, Donald 0. Castell Page 759 Spontaneous rupture of the esophagus is associated with a high moality rate because of the delay in recognition and treatment. Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumothorax or pancreatitis. An elevated serum amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diagnosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.

Which of the following is true about hypothermia during anesthesia?,Beneficial to patients,Prevented by giving warm fluids,Body looses heat mainly by conduction,Always occur irrespective of the type of anesthesia,"Ans. b. Prevented by giving warm fluids Hypothermia during anesthesia can be prevented by giving warm fluids. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Mild hypothermia is extremely common during anesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Of these, radiation is most significant and accounts for --60% of total heat loss. Drug metabolism can be markedly decreased by hypothermia. Although hypothermia is generally regarded as deleterious, it can be beneficial in some situations. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degC to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops and those tissues that have high oxygen consumption normally, such as brain and hea, have a propoionally greater reduction of oxygen use. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. Warm fluids are probably of benefit only when large amounts are administered for fluid replacement.",B

Midazolam undergoes extensive oxidation by hepatic enzymes to form water-soluble hydroxylated metabolites, which are excreted in the urine. The hepatic clearance rate of midazolam is five times greater than lorazepam and 10 times greater than diazepam.

"A 17-year-old boy from Calcutta was playing football when he was tackled by another player. The opponent hit the lateral aspect of his knee. He presented to a hospital 1 week after the injury, complaining of swelling and pain in his right knee. On physical examination of his right knee, there is a large effusion. There is increased laxity (as compared to his uninjured knee) of his knee when his knee is passively placed in a valgus (abducted) position. In addition, there is significant anterior translation of his tibia with respect to his femur when his knee is tested at ninety degrees of flexion. Injury to which of the following structures most likely accounts for the increased laxity of his knee when his knee is passively placed in a valgus position?",Anterior cruciate ligament,Lateral collateral ligament,Medial collateral ligament,Patellar ligament,"The medial collateral ligament originates from the medial femoral epicondyle and inses on the medial proximal tibia. Its function is to prevent valgus instability of the knee. When a valgus stress is placed on the tibia, the medial collateral ligament is stressed and prevents displacement. The anterior cruciate ligament passes from the medial surface of the lateral femoral condyle to the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia. Its primary function is to prevent anterior translation of the tibia in reference to the femur (or posterior displacement of the femur in reference to the tibia). The lateral collateral ligament originates on the lateral femoral epicondyle and inses on the head of the fibula. It functions to prevent varus instability of the knee. When a varus stress (adduction) is placed on the tibia, the lateral collateral ligament becomes taut and prevents displacement. The patellar ligament runs from the inferior pole of the patella to the tibial tubercle, and is commonly referred to as the patellar tendon. However, this structure connects bone to bone, which is the definition of a ligament, not a tendon.",C

The condition occurs in known viral infections (herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus), following injections of tetanus toxoid, in putative viral infections; and as an autobnmune disorder following a surgical procedure.'- Basic neurology By John Gilroy 3/e p594 Brachial plexus neuritis usually is characterized by the acute onset of excruciating unilateral shoulder pain, followed by flaccid paralysis of shoulder and parascapular muscles several days later. The syndrome can vary greatly in presentation and nerve involvement. Brachial neuritis (BN) exists in an inherited and an idiopathic form. In the idiopathic version, the pathophysiology is unknown, but the condition is generally thought to be an immune system - mediated inflammatory reaction against nerve fibers of the brachial plexus. The onset of pain in brachial neuritis (BN) is often abrupt and may follow recent illness, surgery, immunization, or even trauma (see Causes, below). Up to two thirds of cases begin during the nighttime. Sensory abnormalities are of usually of less intensity than the pain and muscle weakness. Causes: The exact cause of brachial neuritis is unknown, but the condition has been linked to many antecedent events or illnesses, as follows: Viral infection (paicularly of the upper respiratory tract) Bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia, diphtheria, typhoid) Parasitic infestation S urgery 2 Trauma (not related to shoulder) Vaccinations (eg, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, peussis [DPT J. smallpox, swine flu) Childbih Miscellaneous medical investigative procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, administration of radiologic dye) Systemic illness (eg, polyaeritis nodosa, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, temporal aeritis, EhlersDanlos syndrome) A rarer, hereditary form of BN has been localized to the SEPT9 gene on chromosome arm 17q and should be considered a distinct disorder. This entity presents in a younger age group, and is characterized by recurrent, often bilateral attacks. Dysmorphic facial features (eg, hypotelorism, long nasal bridge, facial asymmetry) can also be present. Diagnosis: Other causes of severe pain, such as an acute herniated cervical disc, should be excluded. In brachial plexus neuritis, electromyography and nerve conduction studies reveal abnormalities in more than one nerve; in contrast, cervical radiculopathy may show osteophytes and interspace narrowing on cervical spine x-rays and neuroforaminal disc impingement of MRI. Treatment: of brachial plexus neuritis is suppoive, with analgesics for pain, physical therapy to maintain shoulder strength/mobility, and reassurance that the condition generally will improve, albeit slowly.",C

To enter a CD4 cell, HIV must first attach to a CD4 receptor, then attach to either the CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor, and finally fuse its membrane with the CD4 cell membrane. HIV is usually R5-tropic (uses CCR5) during the early stages of infection, but the virus may later switch to using either only CXCR4 (X4-tropic) or both CCR5 and CXCR4 (dual-tropic). An HIV drug called a CCR5 inhibitor blocks HIV from attaching to the CCR5 coreceptor, which prevents HIV entry into the CD4 cell. Ref:",B

"All of the following are true about Rheumatoid Ahritis, Except",PIP and DIP Joints involved equally,Pathology limited to aicular cailage,20 percent of patients have extra aicular manifestations,All,"Answer is A, B, C(PIP and DIP Joints involved Tally; Pathology Limited to aicular cailage; 20 percent have extra aicular manifestations) Women are affected 3 times more commonly than men Pathology is not limited to aicular cailage alone The majority of destruction occurs in juxtaposition to the inflamed synovium, or pannus, that spreads to cover the aicular cailage' The precise mechanism by which bone and cailage destruction occurs has not been completely resolved.

A 35-year-old construction worker presents with complaints of nocturnal parasthesias of the thumb and the index and middle fingers. There is some atrophy of the thenar eminence. Tinel sign is positive. The most likely diagnosis is,Carpal tunnel syndrome,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Rheumatoid ahritis of the wrist joint,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1984-1986.) Carpal tunnel syndrome results from median nerve entrapment and is usually due to excessive use of the wrist. The process has been associated with thickening of connective tissue as in acromegaly, or with deposition of amyloid. It also occurs in hypothyroidism, rheumatoid ahritis, and diabetes mellitus. As in this patient, numbness occurs in the distribution of the median nerve. Later in the process, atrophy of the abductor pollicis brevis becomes apparent. The Tinel sign (parasthesia induced in the median nerve distribution by a reflex hammer hitting on the volar aspect of the wrist) is very characteristic. De Quervain's tenosynovitis causes focal wrist pain on the radial aspect of the hand and is due to inflammation of the tendon sheath of the abductor pollicis longus. It should not produce a postive Tinel sign. Amylotrophic lateral sclerosis may present with distal muscle weakness that is diffuse and not focal. Diffuse atrophy and muscle fasiculations would be prominent. Rheumatoid ahritis would not produce these symptoms unless inflammation of the wrist was causing median nerve entrapment in the carpal tunnel.",A

"A 70 kg old athlete was posted for surgery, Patient was administered succinylcholine due to unavailability of vecuronium. It was administered in intermittent dosing (total 640 mg). During recovery patient was not able to respire spontaneously & move limbs. What is the explanation -",Pseudocholinesterase deficiency increasing action of syccinylcholine,Phase 2 blockade produced by succinylcholine,Undiagnosed muscular dystrophy and muscular weakness,Muscular weakness due to fasciculation produced by succinylcholine,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Phase 2 blockade produced succinylcholine Patients developing paralysis after prolonged and high dose of succinyl choline is highly suggestive of phase II succinyl choline block.Phase II block with succinylcholine occurs with prolonged and high dose of the drug.(High dose for Sch is 7-10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes of exposure is considered prolong).Morgan's Anaesthesia 4th/e p. 112The type of succinylcholine block may change into a non depolarizing block following prolonged administration of the drug (phase II block). Transition from a depolarizing to phase II block is gradual and usually occurs after administration of 7-10 mg/kg of succinylcholine. Recovery from a phase II block is much slower.Millers Anaesthesia 6th/e p. 985After administration of 7-10 mg/kg or 30-60 minutes of exposure to succinylcholine, non depolarizing dual or phase II block occursProlonged paralysis with succinylcholine administration may also occur in pseudocholinesterase deficiencyBut in pseudocholinesterase deficiency prolonged paralysis occurs with usual dose of succinylcholine.Succinylcholine is a noncompetitive muscle relaxantNormally muscles contract due to the action of acetylcholine released in the neuromuscular synaptic junctionsAcetylcholine acts by activating its receptors present on motor end plate, and generates action potentialCompetitive Neuromuscular blockers act by blocking the action of acetylcholine and prevents the generation of action potential.On the other hand succinylcholine acts by depolarization of the motor end plate i.e. it activates the acetylcholine receptor present at the motor end plate.At their first application voluntary muscle contracts but as they are not destroyed immediately like acetylcholine the depolarization persist. It might be expected that this prolonged depolarization would cause muscles to remain contracted but this is not so.With prolonged administration, a depolarization block changes to competitive block. Succinylcholine produces neuromuscular block by overstimulation so that the end plate is unable to respond to further stimulation.Neuromuscular block with succinylcholine occurs in two sequential phasesAn initial depolarization of the endplate produces muscle action potentials and fasciculations.Maintained depolarization past the threshold for firing produces Na+ channel inactivation so that muscle action potentials cannot be generated.This is called phase I or depolarization blockIn the continued presence of succinylcholine, the membrane becomes repolarized *Na+ channel inactivation is reversed and muscle membrane excitability is restoredNonetheless, the neuromuscular block persists because of desensitization of Acetylcholine receptorsThis is known as phase II or desensitization blockThe mechanism for phase II block is not completely understood, a series of allosteric transitions in Acetylcholine receptor is suspected.Succinylcholine phase I block changes to phase II block after prolonged administration of the drue usually following 7-10 mg/kg of the drug or 700 mg drug.Pseudocholinesterase deficiencySuccinylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma cholinesterase to succinylmonocholine which is pharmacologically inactive.In certain conditions metabolism of succinylcholine to the metabolically inactive succinylmonocholine cannot occur.These are : -Genetic determined inability to metabolize succinylcholineSmall proportion of patients have genetically determined inability to metabolize succinylcholine.In these patients either the plasma cholinesterase is absent or there is an abnormal form of the enzyme presentThe metabolism of succinylcholine is reduced and the patient have prolonged paralysis.An important point to note is that this prolonged paralysis occurs even with usual doses of succinylcholine.Other endogenous and exogenous causesPlasma cholinesterase activity can be reduced by a number of endogenous and exogenous causes such as : -PregnancyLiver diseaseUremiaMalnutritionBurnsPlasma pheresisOral contraceptivesThese conditions usually lead to a slight clinically unimportant increase in the duration of action of succinylcholine.",B

"A 58-yrs-old presents with increased 'fullness' in her neck. Examination finds non tender diffuse enlargement of her thyroid gland. Clinically she is euthyroid. Sections from her thyroid gland reveal numerous, mainly enlarged follicles, most of which are filled with abundant colloid material. There are areas of fibrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic degeneration. No papillary structures are identified and neither colloid scalloping nor Huhle cells are present. Most likely diagnosis is?",Colloid carcinoma,Diffuse toxic goiter,Graves disease,Multinodular goiter,"* Goiter is a general clinical term that is used to describe any enlargement of the thyroid. Most patients with goiter are euthyroid (nonfunctional goiter), as hypehyroidism (toxic goiter') is relatively rare, in the early stages of goiter formation, there is diffuse hyperplasia of the small thyroid follicles, which histologically resembles the changes of Graves disease. This early stage is called a diffuse nontoxic goiter or simple goiter. * The thyroid gland then undergoes repeated episodes of involution and hyperplasia. Over time this produces an enlarged multinodular goiter that histologically consists of multiple nodules, some of which consist of colloid-filled enlarged follicles and others of which show hyperplasia of small follicles lined by active epithelium. * There are also areas of fibrosis, hemorrhage, calcification, and cystic degeneration. The last stage of goiter formation consists of nodules composed primarily of enlarged colloid-filled follicles. This stage is called a colloid goiter. * In contrast to the histologiC appearance of multinodular or colloid goiter, diffuse toxic goiter (Graves' disease) is characterized by hyperplasia of the follicular cells with scalloping of colloid at the margin of follicles, while Hashimoto's thyroiditis has a marked Iymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles and scattered oxyphilic (Huhle) cells.",D

False about hydatid cyst of liver,Hepatic resection is never done,Laparoscopic aspiration of cyst is performed,Most commonly located in the right liver,Mostly asymptomatic,"Surgery is still the choice and gold standard therapy for hydatid disease. The abdomen is opened, and the peritoneal cavity is packed with mops . *Fluid from the cyst is aspirated and scolicidal agents(cetrimide, chlorohexidine, alcohol, hypeonic saline(15%-20%), 10% povidone-iodine or H2O2 ) are injected into the cyst cavity (formalin should not be used). Hypeonic saline should be left within the cavity for 15-20 minutes to have effective scolicidal effect. * Detection of cystobiliary communications is very crucial as it may cause caustic sclerosing cholangitis when scolicidal agent like formalin is used. Communicating openings may be single or multiple. Cyst more than 10 cm is likely to have cysto-biliary communications. * Laparoscopic pericystectomy is becoming more popular. Contraindications are a deeply situated cyst, densely adherent cyst, and inaccessible cysts; more than 3 cysts; calcified cysts and cysts in other organs. The main problem with laparoscopic pericystectomy is spillage and difficulty in preventing it. * Liver resection - only occasionally segmental or hemihepatectomy is done. ref: SRB&;S manual of surgery, ed 3, pg no 536",A

For pancreatic injury true is -,Most are iatrogenic,Blunt trauma most common,Urine amylase is diagnostic,HRCT is investigation of choice,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., HRCT is investigation of choice o Pancreas being a retroperitoneal structure, peritoneal lavage is not helpful in making the diagnosis of pancreatic injury.o CT scan is the best diagnostic procedure, apart from an exploratory' laprotomy.More about Pancreatic injuryo About two-thirds are due to penetrating injuries and rest one-third due to blunt trauma,o Pancreatic injuries are usually associated with injury to other visceral organ. Isolated pancreatic injuries are rare.o In blunt injuries which are usually the result of midline upper abdominal trauma (eg. car seat belt, cycle handle), junction of the neck and body of the pancreas are most commonly injured as they are pressed against the vertebral column.o Major abdominal vascular injuries are present in more than 75% of cases of penetrating trauma.'The presence of pancreatic duct injury appears to be a key factor in postoperative morbidity ' SabistonAlso knowo Serum amylase levels are elevated in most patients with significant pancreatic trauma, but they are also increased in up to 90% of severe abdominal trauma patients who do not have pancreatic injury. Thus measurement of amylase at the time of hospital admission is not helpful in identifying those with pancreatic injury. On the other hand a progressive rise in serum amylase activity is a more specific indicator of pancreatic injury.Treatmento The treatment of pancreatic injury depends on its grade and extent.Minor injuries not involving a major duct may be treated nonoperatively.Moderate injuries usually require operative exploration, debridement, and the placement of external drains.More severe injuries including those with major duct injury or transection of the gland, may require distal resection or external drainage.",D

Complication of blood transfusion can be all except aEUR',Hyperkalemia,Citrate toxicity,Metabolic acidosis,Hypothermia,"Metabolic acidosis The question is most probably about complications of massive blood transfusion. Massive Blood Transfusion Massive blood transfusion is generally defined as transfusion of one to two volumes of patient's own blood volumes (For most adults, that is equivalent to 10-20 units.) Complications of Massive Blood Transfusion i) Coagulopathy The most common cause of bleeding following massive blood transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia Clinically significant dilution of the coagulation factors is unusual in previously normal individuals. ii) Citrate Toxicity Citrate is used as an anticoagulant in the stored blood. Citrate has a propey to bind calcium, this calcium binding by the citrate preservative can become significant following transfusion of large volumes of blood or blood products. Hypocalcemia results in some patients after massive transfusion, to prevent this, the transfusion rate should not exceed 1 unit every 5 minutes. Citrate also has an affinity for magnesium ion and the occurrence of hypomagnesemia in the setting of massive transfusion is seen (rarely). iii) Hypothermia Blood is stored at a temperature of 2degC-6degC. So massive blood transfusion can result in hypothermia. Massive blood transfusion is an absolute indication for warming all blood products and intravenous fluids to normal body temperature. Hypothermia due to massive transfusion can result in venticular arryhthmia. iv) Acid-Base Balance The stored blood is acidic for two reasons. - Due to the citric acid (the anticoagulants) - Due to release of metabolic products by the anaerobic glycolysis of red cells (CO2 and Lactate). Despite the Stored Blood Being Acidic, Significant metabolic acidosis due to transfusion is not common. - Once the resuscitation is complete and normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis present, typically resolves, and progressive metabolic alkalosis supervenes as citrate and lactate contained in transfusion and resuscitation fluids are conveed to bicarbonate by the liver. The most consisent acid base abnormality after massive blood transfusion is postoperative metabolic alkalosis. v)Serum Potassium Concentration The extracellular concentration of Potassium in stored blood steadily increases with time due to lvsis of BBC's. The amount of extracellular potassium transfused with each unit is typically less than 4m Eq per unit. Hyperkalemia can develop regardless of the age of the blood when transfusion rate exceede 100m1/min. 688 vi) Oxygen Affinity Changes 2,3 DPG is greatly reduced in RBC's after about 3 weeks of storage, this increases hemoglobin's affinity for oxyen and adversely affects oxygen delivery to tissues. vii) Acute Respiration.'

"All are true about Flail chest, except:",Fracture of atleast 3 ribs,If overlapping of fractured ribs with severe displacement is seen then patients are treated surgically with open reduction and fixation,Pa0260 treated with intubation and PEEP,Paradoxical movement may not be seen in conscious patients,"Ans is 'd' i.e. Paradoxical movement may not be seen in conscious patients Flail chest is simply when a poion of the bony chest wall loses its continuity from the remainder of the thorax due to multiple fractures. By definition, a flail chest occurs in the presence of two or more fractures in three or more consecutive ribs (either on one side of the chest or either side of the sternum) and causes instability of the chest wall: however, it can also occur after costochondral separation. Flail chest is characterized by paradoxical motion of the chest wall (inward with inspiration and outward with expiration). The chance of having an intrathoracic injury in this situation increases severalfold. The paradoxical motion increases the work of breathing, and the most impoant consequence of flail chest is respiratory failure. Until recently it was believed that ineffective air movement between both lungs caused by paradoxical motion of the chest wall was the main cause of the respiratory distress in patients with flail chest. It is now understood that underlying pulmonary contusion and pain during inspiration are the most impoant components in the pathophysiology of the respiratory failure. Management: Patients without evidence of respiratory distress can be managed with only analgesia. Pain control can be provided by an intercostal nerve block or more adequately by epidural anesthesia. If respiratory distress develops, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation with peak end-expiratory pressure are usually indicated, provided that pain control is adequate. - Sequential aerial blood gas determination may gauge the severity of an injury and is useful to predict which patients will require ventilatory suppo.The ratio of aerial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Pa02:Fi02 ratio) yields an estimate of the extent of intrapulmonary shunt and may be used as a parameter to determine the need for mechanical ventilation. - Schwaz 7/e p689 writes-'1ntubation is delayed until clear evidence of a need of ventilator suppo develops: a respiratory rate of 40/min, a falling PaCO2 (evidence of excessive work of breathing) or a Pa02 below 60 Corr on inspired 02 fraction of over 0.5' - General Thoracic Surgery By Thomas W. Shields 7/e p894 writes-'Suggested parameters for instituting ventilator suppo are respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute, Pa02 45mm Hg.'

All of the following are true regarding medullary carcinoma of thyroid except: March 2010,Total thyroidectomy is done,Parafollicular cells involved,TSH dependent,Releases calcitonin,"Ans. C: TSH dependentMedullary tumors are the third most common of all thyroid cancers (about 5 to 8 percent).Unlike papillary and follicular thyroid cancers which arise from thyroid hormone producing cells, medullary cancer of the thyroid originates from the parafollicular cells (also called C cells) of the thyroid.These C cells make a different hormone called calcitonin.High levels of serum calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen are produced by many medullary tumours.Levels falls after resection and rise again with recurrence making it a valuable tumour marker in the follow-up of patients with this diseaseThis cancer has a much lower cure rate than does the 'well differentiated' thyroid cancers (papillary and follicular), but cure rates are higher than they are for anaplastic thyroid cancer.Sporadic- Accounts for 80% of all cases of medullary thyroid cancer.They are typically unilateral and there are no associated endocrinopathies (not associated with disease in other endocrine glands.Peak onset 40 - 60. Females outnumber males by 3:2 ratio.One third will present with intractable diarrhea. Diarrhea is caused by increased gastrointestinal secretion and hypermotility due to the hormones secreted by the tumor (calcitonin, prostaglandins, serotonin, or VIP).MEN H-A (Sipple Syndrome). Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes are a group of endocrine disorders. Sipple syndrome has bilateral medullary carcinoma or C cell C cell hyperplasia, pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism.This syndrome is inherited and is due to a defect of a gene (DNA) which helps control the normal growth of endocrine tissues.This inherited syndrome is passed on to all children who get the gene (inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion). Males and females are equally affected. Peak incidence of medullary carcinoma in these patients is in the 30's.MEN II-B. This syndrome also has medullary carcinoma and pheochromocytoma, but only rarely will have hyperparathyroidism. Instead these patients have an unusual appearance which is characterized by mucosal ganglioneuromas (tumors in the mouth) and a Marfanoid habitus.Inheritance is autosomal dominant as in MEN II-a, or it can occur sporadically (without being inherited). MEN II-B patients usually get medullary carcinoma in their 30's, and males and females are equally effected.As with MEN II-A, pheochromocytomas must be detected prior to any operation. The idea here is to remove the pheochromocytoma first to remove the risk of severe hypeensive episodes while the thyroid or parathyroid is being operated on.Inherited medullary carcinoma without associated endocrinopathies. This form of medullary carcinoma is the least aggressive. Like other types of thyroid cancers, the peak incidence is between the ages of 40 and 50. Involvement of lymph nodes occurs in 50-60% of cases of MCT and blood-borne metastases are common. They are not TSH dependent and do not take up radioactive iodineTreatment is by total thyroidectomy and either prophylactic or therapeutic resection of the central and bilateral cervical lymph nodes.",C

Regarding urinary bladder stone one is Not true ?,Common in Paediatric pt in tropics than that of non tropical areas,Uric acid stones are dropped from above,Jack stone is due to urea splitting bacteria,Commonly distal passage obstruction cause stone,"Answer is 'b' i.e. Uric acid stones are dropped from above It is the oxalate stones that are usually dropped from above (i.e. formed in the kidney and dropped in the bladder through ureter). Uric acid stones are mostly formed within the bladder. In general most of the bladder calculi are formed within the bladder itself. Only some stones are formed in the kidney and pass into the bladder, where they grow by additional deposition of crystals. Etiology for Bladder calculi Bladder outlet obstruction is the most common cause of vesical calculi in adults. Other causes are - neurogenic bladder leading to urinary stasis - a foreign body eg. Foley catheter and forgotten DJ stent, which serve as nidi for stones. - bladder diveicula Bladder stones are commonly seen in older men (>50 yrs.) usually because of bladder outlet obstruction In the Western world bladder stones are rare in pediatric population but bladder stones are endemic in children in underdeveloped nations (in Noh Africa, Thailand, Burma, Indonesia i.e. found near the tropics). This is because of low-protein, high carbohydrate diet and chronic dehdyration. These are usually ammonium urate stones. Common vesical stones are Uric acid stones & Struvite stones Other less common stone types are Oxalate stones Cystein stones Struvite stones are also known as 'Jack stones' because of their rough surface as against the smooth surface of uric acid stones. Struvite stones are composed of ammonium, magnesium and calcium phosphates and occurs in urine infected with urea-splitting organisms, eg. proteus. Bladder stones are usually solitary but may also be multiple.",B
All of the following are features of exstrophy of the bladder except :,Epispadias,Cloaca] membrane is present,Posterior bladder wall protrudes through the defects,Umbilical and inguinal hernia,"Ans is 'b' i.e., Cloacal membrane present Exstrophy of bladder (Ectopia vescicae) * There is defect in the infraumbilical pa of the anterior abdominal wall, associated with incomplete development of the anterior wall of the bladder. * The posterior wall of the bladder protrudes through the defect and urine spus onto the abdominal wall from the uretral orifices. * The public rami are widely separated. The femurs are rotated externally and the child 'waddles like a duck'. * The rectus muscles which are inseed on the pubic rami are also widely separated. * An umbilical hernia though usually small is present along with extrophic bladder. In males, there is complete epispadias with a wide and shallow scrotum. Undescended testis and inguinal herniasare common. Females also have epispadias, with separation of the two sides of the clitoris and wide separation of the labia. The anus is dislocated anteriorly in both sexes and there may be rectal prolapse. The consequence of untreated bladder exstrophy are total urinary incontinence and an increased incidence of bladder cancer, usually adenocarcinoma. Embryology - The basic defect in extrophy bladder is abnormal overdevelopment of the cloacal membrane and its rupture. The timing of the rupture of this defective cloacal membrane determines the variant of the exstrophyepispadias complex that results.",B

Allergies, Anaphylaxis, and Systemic M astocytosis Anaphylaxis: Treatment Mild symptoms such as pruritus and uicaria can be controlled by administration of 0.3 to 0.5 mL of 1:1000 (1.0 mg/mL) epinephrine SC or IM, with repeated doses as required at 5- to 20-min intervals for a severe reaction An IV infusion should be initiated to provide a route for administration of 2.5 mL epinephrine, diluted 1:10,000, at 5- to 10-min intervals, volume expanders such as normal saline, and vasopressor agents such as dopamine if intractable hypotension occurs. When epinephrine fails to control the anaphylactic reaction, hypoxia due to airway obstruction or related to a cardiac arrhythmia, or both, must be considered Oxygen alone a nasal catheter or with nebulized albuterol may be helpful, but either endotracheal intubation or a tracheostomy is mandatory for oxygen delivery if progressive hypoxia develops. Ancillary agents such as the antihistamine diphenhydramine, 50 to 100 mgIM or IV, and aminophylline , 0.25 to 0.5 g IV, are appropriate for uicaria-angioedema and bronchospasm, respectively.

Proper management would be",Administration of hypeonic saline solution,Restriction of free water,Plasma ultrafiltration,Hemodialysis,"Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures. It is usually the result of the combination of appropriate postoperative stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Totally sodium-free intravenous fluids (e.g., dextrose and water) should be given with great caution postoperatively, since occasionally the resulting hyponatremia can be associated with sudden death from a flaccid hea or with severe permanent brain damage. The condition is usually best treated by withholding free water and allowing the patient to reequilibrate spontaneously. At levels below 115 meq/L, seizures or mental obtundation may mandate treatment with hypeonic sodium solutions.

Which of the following is true regarding bone marrow transplantation?,Marrow is highly immunogenic and easily rejected by the non-immunosuppressed host,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of aplastic anemias,Marrow transplantation has not been successful in the treatment of congenital immunodeficiency diseases,Marrow transplantation can be used as a successful therapy for stage IV breast cancer following high-dose chemotherapy,"Bone marrow cells are highly immunogenic. Successful engraftment requires the use of powerful immunosuppressants that permit the transplanted cells not only to survive the host's immune response, but also to mount a graft-versus-host response against recipient tissues. The graft-versus-host response is the major impediment to more widespread clinical use of this technique. Despite these barriers, human bone marrow transplantation has had important clinical application in the treatment of aplastic anemias and congenital immunodeficiency diseases and several hematologic malignancies. Stem cell transplantation involves harvesting of a patient's own pluripotent bone marrow cells and subsequent reestablishment of the marrow following high-dose, toxic chemotherapy for advanced cancer. This modality has been used in the treatment of recurrent breast cancer, but recent metanalyses of the results have failed to show any significant survival benefit. In experimental models, work with bone marrow transplantation for the induction of tolerance to organ allografts has proved highly promising. This may provide a key for the development of treatment protocols in organ transplant recipients that would avoid or reduce the need for toxic systemic immunosuppressants.",A

Brilliantly transilluminant swellings are all except?,Hydrocele,Meningeocele,Lipoma,Cystic hygroma,"Ans is 'c' i.e. lipoma All the other options except lipoma are cystic lesions containing clear fluid and thus will show brilliant transillumination.Lipoma are not cystic structures but large lipomas are able to show transillumination upto varying extent (though not brilliantly)TransilluminationTransillumination involves shining a light through a swelling to detect whether it transmits light brilliantly or not.It is a function of the optical density of the component elements of the swelling. Light passes easily through clear fluid but not through solid tissues. If a lump trans illuminates then it must contain water, serum, lymph or plasma, or highly refractile fat. Blood and other semi-opaque fluids do not transmit light.Thus a cyst containing clear fluid (e.g. hydrocele, cystic hygroma, meningocele) trans illuminates brilliantly, one containing opalescent fluid (spermatocele) less so. Fat (lipoma) and subcutaneous tissues also transilluminate to a varying extent.",C

The BPS is composed of three observational areas (facial expression, upper limb movements and compliance with mechanical ventilation). Each is scored from 1 to 4, with higher numbers indicating discomfo. The BPS score ranges from 3 (no pain) to 12 (most pain). It has been studied and validated in both deeply sedated and moderately sedated patients. The CPOT assesses four areas (facial expression, movements, muscle tension and ventilator compliance). Each area is scored from 0-2, with total scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 8 (most pain). It is validated in both intubated and non-intubated critical care patients. CPOT has superior reliability and validity when used in non-verbal critically ill adults. Chronic pain or delirium may make asceaining a pain level difficult with CPOT.

Diffusion hypoxia is seen with -,Ether,Cyclopropane,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,"DIFFUSION HYPOXIA also known as FINK EFFECT OR THIRD GAS EFFECT At the end of general anesthesia, N2O is switched off so that inspired gas changes from N2O+O2 - N2+O2. As a result, N2O stas diffusing out of the blood into alveoli while N2 diffuses into blood. Due to the difference in solubilities of the two gases, N2O diffuses out more rapidly as it has high solubility. This diluted other gases present in alveoli and relative concentration of O2 falls. It is termed as diffusion hypoxia.

Which among the following is best method to assess intake of fluid in Polytrauma pt -,Urine output,CVP,Pulse,BP,"• Lets see each option one by one
Urine output

'Urine output is a quantitative and relatively reliable indicator of organ perfusion. Adequate urine output is 0.5 ml/kg/ h in an adult, lml/kg/h in a child and 2ml/kg/h in an infant less than 1yr. of age.'

Pulse-

'Although tachycardia may be the earliest sign of hypovolemia, individuals in good physical condition, and particularly trained atheletes with a low resting pulse rate, may manifest only a relative tachycardia, pts on blocking medication may not be able to increase their heart rate. In children, bradycardia or relative bradycardia can occur with severe blood loss. Conversely, hypoxia, pain, apprehension and stimulant drugs  produce a tachycardia'

B.P. -

Hypotension is not a reliable early sign of hypovolemia. in healthy pts.
Blood volume must decrease by 30 to 40 percent before hypotension occurs.
Younger pts with good sympathetic tone can maintain systemic blood pressure with severe intravascular deficit untill they are on the verge of cardiac arrest.

CVP

CVP measurement helps in distinguishing b/w cardiogenic shock and hypovolemic shock.

The following are impoant in maintenance of normal fecal continence except -,Anorectal angulation,Rectal innervation,Internal sphincter,Haustral valve,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Haustral valve Normal fecal continence requires - adequate rectal wall compliance to accommodate the fecal bolus. appropriate neurogenic control of the pelvic floor and sphincter mechanism, and - functional internal and external sphincter muscles At rest the puborectalis muscle creates a 'sling' around the distal rectum, forming a relatively acute angle (Anorectal angle). Anorectal angle distributes intraabdominal forces onto the pelvic floor and play an impoant role in the continence mechanism. At the time of defecation, this angle straightens, allowing the downward force to be applied along the axis of the rectum and anal canal. The internal & external sphincters are tonically active at rest. - the internal sphincter is responsible for most of the resting, involuntary sphincter force - the external sphincter is responsible for voluntary sphincter force. Both the internal and external sphincters are innervated by pudendal nerve. Finally, the hemorrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically blocking the anal canal. Thus impaired continence may result from : - poor rectal compliance - injury to internal and/or external sphincter or puborectalis, or - nerve damage or neuropathy",D

A 75-year-old man is found by his internist to have an asymptomatic carotid bruit. The best initial diagnostic examination would be,Transcranial Doppler studies,Doppler ultrasonography (duplex),Spiral CT angiography,Arch aortogram with selective carotid artery injections,"Doppler ultrasonography (duplex) has become the best initial test for screening patients with carotid disease. It has become a highly accurate test, often obviating the need for carotid arteriography prior to carotid endarterectomy. Carotid arteriography remains the 'gold standard' when quantifying the degree of carotid stenosis, but it is usually performed after noninvasive testing suggests significant stenosis. Spiral CT angiography is a new noninvasive modality that has been used to evaluate many segments of the vascular tree, but as yet its accuracy does not approach that of standard arteriography and it would certainly not be used in the initial evaluation of a patient with an asymptomatic bruit. Magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA) is also a relatively new modality that has enjoyed moderate success in the investigation of carotid disease. Although not quite as accurate as standard arteriography, it has been used in conjunction with the duplex as a complementary study.

"A 59-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction 2 years ago undergoes an uneventful aoobifemoral bypass graft for aooiliac occlusive disease. Six hours later he develops ST segment depression, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) shows anterolateral ischemia. His hemodynamic parameters are as follows: systemic BP 70/40 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats per minute, CVP 18 mm Hg, PCWP 25 mm Hg, cardiac output 1.5 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance 1000 (dyne * s)/cm5 . Which of the following is the single best pharmacologic intervention for this patient?",Sublingual nitroglycerin,Intravenous nitroglycerin,A sho-acting b-blocker,Dobutamine,"This patient has developed pump failure because of a combination of preexisting coronary aery occlusive disease and high preload following a fluid challenge; afterload remains moderately high as well because of systemic vasoconstriction in the presence of cardiogenic shock. Poor myocardial performance is reflected in the low cardiac output and high PCWP. Therapy must be directed at increasing cardiac output without creating too high a myocardial O2 demand on the already failing hea. Administration of nitroglycerin could be expected to reduce both preload and afterload, but, if given without an inotrope, it would create unacceptable hypotension. Nitroprusside similarly would achieve afterload reduction but would result in hypotension if not accompanied by an inotropic agent. A b-blocker would act deleteriously by reducing cardiac contractility and slowing the hea rate in a setting in which cardiac output is likely to be rate-dependent. Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine that is becoming the inotropic agent of choice in cardiogenic shock. As a b1 -adrenergic agonist, it improves cardiac performance in pump failure both by positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation. With minimal chronotropic effect, dobutamine only marginally increases myocardial O2 demand.",D

Finger guided core biopsy (Ref: Schwartz 9/467; Sabiston19/2035-2037; Bailey 26/818, 25/846)Most breast lesions in pregnancy are benign but biopsy should be done to rule out malignancy. Core-needle biopsy with or without ultrasound guidance is a safe and reliable method for obtaining tissue.'Fewer than 25% of the breast nodules developing during pregnancy and lactation will be cancerous. Ultrasonography and needle biopsy are used in the diagnosis of these nodules. Open biopsy may be required. Mammography is rarely indicated because of its decreased sensitivity during pregnancy and lactation; however, the fetus can be shielded if mammography is needed. --Schwartz 9/467'Because of the changes in the breast tissue with pregnancy, imaging modalities may be difficult to interpret. If used with appropriate shielding, mammography carries a limited risk to the fetus. Mammography has a high false-negative rate due to the increased density of the fibroglandular breast tissue, however.: so it has limited usefulness in the evaluation of the pregnant patient. Ultrasonography can safely be performed as an initial evaluation or in conjunction with mammography. Ultrasound is able to distinguish solid from cystic lesions in 97% of patients and is helpful in guiding fine-needle aspiration or biopsy Although MRI does not use ionizing radiation, the two main risks to the fetus from the magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation are heating and cavitation. With other reliable imaging modalities available, MRI is not currently recommended for breast imaging in the pregnant patient.

All the following are true about Meckel's diverticulum except-,Bleeding,Intussusception,Arises at the mesentric border,Located 60 cm from the cecal valve,"Meckel's diverticulum is situated at the anti-mesenteric border of the small intestine.

Meckel's diverticulum is a true diverticulum as it has all the 3 layers of the intestine.
It's the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract.
Male to female ratio is 3 : 2.
Approximately 60% of Meckel's diverticula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are ­colonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue.
A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diverticula is

Rule of two: i.e. 

2% prevalence
2 inch in length
2 feet proximal to the ilcocecal valve.
half of these who are symptomatic are younger than 2 yrs of age
Meckel's diverticula are asymptomatic. Symptoms arise only when any complication occurs.

Complications
Most common complication

in children & young adults (< 18 yrs of age) → bleeding
in adults → intestinal obstruction
overall → bleeding
Following complications are noted in Meckel's diverticulum.

Bleeding

bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum.

Intestinal obstruction
Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms.

Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus
Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point.
Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (the Mesodiverticular band is a remnant of the left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentery.)
Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis.

Diverticulitis

clinical picture is similar to appendicitis.
diverticulitis may lead to perforation.
Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in an inguinal or a femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia.


Diagnostic studies

Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention.
Barium meal follows through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during the acute presentation of complication.
If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium99 pertechnate radionuclide scan. It demonstrates the ectopic gastric mucosa and localizes the Meckel's diverticulum. Angiography can localize the site of bleeding during acute hemorrhage related to Meckel's diverticula.",C

Paradoxical aciduria (the excretion of acid urine in the presence of metabolic alkalosis) may occur in the presence of,Release of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone,Severe crush injury,Acute tubular necrosis,Gastric outlet obstruction,"The body has elaborate mechanisms to compensate for metabolic acidosis. Not only do most body functions work better in an acidotic state, the patient is able to move toward correction of the pH by excreting acid urine and by hyperventilating to 'blow off' carbonic acid. On the other hand, we are poorly equipped to deal with metabolic alkalosis. We cannot hold our breath to save acid since the respiratory center overrides our efforts as the PaCO2 rises and the PaO2 falls. The kidney cannot make urine under any circumstance that is very far above normal pH. In the subtraction alkalosis that accompanies gastric outlet obstruction with loss of gastric acid by vomiting or suction, the potassium depletion and volume deficits provoke exchange of sodium for hydrogen ion in the distal tubule with resultant exacerbation of the metabolic alkalosis. All the other conditions listed would be expected to produce acidosis; consequently, acid urine would not be paradoxical.",D

Suspected medial epicondylar fracture of humerus in a 4 year old child requires:,X-ray both arms with elbow for comparison,X-ray same limb only,Examination under general anaesthesia,POP in full flexed position,"A i.e. X- Ray both arms with elbow for comparison The ossification centre of medial epicondyle of humerus appears between 5 - 7 years and fuses to the shaft (diaphysis) between 16 - 20 years. In older patients (> 7yr.) the medial epicondyle fragment is usually easily identified radio graphically. However radiographic interpretation is very difficult in younger patients In either case, assessment of minimally displaced fractures may be facilitated with comparison views of both elbowsQ to establish the normal width of the cailagenous space between the metaphysis and medial epicondyle. Although medial joint space widening may be present on AP radiograph, a non centrically reduced ulno - humeal joint on lateral view is often the only radiographic finding. Thus whenever a medial epicondylar fracture is suspected, it is imperative to obtain true lateral radiograph. The inability to obtain a true lateral radiograph should raise the suspicion of an entrapped medial epicondyle fragment.",A

Most common subtype of Basal cell carcinoma is: March 2005,Superficial basal cell carcinoma,Nodular basal cell carcinom,Sclerosing basal cell carcinoma,Pigmented basal cell carcinoma,"Ans. B: Nodular basal cell carcinoma Subtypes of basal cell carcinoma: Nodular basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of basal cell carcinoma and usually presents as a round, pearly, flesh-colored papule with telangiectases. As it enlarges, it frequently ulcerates centrally, leaving a raised, pearly border with telangiectases, which aids in making the diagnosis. Most tumors are observed on the face, although the trunk and extremities also are affected Cystic basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma, cystic basal cell carcinoma is often indistinguishable from nodular basal cell carcinoma clinically, although it might have a polypoid appearance Pigmented basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant of nodular basal cell carcinoma that has brown-black macules in some or all areas, often making it difficult to differentiate from melanoma. Morpheaform (sclerosing) basal cell carcinoma is an uncommon variant in which tumor cells induce a proliferation of fibroblasts within the dermis and an increased collagen deposition (sclerosis) that clinically resembles a scar. Superficial basal cell carcinoma is often multiple, most often developing on the upper trunk or shoulders",B

Best marker to assess prognosis after Surgery for colon carcinoma:,CA 19-9,CA-125,Alpha fetoprotein,CEA,"CEA is a family of related glycoproteins initially found in embryonic tissue and colon malignancies. The half-life of CEA is approximately 2 weeks. Plasma levels of CEA can be determined readily by radioimmunoassay. However, its usefulness in colon carcinogenesis screening is limited because of its high level in the plasma of a patient&;s malignancies originating from other sites such as breast, pancreas, stomach and lung. Fuhermore, CEA plasma levels may also be increased in smokers or patients with chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, bronchitis and alcoholic liver disease. The clinical usefulness of CEA for screening purposes is fuher limited by the fact that its increase in level typically occurs only when the tumor penetrates through the serosa. Thus, early lesions may not be detected by serum CEA level changes. CEA is typically elevated with metastatic liver disease, but rarely with peritoneal involvement. Thus, while the specificity for CEA to identify occult CRCs is high, the sensitivity is low in most studies for screening. Accordingly, CEA is not a useful test for the screening of CRC.

apnography is used for assessment of ?,Oxygen saturation of blood,Amount of CO2 transpoed in blood,Ventilation of lung after intubation,Myocardial perfusion,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Ventilation of lung after intubation Capnographv Capnography is the continuous measurement of end tidal CO2 (ETCO2), i.e., CO2 in exhaled air. Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%). Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit. Uses of Capnography It is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETCO2 = 0. Intraoperative displacement of endotracheal tube ---> ETCO2 will become zero. Obstruction or disconnections of endotracheal tube ---> ETCO2 will fall. Diagnosing malignant hypehermia ETCO2 increases significantly (more than 100 mg Hg).",C

Serum fructosamine can be used in all exceptaEUR',Screening of diabetes,Rapid change in DM treatment,Monitoring sho term control of DM,Screening of DM in pregnancy,"Screening of diabetes Fructosamine is the product of a reaction between fructose and protein. Fructosamine is a compound that is fOrmed by the nonenzymatic reaction between fructose and ammonia. When .fructosamines are fanned from blood proteins such as albumin, they are known as glycated serum protein or glycated albumin. Since albumin has much shoer half life than hemoglobin, serum fructosamine generally reflects the state of glycemic control for only the preceeding 2 weeks. Fructosamine measurement has been present since long to monitor sugar control in diabetes. The test for ,fructosamine is simpler and less costly than for glycated hemoglobin. However, the trials have shown it to be too unspecific to replace the increasingly well established and generally recommended determination of HbAc. Glucose control in diabetics is usually assessed with the help of glycosylated hemoglobin that indicates average glucose level over the preceeding 12 weeks as reflected by the permanent glycosylation of a small fraction of the hemoglobin molecule in the blood. However, its measurement is not appropriate where there has been a recent change in the diet or treatment within 6 weeks of if there are abnormalities in red blood cell aging or mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence people with recent blood loss or hymolytic anemia or hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell disease are not suitable for glycosylated hemoglobin method that do not account for higher turnover of hemoglobin. Fructosamine is used in these circumstances. It is also used in conditions such as pregnancy in which hormonal changes cause greater sho term fluctuation in glucose concentrations. The American diabetes Association says that fructosamine may be a better choice when glycosylated hemoglobin cannot be reliably measured : These situations include: 1) The evaluation of changes in diabetic treatmentQ, since the effects of adjustment can be evaluated after a couple of weeks rather than months. 2) In pregnancyQ, since the glucose and insulin needs of the mother and fetus changes rapidly during gestation. 3) Any condition that effects the average age of red blood cellsQ such as hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia or blood loss. Fructosamine is not affected by such conditions and may be a better choice for monitoring glucose control. 4) In monitoring sho term and intermediate glycemic control. Disadvantages of fructosamine:- Measured fructosamine may be falsely low in the setting of decreased protein levels such as nephrotic syndrome or hepatic disease. Fuher, because of lack of standardization and concern with reproducibility, fructosamine is not recommended for routine use or as a replacement or supplement for glycated hemoglobin in the assessment of glucose in diabetes.",A

Warm periphery is noticed in which type of shock: September 2012,Cardiogenic shock,Septic shock,Hemorrhagic shock,Traumatic shock,"Ans. B i.e. Septic shock Distributive shock Peripheral vasodilatation and subsequent maldistribution of blood flow. This leads to a relative hypovolaemia. Common examples of this type being septic, anaphylactic and neurogenic shock. Septic shock It includes vasodilatation, high cardiac output, and loss of intravascular volume due to 'leaky capillaries'. The patient may sta with a low cardiac output due to the leaky capillaries with loss of fluid and because the vasodilated aerial tree requires a larger blood volume to fill it (relative hypovolaemia). With appropriate fluid volume replacement the hea will pump against lower resistance and therefore there will often be an increase in cardiac output in order to compensate for the reduction in SVR. The patient may remain hypotensive but will have warm peripheries and a bounding pulse. The bounding pulse is a reflection of the wide pulse pressure which is due to a low diastolic pressure. Due to toxins and acidosis, sepsis may have a negative inotropic affect on the hea as well as causing vasodilatation and the patient can therefore have a low cardiac output and a low SVR.",B

Diagnosis Ameloblastoma is tentatively diagnosed through radiographic examination and must be confirmed by histological examination through biopsy. Radiographically, the tumour area appears as a rounded and well-defined lucency in the bone with varying size and features. Numerous cyst-like radiolucent areas can be seen in larger tumours (multi-locular) giving a characteristic 'soap bubble' appearance. A single radiolucent area can be seen in smaller tumours (unilocular). The radiodensity of an ameloblastoma is about 30 Hounsfield units, which is about the same as keratocystic odontogenic tumours. However, ameloblastomas show more bone expansion and seldom show high density areas. Lingual plate expansion is helpful in diagnosing ameloblastoma as cysts rarely do this.

True about epidermoid cysta) Punctum is presentb) Keratin is presentc) Sebaceous material presentd) Autosomal inheritancee) May turn malignant,abc,bcd,abe,acd,"Epidermoid cyst (also k/a sebaceous cyst, epidermal cyst) Epidermoid cysts are most common cutaneous cysts.

Epidermoid cyst results from proliferation of epidermal cells within a circumscribed space of dennis (which had got implanted within the dermis due to a variety of reasons)
Sebaceous cyst is a misnomer as the cysts are not of sebaceous origin and the white, creamy material filled within them is not sebum but is keratin (desquamated epithelial cells)
The walls of these cysts consist of a layer of epidermis oriented with the basal layer superficial and the more mature layers deep (i.e. the epidermis grows into the centre of the cyst). The desquamated cells (keratin) collect in the centre and form the creamy substance of the cyst.
Epidermoid cysts usually are asymptomatic unless they get infected or inflamed and become painful
They appear as firm, round, flesh coloured to yellow or white subcutaneous nodules of variable size. A central pore or punctum is an inconsistent finding that may tether the cyst to the overlying epidermis and from which the white creamy material can be expressed.
Rarely malignancies (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell ca) can develop in epidermoid cysts.

"Regarding injury to pancreas, what is NOT true ?",Majority of postoperative complications are due to missed duct injury,Commonly associated with vascular injury,Peritoneal lavage is good for making the diagnosis,All,"Ans. is 'b' i.e. Fracture is common at the junction of head and body Pancreas being a retroperitoneal structure, peritoneal lavage is not helpful in making the diagnosis of pancreatic injury. CT scan is the best diagnostic procedure, apa from an exploratory laprotomy More about Pancreatic injury About two-thirds are due to penetrating injuries and rest one-third due to blunt trauma. Pancreatic injuries are usually associated with injury to other visceral organ. Isolated pancreatic injuries are rare. In blunt injuries which are usually the result of midline upper abdominal trauma (eg. car seat belt, cycle handle), junction of the neck and body of the pancreas are most commonly injured as they are pressed against the veebral column. Major abdominal vascular injuries are present in more than 75% of cases of penetrating trauma. 'The presence of pancreatic duct injury appears to be a key factor in postoperative morbidity.' - Sabiston Also know Serum amylase levels are elevated in most patients with significant pancreatic trauma, but they are also increased in up to 90% of severe abdominal trauma patients who do not have pancreatic injury. Thus measurement of amylase at the time of hospital admission is not helpful in identifying those with pancreatic injury. On the other hand a progressive rise in serum amylase activity is a more specific indicator of pancreatic injury. Treatment The treatment of pancreatic injury depends on its grade and extent. - Minor injuries not involving a major duct may be treated nonoperatively. Moderate injuries usually require operative exploration, debridement, and the placement of external drains. More severe injuries including those with major duct injury or transection of the gland, may require distal resection or external drainage.",B

The degective migration of neural crest cells results in,Congenital megacolon,Albinism,Adrenogenital hypoplasia,Dentinogenesis imperfecta,"Hirschsprung's disease (congenital mega colon) Hirschsprung's disease is characterised by the congenital absence of intramural ganglion cells (aganglionosis) and the presence of hyperophic nerves in the distal large bowel. The absence of ganglion cells is due to a failure of migration of vagal neural crest cells into the developing gut. The affected gut is in spasm, causing a functional bowel obstruction. The aganglionosis is restricted to the rectum and sigmoid colon in 75% of patients (sho segment), involves the proximal colon in 15% (long segment) and affects the entire colon and a poion of terminal ileum in 10% (total colonic aganglionosis) . A transition zone exists between the dilated, proximal, normally innervated bowel and the narrow, distal aganglionic segment.Hirschsprung's disease may be familial or associated with Down syndrome or other genetic disorders. Gene mutations have been identified on chromosome 10 (involving the RET proto-oncogene) and on chromosome 13 in some patients. Hirschsprung's disease typically presents in the neonatal period with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension and bilious vomiting but it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood or even adult life, when it manifests as severe chronic constipation. Enterocolitis is a potentially fatal complication. The diagnosis requires an adequate rectal biopsy and an experienced pathologist. A contrast enema may show the narrow aganglionic segment, a cone and the dilated proximal bowel. Surgery aims to remove the aganglionic segment and 'pull-through' ganglionic bowel to the anus (e.g. Swenson, Duhamel, Soave and transanal procedures), and can be done in a single stage or in stages after first establishing a proximal stoma in normally innervated bowel. Most patients achieve good bowel control but a significant minority experience residual constipation and/or faecal incontinence or fuher enterocolitis. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 136",A

In these infants, for whom an inhalation anesthetic may have increased risks, spinal anesthesia and caudal epidural anesthesia have been used successfully to avoid general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation.The history is compatible with cerebral palsy or congenital myopathies. Since this is an elective surgical repair, complete neurological workup and diagnosis is necessary before anesthetic risk can be assessed.These children are ideal for assessment by a multidisciplinary team which include anaesthesiologists and pediatrician. A complete history and physical examination is essential before anaesthetizing these children, including a discussion of postoperative pain management with the parents. Cognitive and communication problems may make preoperative assessment more difficult. Parents and caretakers are best to be involved during this period not only to gain information but also allay the fears of the child.Anesthetic Concern in Cerebral PalsyIntraoperative hypothermia and slow emergence.Suxamethonium does not cause hyperkalaemia in these patients, and a rapid sequence induction may be indicated.Anesthetic Concern in Neuromuscular DiseasesThe incidence of anaesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis is significant.Succinylcholine and volatile agents should be avoided in at-risk children.",A

All of the following are true about lupus anticoagulant except aEUR',Prolongation of only aPTT,Recurrent second trimester aboion,Recurrent bleeding episodes,Can be associated wihout any clinical symptoms,"Recurrent bleeding episodes Make it clear once and for always. 'Despite having been named lupus 'anticoagulant' lupus anticoagulation syndrome does not present with bleeding'. Lupus anticoagulant is characterized by the presence of circulating lupus anticoagulant in the body but its predominant symptonz is thrombosis. . The circulating anticoagulants do not exe any anticoagulant effect in vivo instead they act in vitro. The main symptoms of lupus anticoagulant is thrombosis. The thrombotic manifestations are entirely independent of anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The reason for thrombosis is not quite clear but it has no relation with circulating anticoagulants.The thrombotic episodes are life threatening. Bleeding episodes in lupus anticoagulant -Bleeding may occur with lupus anticoagulant but is quite rare and do not lead to life threatening hemorrhage. According to William's hematology - Although thrombocytopenia is a common finding in APS, bleeding complications, are rare even with severe thrombocytopenia bleeding in an antiphospholipid antibody syndrome should trigger evaluation for the presence of antiprothrombin antibodies and other disorders that may affect hemostasis such as DIC and Uremia. Thrombocytopenia due to antiplatelet antibodies is usually mild to moderate without bleeding (Tejinder Singh hematology Atlas) . Many cases of lupus anticoagulant can be 'asymptomatic' too. Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome fall into two categories. Secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome . In this cases antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is associated with an autoimmune disease usually SLE. Primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome . In these cases there is no evidence of other autoimmune disease, the patient exhibit only the manifestations of antiphospholiipid antibody syndrome. Clinical manifestations ill' lupus Lupus anticoagulant increases the PTT but not the PT. Lupus anticoagulant syndrome is characterized by the presence of circulating anticoagulants or the antiphospholipid antibodies. But the predominant symptom of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is thrombosis. The question which immediately comes to mind is, how a patient with circulating anticoagulant has thrombosis as its predominant manifestation?? The point to emphasize here is that circulating anticoagulants are not responsible for any clinical syndrome in case of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. These antibodies are unable to exe any effect in circulation. They act as anticoagulants only in invitro not invivo. The thrombotic manifestations are entirely independent of anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies. The reason for thrombosis is not quiet clear but it has no relation with circulating anticoagulants. The effect of circulating anticoagulant is seen only during laboratory test where their presence increase the PTT. The anticoagulants exe this effect by acting against phospholipids. These anionic phospholipids are present on the plasma membranes of the activated platelets, which form platelet plugs at the site of injury. The coagulation .factors assemble on the surface of activated platelets and thus becomes concentrated at sites of vascular injury. The circulating anticoagulants acts by blocking these phospholipids. NOW, Two questions crops up, Why do the circualting anticoagulants do not exe their effect in vivo? 'And why do these antiocoagulants affect only PTT and not PT.' Explanation While performing PTT patient is given calcium, paial thromboplastin along with an intrinsic pathway activator. Paial thromboplastin contains the phospholipid needed for coagulation. If the patients plasma, contain antiphospholipid antibodies, it will inhibit the phospholipids present in the paial thromboplastin. Since the paial thromboplastin has limited phospholipids the coagulation gets inhibited by the anticoagulants and thus the PTT increases. On the other hand in the body there is abundant supply of phospholipids from the platelets therefore the antiphospholipid antibodies are not able to affect the coagulation. Platelets continuously replenish the phspholipids. While performing test for prothrotnbin time(PT) patient is given tissue .factor i.e. thromboplastin. Thromboplastin contains abundant supply of phospholipid so the circulating (plasma) anticoagulants are not able to exe their effect on it, and thus PT remains normal Coagulation tests in lupus anticoagulant .

Latter is probably more common.# Postoperative ileus is characterized by absent intestinal sounds.# Early evidence (days 1-5) is usually due to non-strangulating obstructive cause like fibrinous adhesions and edema.# Postoperative adynamic Ileus usually presents after a week of operation.Paralytic ileusThis may be defined as a state in which there is failure of trans- mission of peristaltic waves secondary to neuromuscular failure . The resultant stasis leads to accumulation of fluid and gas within the bowel, with associated distension, vomiting, absence of bowel sounds and absolute constipation.Varieties# Postoperative:a degree of ileus usually occurs after any abdominal procedure and is self-limiting, with a variable duration of 24-72 hours. Postoperative ileus may be prolonged in the presence of hypoproteinaemia or metabolic abnormality (see below).# Infection: intra-abdominal sepsis may give rise to localised or generalised ileus. Resultant adhesions may contribute a mechanical element to the initial neurogenic aetiology.# Reflex ileus: this may occur following fractures of the spine or ribs, retroperitoneal haemorrhage or even the application of a plaster jacket.# Metabolic: uraemia and hypokalemia are the most common contributory factors.Specific treatment is directed towards the cause, but the fol- lowing general principles apply:# The primary cause must be removed. * Gastrointestinal distension must be relieved by decompression.# Close attention to fluid and electrolyte balance is essential.# There is no place for the routine use of peristaltic stimulants.Rarely, in resistant cases, medical therapy with an adrenergic blocking agent in association with cholinergic stimulation, e.g. neostigmine (the Catchpole regimen), may be used, provided that an intraperitoneal cause has been excluded.# If paralytic ileus is prolonged and threatens life, a laparotomy should be considered to exclude a hidden cause and facilitate bowel decompression.",A

(SELECT 1 DISORDER)",Massive tricuspid regurgitation,Aortic regurgitation,Coarctation of the aorta,Thoracic aortic aneurysm,"Myocarditis, aortitis, and pericarditis all have been described in association with Reiter syndrome; the original description included conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthralgias. Although its cause is unknown, Reiter syndrome is associated with HLA-B27 antigen, as are aortic regurgitation, pericarditis, and ankylosing spondylitis.Short stature, webbed neck, low-set ears, and epicanthal folds are the classic features of patients who have Turner syndrome. Persons affected by the syndrome, which is commonly linked with aortic coarctation, are genotypically XO. However, females and males have been described with normal sex chromosome constitutions (XX, XY) but with the phenotypic abnormalities of Turner syndrome. Additional cardiac lesions associated with Turner syndrome include septal defects, valvular stenosis, and anomalies of the great vessels.The Argyll Robertson pupil, a pupil that constricts with accommodation but not in response to light, is characteristic of central nervous system syphilis and is associated with vascular system manifestations of this disease. Treponema pallidum invades the vasa vasorum and causes an obliterative endarteritis and necrosis. The resulting aortitis gradually weakens the aortic wall and predisposes it to aneurysm formation. Once an aneurysm has formed, the prognosis is grave.Massive isolated tricuspid regurgitation produces a markedly elevated venous pressure, usually manifested by a severely engorged (often pulsating) liver. If the venous pressure is sufficiently elevated, exophthalmos may result. Tricuspid regurgitation of rheumatic origin is almost never an isolated lesion, and the major symptoms of patients who have rheumatic heart disease are usually attributable to concurrent left heart lesions. Bacterial endocarditis from intravenous drug abuse is becoming an increasingly important cause of isolated tricuspid regurgitation.A Quincke pulse, which consists of alternate flushing and paling of the skin or nail beds, is associated with aortic regurgitation. Other characteristic features of the peripheral pulse in aortic regurgitation include the water- hammer pulse (Corrigan pulse, caused by a rapid systolic upstroke) and pulsus bisferiens, which describes a double systolic hump in the pulse contour. The finding of a wide pulse pressure provides an additional diagnostic clue to aortic regurgitation.",C

Which is NOT true about femoral aery cannulation?,Common femoral aery is cannulated,Single wall puncture is indicated in those with normal coagulation profile,Femoral aery is catheterised at medial third of femoral head,Seldinger technique is used both for femoral aery and vein,"Single wall puncture is indicated in those with normal coagulation profile Single wall puncture is indicated in those with coagulopathy as there is more risk of bleeding in double wall puncture technique. Aerial access is obtained for hemodynamic monitoring (blood pressure monitoring, blood gases monitoring) in an intensive care unit, or for the purpose of aeriography and intervention as in vascular surgical patients. The femoral aery is one of the most frequently cannulated aeries in the body. It is commonly used for aerial access for the purpose of aeriography in the vascular surgical patient. It is a large-caliber vessel that is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. It is also commonly used in cardiac catheterization for the purpose of coronary angiography and for coronary interventions. The radial aery is the most frequently used site of aerial cannulation for hemodynamic monitoring because it is technically easy to cannulate and has a low complication rate, in pa due to the good collateral circulation of the hand. The femoral aery is the second most cannulated aery for haemodynamic monitoring. It provides a more accurate estimation of central (aoic) pressure than the radial aery. Its large-caliber is appropriate for using the larger-profile devices for angioplasty and stenting of the peripheral vessels. Femoral aery catheter complications are infrequent but are more complicated than that of the radial aery. For femoral aerial access, the puncture is made in the common femoral aery. A puncture site above the inguinal ligament, in the external iliac aery, or distally in the superficial femoral or profunda femoris aery is problematic. Disadvantage of external iliac aery: - The external iliac aery is located in the retroperitoneal space, making this aery difficult, to compress and achieve postprocedure hemostasis. (a puncture in this region can result in potentially catastrophic complication of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.) Disadvantage with superficial femoral or external iliac aery: - these aeries are substantially smaller in caliber and have a higher incidence of postprocedure thrombosis. - higer incidence of pseudoaneurysm - Additionally, the superficial .femoral aery is often heavily diseased. Localization of Common femoral aery (CFA): The CFA begins immediately behind the inguinal ligament, midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the symphysis pubis. (A line connecting these two bony structures represents the inguinal ligament) Just below the inguinal ligament (one to two fingerbreadths distal to the inguinal ligament) the aery is closest to the surface of the skin and easily accessible. This is the optimal location of cannulation. The femoral aery is identified in the inguinal region by its pulsation. If fluoroscopy is being used, the femoral aery is typically located over the medial third of the femoral head. Note that the groin crease is unreliable in locating the ideal site of puncture and should not be used as a landmark. Femoral aery cannulation can be done using the Seldinger technique. The Seldinger technique is a medical procedure to obtain safe access to blood vessels (both aeries and veins) and other hollow organs. There are two methods of aerial wall puncture: the double-wall puncture and the single-wall puncture. The double-wall puncture involves penetrating both the anterior and posterior walls with the needle and then withdrawing the needle slowly until pulsatile blood flow is confirmed. This method is associated with a higher incidence of complications but is relatively easier. In the single-wall puncture technique, only the anterior wall of the aery is punctured with the needle, which is confirmed by pulsatile blood flow through the needle. Single wall puncture is usually the recommended technique. These two techniques can be used interchangeably and depends on the operator's preference, however-Single wall puncture is indicated in patients with coagulopathy or if thrombolysis is planned because of the increased risk of bleeding in double wall technique. Complications of femoral aery cannulation: - haemorrhage - Aeriovenous.fistulae - aerial dissection - pseudoaneurysm - aerial thrombosis",B

"Sunray appearance on X-ray may be seen in: September 2008, March 2013 (c)",Osteoclastoma,Osteoblastoma,Osteoblastoma,Chondroblastoma,"Ans. C: Osteosarcoma In radiographic terms,'sunray' or 'sunburst', or 'spicule', are used for periosteal new bone formation in which new bone is formed perpendicular to the coex resulting in multiple lines like sunrays. This event could occur when the periosteum is rapidly stripped from the coex. It is believed that a variety of substances that contact the inner surface of the exposed periosteum can cause new bone formation. These substances include inflammatory products from infection, blood from trauma, granulomatous reactions or neoplasms. Although the sunray pattern is highly suggestive of osteosarcoma and chrondrosarcoma, other jaw lesions sometimes show this feature, such as hemangioma, complex odontoma odontogenic myxoma, benign cementoblastoma and multiple myeloma.",C

Which of the following statement about the pathophysiology of mitral stenosis is accurate,Patients with mitral stenosis have decreased left atrial pressure.,Patients with mitral stenosis generally have an under-loaded left ventricle.,The increased pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricles results in left ventricular hyperophy.,Diastolic filling of the left ventricle is increased in mitral stenosis because of the increased pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle.,"The pathophysiology of mitral stenosis involves impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle because of an obstruction at the level of the mitral valve. This results in a pressure gradient between the left atrium and the left ventricle. Consequently, left atrial pressure rises while the left ventricle is under-filled. As left atrial pressure increases, pulmonary venous return is impaired and pulmonary hypeension with right ventricular failure can occur.",B

False statements about carcinoma esophagus are all of the following except: March 2007,Most common in lower third,"Histologically, adenocarcinoma only",Unrelated to tobacco chewing,It is more common in females,"Ans. A: Most common in lower third There are a number of risk factors for esophageal cancer: Age-Most patients are over 60. Gender-It is more common in men. Heredity-It is more likely in people who have close relatives with cancer. Tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use increase the risk. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its resultant Barrett's esophagus increase esophageal cancer risk due to the chronic irritation of the mucosal lining (adenocarcinoma is more common in this condition, while all other risk factors predispose more for squamous cell carcinoma). Human papillomavirus (HPV) Paicular dietary substances, such as nitrosamine. Plummer-Vinson syndrome (anemia and esophageal webbing) Tylosis and Howel-Evans syndrome (hereditary thickening of the skin of the palms and soles). Radiation therapy for other conditions in the mediastinum. Celiac disease predisposes towards squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma may develop at the achalasia segment due to persistent retention esophagitis as a result of fermentation of food residues. The location of the tumor is generally measured by the distance from the teeth. The esophagus (25 cm or 10 inches long) is commonly divided into three pas for purposes of determining the location. Adenocarcinomas tend to occur distally and squamous cell carcinomas proximally, but the converse may also be the case. Worldwide squamous cell carcinoma is most common whereas adenocarcinomas predominates in the west. Squamous cell carcinomas are similar to head and neck cancer in their appearance and association with tobacco and alcohol consumption. Adenocarcinomas are often associated with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopy is the first line investigation for most patients.",A

The recent treatment of short bridle passable stricture of urethra in the penile and bulbous urethra is-,Internal urethrotomy with Thompson-Walker's urethrotome,Optical internal urethrotomy,Syme's operation,Wheelhouse operation,"Campbell says “The data show that strictures at the bulbous urethra that are < 1.5 cm in length and not associated with dense, deep spongiofibrosis (i.e. straddle injuries) can be managed with internal urethrotomy, with a 74% moderately long-term success rate.”
• Internal urethrotomy refers to any procedure that opens the stricture by incising it transurethrally .
• Internal urethrotomy is done for short, soft, passable, bulbar stricture.
• The urethrotomy procedure involves incision through the scar to healthy tissue to allow the scar to expand (release of scar contracture) and the lumen to heal enlarged.
• MC complication of internal urethrotomy is recurrence of stricture.
• The data show that strictures at the bulbous urethra that are < 1.5 cm in length and not associated with dense, deep spongiofibrosis (i.e. straddle injuries) can be managed with internal urethrotomy, with a 74% moderately long-term success rate .",B
Cardiac arrest developed due to local anaesthetic systemic absorption. All are management except-,Cardiac compression,Adrenaline,20 % intralipid emulsion,Vasopressin,"Vasopressin not used Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms for cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be followed should cardiac arrest occur. Chest compressions should be initiated immediately and continued until return of spontaneous circulation. If epinephrine is used, small initial doses of <=1 ug[?]kg-1 are preferred to avoid impaired pulmonary gas exchange and increased afterload. Vasopressin is not recommended for use as it has been associated with adverse outcomes in animal models. In the absence of rapid recovery following advanced life suppo measures and intravenous lipid emulsion therapy, early consideration should be given to cardiopulmonary bypass for circulatory suppo. The inotropic effect of lipid emulsion therapy only occurs once the myocardial LA levels are below a threshold that corresponds to ion channel blocking concentrations. This emphasizes the impoance of effective chest compressions to ensure coronary perfusion is sufficient to reduce LA tissue levels in order to obtain the benefit of lipid emulsion therapy. If cardiac output is maintained but there are deleterious CVS effects - such as arrhythmias, conduction block, progressive hypotension, and bradycardia - standard Advanced Cardiac Life Suppo algorithms should be followed with the omission of LA, such as lidocaine, for the treatment of arrhythmia. Amiodarone is the first-line antiarrhythmic in the event of ventricular dysrhythmia.",D

Most common cause of secondary tumors affecting spinal cord is from,Secondaries from prostate gland,Secondaries from breasts,Secondaries from lungs,Secondaries from gastrointestinal tract,"(C) Secondaries from lungs # Secondary spinal cord tumors, which are more common, are metastases of cancer originating in another part of the body and thus are always cancerous. Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebrae from cancers that originate in the lungs, breasts, prostate gland, kidneys, or thyroid gland. Metastases compress the spinal cord or nerve roots from the outside. Lymphomas may also spread to the spine and compress the spinal cord.> Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, possibly causing additional symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the vertebrae (bones of the spine), pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal part of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence. Spread to the lymph nodes can cause a swelling or lump, either under your arm or in another part of the body. If the lymph nodes in your armpit are affected, your hand and arm may swell. Secondary breast cancer in the bone can cause aching or pain in the affected bone. If the breast cancer has spread to your liver you may feel ill and tired. Women with secondary breast cancer in their lungs usually first notice a cough, or find that they get short of breath easily. If a secondary breast cancer develops in the brain, you may have headaches and feel sick. Secondary spinal cord tumors, which are more common, are metastases of cancer originating in another part of the body and thus are always cancerous. Metastases most commonly spread to the vertebrae from cancers that originate in the lungs, breasts, prostate gland, kidneys, or thyroid gland. Metastases compress the spinal cord or nerve roots from the outside. Lymphomas may also spread to the spine and compress the spinal cord.

The most probable diagnosis is:,Takayasu arteritis,Giant cell artertis,Hypersensitivity angitis,Thrmoboangitis obliterans,"About other options  
Takayasu's Arteritis :

does not involve the peripheral limb vessels. Its an inflammatory and stenotic disease of medium and large-sized arteries characterized by a strong predilection for the aortic arch and its branches (thus also k/an aortic arch syndrome)

Giant cell arteritis:

also, k/a cranial arteritis or temporal arteritis is a systemic chronic inflammatory vascular disease with many characteristics similar to Takayasu disease
involves medium and large-sized arteries, characteristically one or more branches of the carotid artery, particularly the temporal artery.

Hypersensitivity angiitis

hypersensitivity angiitis also k/a cutaneous vasculitis or leukocytoclastic vasculitis typically involves the small vessels of the skin. Postcapillary venules are most commonly involved vessels; capillaries and arterioles are involved less frequently.
its the most commonly encountered vasculitis in clinical practice.

What is the time period for perimoem cesarean section in pregnant female with cardiac arrest?,4 min,5 min,8 min,10 min,"If we are doing resuscitation of a pregnant female in cardiac arrest and no successful in return of spontaneous circulation within 4 min then we have to go for perimoem cesarean section. If attempts at maternal resuscitation fail, consider immediate cesarean section. Gestational age greater than 23 weeks is the recommended cut-off for immediate delivery. A fetus younger than 23 weeks has an extremely poor prognosis. Such instances of perimoem delivery are rare, and the chances of fetal survival are generally poor. The earlier the fetus is delivered following maternal arrest the better is the fetal survival. Delivery should be conducted in the mother's current location; transpoation to an operating room wastes valuable time. Cesarean section should be performed no later than 4 minutes after initial maternal arrest. A fetus delivered within 5 min from initiation of CPR has the best chance for survival.

If the contents of a hydrocele are allowed to drain into a collecting vessel, the liquid does not clot; however, the fluid coagulates if mixed with even a trace of blood that has been in contact with damaged tissue.* About 5% of inguinal hernias are associated with a vaginal hydrocele on the same side.* In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent.* Encysted hydrocele of the cord is a smooth oval swelling near the spermatic cord, which is liable to be mistaken for an inguinal hernia.

Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia is seen in all of the following diseases except aEUR',Antiphosphplipid antibody syndrome,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Microscopic polyangitis,Metallic cardiac valves,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome Metallic cardiac valves do not cause microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Don't mix microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with fragmentation syndrome. They are two separate entities, according to most standard text in hematology. Fragmentation syndrome Red cells when subjected to mechanical trauma may undergo .fragmentation in circulation. These fragment cells have shapes like triangular cells, helmet cells and are known as schistiocytes and are easily made out in a well made peripheral blood, film. Schistiocytes are the hallmark of diagnosis of this group of hemolytic anemia. Fragmentation of the red cell can occur either in large vessels or small vessels of capillaries and aerioles. Microangiopathic hemolytic Anemia When fragmentation occurs in small vessels of capillaries and aerioles due to the presence of thrombotic lesions, it is called microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is characterized by hemolytic anemia due to red cell .fragmentation. There is associated small vessel disease of capillaries and aerioles with thrombotic lesions. As the red cells pass through these microthrombi, red cells get attached to them and pa of RBC's get .fragmented by high shear forces. But the problem is that Harrison does not make any distinction between these two:? - It is clearly mentioned in Harrison table 101-6 page 658 that microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia occurs in prosthetic hea walls. - C.M.D.T also shares same views. We may have to go against Harrison in this case (may be they might have loosely used the term microangiopathic hemolytic anemia).",A

A 7yr. old boy with abrupt onset of pain in hip with hip held in abduction. Hernogram is normal. ESR is raised. What is the next line of management:,Hospitalize and observe,Ambulatory observation,Intravenous antiobiotics,USG guided aspiration of hip,"USG guided aspiration of hip There are two very common causes of an acute hip/groin pain, which commonly are very challenging to diagnose: septic ahritis and transient synovitis. Septic ahritis and transient synovitis are completely unrelated, although both might manifest with hip pain, restricted range of movement of the hip. Differentiating between these two is vital, because while transient synovitis is a benign self-limiting disorder, the septic ahritis if untreated is catastrophic with permanent damage to the hip. Treatment for septic ahritis and for transient synovitis is entirely different. While transient synovitis can be managed by observation and anti-inflammatory agents; septic ahritis needs aggressive management with intravenous antibiotics with or without surgical debridement. Lets, first see the two conditions and the differences between them: Transient synovitis (also k/a toxic synovitis, observation hip. irritable hip) Its a self-limiting, inflammatory condition of the synovium, that lasts only a sho time (therefore k/a transient) Its the most CO/11111On cause of hip pain and limp in children under 10 yrs of age. Although the cause of transient synovitis is unclear, evidence suggests it is associated with immune responses to viral or bacterial antigens, mediated through the synol membrane. Synol fluid rapidly accumulates under pressure in the hip joint, and there may be severe pain from capsular distension. The fluid is resorbed within 3-7 days, with no long term sequelae. Presentation is with hip pain or limp. Hip can be held in flexion, abduction and external rotation depending on the degree of effusion. Physical examination is characterized by guarded rotation of the hip joint. Pain can usually be elicited at the extremes of motion, especially abduction and medial rotation. The ESR and C-reactive protein are usually normal but may be mildly elevated. The WBC count is generally normal with a normal differential. Rest is the primary method of treatment (thus it's also k/a observation hip). In most patients the symptoms resolve in 3 to 7 days. Differentiation from septic ahritis: The very impoant distinction between transient synovitis and septic ahritis is in the first instance clinical. The patient with transient synovitis is not sick, appears cheerful and healthy and, if there is fever, it is usually of a low-grade nature. Whereas a child with septic process is seriously ill, with high grade fever. Pain is severe and the patient is unable to bear weight. A patient of transient synovitis may be able to walk with a limp, however depending on the extent of effusion the pain in transient synovitis may also be severe enough as to render the child incapable of walking. In septic ahritis, WBC count, ESR and C-reactive protein are significantly raised. U/S may show joint fluid in both the conditions. 'Within the past 5 years three excellent papers have been published that help differentiate between benign, transient synovitis and the potentially dangerous septic ahritis. In the two studies by Kocher et al - A history of fever, together with - Non-Weight bearing, and - ESR higher than 40 mm, and - A serum WBC count higher than 12000 cells/mm3 all pointed clearly toward septic ahritis. The probability of having septic ahritis with all four predictor was 99.6%. However, in a study Luhmann et al the probability was only 59% with all four predictors. They found that a history of fever, a WBC> 12000. and a previous health care visit yielded a 71% probability of septic ahritis. 'Current diagnosis & treatment in spos medicine By Patrick J. McMahon 1/e p210 Now lets come to the question. Here we see that the information supplied is insufficient. ESR is raised but how much, its not given. The WBC count is normal, so we can think in lines of Transient synovitis, but Turek ohopaedics writes about septic ahritis- 'The peripheral WBC count is usually elevated, as is the sedimentation rate, although the diagnosis of septic ahritis should not be excluded simply on the basis of normal values for these two studies.' So here the diagnosis is unceain. Thus we will proceed with usg guided aspiration of the hip as the next line of management.

In an emphysematous patient with hullous lesion which is the best investigation to measure lung volumes,Body plethysmography,Helium dilution,Trans diaphragmatic pressure,DLCO,"Body plethysmography During pulmonary function testing, lung volumes are usually measured by the spirometer. But ceain lung volumes e.g., RV, FRC and TLC cannot be measured by spirometer because they include the volume of the gas left in the lung (i.e., this air cannot come out of the lung, however.forcefully one may expire). Two techniques are commonly used to measure the lung volumes. - Helium dilution method. - Body plethysmography. Helium dilution method In the helium dilution method, the subject repeatedly breathes in and out from a reservoir with a known volume of gas containing a trace amount of helium. The helium is diluted by the gas previously present in the lungs and very little is absorbed into the pulmonary circulation. From knowledge of the reservoir volume and the initial and final helium concentrations, the volume of the gas present in the lungs can he calculated. The helium dilution method may underestimate the volume of gas in lungs if there are slowly communicating airspaces such as bullae. In this situation, lung volumes can be measured more accurately with a body plethysmography a sealed box in which patient sits while panting against a closed mouthpiece. Because there is no airflow into or out of the plethysmography the pressure changes in the thorax during panting cause compression and rarefaction of gas in the lungs and simultaneous rarefaction and compression of gas in the plethysmograph. By measuring the pressure changes in the plethysmograph and at the mouthpiece the volume of gas in the thorax can he calculated using Boyle's law.",A

Tissue suturing glue contains:,Cyanoacrylate,Ethanolamine oleate,Methacrylate,Polychloroprene,"Most tissue adhesives or glue are cyanoacrylate polymers, such as n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (eg, Histoacryl®, PeriAcryl®) or 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (eg, Dermabond®, Surgiseal).
Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue.
Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair.
Advantages:

Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injection
More rapid application and repair time
Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair
	Waterproof barrier
Antimicrobial properties
Better acceptance by patients
No need for suture removal or follow-up

Indications and contraindications:


For use of tissue adhesives the wound needs to be clean, dry with near perfect hemostasis and under no tension.
Complex stellate lesions or crush injuries should not be closed with tissue adhesives since good wound approximation is difficult to achieve.
Tissue adhesives are not recommended for lacerations of the hands, feet, or joints, since repetitive movements could cause the adhesive bond to break before sufficient tensile strength is achieved.
Tissue adhesives are not recommended for the oral mucosa or other mucosal surfaces or areas of high moisture such as the axillae and perineum.
Lacerations involving the hairline or vermilion border require more precision, and should be repaired with traditional sutures.",A

Which of the following investigations is most useful to assess the extent of her osteoporosis?,Spinal x-rays,DEXA scan,"Full blood count, bone and liver biochemistry blood test",Vitamin D levels,"Osteoporosis is a loss of the bone mass. It is impoant to note that the mineralization of the bone is normal. This loss of bone mass means there is an increasing likelihood of fracture with increasing age. Due to the accelerated loss of bone mass following the menopause, elderly women are at a higher risk of osteoporosis than men. There are numerous risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. Among them are Caucasian and Asian ethnic groups, female sex, increasing age, early menopause, smoking, excess alcohol, coicosteroid use, hypogonadism and rheumatoid ahritis. The reduced bone mass of osteoporosis may result in veebral crush fractures, the majority of which are asymptomatic. The extent of osteoporosis is best investigated with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. This gives a T score, which is the number of standard detions the patient's bone mineral density differs from the population average for a young healthy adult. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as a T score of -2.5 or greater (i.e. the bone mineral density of more than 2.5 standard detion below that of the average for a young healthy adult). A T score of between -1.5 and -2.5 is defined as osteopenia. Spinal x-rays (A) are useful to assess veebral crush fractures but cannot assess extent of osteoporosis.

"A 65-year-old smoker presents with hoarseness, hemoptysis and a hard painless lump in the left supraclavicular fossa. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate diagnostic step in this patient?",Undeake an open biopsy of the neck lump,Undeake a radical neck dissection,Do fine needle aspiration cytology,Give a trial of Anti tuberculous therapy,"This patient presenting with a history of smoking along with symptoms and presence of hard painless mass in left supraclavicular fossa probably indicates the presence of an underlying lung malignancy which has metastasised to the lymph node. Open biopsy is especially indicated when the patients history and physical findings suggest malignancy i.e solitary, hard, nontender cervical node in an older patient who is a chronic user of tobacco, supraclavicular adenopathy and in solitary or generalized adenopathy that is firm and mobile suggestive of lymphoma. Fine-needle aspiration should be reserved for thyroid nodules and for confirmation of relapse in patients whose primary diagnosis is known. Supraclavicular and scalene lymph node enlargement is always abnormal. As these nodes drain regions of the lung and retroperitoneal space they can reflect lymphomas, other cancers or infectious processes arising in these areas. Virchow's node refers to enlarged left supraclavicular node infiltrated with metastatic cancer from a gastrointestinal primary. Metastases to supraclavicular nodes also occur from lung, breast, testis, or ovarian cancers. Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and toxoplasmosis are non neoplastic causes of supraclavicular adenopathy.

An alcoholic patient with history diabetic nephropathy and liver failure is posted for open abdomen surgery. The most appropriate muscle relaxant in this patient is:,Cisatracurium,Rocuronium,Vecuronium,Rapacuronium,"Cisatracurium is a stereoisomer of atracurium that is four times more potent. Like atracurium, it undergoes degradation in plasma at physiological pH and temperature by organ-independent Hofmann elimination. The resulting metabolites (a monoquaternary acrylate and laudanosine) have no neuromuscular blocking effects. Because of cisatracurium's greater potency, the amount of laudanosine produced for the same extent and duration of neuromuscular blockade is much less than with atracurium. Nonspecific esterases are not involved in the metabolism of cisatracurium. Metabolism and elimination are independent of renal or liver failure hence can be given in hepatic and renal failure.

All are complication of PEEP except :-,Decreased urine ouput,Increased blood pressure,Increased intracranial pressure,Increased intrathoracic pressure,"Positive end expiratory pressure decreases venous return and decreases cardiac output and hence blood pressure decreases and decreased perfusion so urine output can reduce. Pulmonary barotrauma is a frequentcomplicationofPEEPtherapy. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and interstitial emphysema may lead to rapid deterioration of a patient maintained on mechanical ventilation with an already compromised respiratory status. Positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP is a mode of therapy used in conjunction with mechanical ventilation. At the end of mechanical or spontaneous exhalation, PEEP maintains the patient's airway pressure above the atmospheric level by exeing pressure that opposes passive emptying of the lung. This pressure is typically achieved by maintaining a positive pressure flow at the end of exhalation. This pressure is measured in centimeters of water. PEEP therapy can be effective when used in patients with a diffuse lung disease that results in an acute decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of gas that remains in the lung at the end of a normal expiration. FRC is determined by primarily the elastic characteristics of the lung and chest wall. In many pulmonary diseases, FRC is reduced because of the collapse of the unstable alveoli. This reduction in lung volume decreases the surface area available for gas exchange and results in intrapulmonary shunting (unoxygenated blood returning to the left side of the hea). If FRC is not restored, a high concentration of inspired oxygen may be required to maintain the aerial oxygen content of the blood in an acceptable range. Applying PEEP increases alveolar pressure and alveolar volume. The increased lung volume increases the surface area by reopening and stabilizing collapsed or unstable alveoli. This splinting, or propping open, of the alveoli with positive pressure improves the ventilation-perfusion match, reducing the shunt effect. After a true shunt is modified to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch with PEEP, lowered concentrations of oxygen can be used to maintain an adequate PaO2. PEEP therapy may also be effective in improving lung compliance. When FRC and lung compliance are decreased, additional energy and volume are required to inflate the lung. By applying PEEP, the lung volume at the end of exhalation is increased. The already paially inflated lung requires less volume and energy than before for full inflation. When used to treat patients with a diffuse lung disease, PEEP should improve compliance, decrease dead space, and decrease the intrapulmonary shunt effect. The most impoant benefit of the use of PEEP is that it enables the patient to maintain an adequate PaO2 at a low and safe concentration of oxygen (< 60%), reducing the risk of oxygen toxicity . Because PEEP is not a benign mode of therapy and because it can lead to serious hemodynamic consequences, the ventilator operator should have a definite indication to use it. The addition of external PEEP is typically justified when a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg cannot be achieved with an FIO2 of 60% or if the estimated initial shunt fraction is greater than 25%. No evidence suppos adding external PEEP during initial setup of the ventilator to satisfy misguided attempts to supply prophylactic PEEP or physiologic PEEP.",B

"All of the following agents can be given for induction of anaesthesia in children, EXCEPT:1",Halothane,Servoflurane,Morphine,Nitrous oxide,"Morphine has pharmacokinetic differences in young individuals, that may predispose them to develop respiratory depression. So this drug should be used with caution in infants less than 6 months of age who are not ventilated. Drugs used in the induction of anesthesia in children are a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide. Other drugs which are useful are sevoflurane or halothane. Sevoflurane is considered to be the agent of choice for inhalational induction rather than halothane, because sevoflurane has a wider therapeutic safety window in terms of cardiovascular depression and has no unpleasant smell.

"Hari ram a 70 year old male presents with h/o lower GI bleed for the last 6 months. Sigmoidoscopic examination shows a mass, of 4 cms about 3.5 cms above the anal verge. The treatment of choice is:",Colostomy,Anterior resection,Abdominoperineal resection,Dysfunctional anastomosis,"Treatment of rectal cancer: Surgical and oncological management varies greatly depending on the stage of the tumor within the rectum. Superficially invasive, small cancers may be managed effectively with local excision. However, most patients have more deeply invasive tumors that require major surgery, such as low anterior resection or abdominoperineal resection. Low anterior resection: This is a sphincter saving procedure. In this procedure the sigmoid colon and proximal rectum are removed. The descending colon is anastomosed to the distal rectum. Previously this sphincter saving LAR procedure was possible for lesions confined in upper ? rd of rectum. Lesions in lower third were treated with APR with permanent colostomy. With the introduction of stapling gun, the sphincter saving LAR operation can now be done even in lesions of lower ? of rectum, provided a margin of 2 cm or more of normal bowel can be resected below the lesions but above the dentate line. 1 cm of margins can be adequate, provided the carcinoma is well differentiated. Abdominoperineal resection (also known as Miles procedure): In this procedure there is complete excision of the distal sigmoid colon, rectum and anus, by the concomitant dissection through the abdomen and perineum with creation of permanent colostomy. APR is performed when adequate distal margins for LAR cannot be obtained i.e. for carcinoma in lower rectum. Local excision: In carefully selected patients with small, well differentiated, superficial, mobile polypoid lesions, a full thickness excision can be performed through the transrectal route as the definitive therapy. Local excision can be done for selected T1 and T2 lesions without evidence of nodal disease. Palliative procedures: unresectable rectal cancers can be palliated by fulguration (electrocoagulation) or laser photocoagulation. Chemoradiation: Chemoradiation can be given as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. 'In this patient the tumor lies 3.5 cms above the anal verge (the lower limit is taken into consideration). Dentate line is just 2 cms from the anl verge so the tumor is just 1.5 cm from the dentate line. A minimum margin of 2 cm is required below the tumor for sphincter saving LAR, so the patient will have to go an APR procedure to remove the tumor'.

For example, radiation therapy, such as used for treatment of pelvic gynecologic and rectal malignancies, can result in chronic injury to the small intestine characterized by fibrosis and poor wound healing. High-output fistulas, defined as those with more than 500 cc per day output, are usually proximal and unlikely to close.

High airway resistance is seen in,Respiratory bronchiole,Intermediate bronchiole,Terminal bronchiole,Main bronchus,"Resistance impedes airflow into (and out of) the lung. The major component of resistance is the resistance exeed by the airways (large and small), and a minor component is the sliding of the lung and the chest wall tissue elements during inspiration (and expiration). Resistance is overcome by (driving) pressure. In spontaneous breathing, Resistance (R) is calculated as driving pressure (DP) divided by the resultant gas flow (F): R = DP/F The value of airway resistance is approximately 1 cm H2O/L/sec, and is higher in obstructive lung disease (e.g., COPD, asthma); in severe asthma, it is elevated approximately tenfold. The presence of an endotracheal tube adds a resistance of 5 (or 8) cm H2O/L/min for a tube with an internal diameter of size 8 (or 7) cm. For any tube for which the airflow is laminar (smooth, streamlined), the resistance increases in direct propoion to the tube length and increases dramatically (to the fouh power) as the diameter of the tube is reduced. Two factors explain why most (approximately 80%) of the impedance to gas flow occurs in the large airways. First, as bronchi progressively branch, the resistances are arranged in parallel and the total cross-sectional area at the level of the terminal bronchioles adds up to almost tenfold that at the trachea. Second, in tubes that are large, irregular or branched, the flow is often turbulent, not laminar. When flow is laminar: F(lam) = DP/R In contrast, when the flow is turbulent: F(turb) = DP/R2 Therefore, for a given radius, far more pressure is required to achieve comparable flow where the flow is turbulent; thus, the effo required is greater, and if prolonged or severe, respiratory failure is more likely.

Not true about CPR?,Chest compressions at 100/min,Ratio 30:2,Chest compression > 6 inches,Breathing rate 8-10 breaths/min,"Ans is 'c' i.e. Chest compressions > 6 inches Management guidelines for CPR * The management of CPR should be done in following sequence: - A (Airway) - B (Breathing) - C (Circulation) - D (Defibrillation).* Management is divided into following parts: -A) Basic life support (Primary ABCD)# Basic life support (BLS) involves early recognition of medical emergencies, activation of an emergency response system, and interventions made in response to sudden cardiac arrest, heart attack, stroke and airway obstruction by a foreign body. ABCD of BLS are: -i) Airway management: - Most common cause of airway obstruction is tongue fall, i.e., tongue falling back on posterior pharyngeal wall and obstructing the airway. In BLS, this airway obstruction is managed manually: -a) Open mouth and clear airway if something is visible in oral cavity.b) Tilt the head backward (neck extension) and chin lift -> Head tilt and chin lift.c) Jaw thrust: - Mandible is pulled forward.# Note: In patient with cervical spine injury head tilt & chin lift is contraindicated and airway should be managed only by jaw thrust.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - After management of airway obstruction ventilation is provided. In BLS ventilation is provided by mouth to mouth or mouth to nose or bag and mask ventilation.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. It is done in supine position and compression over lower l/3rd of sternum is given by heel of two hands one locked over the other. The force generated during massage should be able to depress the sternum by 1 1/2 -2 inches (approximately 1/3 of chest wall diameter). The ratio of compression to ventilation is 30:2(30 compressions followed by 2 breaths) irrespective of durationiv) Defibrillation: - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillatorB) Advanced life support (secondary ABCD)# Advanced airway support involves more advanced assessment and treatment. ABCD of advanced life support are: -i) Airway management: - Airway management is done by equipments like GuedeVs airway.ii) Breathing (ventilation): - Most definitive and best method of ventilation is endotracheal intubation. Other methods are LMA or tracheostomy. In severe maxillofacial injuries orotracheal intubation should be tried first, if orotracheal intubation is very difficult cricothyrotomy or tracheostomy can be used but only as a last resort.iii) Circulation: - Circulation is maintained by cardiac massage. Compression will be continued at a rate of 100 compressions!minute and breathing at a rate of 8-10 breaths/minute with no synchronization, i.e., no pause for ventilation.iv) Defibrillation : - Defibrillation is done by manual defibrillator.",C

Therefore, hypotension may not be observed, and neither are the other signs of circulatory inadequacy that are typical of isotonic or hypotonic dehydration. Signs suggesting involvement of the central nervous system (such as irritability or lethargy) are characteristic of hypeonic dehydration. Slow correction of this hypernatremia (over 24 to 48 h) prevents significant fluid shifts and increased intercranial pressure. Initial bolus therapy should be with isotonic fluid such as normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution. Blood products such as fresh-frozen plasma are not indicated, and hypotonic solutions such as D10W and 1/4 NS could cause rapid fluid shifts, resulting in cerebral edema and death.

Which of the following local anaesthetic is a strong vasoconstrictor?,Procaine,Cocaine,Lignocaine,All of the above,"Cocaine inhibits the neuronal membrane transpoers for catecholamines, thereby potentiating the effect of NE at adrenergic receptors in the vasculature, resulting in vasoconstriction and reduced cocaine absorption in vascular beds where adrenergic effects predominate. Ropivacaine and bupivacaine also cause vasoconstriction. Cocaine is used only in the nose, nasopharynx, mouth, throat, and ear, where it uniquely produces vasoconstriction as well as anesthesia. The shrinking of mucous membranes decreases operative bleeding while improving surgical visualization. Comparable vasoconstriction can be achieved with other local anesthetics by the addition of a low concentration of a vasoconstrictor such as phenylephrine (0.005%). Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K.

In recurrent cases, a characteristic fistula tract often tunnels under the smooth muscle of the nipple and opens onto the skin at the edge of the areola.* Many women have an inverted nipple, most likely as a secondary effect of the underlying inflammation.* More than 90% of the afflicted are smokers. It has been suggested that a relative deficiency of vitamin A associated with smoking or toxic substances in tobacco smoke alter the differentiation of the ductal epithelium.* The key feature is keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the nipple ducts. Keratin shed from these cells plugs the ductal system, causing dilation and eventually rupture of the duct. An intense chronic granulomatous inflammatory response develops once keratin spills into the surrounding periductal tissue.* With recurrences, a secondary anaerobic bacterial infection may supervene and cause acute inflammation.* Simple incision drains the abscess cavity, but the offending keratinizing epithelium remains and recurrences are common.* In most cases, en bloc surgical removal of the involved duct and contiguous fistula tract is curative. If secondary bacterial infection is present, antibiotics also have a therapeutic role.",A

What is the fresh gas flow in Mapleson A circuit:-,Equal to minute ventilation,Twice the minute ventilation,2.5 times the minute ventilation,Half the minute ventilation,"Mapleson A or the Magill circuit is the circuit of choice for spontaneous ventilation. In all mapleson circuits, rebreathing of carbon dioxide is prevented by an adequate fresh gas flow and by the presence of adjustable pressure release valve. The exhaled carbon dioxide flows through the outer corrugated tube and out this valve from where it can be scavenged. Out of these, Mapleson A circuit is considered the best for spontaneous ventilation because it requires a fresh gas inflow rate of only 1 times minute ventilation to prevent rebreathing of carbon dioxide. In mapleson circuits D, E, and F, the amount of fresh gas flow required is 2.5 times a minute ventilation and in mapleson circuits B and C, it is much higher. But the disadvantage of mapleson circuit A is that it is not very useful in controlled ventilation because a minute ventilation as high as 20 L/minute (fresh gas flow rate should be greater than 3 times a minute ventilation) is needed to prevent rebreathing.",A

Not true regarding sub dural haematoma,Occurs on both sides,X-Ray not visible,Surgery can be done,Unilateral surgery,"Acute subdural haematoma Acute subdural haematoma encountered in two broadly distinct contexts. Firstly, high-energy injury mechanisms can result in the rupture of coical surface vessels with significant associated primary brain injury. This results in expanding haematoma with rapid deterioration anddeveloping signs of raised ICP, reminiscent of extradural haematoma without the lucid interval. These collections require prompt evacuation, typically by craniotomy or craniectomy. In a second group of patients, older and often anticoagulated, a lower-energy injury leads to venous bleeding around the brain. Depending on the total volume of bleeding, the resulting haematoma may present early as acute subdural haematoma, after delay and osmotic expansion as chronic sub- dural haematoma or may even remain clinically silent. This latter group may present much later with a fuher 'acute-on- chronic' subdural haematoma. On diagnosis, clotting function should be corrected wherever possible. Bleeds of significant size, with significant associated midline shift or with deteriorating neurology, require urgent evacuation. Smaller bleeds in neurologically stable patients may be managed conservatively, at least initially: liquefaction of the clot over 7-10 days after the bleed may allow for a much less invasive evacuation through burr holesSince the dura is not adherent to the brain as it is to the skull, subdural blood is free to expand across the brain surface giving a diffuse concave appearance.

Warthin tumors have arisen within cervical lymph nodes, a finding that should not be mistaken for metastases.These neoplasms are benign, with recurrence rates of only 2% after resection",A
True about small bowel tumour -,Commonly located in duodenum,Lymphoma is common,Adenocarcinoma has good prognosis,Palliative surgeries are done even in presence of metastasis,"• MC malignant neoplasms of the small bowel: Carcinoid tumors >adenocarcinomas >malignant GISTs >lymphomas.
• Adenocarcinomas are more numerous in the proximal small bowel, whereas the other malignant lesions are more common in the distal intestine (ileum).
Clinical Features
• In contrast to benign lesions, malignant neoplasms almost always produce symptoms
• MC symptom: Abdominal pain >weight loss
• Obstruction develops in 15-35% of patients and, in contrast to the intussusception produced by benign lesions, is usually the result of tumor infiltration and adhesions.
• Diarrhea with tenesmus and passage of large amounts of mucus may occur.
• Adenocarcinomas may produce the typical constricting apple-core lesions similar to those observed in the colon.
• Gastrointestinal bleeding is more common with leiomyosarcomas.
• A palpable mass may be felt in 10-20% of patients, and perforations develop in about 10%, usually secondary to lymphomas and sarcomas.
Diagnosis
• Barium meal follow through (BMFT): Accurate diagnosis in 50–70% of patients with malignant neoplasms of the small intestine
• Enteroclysis (small bowel enema): Diagnostic accuracy of about 90%
Treatment
• Wide resection including regional lymph nodes.
• Often, surgical resection for cure is not possible. Therefore, palliative resection should be performed to prevent further complications of bleeding, obstruction, and perforation.
• Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy have little role in the treatment of patients with adenocarcinomas of the small bowel.
Prognosis
• Only half of the patients operated on for malignant tumors of the small intestine have lesions amenable to curative resection.
• One third have a distant metastasis at the time of initial surgery
• Overall 5-year survival rate after surgical treatment of malignant tumors is only 25%
• Adenocarcinoma has the poorest prognosis, with an overall survival rate of 15-20%.
• Obstruction in CA small bowel develops in 15-35% of patients, due to tumor infiltration and adhesions.
• Obstruction in benign lesions is due to intussusceptions.",D

Postoperatively, she develops a leak from the pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis and becomes septic. A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed, which demonstrates an increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. She also develops acute renal failure and oliguria. Which of the following is an indication to sta dopamine?",To increase splanchnic flow,To increase coronary flow,To decrease hea rate,To lower peripheral vascular resistance,"Dopamine has a variety of pharmacologic characteristics that make it useful in critically ill patients. At all doses, the diastolic blood pressure can be expected to rise; since coronary perfusion is largely a result of the head of pressure at the coronary ostia, coronary blood flow should be increased. In low doses (1-5 mg/), dopamine affects primarily the dopaminergic receptors. Activation of these receptors causes vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild vasoconstriction of the peripheral bed, which thereby redirects blood flow to kidneys and bowel. At these low doses, the net effect on the overall vascular resistance may be slight. As the dose rises (2-10 mg/), b1 -receptor activity predominates and the inotropic effect on the myocardium leads to increased cardiac output and blood pressure. Above 10 mg/(kg*min), a-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting of blood from extremities to organs, decreased kidney function, and hypeension.",B

What is the most probable diagnosis",metastatic germ cell tumour,metastatic melanoma,lymphoma,metastatic transitional cell tumour,"Ans is 'a' i.e. metastatic germ cell tumor 'Testicular tumors tend to metastasize via the lymphatic system. In general, the testicular lymphatics, which follow the course of the testicular arteries/veins, drain directly into the lymph nodes in or near the renal hilus. After involvement of these sentinel nodes, the lumbar paraaortic nodes become involved (unilaterally or bilaterally), followed by spread to the mediastinal and supraclavicular nodes or hematogenous dissemination to the lungs, liver and brain. Lee SagelThis necrotic retroperitoneal mass represents necrotic lymph nodes.Necrotic lymph nodes usually suggest malignant metastasis; however benign inflammatory diseases may also cause necrotic lymphadenopathy.Lymphoma though a common cause of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy usually does not show necrosis, and is thus ruled out.Metastases to retroperitoneal lymph nodes may come from virtually any abdominal or pelvic neoplasm, but the most common ones are testicular, prostatic, cervical, endometrial, and renal.Carcinomas of the bladder, prostate, cervix, and uterus initially spread to the pelvic nodes.Testicular, ovarian, and fallopian tube malignancies spread first to the retroperitoneal nodes adjacent to or near the renal hila but may involve the pelvic nodes by retrograde spread.Testicular neoplasms are the most common solid tumor in men 15 to 34 years old .(Ref: Lee Sagel)",A

Normal value is 35-45 mm Hg (4% to 6%).o Capnography works on the principle that infrared light is absorbed by carbon dioxide. A beam of infrared light is passed across the gas sample to fall on to a sensor. The presence of CO2 in the gas leads to a reduction in the amount of light falling on the sensor which changes the voltage in the circuit.Uses of CapnographyIt is the surest confirmatory sign of correct intubation in trachea. Incorrect position of tube in esophagus instead of trachea (esophageal intubation) will yield ETC02 = 0.Intraoperative displacement of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will become zero.Obstruction or disconnections of endotracheal tube - ETCO2 will fall.Diagnosing malignant hyperthermia - ETCO2 increases significantly (more than 100 mg Hg).",C

The most common complication of renal osteodystrophy is fracture, which may be insufficiency fractures through osteomalacic bone or pathologic fractures through brown tumors or amyloid deposits. Dialysis patients may experience carpal tunnel syndrome, osteomyelitis, septic ahritis, and osteonecrosis. Renal transplant patients may experience osteonecrosis, tendinitis, tendon rupture, and fracture.",D

Which is a clean surgery -,Hernia surgery,Gastricsurgeru,Cholecystectomy,Rectal surgery',"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Hernia surgeryo Surgical site infections or also k/a wound infectionsAre infections of the tissue, organs or spaces exposed by surgeons during performance of an invasive procedure.They are classified as belowClassification of Surgical WoundsClean Wound (Class I)o Include those in which no infection is present: only skin microflora potentially contaminate the wound.No hollow viscus is entered. No inflammationo Examples : Hernia repair, breast biopsyClean/con taminated wounds (Class II)o Include those in which a hollow viscus such as the respiratory, alimentary or genitourinary tracts with indigenous bacterial flora is opened, but under controlled circumstances without significant spillage of contents. No inflammation.o Examples : Cholecystectomy, elective GI surgery.Contaminated wounds (Class 111)o Include open accidental wounds encountered early after injury, those with extensive introduction of bacteria into a normally sterile area of the body due to major breaks in sterile technique (eg. open cardiac massage); uncontrolled spillage of viscus contents such as from the intestine. Inflammation is apparento Examples : Penetrating abdominal trauma, large tissue injury, enterotomy during bowel obstructionDirty wounds (Class IV)o Include traumatic wounds in which a significant delay in treatment has occurred and in which necrotictissue is present. Includes wounds in which pus is present. Includes those wounds created to access aperforated viscus accompanied by a high degree of contamination. Severe in flammation is seeno Examples : Perforated diverticulitis, necrotizing soft tissue infection.o Various steps are described for the prevention of SSIs, but we will discuss those related to use of antibiotics only.Use of antibiotics as prophylaxis of SSIsWound classAntibiotics ProphylaxisClass IControversial, most surgeons do not giveClass IDProphylactic antibiotics givenClass HProphylactic antibiotics givenClass HI & IVProphylactic as well as therapeutico About prophylactic antibiotics points to know are -By definition prophylaxis is limited to the time prior to and during the operative procedure - 'To be most effective the prophylactic antibiotic agent should be administered intravenously before the incision is made jo that the tissue levels are present at the time the wound is created and exposed to the bacterial contamination. A good time to administer the preoperative dose is when the patient arrives in the operating room. ' -- SabistonThere is no evidence in support of post operative doses of antibiotics.

"An 18 year old patient presents with acute abdominal pain, vomiting and on clinical examination loin tenderness is present. History of pyrexia is absent. The diagnosis is",Acute testicular torsion,Acute appendicitis,Acute pyelonephritis,Acute diverticulitis,"(A) Acute testicular torsion# TESTICULAR TORSION Usually presents with sudden, severe, testicular pain (in groin and lower abdomen) and tenderness. There is often associated nausea and vomiting. Testis may be higher than its normal position. Mild pyrexia and redness of overlying area may be found. Presentation of acute appendicitis includes abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. Appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall. Leads to the localization of the pain to the right lower quadrant. Classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years. Pain can be elicited through signs and can be severe. Signs include localized findings in the right iliac fossa. Abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure (palpation). There is severe pain on sudden release of deep pressure in the lower abdomen (rebound tenderness). If appendix is retrocecal (localized behind the cecum), even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness (silent appendix). This is because the cecum, distended with gas, protects the inflamed appendix from pressure. Similarly, if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis, there is usually complete absence of abdominal rigidity. Digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch. Coughing causes point tenderness in this area (McBurney's point).> Acute pyelonephritis develop rapidly over a few hours or a day & it can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated vomiting.> Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection (fever, unintentional weight loss, malaise, decreased appetite), lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine.> Diverticulitis symptoms may include: Tenderness, cramps, or pain in the abdomen (usually in the lower left side but may occur on the right) that is sometimes worse with movement.

"A 35-year-old female complains of slowly progressive dyspnea. Her history is otherwise unremarkable, and there is no cough, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, or thrombophlebitis. She has taken appetite suppressants at different times. On physical exam, there is jugular venous distention, a palpable right ventricular lift, and a loud P2 hea sound. Chest x-ray shows clear lung fields. ECG shows right axis detion. A perfusion lung scan is normal with no segmental deficits. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is",Primary pulmonary hypeension,Recurrent pulmonary emboli,Cardiac shunt,Interstitial lung disease,"(Braunwald, 15/e, pp 1506-1508.) Although a difficult diagnosis to make, primary pulmonary hypeension is the most likely diagnosis in this young woman who has used appetite suppressants. There has been a recent increase in primary pulmonary hypeension in the individuals consuming fenfluramines, an appetite suppressant. The predominant symptom is dyspnea, which is usually not apparent in the previously healthy young woman until the disease has advanced. When signs of pulmonary hypeension are apparent from physical findings, chest x-ray, or echocardiography, the diagnosis of recurrent pulmonary embolus must be ruled out. In this case, a normal perfusion lung scan makes pulmonary angiography unnecessary. Restrictive lung disease should be ruled out with pulmonary function testing. An echocardiogram will show right ventricular enlargement and a reduction in the left ventricle size consistent with right ventricular pressure overload.",A
"A 65-year-old man undergoes a technically difficult abdominal-perineal resection for a rectal cancer during which he receives 3 units of packed red blood cells. Four hours later, in the intensive care unit (ICU), he is bleeding heavily from his perineal wound. Emergency coagulation studies reveal normal prothrombin, paial thromboplastin, and bleeding times. The fibrin degradation products are not elevated, but the serum fibrinogen content is depressed and the platelet count is 70,000/mL. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his bleeding?",Delayed blood transfusion reaction,Autoimmune fibrinolysis,A bleeding blood vessel in the surgical field,Factor VIII deficiency,"Whenever significant bleeding is noted in the early postoperative period, the presumption should always be that it is due to an error in surgical control of blood vessels in the operative field. Hematologic disorders that are not apparent during the long operation are most unlikely to surface as problems postoperatively. Blood transfusion reactions can cause diffuse loss of clot integrity; the sudden appearance of diffuse bleeding during an operation may be the only evidence of an intraoperative transfusion reaction. In the postoperative period, transfusion reactions usually present as unexplained fever, apprehension, and headache--all symptoms difficult to interpret in the early postoperative period. Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia) would almost ceainly be known by history in a 65-year-old man, but, if not, intraoperative bleeding would have been a problem earlier in this long operation. Moreover, factor VIII deficiency causes prolongation of the paial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is normal in this patient. Severely hypothermic patients will not be able to form clots effectively, but clot dissolution does not occur. Care should be taken to prevent the development of hypothermia during long operations through the use of warmed intravenous fluid, gas humidifiers, and insulated skin barriers.",C

On physical examination he cannot move his feet or ankles and he can barely raise his thighs off the bed. He has symmetrical hyporeflexia of the legs, but his sensorium is completely intact. Scanning his cha, the physician notes that he was treated 10 days previously for an upper respiratory tract infection. The immunological response producing the patient's symptoms is most intense at which of the following locations?",Lateral coicospinal tracts,Neuromuscular junction,Precentral gyrus,Spinal motor nerves,"The patient has developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, also known as inflammatory polyneuropathy. This presentation is classic-rapidly evolving limb weakness with symmetrical hyporeflexia but normal sensation. The syndrome frequently follows viral infections and may evolve into complete paralysis with respiratory failure. Guillain-Barre syndrome is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The clinical course is correlated with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and demyelination of peripheral nerves, especially spinal and cranial motor nerve roots. Inflammation localized to a small poion of spinal cord (lateral coicospinal tracts) or cerebral coex (precentral gyrus) may occur in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or in multiple sclerosis (MS). PML occurs in the immunosuppressed, and MS presents with hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron signs). The classic autoimmune disease involving the neuromuscular junction is myasthenia gravis. Although the weakness caused by myasthenia gravis may affect the legs, extraocular muscles are involved in the majority of cases, and isolated limb weakness is rare.

For CA breast best chemotherapeutic regimen ?,"Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil","Methotrexate, cisplatin","Cispltain, Adriamycin, steroid","Methotrexate, Adriamycin, steroid","Ans is 'a' ie Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5-FU Previously CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate & 5-fluorouracil) was the chemotherapeutic regimen of choice. 'CMF is no longer considered adequate adjuvant chemotherapy and modern regimens include an anthracycline doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)' Anti-HER-2/neu antibody therapy (Traztuzumab) HER-2/neu expression for all newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer is now recommended. Trastuzumab is added to the chemotherapy for tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu receptors. (Trastuzumab is added along with taxanes) About Adjuvant Therapy Adjuvant therapy is the use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy or/and hormone therapy) in patients who have received local therapy but are at risk of relapse. The objective is to eliminate the occult metastasis responsible for late recurrences while they are microscopic and theoretically most vulnerable to anticancer agents. Adjuvant chemotherapy is given to all node-positive cancers node negative cancers if > 1 cm in size node negative cancer > .5 cm in size with adverse prognostic factors such as blood vessel or lymph vessel invasion - high nuclear grade - high histological grade - HER 2/neu overexpression - negative hormone receptor status Adjuvant hormone therapy (tamoxifen) is added to all those with estrogen receptor positive. The use of chemotherapy in post-menopausal women is controversial. - In post menopausal women, chemotherapy is frequently used upto age 70 yrs, if she can tolerate it. - In older women, chemotherapy is performed less frequently. - In estrogen positive tumors, in postmenopausal women, antiestrogen (tamoxifen/ aromatase inhibitors) therapy is the preferred form of adjuvant systemic treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy - it involves the administration of adjuvant therapy before primary therapy (surgery & radiation therapy) - it has shown to down-stage the tumor.",A
Which of the following determines the speed of recovery from IV anesthetic?,Liver metabolism of drug,Protein binding of drug,Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNS,Plasma clearance of the drug,"Ans. c. Redistribution of the drug from sites in the CNSAn IV anesthetic completely bypasses the process of absorption, because the drug is placed directly into the bloodstream. Highly perfused organs (vessel rich) including the brain take up disproportionately large amount of drug compared to less perfused areas (the muscle, fat, and vessel-poor groups).Drugs bound to plasma proteins are unavailable for uptake by an organ.After the highly perfused organs are saturated during initial distribution, the greater mass of the less perfused organs continue to take up drug from the bloodstream.As plasma concentration falls, some drug leaves the highly perfused organs to maintain equilibrium.This redistribution from the vessel-rich group is responsible for termination of effect of many anesthetic drugs.",C

Chylolymphatic (most common)           
simple (mesothelial)
Enterogenous
Urogenital remnan 
Dermoid (teratomatous cyst)

Chylolymphatic cyst

Usually are congenital, resulting from developmental sequestration of lymphatics.
It is found most frequently in the mesentery of the ileum.
The cyst wall is thin, made up of connective tissue; lacks the muscular wall of enteric duplication cyst.
The cyst is not lined by mucosa.
It is filled with clear lymph or chyle.
A chylolymphatic cyst is almost invariably solitary, although in extremely rare cases, multiple cysts may be seen.
The cyst is more often unilocular than multilocular.
A chylolymphatic cyst has a blood supply independent of that of the adjacent intestine, and thus enucleation (resection) is possible without the need for resection of the gut.

Enterogenous cyst

Believed to be derived either from a diverticulum of the mesenteric border of the intestine which has become sequestered from the intestinal canal during embryonic life or from a duplication of the intestine.
An enterogenous cyst has a thicker wall than a chylolymphatic cyst, and it is lined by mucous membrane, sometimes ciliated.
The content is mucinous
The enterogenosu cyst and the adjacent bowel wall has a common blood supply, therefore, enucleation of the cyst is always done along with resection of the related portion of intestine followed by anastomosis.

Clinical features

painless abdominal swelling


the swelling moves freely in a plane at right angles to the attachment of the mesentery.


recurrent attacks of abdominal pain with or without vomiting due to obstructive symptoms.
acute abdominal pain due to


torsion of the mesentery containing cyst
rupture of cyst
hemorrhage into the cyst
infection of the cyst

Enucleation is the t/t of choice. An associated segment of bowel is removed along with enterogenous cyst. Other t/t modalities i.e. marsupialization, internal drainage, or aspiration are suboptimal and are almost always followed by recurrence.",D

Such decisions are based on tumor stage (TNM), grade, size, multiplicity, and recurrence patterno First see the staging (TNM)o The primary bladder cancer is staged according to the depth of invasion into the bladder wall or beyond The urothelial basement membrane separates superficial bladder cancers into Ta (noninvasive) and T1 (invasive) tumors. The muscularis propria separates superficial disease from deeply (muscularis propria) invasive disease. Stage T2 and higher T stage tumors invade the muscularis propria, the true muscle of the bladder wall. If the tumor extends through the muscle to involve the full thickness of the bladder and into the serosa, it is classified as T3. If the tumor involves contiguous structures such as the prostate, the vagina, the uterus, or the pelvic sidewall, the tumor is classified as stage T4.# Tis Ca in situ# Ta Ca confined to mucosa# T1 Ca confined to submucosa# T2 Muscle invasion# T3 perivescical fat invasion# T4 invasion of adjacent structures (prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic wall, abd. wall)o Now the histological grading.# There are 3 histological gradeso Grade I, II & IIIo There is a strong correlation between tumor grading and tumor recurrence progression and survival.Treatment options for bladder cancersCancer stageInitial treatment optionsTisComplete TUR followed by intravesical BCGTa (single, low-to- moderate grade, not recurrent)Complete TURTa (large, multiple, high grade, or recurrent)Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo-or immunologyT1Complete TUR followed by intravesical chemo- or immunotherapy or radical cystectomyT2-T4Radical cystectomyNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cytectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapyConcomitant chemotherapy and irradiationAny T, N+, M+Systemic chemotherapy followed by selective surgery orirradiationo Intravesical therapy : Common agents used for intravesical therapy are# Mitomycin C# Thiotepa# BCGo Among these agents, BCG is the most effective.o The patient in question has T1 stage (Tumor upto submucosa)",B

Hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis both produce vascular injury and poal hypeension, which leads to the development of poosystemic shunts-most typically causing esophageal varices, caput medusae, and hemorrhoids. Bright red blood in stools is a classic presentation of hemorrhoids. Colorectal carcinoma generally develops in an older population, and produces occult blood loss rather than frankly bloody stools. Although diveiculosis may be an asymptomatic condition, diveiculitis is associated with significant abdominal distress, which may be accompanied by blood loss and diarrhea and/or constipation. Hyperplastic polyps are asymptomatic, non-neoplastic, polypoid growths, generally less than 5mm in diameter. They do not produce bleeding or any increased risk of carcinoma.

"Which of the following refinements of serum PSA is used to determine the need for TRUS guided biopsy of prostate, even though the level of serum PSA is still in normal range?",PSAD (prostate-specific antigen density),PSA velocity,Free/Total PSA,Complexed/Total PSA,"PSA velocity Several refinements have been proposed to increase the sensitivity of the serum PSA for younger men more likely to die of prostate-cancer, while reducing the frequency of diagnosing cancers of low biologic potential in elderly men more likely to die of other causes. These modifications include age-specific reference ranges, using a lower 'upper' limit of normal for younger males and higher 'upper' limit for older individuals. Prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) is calculated by dividing the serum PSA level by the estimated prostate weight calculated from transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). It was proposed to correct for the influence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) on the measured level of PSA. Values <0.10 are consistent with BPH, while values >0.15 suggest the presence of cancer. PSAD levels also increase with age. PSA velocity is derived from calculations of the rate of change in PSA before the diagnosis of cancer was established. Increases of>0.75 ng/mL per year are suggestive of cancer. For a 50-year-old male, an increase from 2.5 to 3.9 ng/mL in a I-year period would warrant fuher testing, even though the level is still in the 'normal' range. Free and complexed PSA measurements are used to determine which men require a biopsy when the PSA level is in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In cancer, the level of free PSA is lower. Using a 25% threshold of free PSA for patients with levels in the range of 4 to 10 ng/mL, specificity was improved by 20% while maintaining a sensitivity of95%. Fuher refinements to increase the specificity of distinguishing benign and malignant conditions involve the determination of the ratios of free to total, complexed to total, and free to complexed PSA. Using normal ranges for free/total PSA of>O .15, for complexed total PSA of <0.70, and for free/complexed PSA of>0.25 improved specificity in one study by 20%. These modifications are designed to reduce the frequency of biopsies in men without cancer.",B

True about branchial anomaly :,Cysts are more common than sinuses,For sinuses surgery is not always indicated,Cysts present with dysphagia and hoarseness of voice,Most commonly due to 2nd branchial remnant,"Branchiogenic Anomalies 

Branchial anomalies are remnants of the branchial apparatus present during the embryonic life.
Embryologically the structures of head and neck are derived from 5 pairs of branchial arches, their intervening clefts externally and pouches internally.
A tract of branchial origin may form a complete fistula, or one end may be obliterated to form an external or internal sinus, or both ends may resorb forming a cyst.
2nd branchial remnant are the most common
Ist branchial remnants are typically located in front or back of the ear or in the upper neck in the region of the mandible. Fistulas typically commence through the parotid gland and end in the external auditory canal.
2nd branchial cleft remnants cause fistulas/sinuses with an external opening along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal opening at the tonsillar fossa (The fistulous track passes in b/w internal & external carotid arteries)
3rd branchial cleft remnants usually do not have associated sinuses or fistulas and are located in the suprasternal notch or clavicular region. These most often contain cartilage and present clinically as a firm mass or as a subcutaneous abscess. Rarely sinus may occur which open internally into the pyriform sinus.
Branchiogenic anomalies occur with equal frequency on each side of the neck and 15% are bilateral.

Clinical presentation

By definition, all branchial remnants are present at the time of birth although they may not become clinically evident until later in life.
Fistulas and sinus present at birth whereas cysts usually appear in late childhood and adults.
Fistulas and sinuses usually discharge a mucoid or purulent material
The cysts are characteristically found anterior and deep to the upper third of the sternocleidomastoid (interior to the angle of mandible)
Sinuses and cysts are prone to become repeatedly infected producing cellulitis and abscess formation.

Treatment

Almost all branchial abnormalities should be excised early in life since repeated infection is common making resection more difficult.
Complete removal of the cyst and tract is necessary for a cure and preventing recurrence.
A series of two or sometimes three small transverse incisions in a 'stepladder' fashion is preferred to a long oblique incision in the neck, which is cosmetically undesirable.",D

(Ref LB 26th/pg. 1260)In fistula in ano, Goodsall's rule used to indicate likley position of internal opening according to the position of external openings.FISTULA-IN-ANO# Intersphincteric fistulae (most common type; 45%) do not cross the external sphincter (bar, for the purist, the most medial subcutaneous fibres running below the distal border of the internal sphincter); most commonly they run directly from the internal to the external openings across the distal internal sphincter, but may extend proximally in the intersphincteric plane to end blindly with or without an abscess, or enter the rectum at a second internal opening.# Goodsall's rule used to indicate the likely position of the internal opening according to the position of the external opening(s), is helpful but not infallible.# Endoanal ultrasound, especially with hydrogen peroxide, can also be used to delineate fistulae, although definition of sepsis outside or above the sphincters is limited by the probe's focal range and scarring makes interpretation difficult. Nonetheless, ultrasound, which is more accurate than clinical examination, is useful to determine whether a fistula is relatively straightforward or not.# MRI is acknowledged to be the 'gold standard' for fistula imaging but it is limited by availability and cost and is usually reserved for difficult recurrent cases. The great advantage of MRI is its ability to demonstrate secondary extensions, which may be missed at surgery and which are the cause of persistence . Fistulography and CT both have limitations but are useful techniques if an extrasphincteric fistula is suspected.Anorectal fistulae# Are common and may be simple or complex# Are classified according to their relationship to the anal sphincters# May be associated wlith underlying disease such as tuberculosis or Crohn's disease# Laying open is the surest method of eradication, but sphincter division may result in incontinence",B

Acute orchitis all are seen except,Increased local temperature,Decreased blood flow,Etythematous scrotum,Raised TLC,"ORCHITIS Mumps orchitis, which is the most common form of orchitis, develops in 20-30% of postpubeal patients with a mumps virus infection and it usually develops as the parotid swelling is waning. Evidence of IgM antibodies in the serum suppos the diagnosis. The main complication is testicular atrophy, which may cause infeility if the condition is bilateral. Paial testicular atrophy is associated with persistent testicular pain. Syphilitic orchitis is now uncommon. It can cause bilateral orchitis (which is a feature of congenital syphilis), interstitial fibrosis, which causes painless destruction of the testis, or, rarely, it may lead to a gumma of the testis, which presents as a unilateral slowly growing painless swelling. The latter presentation may be difficult to distinguish from a neoplasm without surgical exploration. Diagnosis is confirmed by serology. Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1506",B
Hyperextensibility with normal elastic recoil is a feature of aEUR',Ehlers Danlos syndrome,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,Cutis laxa,Scleroderma,"Ehlers Danlos syndrome Ehlers - Danlos syndrome (EDS) Ehler's danlos syndrome comprise a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of disorder that result from some defect in the synthesis or structure of fibrillar collagen. The basic abnormality in Ehler's Danlos syndrome (EDS) is some defect in the synthesis or structure of collagen Biosynthesis of collagen is a complex process It involves numerous structural collagen genes or enzymes. Which are used in post transcriptional modification of collagen. Therefore it can be disturbed by no. of genetic errors that may affect any of the numerous genes or enzymes necessary for collagen synthesis. At the molecular level, a variety of defects, varying .from mutations involving structural genes or collagens to those involving enzymes that are responsible for post transcriptional modification of mRNA have been detected. Such molecular heterogenecity result in expression of EDS as a clinically variable disorder with several patterns of inheritance. On the basis of clinical and molecular characteristics six variants of Ehler's Danlos syndrome have been identified. The common thread in all forms of EDS is some abnormality in the synthesis of collagen. Clinical features - As might be expected tissues rich in collagen such as skin, ligaments and joints are frequently involved. - Because the abnormal collagen fibre lacks adequate tensile strength, skin is hyper extensible and the joints are hypermobile. The skin is extraordinarily stretchaeble, extremely fragile and vulnerable to trauma. - Minor injuries produce gaping defects and surgical repair or intervention is accomplished with great difficulty because of the lack of normal tensile strength. - The defect in connective tissue may lead to serious internal complications which include:? - Rupture of the colon and large aeries - Occular.fragility with rupture of cornea and retinal detachment - Diaphragmatic hernia EQS type Gene defect Inheritance Clinical findings Classical Defect in type V collagen Mutation in COL5A gene Autosomal dominant Skin and joint hypermo? bility, atrophic scars, Easy bruising Hypermobility Unknow Autosomal dominant Joint hypennobility, pain, dislocations Vascular Defect in collagen type 111 Autosomal The skin, aerial or Collagen ill is abundant in Blood vessels and intestine ( *.. severe defect of these organs dominants uterine rupture, bru? ising, small joint hyperextensibility Kyphoscoliosis Reduced level of lysyl hydroxylase essential for cross linking of collagen fibres Autosomal recessive Hypotonia, joint laxity, congenital scoliosis, ocular fragility Ahrochalasia - Defect in conversion of Autosomal Severe joint hypenno?

Therefore affected newborn infants appear 'prematurely aged'. The skin abnormality is most prominent around eye, face neck. Therefore patients with cutis laxa have characteristic facial features including an aged appearance with sagging jaws (blood hound appearance) a hooked nose with eveed nostrils, a sho columella, a long upper lip and eveed lower eyelids. Hypermobility of the joint is not present. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum It is a rare group of disorders affecting the elastic tissue. It primarily affects the dermis, retina, and cardiovascular system. The skin has characteristic 'plucked chicken skin' appearance. - It tends to loose its elastic recoil when stretched.",A
In a male after laparoscopic cholecystectomy specimen is sent for histopathology which shows carcinoma gallbladder stage T la. Appropriate management is:,Conservative and follow up.,Extended cholecystectomy,Excision of all po sites,Radiotherapy,"Excision of all po sites Repeat from Nov 08 The appropriate management for gallbladder cancer depends on the stage of cancer.

No fuher t/t is needed. Simple cholecystectomy is sufficient for them. - In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, recurrent cancer has been seen at the po site. Hence all po sites should be excised. - Patients with preoperatively suspected gallbladder cancer should under go open cholecystectomy to minimize the chances of tumor dissemination. Tlb staged tumors (tumors invading muscular layer)? - Invasion of the muscular layer allows access to lymphatics and vessels. For Tlb staged tumors, an extended cholecystectomy is indicated, as these tumors have been repoed to recur after simple cholecystectomy. For stage lb, II, selected stage III tumors: These are managed by extended cholecystectomy. Stage IV tumors: - Should be treated with appropriate palliation as indicated. No randomized data have demonstrated improved survival with either chemotherapy or radiation and its use depends on case to case basis. Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer: Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer on pathologic review: For T1a tumors (tumor invades lamina propria) - Observation only is open cholecystectomy done. - Excision of all po sites if cholecystectomy done laparoscopically. For Tlb tumors (tumor invades muscle layer) or greater - A radical re-resection (after a complete staging including laparoscopy demonstrating resectability) is highly recommended Treatment after incidental finding of gallbladder cancer at surgery: After incidental finding of gallbladder cancer at surgery staging has to be performed intraoperatively and extended cholecystectomy including en bloc hepatic resection and lymphadenectomy with or without bile duct excision has to be considered depending on resectability and expeise of the surgeon",C

In general commonest hemorrhage following head injury is,Subcoical,Extradural,Subdural,Intraventricular,"SUBDURAL HAEMATOMA Types Acute Chronic Acute Subdural Haematoma It is a collection of blood between the brain and dura. It is due to injury to the coical veins and often due to laceration of coex of brain which bleeds and blood gets collected in the subdural space forming a haematoma. Here haematoma is extensive and diffuse. There is no lucid interval. There is severe primary brain damage. Haematoma may be of coup and contre-coup type. Loss of consciousness occurs immediately after trauma and Is progressive. Convulsion is common. Features of raised intracranial pressure is obviously seen high BP, bradycardia, vomiting. Focal neurological deficits or hemiparesis can occur. CT scan shows concavo-convex lesion. Treatment Antibiotics, anticonvulsants. Surgical decompression is done by craniotomy. Chronic Subdural Haematoma It is due to the rupture of veins between dura and brain (cerebral hemispheres), causing gradual collection of blood in subdural space. It is commonly seen in elderly people following any minor trauma like fall, slipping (which might have gone unnoticed). In elderly people, brain atrophies and even minor injuries can cause shearing and bleeding from these veins. Blood collects gradually over 2-6 weeks. Plasma and cellular components get separated. Eventually cellular pa gets absorbed leaving only fluid component. It is called as chronic subdural hygroma. Usual haematoma collection is 60-120 ml. Often in 50% of cases, it is bilateral. Clinical Features Common in old age, with history of minor trauma. Patient presents with confusion, disorientation, gradually with altered level of consciousness and drowsiness. Later convulsions, features of intracranial hypeension, features of coning develops. Extensor plantar response and pupillary changes develop eventually. Investigations CT scan (shows concavo-convex lesion). Serum electrolytes. Blood grouping and cross matching. Differential Diagnosis Electrolyte imbalance. Intracranial space occupying lesion.

Ch 25The most important information in the above question is that the patient is 70 yrs old, i.e, of a geriatric age. Geriatric patients have a lot of anaesthetic implications. As a rule, we must consider shorter acting agents in these patients.Our body can be considered to be divided into 3 compartments when we inject any drug. These compartments are formed on the basis of the speed with which the drug reaches various parts of the body.Three-compartment model (including the biophase) schematizing the basic pharmacokinetic processes that occur after intravenous drug administration.I = dosing scheme as a function of timekl0 = Rate constant reflecting all processes acting to irreversibly remove drug from the central compartmentVI = central compartment volume, usually expressed in liters or liters per kilogram.Central compartment-blood, highly vascular tissues like brain - The effect of Anaesthetic drugs primarily depends on the duration of drug in central compartment & volume of the compartment since they primarily act on CNSIntermediate compartment-intermediate blood supply organs like skeletal musclesPeripheral compartment-adipose tissue - responsible for storage & delayed release of drugs into circulationGeriatric patients have an increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass. Also, they are dehydrated leading to contraction of the central compartment. Thus, more drug is present in the central compartment on immediate injection (causing a profound effect at a normal dose), & more fat is available for delayed release of drugs back into the circulation, leading to prolonged action of drugs (see figure)They may have a decreased renal & hepatic clearanceDecreased cardiac output may contribute to a slow onset of drug effects followed by prolonged action secondary to delayed clearance (i.e.f barbiturates, benzodiazepines).Minimal alveolar concentration of inhalation anesthetics decreases with age (6% for each decade after age 40), which parallels loss of neurons and decreased cerebral metabolism.Short-acting intravenous drugs and volatile anesthetics with lower partition coefficients provide the advantage of more rapid elimination, brisk emergence, and reorientation to the patient's surroundings, and potentially lower incidence of confusion and delirium during recovery. However, the recovery of cognitive function, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination, has not been shown to be different between various agents.Desflurane is associated with the most rapid emergence. (It has a low solubility hence faster onset & shorter time for emergence)A more predictable method of opioid titration may be to use a shorter acting opioid such as remifentanil. By adjusting the bolus and infusion doses, the variability in remifentanil pharmacokinetics is considerably less than for other intravenous opioids. (Morphine has a much longer duration of action)Similarly, it may be prudent to use shorter acting muscle relaxants. Studies show that there is an increased incidence of postoperative residual block and pulmonary complications in patients receiving pancuronium compared with atracurium or vecuronium. Atracurium depends to a small extent on hepatic metabolism and excretion, and elimination half-life is prolonged in elderly patients.

Bailey and Love Surgery 25th/pg. 729).Definitive treatment of Cystic hygroma is complete excision of the cyst at an early stage. Injection of a sclerosant , may reduce the size of the cyst; however, they are commonly multicystic and if the injection is extracystic subsequent surgery may be more difficult.CYSTIC HYGROMA# In this developmental abnormality of the lymphatic system, lymphatic fluid collects in a cystic space which is often multilocular and situated in the base of the neck (post triangle).# Association with Turner's syndrome is known.# Cystic hygroma usually presents in the neonate or in early infancy, and occasionally may present at birth and be so large as to obstruct labour. The cysts are filled with clear lymph and lined by a single layer of epithelium with a mosaic appearance. Swelling usually occurs in the neck and may involve the parotid, submandibular, tongue and floor of mouth areas. The swelling may be bilateral and is soft and partially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child coughs or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent.# The cheek, axilla, groin and mediastinum are other less frequent sites for a cystic hygroma.# The behaviour of cystic hygromas during infancy is unpredictable. Sometimes the cyst expands rapidly and occasionally respiratory difficulty ensues, requiring immediate aspiration and even occasionally a tracheostomy. The cyst may become infected.# USG can be diagostic.",D

Lung head ratio associated with good prognosis is:,<1,<1.4,>1,>1.4,"A useful index of severity for patients with left CDH is the lung-to-head ratio (LHR), which is the product of the length and the width of the right lung at the level of the cardiac atria divided by the head circumference (all measurements in millimeters). An LHR value of whereas an LHR of >1.4 predicts a more ourable outcome. The usefulness of the LHR in predicting outcome in patients with CDH has recently been questioned, due to the tremendous inter observer variability in calculating this ratio for a paicular patient as well as the lack of reliable measures to determine postnatal disease severity.

"A 56-year-old male presents with the sudden onset of excruciating pain. He describes the pain as beginning in the anterior chest, radiating to the back, and then moving downward into the abdomen. His blood pressure is found to be 160/115. Your differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction; however, no changes are seen on ECG, and you consider this to be less of a possibility. You obtain an x-ray of this patient's abdomen and discover a 'double-barrel' aoa. This abnormality most likely results from",A microbial infection,Loss of elastic tissue in the media,A congenital defect in the wall of the aoa,Atherosclerosis of the abdominal aoa,"Dissecting aneurysms are usually the result of cystic medial necrosis of the aoa. This abnormality results from loss of elastic tissue in the media and is associated with hypeension and Marfan's syndrome. Most cases of dissecting aneurysms involve a transverse tear in the intima and are located in the ascending aoa, just above the aoic ring. The pain caused by a dissecting aneurysm is similar to the pain caused by a myocardial infarction, but it extends into the abdomen as the dissection progresses. Additionally, the blood pressure is not decreased with a dissecting aneurysm unless the aoa itself has ruptured. In contrast, berry aneurysms, found at the bifurcation of aeries in the circle of Willis, are due to congenital defects in the vascular wall. Rupture of these aneurysms may produce a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Berry aneurysms have been noted in about one-sixth of patients with adult polycystic renal disease and account for death in about 10% of patients with this type of polycystic renal disease. Syphilitic (luetic) aneurysms occur in the thoracic aoa and may lead to luetic hea disease by producing insufficiency of the aoic valve. Mycotic (infectious) aneurysms result from microbial infection during septicemia, usually secondary to bacterial endocarditis. They are prone to rupture and hemorrhage. The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of eight syndromes characterized by defects in collagen synthesis. In EDS IV there is deficient synthesis of type III collagen and a tendency to rupture of muscular aeries, including dissecting aneurysms of the aoa.",B

Which of the following is not an exception to Meyer Oveon rule,Non anaesthetics,Non immobilizer,cut off effect,Hydrophobic site,"Meyer-Oveon correlation of anesthetic potency with solubility in olive oil interpreted by the majority of researchers as an indicator that lipids are likely the anesthetic target. This interpretation focused attention on anesthetic effects on the bulk physical propeies of cell membranes, which were known at that time to consist primarily of lipid molecules. Such nonspecific or 'lipoid-based' anesthetic theories dominated the field from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, the simple elegance of the relationship between MAC and lipid solubility graphically illustrated Meyer and Oveon's conclusion that 'All chemically indifferent substances that are soluble in fat are anesthetics ... their relative potency as anesthetics will depend on their affinity to fat on the one hand and water on the other hand, that is, on the fat/water paition coefficient. This was interpreted as oring lipids as the primary targets of anesthetics and a single nonspecific theory to explain anesthesia. Objections to the outdated lipid hypotheses: 1. Stereoisomers of an anesthetic drug Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(-)-etomidate). Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas paition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anesthetic than its S-(-) isomer 2. Non-immobilizers According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, the anesthetic potency of the drug is directly propoional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anesthetics and are predicted to be potent anesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exe only one constituent of the anesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as non-immobilizers. 3. Temperature increases do not have an anesthetic effect 4. Effect vanishes beyond a ceain chain length According to the Meyer-Oveon correlation, in a homologous series of any general anesthetic (e.g. n-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anesthetic potency. However, beyond a ceain chain length, the anesthetic effect disappears. For the n-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the n-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species. 5. Non-hydrophobic anesthetics.

The main controlling agent for respiratory drive is which of the following -,CO2,Oxygen,NO,HBO3,"Central chemoreceptors are situated in the deeper pa of medulla oblongata, close to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons. This area is known as a chemosensitive area, and the neurons are called chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors are in close contact with blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Central chemoreceptors are connected with respiratory centers, paicularly the dorsal respiratory group of neurons through synapses. These chemoreceptors act slowly but effectively. Central chemoreceptors are responsible for 70% to 80% of increased ventilation through chemical regulatory mechanisms. Main stimulant for central chemoreceptors is the increased hydrogen ion concentration. However, if hydrogen ion concentration increases in the blood, it cannot stimulate the central chemoreceptors because the hydrogen ions from blood cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. On the other hand, if carbon dioxide increases in the blood, it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier and enter the interstitial fluid of the brain or the cerebrospinal fluid. There, carbon dioxide combines with water to form carbonic acid. Since carbonic acid is unstable, it immediately dissociates into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. CO2 + H2O - H2CO3 - H+ + HCO3- Hydrogen ions stimulate the central chemoreceptors. From chemoreceptors, the excitatory impulses are sent to the dorsal respiratory group of neurons, resulting in increased ventilation (increased rate and force of breathing). Because of this, excess carbon dioxide is washed out and respiration is brought back to normal. Lack of oxygen does not have a significant effect on the central chemoreceptors, except that it generally depresses the overall function of the brain. Ref: Sembulingam - physiology 7th edition",A

"Kallu, a 60 years old male diagnosed to have carcinoma stomach. CT scan of abdomen showed a mass measuring 4 x 4 cm in the antrum with involvement of celiac nodes and right gastric nodes. Management of choice is -",Total gastrectomy,Subtotal gastrectomy,Palliative,Chemotherapy,"Ans. is 'b' ie. Subtotal Gastrectomy Management of Gastric carcinoma Surgical resection of stomach is the only curative treatment. It is also the best way of palliation in non-curable cases. So it's done in almost every case. Exceptions to surgery are - patients who cannot tolerate an abdominal operation and patients with overwhelming metastasis. The surgical objective should be to remove the tumor, and adjacent uninvolved margin of stomach and duodenum, the regional lymph nodes, and, if necessary, poions of involved adjacent organs. Radical subtotal gastrectomy is the standard operation for gastric cancer. -It removes distal 75% of the stomach, including the pylorus and 2 cm. of duodenum, the greater and the lesser omentum and the associated lymphatic tissue. Reconstruction is usually by Billroth II anastomosis - For curative treatment, all the margins (proximal, distal and radial) should be negative and an adequate lymphadenectomy performed. Margins are checked by frozen section biopsy. Total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy is done (splenectomy is plus/minus) - for proximal gastric carcinoma - for extensive tumors (eg. Linitis plastica) to obtain negative margins for distal gastric carcinoma Esophagogastrectomy with splenectomy is done for tumor of the cardia. Adequate lymphadenectomy must be done in all curable cases. Adjuvant Chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil & leucovorin) + Radiation therapy - their role is not very well proven Gastric Ca is relatively radioresistant tumor and radiotherapy alone has no role in treatment. The best it can be used for palliation of pain and bleeding. So in this patient Kallu, curative treatment is done by radical subtotal gastrectomy. Involvemetn of lymph nodes is no indication against curative treatment. Schwaz writes - 'It should be strongly emphasized that many patients with positive lymph nodes are cured by adequate surgery. It should also be stressed that often lymph nodes that appear to be involved with tumor turn out to be benign or reactive on pathological examination. Therefore therapeutic nihilism should be avoided, and in the low risk patients an aggressive attempt to resect all tumours should be made.'",B

"A 4-year-old child is observed to hold his eyelids open with his fingers and to close one eye periodically, especially in the evening. He has some trouble swallowing his food. He usually appears sad, although he laughs often enough. He can throw a ball, and he runs well. Which of the following is likely to result in the diagnosis?",Muscle biopsy,Creatine phosphokinase (CPK),Effect of a test dose of endrophonium,Chest x-ray,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating acetylcholine receptor- binding antibodies are found in approximately 90% of cases, less commonly, when the patient demonstrates isolated eye disease. Other nonspecific evidence of autoimmune disease includes elevated ANAs, presence of abnormal immune complexes, and an association with the hypothyroidism related to lymphocytic thyroiditis, also an autoimmune disorder. The earliest signs of myasthenia gravis are ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, followed by dysphagia and facial muscle weakness. The distinguishing hallmark of this disease is rapid fatiguing of the involved muscles. The conduction velocity of the motor nerve is normal in this condition. When the involved muscle is repetitively stimulated for diagnostic purposes, the EMG shows a decremental response, which can be reversed by the administration of cholinesterase inhibitors. In older children this test is accomplished with edrophonium chloride, but it should be avoided in young infants, as cardiac arrhythmias may result (neostigmine would be used instead). Cholinesterase inhibitors are the primary therapeutic agents, and intramuscular neostigmine methylsulfate, oral neostigmine bromide, and oral pyridostigmine are available. Other therapeutic modalities for myasthenia gravis include immunosuppression, plasmapheresis, thymectomy (an enlarged thymus is frequently seen on chest x-ray), and treatment of hypothyroidism. CPK should be normal.",C
Most common site of pseudoaneurysm in I.V. drug abusers is:,Carotid,Brachial,Femoral,Radial,"In the IDU, frequent direct trauma to peripheral vessels produces damage to the vessel wall and an initial sterile perivascular hematoma. Injection of chemical agents in illicit drugs also causes tissue necrosis. The vascular wall usually becomes infected by contiguous spread from adjacent subcutaneous abscesses or areas of cellulitis. The infection causes liquefaction of the central poion of the hematoma in communication with the aerial or, less commonly, the venous wall, forming a secondary (false) pseudoaneurysm. The common femoral aery is the most frequent location, followed by the deep femoral and superficial femoral aeries. Because most IDUs are right handed, left-sided groin infections and aneurysms are more common. Primary mycotic aneurysms in which the damaged vessel wall is infected secondary to unrelated bacteremia are rare and are more likely to involve cerebral vessels as a complication of endocarditis. Pathogenesis includes septic embolization from valvular vegetations to the vasa vasorum of smaller vessels, such as the middle or posterior cerebral and visceral infra-abdominal aeries, which are more frequently involved than the aoa.",C

More Info: There are two other bony lesions distinctive enough to be included in the diagnostic criteria for NF-1. 1. Dysplasia of the wing of the sphenoid bone, results in poor formation of the wall and/or floor of the orbit. This leads to proptosis (from herniation of meninges or brain into the orbit) or enophthalmos. 2. Dysplasia of a long bone, characterized by congenital thinning and bowing, affects approximately 2% of children with NF-1. Although the tibia is most commonly affected, the femur, humerus and other long bones may also be involved. Failure of primary union following a fracture results in a 'false joint' or pseudahrosis.

Colectomy specimen on histopathology shows adenocarcinoma. Which of the following prognostic investigations is not required?",Microsatellite instability,c-myc mutations,EGFR mutations,k-RAS mutations,"Ans. c. EGFR mutations Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many types of cancers, especially colorectal cancer (CRC), and seems to reflect more aggressive histological and clinical behaviours. It was observed that EGFR was significantly associated with TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) stage T3. In the context of a new therapeutic strategy using EGFT-targeted therapies (e.g. cetuximab), although EGFR remains a controversial prognostic factor, this expression-stage association may play a crucial role in a decision to initiate an adjuvant treatment.'- Deng Y, Jurland B, Wang .1, Bi .1, Li W, Rao S, Lan P, Lin T and Lin E. High epidermal growth factor receptor expression in metastatic colorectal cancer lymph nodes may be more prognostic of poor survival than in primary tumor. Am J Clin Oncol. 2009;32:(3):245-52High EGFR expressions in metastatic lymph nodes seem to be more accurate in predicting survival than in primary or metastatic tissues. Microsatellite Instability: (Robbil,) The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by genetic lesions in mismatched repair genes. It is involved in 10 to 15% of sporadic cases of colon cancer and in the hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome. Mutations in the mismatch repair genes cause alternation of microsatellites, leading to microsatellite instability. These satellites are prone to misalignment during DNA replication. Most microsatellite sequences are in the non-coding regions of the genes, and hence, mutations in these genes are probably harmless. However, some microsatellite sequences are located in the coding or promotor regions of genes involved in regulation of cell growth. Loss of mismatch repair genes leads to accumulation of these and other growth-regulating genes, culminating in the emergence of colorectal carcinoma. C-MYC Mutations: In human colorectal adenocarcinomas, overexpression of the c-myc mRNA has been repoed to occur in 60-80% of cases. C-myc has been characterized as a proto-oncogene, which promotes cell proliferation. However, overexpression of the c-myc mRNA is associated with a more ourable prognosis. k-RAS mutations: The k-RAS is the most frequently observed activated oncogene in adenomas and colon cancers. k-RAS plays a role in intracellular signal transduction and is mutated in fewer than 10% of adenomas less than 1 cm in size, in about 50% of adenomas larger than I cam and in approximately 50% of carcinomas.",C

True regarding Papillary carcinoma of thyroid is: March 2008,Undifferentiated carcinoma,Blood-borne metastasis is commoner,Excellent prognosis,Capsulated,"Ans. C: Excellent prognosis Papillary carcinoma is a relatively common well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Despite its well-differentiated characteristics, papillary carcinoma may be ovely or minimally invasive. In fact, these tumors may spread easily to other organs. Papillary tumors have a propensity to invade lymphatics but are less likely to invade blood vessels. Papillary carcinoma appears as an irregular solid or cystic mass in a normal thyroid parenchyma. They are very seldom encapsulated Thyroid cancers are more often found in patients with a history of low- or high-dose external irradiation. Papillary tumors of the thyroid are the most common form of thyroid cancer to result from exposure to radiation. The life expectancy of patients with this cancer is related to their age. The prognosis is better for younger patients than for patients who are older than 45 years of patients with papillary cancers, about 11% present with metastases outside the neck and mediastinum. FNAB is considered the best first-line diagnostic procedure for a thyroid nodule; FNAB is a safe and minimally invasive procedure. Surgery is the definitive management of thyroid cancer, and various types of operations may be performed. Lobectomy with isthmectomy Subtotal thyroidectomy This is a near-total thyroidectomyPatients younger than 40 years who have papillary thyroid carcinoma nodules that are smaller than 1 cm, well-defined, minimally invasive, and isolated may be treated with hemithyroidectomy and isthmectomy Total thyroidectomy Perform a total thyroidectomy (removal of all thyroid tissue but preserving the contralateral parathyroid glands) in patients who are older than 40 years with papillary carcinoma and in any patient with bilateral disease Compared with most cancers the prognosis in differentiated thyroid carcinoma is excellent.",C

Fluid of choice in shock is?,Albumin,Ringer lactate,Hydroxyethyl starch,Dextran,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Ringer lactate * Crystalloid solutions are first choice to resuscitate any type of shock patients.Fluid management in shockA) Hemorrhagic shock# Crystalloid solutions for intravascular volume replenishment are typically isotonic (eg, 0.9% saline or Ringer s lactate ). H2O freely travels outside the vasculature, so as little as 10% of isotonic fluid remains in the intravascular space. Both 0.9% saline and RL are equally effective;# Colloid solutions (eg, hydroxyethyl starch, albumin, dextrans) are also effective for volume replacement during major hemorrhage. Colloid solutions offer no major advantage over crystalloid solutions, and albumin has been associated with poorer outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury.B) Nonhemorrhagic hypovolemia# Isotonic crystalloid solutions are typically given for intravascular repletion during shock and hypovolemia. Colloid solutions are generally not used.",B

"Desmoid tumor, treatment is:",Local excision,Wide excision,Wide excision with radiotherapy,Radiotherapy,"Desmoid tumors, also known as 'aggressive fibromatosis,' are soft tissue lesions that behave similarly to other truncal soft tissue sarcomas but have unique characteristics. These tumors, like other soft tissue sarcomas, present as slow-growing, indolent masses (sometimes can be aggressive). Unlike typical sarcomas however, these tumors rarely metastasize.
Desmoids are diffusely infiltrative and tend to recur locally, even after complete resection..
Most desmoid tumors arise sporadically, but a small percentage (-5%) occurs in association with FAP syndrome.
Desmoids are classified as either abdominal or extra-abdominal. Abdominal desmoids are categorized further as superficial or infra-abdominal tumors . The superficial disease, also known as Dupuytren's fibromatosis, is slow growing, is small in size, and rarely involves deeper structures.Most of the intra-abdominal lesions are seen in association with FAP. These lesions are associated with mutations in the APC gene that are found in patients who have FAP. These tumors usually are found in the mesentery, and their growth and compression of neighboring structures can lead to significant morbidity and sometimes even death in these patients
Sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumors have been found to be associated with pregnancy. Oral contraceptive use has also been associated with the occurrence of these tumors. These associations, combined with the detection of estrogen receptors within the tumor, suggest a regulatory role for estrogen in this disease.
Tissue injury, such as trauma and/or surgery, also has been implicated in tumor development.
The natural history of desmoid lesions is unpredictable. Although most are indolent and slow growing, some lesions are aggressive. There are some reports of spontaneous regression, but such occurrences are mainly in women and are associated with chemical or surgical menopause. Most lesions are indolent and have benign-appearing histology, but local growth and compression have caused significant morbidity. Involvement of abdominal vessels and organs often complicates management.
Patients with desmoid tumors present with a painless enlarging mass. Local symptoms may arise from compression of adjacent organs or neurovascular structures.
MRI is done to define the extent of disease and its relationship with other structures.
Incisional biopsy or a core needle biopsy is done to confirm the diagnosis.


Management: 

Surgery with wide negative margins is the best treatment. Unfortunately, even with complete resection, the local recurrence rate is as high as 40%. Surgery is also the t/t of choice for recurrences.
For tumors where vital visceral organs and local infiltration often make achieving negative margins difficult, other therapeutic modalities have been suggested.


Antiproliferative agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy have been used to palliate these tumors with variable results. The two most widely used groups of noncytotoxic drugs are NSAIDs (such as sulindac and indomethacin) and antiestrogens(such as tamoxifen).
Chemotherapy has generally been reserved for unresectable, symptomatic, and clinically aggressive disease. Partial responses have been observed after treatment with doxorubicin, actinomycin C, dacarbazine, or carboplatin, although toxicity has been relatively high.
Radiotherapy-'The role of radiation therapy in the management of these tumors, either as an adjunct to surgery or as primary treatment, continues to be defined.' — Sabiston


'In summary, for easily resectable disease, surgery alone appears to be the optimal approach, especially in patients with negative microscopic margins. In advanced cases, a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapy can be considered in most patients. A period of close observation is also reasonable because some patients demonstrate regression without any therapy. However, if a patient is symptomatic and not a candidate for surgery, consideration should be given to radiation or chemotherapy to increase the chance of a response.'-Devita Oncology",B

The nonvariceal causes account for about 80% of such bleeding, with peptic ulcer disease being the most .common.The foundation of diagnosis and management of patients with an upper GI bleed is an OGD scopy. Early OGD scopy (within 24 hours) results in reductions in blood transfusion requirements, a decrease in the need for surgery, and a shorter length of hospital stay.

Traditionally, BE was identified by the presence of columnar mucosa extending at least 3 cm into the esophagus. It is now recognized that the specialized intestinal type epithelium found in the Barrett's mucosa is the only tissue predisposed to malignant degeneration. Consequently, the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is presently made given any length of endoscopically identifiable columnar mucosa that proves on biopsy to show intestinal metaplasia. While long segments of columnar mucosa without metaplasia do occur, they are uncommon and are probably congenital in origin. The hallmark of intestinal metaplasia is the presence of intestinal goblet cells.'",B

Mechanism of action of curare is ?,Reducing end plate potential,Reducing presynaptic potential,Inhibits K+ channels,Inhibits Na+ channels,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle ? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na.* channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca' from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca' binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca' pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca' from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases : a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose. SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",A

All of the following statement about neuromuscular blockage produced by succinylcholine are true except,No fade on Train of Four stimulation,Fade on tetanic stimulation,No post tetanic fecilitation,Train of four ratio 1,"Depolarizing neuromuscular blocker The only drug still in clinical use belonging to this group is succinylchloline. Mode of action The effects of succinylcholine (SCh)at the neuromuscular junction are depolarizing postsynaptic and extrajunctional receptors, normally, this desensitization process does not occur with acetylcholine because of its rapid breakdown. However, succinylcholine remains at the endplate for much longer, so desensitization develops after a brief period of activation. Neuromuscular blockade because a depolarized neuro muscular blockade cannot respond to subsequent acetylcholine release. SCh is endowed with two unique and critically impoant characteristics - 1.produces intense paralysis rapidly(fastest onset) 2.effect wanes before preoxygenated person beomes hypoxic (shoest duration). Within 1 minute after succinylcholine injection and before paralysis are manifested, disorganized movements or fasciculation is seen. Characteristics of blockade 1. Simple twitch height reduces 2. No fade on train of four stimulation 3. No fade on tetanic stimulation 4. Potentiated by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase 5. High dose > 4-6 mg/kg body weight in multiple dosing or single dose changes the characteristic of block from depolarizing to nondepolarizing. This is termed nondepolarizing dual or phase II block. When succinyl choline enters phase II block it stas showing character of nondepolarizing NMB.",B

Which is the most common type of male breast cancer?,Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma,lobular Carcinoma,Mucinous Carcinoma,Colloid Carcinoma,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma o All known histopathologic types of breast cancer have been described in men with infiltrating ductal carcinoma being most common (about 70%)Male breast cancero Breast cancer in men is a rare disease; less than 1% occurs in men.o The average age is about 60 yrs - older than the most common presenting age in womeno Gynecomastia is seen preceding or accompanying the breast cancer in about 20% of caseso The risk of male breast cancer is related to an increased lifelong exposure to estrogen (as with female breast cancer) or to reduced androgen. The strongest association is in men with Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY) who have a 14- to 50-fold increased risk of developing male breast cancer. Also, men who carry a BRC A1, or particularly a BRC A2 mutation, have an increased risk of developing breast cancero The following conditions have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in men:# Chronic liver disorders, such as cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism, schistosomiasis;# A history of mumps orchitis, undescended testes, or testicular injury; and# Feminization, genetically or by environmental exposure# Radiation exposureo All known histopathologic types of breast cancer have been described in men with infiltrating ductal carcinoma being most common (about 70%). o A majority of male breast cancers are ER/PR positive and the percentage positive is greater than for female breast cancer.o As for women, stage is the predominant prognostic indicator, and most studies report that stage for stage, men with breast cancer have the same outcome following treatment as women with breast cancer. Overall, men do worse because of the advanced stage of their cancer at the time of diagnosiso Treatment consists of modified radical mastectomy in operable patients. The use of postmastectomy radiation therapy follows the same guidelines as for female breast cancer. Similarly, the use of systemic therapy follows the same guidelines as for women with postmenopausal breast cancer.

Common sites of fracture non union are the following except -,Waist of scaphoid,Neck of femur,Distal 1/3 tibia fibula,Distal end radius,"Ans. is `d' i.e., Distal end radius Non-union When a fracture fails to unit completely even after the stipulated time, it is termed as non-union. Both, In non-union and delayed union, fracture does not unite in the usual stipulated time. The difference between two is that In delayed union, union occurs but at a slower rate, i.e. there is presence of clinical and radiological progressive signs of union though at a slower rate. Healing may occur without surgical intervention by just prolonging the duration of immobilization. In non-union, union does not occur at all, i.e. there is complete cessation of healing process in which fibrous tissue is never replaced by bony matrix. So, there is absence of clinical and radiological progressive signs of union. Fracture healing will not occur without surgical intervention, e.g. bone grafting, illizarov's technique. Common sites of non-union are neck of femur, scaphoid, lower third of tibia, lateral condyle of humerus and lower third of ulna.",D

A 56 year old woman has not passed stools for the last 14 days. Xray shows no air fluid levels. Probable diagnosis is ?,Paralytic ileus,Aganglionosis of the colon,Intestinal pseudo-obstruction,Duodenal obstruction,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Intestinal pseudoobstruction The information provided in the question is too less, but we have to come to a diagnosis based on the provided information. Lets see each option one by one. a) Paralytic ileus - multiple air fluid levels are noted, hence ruled out. b) Aganglionosis of the colon or Hirshprung's ds. - presents in infancy or childhood, hence ruled out d) Duodenal obstruction multiple air fluid levels are not noted, but the dominant symptom is recurrent, vomiting, which is not mentioned, hence ruled out. c) Intestinal pseudo-obstruction it's the most likely diagnosis, as air fluid levels are not seen in it. Harrison writes - 'The symptom of chronic pseudoobstruction are chronic or intermittent constipation, crampy abdominal pain, anorexia and bloating. Abdominal xrays reveal gaseous distention of the large and small bowel and occasionally of the stomach. Air-fluid levels are unusual and should raise the possibility of mechanical obstruction.' Acute pseudoobstruction involves only the colon and presents with features of colonic obstruction (as described before). Air fluid level is also not a feature of colonic obstruction. About the fluid levels remember the following points upto 3 to 5 fluid levels less than 2.5 cm in length may be normal. multiple air-fluid levels are feature of mechanical small intestinal obstruction and paralytic ileus. They are not seen in colonic obstruction and pseudoobstruction. They may be seen in colonic obstruction if the ileocecal valve is incompetent.",C

Renal pelvis disorders (eg, UPJ obstruction, horseshoe kidneys,ureter duplex, ureter fissures, double renal collecting system) Hydronephrosis in renal transplant allografts. when dilatation of the renal pelvis affects kidney function to the extent that double -j stent placement is difficult or impossible, percutaneous nephrostomy may be an easier option. Contraindication to ESWL (eg, size of patients): Most ESWL units have a weight limits of 140 kg (approximately 300 lb) Stone or tumours associated with distal obstruction or a foreign body that cannot be removed through the ureters. When rapid dilation of the nephrostomy tract is required (eg, when access is needed instantly for operative procedures within the renal collecting system (for stone removal or tumour ablation) To diagnose ureteral obstruction, filling defects, and anomalies antegrade radiography Tumours such as sarcomas, ovarian tumours,and other retroperitoneal tumors (Ormond disease, intraperitoneal tumors), can compress ureters.

• Turner's syndrome is associated with cystic hygroma.
• Most cystic hygromas involve the lymphatic jugular sacs.
• MC site: Posterior neck region.
• Other common sites: Axilla, mediastinum, inguinal and retroperitoneal regions.
• Approximately 50% of them are present at birth.
• It may show spontaneous regression.
Clinical Features
• Usually present as soft cystic masses. that distort the surrounding anatomy, can result in acute airway obstruction.
• Usually manifests in the neonates or in early infancy (50% present at birth).
• Prone to infection and hemorrhage within the mass.
• Swelling is soft and partially compressible and invariably increases in size, when the child coughs or cries.
• Characteristic features: Brilliantly translucent.
Diagnosis

For Ca Anal canal t/t of choice is -,Surgery,Surgery + Radiotherapy,Chemoradiation,Chemotherapy,"Nigro regimen refers to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for primary treatment of malignant tumors of the anal canal.
In the 1970s, Nigro pioneered preoperative combination chemoradiation therapy to convert unrespectable cases to respective cases. There was no surgical pathological evidence of tumor found in three out of three patients treated with this approach in an early report.
This led to the concept of definitive radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Prior to this, the standard definitive treatment for carcinoma of the anal canal was abdominal-perineal resection, which necessitated a permanent colostomy.
The organ preservation concept following the discovery of a high complete response rate from combined chemoradiation saves a large number of patients from undergoing abdominal-perineal resection and colostomy.",C

Which inhalational agent acts on NMDA receptor:-,Xenon,Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Isoflurane,"acts on NMDA receptor Xenon has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and so produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. the disadvantage with Xenon gas is its high density (5.9 g/L), which is much higher than oxygen and nitrous oxide which leads to increased flow resistance and work of breathing. Thus it is not suitable for patients with compromised respiratory function. It has minimal cardiovascular effects- It produces minimal cardiovascular depression, and it is not arrhythmogenic- and so is safe in cardiac patients. Xenon produces no green house effect or ozone depletion and is environmentally safe, unlike the other inhaled anesthetics.

Commonly, when the condition is due to underlying peptic ulcer disease, the stenosis is found in the first part of the duodenum, the most common site for a peptic ulcer.> True pyloric stenosis can occur due to fibrosis around a pyloric channel ulcer. However, in recent years the most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction has been gastric cancer. In this circumstance the metabolic consequences may be somewhat different from those of benign pyloric stenosis because of the relative hypochlorhydria found in patients with gastric cancer.",A

"If caecum is involved as a pa of the wall of hernial sac and is not its content, then it will be known as: September 2009",Richter's hernia,Spigelian hernia,Sliding hernia,Interstitial hernia,"Ans. C: Sliding hernia Indirect inguinal hernia An indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine. The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric aeries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle. Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac. Direct hernia A direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle. The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric aeries, and medially by the conjoined tendon. Femoral hernia The femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament. Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated. Umbilical hernia The umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years. Richter hernia The Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel. As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting. The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional hernia This iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%. Spigelian hernia This rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle). Obturator hernia This hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter. Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contents Sliding hernia As a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder.",C

"All of the following are true about depolarizing agents, EXCEPT:",Rocuronium undergoes no metabolism,Pancuronium resembles noradrenaline,Atracurium's duration of action can be markedly prolonged by hypothermia,Vecuronium effect is not altered in renal failure,"Pancuronium consists of a steroid ring on which two modified ACh molecules are positioned. It resembles ACh enough to bind (but not activate) the nicotinic ACh receptor. Rocuronium undergoes no metabolism and is eliminated primarily by the liver and slightly by the kidneys. Because of its unique metabolism, atracurium's duration of action can be markedly prolonged by hypothermia and to a lesser extent by acidosis. Vecuronium is metabolized to a small extent by the liver. It depends primarily on biliary excretion and secondarily (25%) on renal excretion. Although it is a satisfactory drug for patients with renal failure, its duration of action is somewhat prolonged. Ref: Butterwoh IV J.F., Mackey D.C., Wasnick J.D. (2013). Chapter 11.

Lower levels may be found in patients * with large metastases from gastric or colonic tumors and in some patients with acute or chronic hepatitis. High levels of serum AFP (> 500 to 1000 gg/1) in an adult with liver disease and without an obvious gastrointestinal tumor strongly suggest HCC.'- Harrison 16/e [Harrison 17/e writes about AFP:- 'Fetoprotein (AFP) is a serum tumor marker in HCC; however, it is only increased in about half of U.S. patients.' A rising level suggests progression of the tumor or recurrence after hepatic resection or embolization therapies. * The presence of an aerially enhancing liver mass > 2 cm with an AFP > 400 ng/ml (or 400 ,ug/L) is highly * suggestive of HCC. Percutaneous liver biopsy under U/S or CT guidance can be diagnostic, but the sample should be drawn with caution as these tumors tend to be vascular.

Which of the following is the best induction agent: September 2009,Ketamine,Diazepam,Nitrous oxide,Thiopentone,"Ans. D: Thiopentone Thiopental is an ultra-sho-acting barbiturate and has been used commonly in the induction phase of general anaesthesia Following intravenous injection the drug rapidly reaches the brain and causes unconsciousness within 15 seconds. At one minute, the drug attains a peak concentration of about 60% of the total dose in the brain. Thereafter, the drug distributes to the rest of the body and in about 15-20 minutes the concentration is low enough in the brain such that consciousness returns Thiopental is not used to maintain anaesthesia in surgical procedures because, in infusion, it displays zero-order elimination kinetics, leading to a long period before consciousness is regained. Instead, anaesthesia is usually maintained with an inhaled anesthetic (gas) agent. Inhaled anesthetics are eliminated relatively quickly, so that stopping the inhaled anesthetic will allow rapid return of consciousness.",D

The following are important in the maintenance of normal fecal continence except -,Anorectal angulation,Rectal innervation,Internal sphincter,Haustral valve,"Normal fecal continence requires

adequate rectal wall compliance to accommodate the fecal bolus.
appropriate neurogenic control of the pelvic floor and sphincter mechanism, and
functional internal and external sphincter muscles

At rest the puborectalis muscle creates a 'sling' around the distal rectum, forming a relatively acute angle (Anorectal angle). Anorectal angle distributes intraabdominal forces onto the pelvic floor and play an important role in the continence mechanism. At the time of defecation, this angle straightens, allowing the downward force to be applied along the axis of the rectum and anal canal.
The internal & external sphincters are tonically active at rest.

the internal sphincter is responsible for most of the resting, involuntary sphincter force
the external sphincter is responsible for voluntary sphincter force.
Both the internal and external sphincters are innervated by pudendal nerve.
Finally, the hemorrhoidal cushions may contribute to continence by mechanically blocking the anal canal.
Thus impaired continence may result from :
poor rectal compliance
injury to internal and/or external sphincter or puborectalis, or
nerve damage or neuropathy",D

"A patient presented with blunt abdominal injury underwent complete repair of liver; and was given transfusion of 12 units of whole blood. Thereafter, it is found that wound is bleeding. It is treated by",Calcium gluconate/calcium chloride,Fresh Frozen Plasma,Vitamin-K,Platelets rich plasma,"(D) Platelets rich plasma > Massive Transfusion is usually defined as the need to transfuse from one to two times the patient's normal blood volume. In a 'normal' adult, this is the equivalent of 10-20 units. Potential complications from this include coagulopathy, citrate toxicity, hypothermia, acid-base disturbances and changes in serum potassium concentration. Coagulopathy is common with massive transfusion. The most common cause of bleeding following a large volume transfusion is dilutional thrombocytopenia. This should be suspected and treated first before moving on to factor deficiencies as the cause of coagulopathy. Patients who may require multiple transfusions are best second by receiving SPAP and leucocyte reduced components to lower the risk of autoimmunization. Citrate toxicity results when the citrate in the transfused blood begins to bind calcium in the patient's body. Clinically significant hypocalcemia does not usually occur unless the rate of transfusion exceeds one unit every five minutes or so. Citrate metabolism is primarily hepatic - so hepatic disease or dysfunction can cause this effect to be more pronounced. Treatment is with intravenous calcium administration - but identification of the problem requires a high index of suspicion. Hypothermia should not occur on a regular basis. Massive transfusion is an absolute indication for the warming of all blood and fluid to body temperature as it is being given.Acid-Base balance can be seen after massive transfusion. The most common abnormality is a metabolic alkalosis. Patients may initially be acidotic because the blood load itself is acidic and there may be a prevailing lactic acidosis from hypoperfusion. However, once normal perfusion is restored, any metabolic acidosis resolves and the citrate and lactate are then converted to bicarbonate in the liver. Serum potassium can rise as blood is given. The potassium concentration in stored blood increases steadily with time. The amount of potassium is typically less than 4 milliequivalents per unit - so you can see that large amounts of blood at a high rate of delivery is required to raise serum levels of potassium.",D

What is TRUE regarding Barrett's esophagus -,Seen in females,Premalignant condition,Responds to conservative management,Squamous metaplasia is seen,"About option (a)


Barrett's esophagus is more common in men than in women (3 : 1 ratio)


About option (c)

Schwartz surgery and CSDT writes that Barrett's esophagus can be reversed but only with antireflux surgery (response to medications is not good). Read below lines from CSDT (13/e p438) Schwartz (9/e p841): CSDT writes-'A fundoplication may promote regression of the columnar epithelium. Many studies have shown that regression occurs in 15-50% of patients when the length of the Barrett segment is less than 3 cm.'
Schwartz writes- 'The common belief that Barrett's epithelium cannot be reversed is likely false. DeMeester and associates reported that, after antireflux surgery, loss of IM (intestinal metaplasia) in patients with visible BE was rare, but occurred in73% of patients with inapparent IM of the cardia. This suggests that the metaplastic process may indeed be reversible if reflux is eliminated early in its process, that cardiac mucosa is dynamic, and that, as opposed to IM extending several centimeters into the esophagus, IM of the cardia is more likely to regress following antireflux surgery.
Gurski and colleagues reviewed pre- and posttreatment endoscopic biopsies from 77 Barrett's patients treated surgically and 14 treated with PPIs. Histopathologic regression occurred in 28 of 77 patients (36.4%) following antireflux surgery, and in one of 14 (7.1%) patients treated with PPlsalone (P <.03). After surgery, regression from low-grade dysplastic to nondysplastic BE occurred in 17 of 25 (68%) patients and from IM to no IM in 11 of 52 (21.2%) patients. Both types of regression were significantly more common in short- (<3 cm) compared to long-segment (>3 cm) BE.
Although these studies do not conclusively prove the ability of antireflux surgery to reverse the changes of early BE, they do provide encouragement that, given early changes, the process may indeed be reversible.'
More about the tit of Barret's oesophagus

First, the natural course of Barrett's oesophagus.

-  Barrett's esophagus develops during healing of erosive esophagitis with continued acid reflux and the Barrett's esophagus progresses through a dysplastic stage before developing into adenocarcinoma. The stages are
-   Erosive esophagitis → Metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus) → Low grade dysplasia → high grade dysplaisa → Adenocarcinoma

Treatment of Barrett's esophagus is same as for reflux esophagitis → Conservative (antacids, H2 blocking agents, elevation of the head of bed, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol etc.) and Anti-reflux surgery (Nissen's fundoplication is anti-reflux procedure of choice)
As there is substantial increased risk of cancer with Barrett's esophagus, a regular follow-up with endoscopy and biopsy is done. This allows detection of cancer at an early stage with improved long-term survival after resection
In the absence of dysplasia → Surveillance endoscopy every 12-24 months.
In the presence of low-grade dysplasia →

Patients with low grade dysplasia should be treated for 12 weeks with high-dose acid suppression therapy and then biopsy repeated. (the rationale for this approach is to decrease the mucosal inflammation by blocking acid secretion, allowing the pathologist a more accurate reading),If the repeated biopsy show metaplasia or high-grade dysplasia, the patient should be managed accordingly. If repeated low-grade dysplasia is seen- surveillance endoscopy is done every 6-12 months.

If high grade dysplasia is detected (the diagnosis must be confirmed by two experienced pathologist) → esophagectomy with removal of all columnar lined epithelium

or
if resection is not done, then the patient should be strictly followed at 3 monthly interval. If cancer is detected resection is done.
Rationale for esophagectomy in high grade dysplasia is based on the following considerations-
(a) cancer is already present in about 30 to 50% of patients operated for high grade dysplasia.
(b) cancer develops in about 50% fo patients during follow up.)",B

Fontes)On doing laparoscopic cholecystectomy patient developed wheezing, which should be treated by deepening of the plane of anesthesia.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia. First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2. Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment. - Yao and Artusio's AnesthesiologyIn the middle of surgery, the patient developed a severe wheezing attack. How do you manage it?First, deepen the level of anesthesia and increase FIO2, Remember that the patient is under anesthesia and undergoing surgery. Therefore, medical intervention, such as B-agonist administration, is not the first choice of treatment.The most common cause of asthmatic attack during surgery is inadequate depth of anesthesia.The patient with asthma has an extremely sensitive tracheobronchial tree. When the level of anesthesia is too light, the patient may develop bucking, straining, or coughing as a result of the foreign body (endotracheal tube) in the trachea and then bronchospasm.First, the blood pressure is taken to ensure it is normal or high, and then anesthesia is deepened by increasing the concentration of inhalation agents, such as sevoflurane, halothane, or isoflurane. which are direct bronchodilators as well.An incremental dose of ketamine maybe a quick way of maintaining blood pressure, rapidly deepening anesthesia, achieving bronchodilation, and avoiding the problem of delivering an inhaled anesthetic to a patient with poor ventilation.At the same time, oxygenation can be improved by increasing the inspired oxygen concentration and decreasing nitrous oxide. The patient should be continuously ventilated with a volume-cycled ventilator.Second, relieve mechanical stimulation. Pass a catheter through the endotracheal tube to suction secretions and determine whether there is an obstruction, kinking of the tube, or overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff.The cuff of the endotracheal tube can be deflated, the tube moved back 1 to 2 cm, and the cuff reinflated. Occasionally, the endotracheal tube slips down and stimulates the carina of the trachea, causing severe bronchospasm during light anesthesia.Surgical stimulation, such as traction on the mesentery, intestine, or stomach, should be stopped temporarily, because it causes vagal reflex and can cause bronchospasm.Third, medical intervention is necessary if the previously mentioned treatment cannot break the bronchospasm or the anesthesia cannot be increased because of hypotension.The cornerstone of the treatment of the intraoperative bronchospasm is inhalation of B2-agonists such as albuterol, which induce further bronchodilation even in the presence of adequate inhalational anesthesia.Fourth, bring in an intensive care unit (ICU) ventilator. Anesthesia ventilators are not designed for patients with high airway resistance. An ICU ventilator can generate inspiratory pressures as high as 120 cm H2O. With low tubing compliance, little ventilation is wasted into the circuit.",D

The musculature of the pylorus and adjacent antrum is grossly hypertrophied, the hypertrophy being maximum in the pylorus itself.
It occurs in approximately 3 in 1000 live birth and is the most common surgical cause of vomiting in infancy.
M> F (4 : 1)*
Characteristically the first born male child is affected.


The condition is most commonly seen at 4 wks after birth ranging from the 3rd wk to on rare occasion, the 7th. However, 20% of infants are symptomatic from birth, and most are symptomatic within the first 2 months after birth.


Non-bilious vomiting, becoming increasingly projectile, occurs over several days to weeks. Eventually the infant will develop a nearly complete obstruction by the second to fourth week of life and will not be able to hold down even clear liquids. This invariably proceeds to severe dehydration if not t/t.
These infants develop a metabolic alkalosis with severe depletion of potassium and chloride ions.
' The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis usually can be made on physical examination by palpation of the typical 'olive' in the right upper quadrant and the presence of visible gastric waves on the abdomen.
When the olive cannot be palpated, ultrasound in experienced hands will diagnose the condition accurately in 95 percent of pts.' - Schwartz.

Pyloric stenosis is never a surgical emergency although dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities may present a medical emergency
Fluid resuscitation and correction of electrolyte, abnormalities and metabolic alkalosis is essential before surgery.

Meconium ileus is associated with -,Fibrocystic disease of pancreas,Liver aplasia,Cirrhosis of liver,Malnutrition,"Meconium ileus  is a neonatal manifestation of cystic fibrosis (also k/a fibrocystic ds. of pancreas)
In cystic fibrosis there is pancreatic enzyme deficiency and abnormal chloride secretion in the intestine that results in the production of viscous water-poor meconium.
Meconium ileus results because of impaction of this thick meconium in the ileum.
Meconium ileus presents shortly after birth with progressive abdominal distention and failure to pass meconium with intermittent bilious vomiting.


Abdominal x-ray shows

dilated loops of small intestine.
air-fluid levels do not form in spite of complete small intestinal obstruction, because the enteric contents are viscous and thick.

Local anaesthetics act by-,Na channel inhibition inside gate,Na channel inhibition outside gate,K channel inhibition inside gate,K channel inhibition outside gate,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Na channel inhibition inside gate o Local anesthetics act by inhibiting Na+ channels from inside.Mechanism of action of LAo Local anaesthetics block generation and conduction of nerve impulse at all part of neuron where they come in contact, without causing structural damage.o Thus not only sensory but motor impulses and autonomic control is also interrupted,o Mechanism of action# Normally Na+ channel in axonal membrane has following phases :LAs prolong the inactive state - channel takes longer to recover - refractory period of the fiber is increased.LAs first penetrate the axonol membrane to come inside and then their active species (cationic form) bind to Na+ channel from inside.Cationic form (active form) is able to approach its receptor only when the channel is open at the inner face - So resting nerve is resistant to block as Na+ channels are not activated and cationic form is not able to approach its receptor.So blockade develops rapidly when the nerve is stimulated repeatedly.Degree of blockade is frequency dependent - greater blockade at higher frequency of stimulation.Exposure to higher concentration of Ca+2 reduces inactivation of Na+ channels and lessens the block.o Order of blockade of fibres B > C > Ad > Aa, b & g (Autonomic > Sensory > Motor). Order of recovery is in reverse order.o Among sensory afferent order of block is : Temperature (cold before heat) > Pain > touch > deep pressure,o When applied to tongue, bitter taste is lost first followed by sweet and sour, and salty taste last of all.o Myelinated nerves are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated,o Smaller fibres are more sensitive than larger fibres.",A

(SELECT 1 DIAGNOSIS)",Subdural hematoma,Epidural hematoma,Carotid dissection,Brain contusion,"Subdural hematomas usually arise from tears in the veins bridging from the cerebral cortex to the dura or venous sinuses, often after only minor head injuries. They can become apparent several days after the initial injury. Treatment is with drainage of the hematoma through a burr hole; a formal craniotomy may be required if the fluid reaccumulates. Significant brain contusions due to blunt trauma are usually associated with at least transient loss of consciousness; similarly, epidural hematomas result in a period of unconsciousness, although a 'lucid interval' may follow during which neurologic findings are minimal.Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the absence of antecedent trauma most commonly arises from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm, which typically is found at the bifurcation of the major branches of the circle of Willis. Other less frequent causes include hypertensive hemorrhage, trauma, and bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation. Patients present with the sudden onset of an excruciating headache. Complaints of a stiff neck and photophobia are common. Loss of consciousness may be transient or evolve into frank coma. Cranial nerve palsies are seen as a consequence both of increased intracranial pressure due to hemorrhage and pressure of the aneurysm on adjacent cranial nerves. CT scans followed by cerebral arteriography help to confirm the diagnosis as well as to identify the location of the aneurysm. Treatment consists of surgical ligation of the aneurysm by placing a clip across its neck. Early surgical intervention (within 72 h of SAH) may prevent aneurysmal rebleeding and allow aggressive management of post hemorrhage vasospasm.",A

During the interdigestive period, the GI tract undergoes regular increases in peristaltic contractile activity at about every 90 mm that are termed migrating motor complexes. Originally recorded from the small intestine, they begin in the smooth muscle of the esophagus or the stomach. They are commonly associated with periodic increases in the hormone motilin.

A 72-year-old patient with an intractable type I ulcer along the incisura with a significant amount of scarring along the entire length of the lesser curvature. Select the appropriate surgical procedure for the patient. (SELECT 1 PROCEDURE),Vagotomy and antrectomy,Antrectomy alone,Vagotomy and pyloroplasty,Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy,"Gastric ulcers have been classified as type I (incisura or most inferior portion of lesser curvature), type II (gastric and duodenal), type III (pyloric and prepyloric), and type IV (juxtacortical). Indications for surgery are intractability, perforation, obstruction, and bleeding. A patient with an intractable type I ulcer can be treated with an antrectomy alone or with a proximal gastric vagotomy. If done properly, antrectomy offers slightly lower recurrence rates and a higher incidence of postoperative sequelae as compared with proximal gastric vagotomy. However, significant scarring along the lesser curvature makes a proximal gastric vagotomy technically unfeasible.Gastric outlet obstruction and severe inflammation around the pylorus and duodenum make resection a difficult and dangerous option. Similarly, pyloroplasty is often not adequate in the setting of gastric outlet obstruction to provide adequate drainage. Vagotomy and gastrojejunostomy, although associated with the highest recurrence rate, offers the best choice in the described setting.In an elderly patient with a bleeding duodenal ulcer, recurrence rates are less of a consideration and thus the simplest and most expedient operation offers the best surgical outcome. Vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the ulcer is the best choice in this setting. Finally, in a young patient with intractable type III ulcers, antrectomy with vagotomy offers the best long-term outcome. Recurrence rates following this procedure are about 2-3%, as compared with 7.4% for vagotomy and drainage and 10-31% in patients receiving a proximal gastric vagotomy only.",B

The impoance of immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of asthma is suggested by the common association between the disease and the presence of allergic diseases, skin-test sensitivity, and increased serum IgE levels. In addition, many susceptible persons develop bronchospasm after inhalation challenge with airborne allergens. A large propoion of asthmatic subjects, however, have none of these markers of immunologic activity and are classified as having idiosyncratic asthma. When tested for bronchial hyperirritability with various nonantigenic bronchoprovocational agents (e.g., histamine and cold air), asthmatic subjects are found to be more sensitive than normal, and the bronchoconstriction is generally reversible after exposure to a j3-adrenergic agonist; the reason for this airway hyperirritability, which is a common feature in all asthmatic persons, is unlmown. Although psychological factors ceainly influence the expression of asthma, no single personality type is considered 'asthmatic'.",D

Involvement of the respiratory muscles is life threatening. The syndrome seems to be caused by a demyelination in the motor and, occasionally, the sensory erves. Measurement of spinal fluid protein is helpful in the diagnosis; protein levels are increased to more than twice normal, while glucose and cell counts are normal. Hospitalization for observation is indicated. Treatment can consist of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis. Recovery is not always complete. Bell palsy usually follows a mild upper respiratory infection, resulting in the rapid development of weakness of the entire side of the face. Muscular dystrophy encompasses a number of entities that include weakness over months. Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease has a clinical onset including perineal and intrinsic foot muscle atrophy, later extending to the intrinsic hand muscles and proximal legs.",C
Dumping syndrome is characterized by all of the following except: March 2005,Colic,Tremors and giddiness,Hyperglycemia,Epigastric fullness,"Ans. C: Hyperglycemia Dumping syndrome is a relatively rare disorder in which the stomach contents are delivered too quickly to the small intestine. It occurs as a physiological reaction to the consumption of too much simple or refined sugar in some persons, when simple sugar exits the stomach too rapidly it attracts fluid into the upper intestine, and the blood volume decreases as it attempts to absorb the sugar. Dumping syndrome is one of the unwanted post operative sequelae to paial gastrectomy. This symptom complex is believed to be due to rapid emptying of the gastric contents into the upper small intestine and also an increased transit rate through the small bowel itself right through the colon. As a consequence of this dumping a large volume of hyperosmotic fluid enters the small intestine. In an attempt to bring the osmotic tension to the physiological range, large amount of fluid cross the intestinal mucosa. As a result the plasma volume is reduced, which in turn exes a vasomotor effect. The vasomotor symptoms comprise general weakness, pallor, sweating, palpitation and light headedness. Another set of symptoms of gastrointestinal disturbance such as epigastric discomfo, nausea, vomiting and possibly an episode of diarrhea is observed. The biochemical changes that occur in dumping syndrome are hyperinsulinaemia followed by hypoglycaemia due to rapid transpo and absorption of food from small intestine after a meal. Since the conversion of glucose to glycogen and its storage consumes potassium, its level in blood decreases in dumping syndrome and hence hypokalaemia may be seen too. These symptoms classically occur some 5-30 minutes after eating and are more marked if the meal is large paicularly if it contains a substantial amount of carbohydrate and liquid. The choices for managing dumping syndrome include dietary changes, medications and surgery. Although dumping syndrome classically develops after gall bladder surgery, it may also occur after other abdominal operations, such as duodenal ulcer surgery or surgery for severe reflux. Sometimes it may be seen in people born with unusually small stomach and very rarely in those with stomach abnormalities.",C

Which of the following agent causes muscle rigidity,Fentanyl,Halothane,Ketamine,Droperidol,"Opioids can increase muscle tone and may cause muscle rigidity. The incidence of rigidity noted with opioid anesthetic techniques varies significantly because of differences in dose and speed of opioid administration, the concomitant use of N2O, the presence or absence of muscle relaxants, and the patient's age. Opioid-induced rigidity is characterized by increased muscle tone that sometimes progresses to severe stiffness with the potential for serious problems. Clinically significant opioid-induced rigidity usually begins just as or after a patient loses consciousness. Mild manifestations of rigidity, such as hoarseness, can occur in conscious patients. Vocal cord closure is primarily responsible for the difficult ventilation with a bag and mask that follows the administration of opioids. The precise mechanism by which opioids cause muscle rigidity is not clearly understood. Muscle rigidity is not the result of a direct action on muscle fibers because it can be decreased or prevented by pretreatment with muscle relaxants. Mechanisms of opioid-induced muscle rigidity involving the CNS have been postulated. Pharmacologic investigation using selective agonists and antagonists suggest that systemic opioid-induced muscle rigidity is primarily caused by activation of central m receptors, whereas supraspinal d1 and k1 receptors may attenuate this effect. Some aspects of opioid-induced catatonia and rigidity (increased incidence with age, muscle movements resembling extrapyramidal side effects) are similar to Parkinson's disease and suggest similarities in neurochemical mechanisms. Patients with Parkinson's disease, paicularly if they are inadequately treated, may experience reactions such as dystonia following opioid administration. Pretreatment with or concomitant use of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can decrease the incidence and severity of rigidity. Induction doses of sodium thiopental and subanesthetic doses of diazepam and midazolam can prevent, attenuate, or successfully treat rigidity. Rapid administration of larger doses of opioids (paicularly fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, and alfentanil) can induce chest wall rigidity severe enough to make ventilation with bag and mask nearly impossible.

One of the following is characterised by RIM sign:,Hydronephrosis (Gross),Hypernephroma,Chronic pyelonephritis,Polycystic kidney,"Ans is 'a' ie Hydronephrosis (Gross) We will write down, what we have got so far about the 'rim sign'.The rim sign is seen in cases of ureteral calculi.[The'rim sign,' originally reported by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Ref: http://radioloev.rsna.ors/content/202/3/709.abstract: httv://emedicine.medscave.com/article/456872-overview) 1 Rim sign has also been mentioned in cases of renal infarction, but here its k/a cortical rim sign.[Cortical rim sign: Entire kidney is nonenhancing except for the outer 2 to 4 mm of cortex, which are perfused by capsular branches (Ref: http://www. learningradiologv.com/notes/gunotes/renalinfarctpage.htm) 7Spider leg appearance - Polycystic kidney*Cobra head appearance - Ureterocele*Flower vase appearance of ureters - Horse shoe kidney*Sandy patches - Schistosomiasis of bladder*Soap bubble appearance - Hydronephrosis*Apple core lesion on barium enema - Ca colon*Claw appearance on barium enema - Intussusception*Saw tooth appearance - Diverticula of colon*Birds beak appearance of esophagus on barium meal - Achalasia*Cork screw appearance of esophagus on barium meal - Diffuse esophageal spasm*String sign of Kantor - Crohn's ds*Thumb printing sign - Ischemic colitis* Now as far as the answer is concerned, among the given options 'hydronephrosis' appears to be the best choice, as ureteric calculi would lead to hydronephrosis.",A
Double Bubble sign is seen with:,Pyloric stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Ileal atresia,Esophageal atresia,"Ans is 'b' i.e. Duodenal atresia 'The ultrasound hallmark of duodenal atresia is the 'double bubble sign'. This consists of two adjacent, fluid-filled cavities in the upper abdomen: a lateral and usually somewhat larger cavity representing the dilated stomach, and a medial cavity representing the distended proximal duodenum between the pylorus and the stenosis.'- Ultrasound in obstetrics and gynecology By Eberhard Merz, F. Bahlmann 2/e p298Double bubble sign:The double bubble sign is a finding observed on radiographs of newborns and infants. It is reproducible with a variety of other imaging modalities, including upper gastrointestinal studies and prenatal sonography. The finding depicts two air-filled structures in the upper abdomen, with little or no air distally. Horizontal-beam radiographs will demonstrate air and fluid levels in both bubbles.The first bubble (proximal and left sided) is - stomachThe second bubble (to the right of the midline) is - duodenumThe detection of the double bubble sign leads to suspicion of a number of structural anomalies, all of which cause duodenal obstruction.Causes:Intrinsic causes areExtrinsic causes are- duodenal atresia,- annular pancreas,- duodenal stenosis,- malrotation of the gut with obstruction produced byandmidgut volvulus or by Ladd bands, and- duodenal webs;- preduodenal position of the portal vein.The specific duodenal structural anomaly causing the obstruction determines the appearance, prominence, and presence of air distal to the obstruction. Duodenal atresia produces complete obstruction, partially obstructing anomalies, such as duodenal web or duodenal stenosis, allow passage of some air distal to the obstruction and a less dramatic double bubble.",B

Protein metabolism after trauma is characterized by,Decreased liver gluconeogenesis,"Inhibition of skeletal muscle breakdown by interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF, cachectin)",Decreased urinary nitrogen loss,Hepatic synthesis of acute-phase reactants,"Injury and sepsis result in accelerated protein breakdown with increased urinary nitrogen loss and increased peripheral release of amino acids. The negative nitrogen balance represents the net result of breakdown and synthesis (with breakdown increased and synthesis increased or diminished). Amino acids such as alanine are released by muscle and transported to the liver for incorporation into acute-phase proteins including fibrinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and ferritin. The amino acids also undergo gluconeogenesis to glucose, which is utilized primarily by the brain and other glycolytic tissues such as peripheral nerves, erythrocytes, and bone marrow. Other tissues receive energy from fat in the form of fatty acids or ketone bodies during starvation following major trauma; this helps to conserve body protein. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood, and its levels in muscle and blood decrease following injury and sepsis as it is consumed rapidly by replicating fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and intestinal endothelial cells. The use of glutamine may decrease protein catabolism in the intestine and may help prevent atrophy of the gastrointestinal tract in starved and parenterally nourished patients. Along with the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol), interleukin 1 appears to mediate muscle breakdown. Recent studies have indicated that TNF (also called cachectin because of the role it plays in muscle wasting in septic or oncologic patients) also may be a principal catabolic cytokine in the traumatized patient. This protein is secreted by macrophages and further affects metabolism by inducing secretion of interleukin 1 and inhibiting synthesis and activity of lipogenic enzymes.",D

Which of the following is not true about xenon anesthesia,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side effects,Slow induction and slow recovery,Inhibits Ca++ pump and low blood gas solubility,"Xe has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects.

"About Diaphragmatic injury, true statement is -",T/t is conservative,Resolves spontaneously,Left side is more common,Associated with pneumothorax,"Diaphragmatic rupture is more common on the left side.
Cause -
The right diaphragm is protected by two mechanisms:
The liver on the right and the heart in the centre have a buffering effect that diffuses the sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure.
Diaphragmatic Injuries
Diaphragmatic injuries are often caused by penetrating injuries. Patients sustaining penetrating injuries below the nipples and above the costal margins should be investigated to rule out diaphragmatic injury. Blunt injury to the diaphragm is usually caused by a compressive force applied to the pelvis and abdomen. the diaphragmatic rupture is usually large, with herniation of the abdominal contents into the chest. Herniation occurs as a result of the pressure differential between the thoracic and abdominal cavity. Most diaphragmatic injuries are silent and the presenting features are those of injury to the surrounding organs. The most accurate investigation is by video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) or laparoscopy. Operative repair is recommended in all cases. All penetrating diaphragmatic injury must be repaired via the abdomen and not the chest, to rule out penetrating hollow viscus injury.",C
Which of the following statement is false: March 2007,Granulomatous inflammation is found in Crohn's disease.,Perianal lesions are common in Crohn's disease,Stricture involving the colon is found in ulcerative colitis,Fistula formation is common in Crohn's disease.,"Ans. C: Stricture involving the colon is found in ulcerative colitisCrohn's disease/regional enteritis) is an autoimmune disease, which can affect any pa of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus (terminal ileum is the area most commonly affected).Anal lesions are also commonThe disease is characterized by areas of inflammation with areas of normal lining between in a symptom known as skip lesions.Microscopy of Crohn's disease show focal areas of chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal walls.There are non-caseating granulomas, but these are found in only 60% of patients.The main gastrointestinal symptoms are:Abdominal pain may be the initial symptom of Crohn's disease. It is often accompanied by diarrhea, especially in those who have had surgery. The diarrhea may or may not be bloody.The nature of the diarrhea in Crohn's disease depends on the pa of the small intestine or colon that is involved. Ileitis typically results in large-volume watery feces. Colitis may result in a smaller volume of feces of higher frequency.Visible bleeding in the feces is less common in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis, but may be seen in the setting of Crohn's colitis.Although the association is greater in the context of ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease may also be associated with primary sclerosing cholangitisPerianal discomfo may also be prominent in Crohn's disease. Itchiness or pain around the anus may be suggestive of inflammation, fistulization or abscess around the anal area or anal fissure.Crohn's disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloahropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (ahritis) or muscle inseions (enthesitis). Common complications of inflammation include scarring that can produce intestinal blockage (obstruction) and deep ulcers penetrating through the bowel wall that can create pus-filled pockets of infection (abscesses) or abnormal connecting channels between the intestine and other organs (fistulas).When the large intestine is affected extensively by Crohn's disease, rectal bleeding commonly occurs.After many years, the risk of colon cancer (cancer of the large intestine) is greatly increased.About one third of people who develop Crohn's disease have problems around the anus, especially fistulas and cracks (fissures) in the lining of the mucus membrane of the anus.Crohn's disease may lead to complications in other pas of the body. These complications include gallstones, inadequate absorption of nutrients, urinary tract infections, kidney stones, and deposits of the protein amyloid in several organs (amyloidosis).A colonoscopy is the best test for making the diagnosis of Crohn's disease as it allows direct visualization of the colon and the terminal ileum, identifying the pattern of disease involvement. Finding a patchy distribution of disease, with involvement of the colon or ileum but not the rectum, is suggestive of Crohn's disease, as are other endoscopic stigmata. The most common disease that mimics the symptoms of Crohn's disease is ulcerative colitis, as both are inflammatory bowel diseases that can affect the colon with similar symptoms.It is impoant to differentiate these diseases, since the course of the diseases and treatments may be different.",C
"After removal of the Parotid gland, patient is having sweating on cheeks while eating. In this complication seen after parotidectomy, the auriculotemporal nerve which contains parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to parotid gland is fused with which nerve?",Greater petrosal nerve,Facial nerve,Great auricular nerve,Buccal nerve,"Gustatory sweating (Frey's syndrome or auriculotemporal syndrome) Frey syndrome, also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating, is characterized by sweating and flushing of the facial skin over the parotid bed and neck during mastication (in the cutaneous distribution of the auriculotemporal nerve.)

It is caused by injury to auriculotemporal nerve, after surgical trauma to the parotid gland.
Frey syndrome is thought to be due to aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibers between the otic ganglion and salivary tissue, which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels. Frey syndrome is reported by approximately 10 percent of patients, although rigorous testing may detect gustatory sweating in as many as 95 percent of patients after parotidectomy.
Frey syndrome may occur from two weeks to two years after surgery due to a latency in the regeneration of parasympathetic nerve fibers; the area of involved skin may increase over time.
The incidence of Frey syndrome is reduced by minimizing the parotid wound bed, placing fascial grafts between the skin and the gland bed, reconstructive techniques such as thick skin flaps, and postoperative RT.

Hadfields operation is performed for which of the following pathology?,Duct ectasia,Fibroadenoma,Mondors disease,Inflammatory breast carcinoma,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Duct ectasia Duct ectasia/periductal mastitis* This is a dilatation of the breast ducts, which is often associated with periductal inflammation.* The classical description of the pathogenesis of duct ectasia asserts that the first stage in the disorder is a dilatation in one or more of the larger lactiferous ducts, which fill with a stagnant brown or green secretion. This may discharge.* These fluids then set up an irritant reaction in surrounding tissue leading to periductal mastitis or even abscess and fistula formation.* In some cases, a chronic indurated mass forms beneath the areola, which mimics a carcinoma. Fibrosis eventually develops, which may cause slit-like nipple retraction.* A marked association between recurrent periductal inflammation and smoking has been demonstrated. It is certainly clear that cessation of smoking increases the chance of a long-term cure.Clinical features* Nipple discharge (of any colour), a subareolar mass, abscess, mammary duct fistula and/or nipple retraction are the most common symptom/s.Treatment* In the case of a mass or nipple retraction, a carcinoma must be excluded by obtaining a mammogram and negative cytology or histology. If any suspicion remains the mass should be excised.* Antibiotic therapy may be tried, the most appropriate agents being co-amoxiclav or flucloxacillin and metronidazole.* However, surgery is often the only option likely to bring about cure of this notoriously difficult condition; this consists of excision of all of the major ducts (Hadfield's operation). It is particularly important to shave the back of the nipple to ensure that all terminal ducts are removed. Failure to do so will lead to recurrence.",A

The misconception that the entire bowel does not function in the early postoperative period is still widely held. Intestinal motility and absorption studies have clarified the patterns by which bowel activity resumes. The stomach remains uncoordinated in its muscular activity and does not empty efficiently for about 24 hours after abdominal procedures. The small bowel functions normally within hours of surgery and is able to accept nutrients promptly, either by nasoduodenal or percutaneous jejunal feeding catheters or, after 24 hours, by gastric emptying. The colon is stimulated in large measure by the gastrocolic reflex but ordinarily is relatively inactive for 3 to 4 days. Well-nourished patients who undergo uncomplicated surgical procedures can tolerate up to 10 days without full nutritional suppo before significant problems with protein breakdown begin to occur. Enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral nutrition because of decreased risks of nosocomial infections and catheter-related complications and increased benefit in preventing mucosal atrophy",B

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphatase is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphatase assay has been superseeded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. * Normal serum level ----> less than 4 ng/ml* * 4 - 10 ng/ml ----> this range is common for both BHP and Ca.* * More than 10 ng/ml --> approx 75% will have cancer.* Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density are used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 ng/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 ng/mL per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level. - Values < 0.10 are consistent with BPH. - > 0.15 suggest cancer",A

Hydatid disease: Cystic hydatid disease is caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus is the most common whereas E. multilocularis and E. oligaus account for a small number of cases. Hydatid cysts are diagnosed in equal numbers of men and women at an age of 45 years. about three fouh of hydatid cysts are located in the right live and are singular. The clinical presentation of a hydatid cyst is largely asymptomatic until complications occur. The common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, dyspnea, and vomiting. The most frequent sign is hepatomegaly, jaundice and fever are each present in about % of the patients. USG is the most commonly used worldwide for the diagnosis of echinococcosis because of its availability,affordability, and accuracy. Laparoscopic techniques for drainage and unroofing of cysts have been rates after surgical treatment ranges from 1% to 20% but are generally 55 %or less in experienced centres. If surgical cystectomy with removal of the germinal laminated layers is not technically feasible, then liver resection can be employed. During aspiration or surgical treatment of hydatid cysts, extreme caution must be taken to avoid rupture of the cyst with release of protoscolices into the peritoneal cavity.

At supra MAC concentrations, anesthetics lead to shift of EEC wave from B to 6 waves.'In the anaesthetized subject, depression of thalamic gates together with diminished activation of the cortex by the ascending reticular activating system (AR4S) will be indicated by a progressive slowing of the EEG, in which the underlying electrical signal will change from low-voltage fast-wave to high-voltage slow-wave pattern. When quantitative EEG (OEEG) variables are applied, anaesthetic-related EEG slowing is associated with an increase in total power, an increase in relative power in the 6 and 8 frequency bands concomitant with a decrease in a and B power, and a decrease in both median frequency (ME) and spectral edge frequency (SEE). Changes from deeper to lighter levels of anaesthetic depth will be indicated by a shift in EEG power from the lower (6, 8) to the higher (a, B) frequency range and by a numerical increase in MF and SEF.

A housewife presented with acute paronychia since two days. The BEST anaesthetic agent for acute paronychia is:,1% xylocaine,2% xylocaine,Ketamine,Xylocaine + adrenaline,"The addition of epinephrine along with anaesthetic agent causes vasoconstriction at the site of administration. The consequent decreased absorption increases neuronal uptake, enhances the quality of analgesia, prolongs the duration of action, and limits toxic side effects. The effects of vasoconstrictors are more pronounced with shoer-acting agents. For example, the addition of epinephrine to lidocaine usually extends the duration of anesthesia by at least 50%. Epinephrine can also augment and prolong analgesia through activation of 2-adrenergic receptors. Ref: Morgan, Jr. G.E., Mikhail M.S., Murray M.J. (2006). Chapter 14. Local Anesthetics. In G.E.

His white blood cell count is 25,000/mL and creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL. His blood pressure does not respond to fluid administration despite a CVP of 15. Which of the following therapies is indicated in managing this patient?",Intubation,Recombinant human activated protein C,Epinephrine,Norepinephrine,") Early goal-directed therapy should be employed for patients with septic shock or severe sepsis. The tenets of resuscitation include intubation if hypoxic, fluid resuscitation to a central venous pressure target of 8 to 12 mm Hg if not intubated and infusion of vasopressors to maintain a mean aerial pressure of 65 mm Hg. Norepinephrine and dopamine are the vasopressors of choice; epinephrine vasoconstricts peripherally as well as increases cardiac contractility and is not a first-line agent for septic shock. Inotropes such as dobutamine have been used if oxygen delivery is low, but should not be used to push delivery to supranormal levels. Fuhermore, cultures should be drawn immediately and empiric antibiotics initiated; if there is a surgical source of sepsis, then operative intervention for source control should be promptly performed after initial resuscitative effos. Recombinant-activated protein C is indicated in patients with severe sepsis with a predicted high risk of moality (ie, older age, increased severity of disease); this patient does not have evidence of end-organ dysfunction such as acute renal or respiratory failure at this time. The use of coicosteroids for septic shock is controversial, but should only be considered in the setting of shock nonresponsive to fluids and vasopressors.

Which of the following is the best treatment for this surgical complication?,Transfusion with 1 unit of packed red blood cells,Oral iron supplementation,Oral vitamin B12 supplementation,Intravenous vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) supplementation,"Either megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency (due to lack of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for B12 absorption and is normally produced by the parietal cells of the stomach) or microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency (due to decreased iron intake and impaired absorption in the duodenum) can result after paial gastrectomy. While folate deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, it is rare after paial gastrectomy. Oral B12 is not a reliable method for correcting B12 deficiency; intravenous cyanocobalamin should be administered every 3 to 4 months for life. Other complications of paial gastrectomy includes osteoporosis secondary to impaired calcium absorption due to the Billroth II reconstruction (since calcium is normally absorbed in the proximal intestine--duodenum and jejunum). Also, fatty acids may also be malabsorbed due to inadequate mixing of bile salts and lipase with ingested fat, and therefore steatorrhea may result.",D

Clinical assessment b. Radiological imaging c. Tissue sampling for either cytological or histological examination. FNAC is more than often the first investigation for a tissue assessment. Bailey writes ? 'FNAC is the least invasive technique for obtaining a cell diagnosis and is very accurate if both operator and cytologists are experienced. However false negatives do occur, mainly through sampling error, and invasive cancer cannot be distinguished from 'in situ' disease. A histological specimen taken by core biopsy allows a definitive preoperative diagnosis, differentiates between duct carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive disease and also allows the tumor to be stained for receptor status. This is impoant before commencing neoadjuvant therapy.'",A

Gleasons Scoring is done for which of the following malignancy?,Prostate cancer,Lung cancer,Bladder cancer,Hodgkin's lymphoma,"Gleason scoring system is used in prostate cancer to measure the extent of histological aggressiveness. This system relies upon the low-power appearance of the glandular architecture under the microscope. While assigning a grade to a given tumor, pathologists assign a primary grade to the pattern of cancer that is most commonly observed and a secondary grade to the second most commonly observed pattern in the specimen. Grades range usually from 1 to 5. If the entire specimen has only one pattern present, then both the primary and secondary grade are repoed as same grade. The Gleason score or Gleason sum is obtained by adding the primary and secondary grades together. Gleason grades range from 1 to 5, and Gleason scores or sums range from 2 to 10.

Which of the following is not true about Xenon anaesthesia,Non explosive,Minimal cardiovascular side effects,slow induction and slow recovery,Low blood gas solubility,"Xe has a very low blood-gas solubility coefficient (0.115) and produces rapid induction of and emergence from anesthesia. Xe is not teratogenic, does not undergo biotransformation, and exes anesthetic and analgesic effects under normal atmospheric pressure conditions (1.0 MAC = 71%). Xe is derived from a paicle decay of radioactive heavy metals such as uranium and thorium. Xe naturally occurs in the atmosphere in trace amounts (1:11.5 million ) and is extracted from liquefied air by sequential cryogenic fractional distillation. Thus, Xe does not affect the ozone layer, unlike N2O and volatile anesthetics. This latter effect may be paicularly impoant because currently used inhaled anesthetics have been identified as strong greenhouse gases that contribute to total anthropogenic radiative forcing of global climate change. Xe is expensive to produce because of its rarity; only a finite amount is available for use as a general anesthetic. Total world production of Xe is estimated to be approximately 9 to 12 million liters per year. Despite its relative scarcity and high production costs, Xe was approved for clinical use in Russia, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom during the past decade. Unlike volatile anesthetics and N2O, which produce diverse hemodynamic actions in the absence or presence of hea disease, Xe is essentially devoid of major cardiovascular effects. For example, Xe did not alter the amplitudes of Na+, L-type Ca2+, and inward-rectifier K+ channel currents over a range of voltages in the isolated cardiac myocyte nor did the anesthetic noble gas affect indices of cardiac function in a Langendorff hea preparation. Systemic hemodynamics were unchanged and recovery from anesthesia was faster in patients who received 60% Xe-O2 compared with 60% N2O-0.5% isoflurane during elective surgery. Similarly, mean aerial pressure was maintained at conscious values during Xe-remifentanil but not propofol-remifentanil anesthesia in another study of patients undergoing elective surgery.

The management of this patient would be -",Lobectomy,Hemithyroidectomy,Eltroxin,Radio Iodine therapy,"Ans is 'B' i.e. Hemithyroidectomy A discrete solid swelling of the thyroid is mostly treated surgically by hemithyroidectomy. Biopsy of the resected segment is performed and if carcinoma found a total or near total thyroidectomy is done. A cystic swelling is treated by aspiration and surgery is performed only if it recurs (can be reaspirated upto 3 times) or cytology is suspicious of malignancy. most of the discrete thyroid swelling are non-neoplastic and benign, still surgery is the mainstay of treatment because of the risk of leaving a malignant nodule. Even though cold nodule ours malignancy only a very small percentage of them turn out to be malignant, so isotope scanning is of very little use in distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant swellings and is rather obsolete now. Eltroxin for TSH suppression is used only for a small number of cases. It is tried for 6 months. If the swelling regresses, well and good. If it does not surgery is performed.",B

"All are causes of pulmonary hypeension except,",Hyperventilation,Morbid obesity,High altitude,Fenfluramine,"Hyperventilation [Ref Harrison 17th/e p. 1579; 161h/e p. 14041 There are three main causes of pulmonary hypeension:- i) Cardiac diseases ii) Respiratory disease iii) Pulmonary thromboembolic disease Cardiac diseases -Lead to pulmonary hypeension by increasing pulmonary blood flow (e.g., large left to right shunt) or by increasing pulmonary venous pressure (e.g., L V. failure). In Respiratory diseases, - The predominant mechanism for the pulmonary hypeension is an increase in resistance to pulmonary blood flow arising from perivascular parenchymal changes coupled with pulmonary vasoconstriction due to hypoxia. * In pulmonary thromboembolic disease, - Clots in pulmonary vessels increase resistance to blood flow causing pulmonary hypeension. Now about other options mentioned in the question. Alveolar hyperventilation Pulmonary hypeension is seen in Alveolar hypoventilation (not hyperventilation). In patients with alveolar hypoventilation the primary pathogenic mechanism responsible for pulmonary hypeension is alveolar hypoxia potentiated by respiratory acidosis. (alveolar hypoxia leads to constriction of pulmonary vessels). Regardless of the etiology, whether pulmonary hypeenstion will occur in patients with alveolar hypoventilation depends on whether there is sufficient alveolar and aerial hypoxia to raise pulmonary aerial pressure considerably. In sleep apnea syndrome seen in obese individuals - Severe aerial hypomexia occurs during sleep due to hypoventilation (apnea). This causes pulmonary hypeension during sleep. After some point of time, the pulmonary hypeension may continue even during the day time. Anorexiants Pulmonary hypeension has been associated with anorexiants. 'A causal relationship has been established between exposure to several anorexigens including aminorex and fenfluramine and development of pulmonary aery hypeension.'",A

Site of action of vecuronium is?,Cerebrum,Reticular formation,Motor neuron,Neuro-muscular junction,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Neuro-muscular junction* Vecuronium, a non-depolarizing blocker, acts on nicotinic receptors at myoneural junction.* Neuro-muscular blocker act at myoneural junction1. Competitive (Non-depolarizing) blocker: -# They compete with Achfor Nm receptors - called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to Nm receptors - No opening of Na+ channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential - muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers as it increases the concentration of Ach by inhibiting its degradation by cholinesterase. Therefore, Neostigmine is used for the reversal of competitive (nondepolarizing) blockers.2. Depolarizing blockers (Succinylcholine, Decamethonium)# Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on NM receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity) - So, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant partial depolarization - Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonize depolarising blockers (Therefore neostigmine cannot be used for reversal).Inf act neostigmine can potentiate the block as neostigmine and other anti-cholinesterase also inhibits pseudocholinesterase which metabolizes Sch.Under certain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases :a) Phase I block* Rapid in onset* Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate - Typical mechanism of action of depolarizing blocker.* Has classical features of depolarization block.* Block is not antagonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine).b) Phase II block (Dual block)* Slow in onset* Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh - Ach can not act on Nm receptors (similar to competitive blocker).* Resembles block produced by competitive blockers - Therefore, has characteristics similar to non-depolarizing (competitive) block.* Block is partially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine).# In man, normally, only phase I block is seen - typical depolarizing block.# Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose.# SCh also produces phase II block in patients with atypical or deficient pseudocholinesterase.",D

True about esophageal injury:,Most common after penetrating injury,Can lead to mediastinal collection,Barium swallow is diagnostic,All,"Ans is All Most injuries to the esophagus are from penetrating trauma. Associated injuries are the rule.Symptoms include odynophagia (pain on swallowing foods or fluids), subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema, pleural effusion, air in the retro-esophageal space and unexplained fever within 24 hours of injury. Mediastinal and deep cervical emphysema must be seen as evidence of an aerodigestive injury until proven otherwise.If the diagnosis is made early, primary surgical repair is generally possible. If the diagnosis is delayed for more than 24 hours, primary repair may be impractical, with diversion and drainage being the only alternative. The major morbidity and moality associated with esophageal injuries are the result of delay in diagnosis, which underscores the necessity to aggressively exclude esophageal injury during the initial evaluation of a patient with neck injury. 'The moality rate rises exponentially if treatment is delayed for more than 12-24 hours.'- Bailey and LoveEsophagoscopy can be performed to evaluate the esophagus, but injuries have been missed with this technique alone. Therefore patients at risk should also undergo a soluble contrast esophagram looking for extravasation of contrast. If no extravasation is seen, a barium esophagram should be performed for greater detail. Failure to identify esophageal injuries leads to fulminant mediastinitis that is often fatal.Treatment consists of early debridement, primary repair, and drainage if identified within 24 hours after injury. Injuries diagnosed after 24 hours with mediastinal contamination are treated by cervical esophagostomy and distal feeding access. Esophageal resection is rarely needed but may be indicated in patients with esophageal necrosis or severe mediastinitis.. A drain should be left in place after all esophageal repairs.",D

Mucocele of the appendix is -,Benign tumour,Low grade malignancy,Retention cyst,All,"Ans. Three options are correct 'a' i.e, Benign tumour; 'b' i.e., Low grade malignancy & 'c' i.e. Retention cyst Mucocele of appendix: A mucocele of the appendix is an obstructive dilatation by intraluminal accumulation of mucoid material. Mucoceles may be caused by one of four processes: retention cysts, mucosal hyperplasia, cystadenomas, and cystadenocarcinomas. The clinical presentation of a mucocele is nonspecific, and often it is an incidental finding at operation for acute appendicitis. An intact mucocele presents no future risk for the patient; however, rupture may lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei or mucinous carcinomatosis of appendiceal origin Every effo is made to keep the mucocele intact during extraction, including placing the specimen in a bag and conveing a laparoscopic procedure to open. Management of Mucocele: Includes resection of the appendix, plus wide resection of the mesoappendix to include all the appendiceal lymph nodes, collection and cytologic examination of all intraperitoneal mucus, and careful inspection of the base of the appendix. Right hemicolectomy is done for patients with a positive margin at the base of the appendix or positive periappendiceal lymph nodes.",D
"A new born girl not passed meconium for 48 hrs, has abdominal distention and vomiting. Initial investigation of choice would be:",Manometry,Genotyping for cystic fibrosis,Lower GI contrast study,Serum trypsin immunoblot,"More than 90% of full term newborn infants pass meconium within the first 24 hrs. The possibility of intestinal obstruction is considered if an infant does not pass meconium for 24-36 hrs.
Differential diagnosis would include causes of low intestinal obstruction.

- Hirschsprung disease
- Beal or colonic atresia/stenosis
- Meconium ileus
- Meconium plug syndrome
- Neonatal small left colon syndrome

The first investigation is always a plain abdominal radiograph (supine and left lateral decubitus view)
Next investigation is a contrast enema also k/a lower GI series (presence of any perforation can be ruled out from plain X-rays)
Barium can be used but water-soluble contrast agents are used commonly
Contrast enema helps to some extent in differentiating among the causes of low intestinal obstructions.

Hirschsprung's disease-

Barium enema usually shows a transition zone between dilated proximal colon and a smaller-caliber obstructed distal colon caused by the nonrelaxation of the agaglionic bowel. However, a normal study does not exclude Hirschsprung's disease. Diagnosis is confirmed by rectal biopsy.

Meconium ilens-

Meconium ileus occurs when meconium becomes inspissated and obstructs the distal ileum.
The condition is usually a manifestation of cystic fibrosis. Meconium ileus is usually taken to be synonymous with cystic fibrosis until proven otherwise, and meconium ileus is generally the earliest manifestation of the disease.
Contrast enema study typically demonstrates microcolon, which is a reflection of underused bowel.

Meconium plug syndrome

Meconium plug syndrome, also termed functional immaturity of the colon, is a transient disorder of the newborn colon characterized by delayed passage (>24-48 h) of meconium and intestinal dilatation . Currently, meconium plug syndrome is understood as a transient functional disorder of the colon resulting from immaturity of the myenteric plexus nerve cells or their hormonal receptors.


Contrast enema demonstrates the retained meconium as a filling defect or plug that produces a double-contrast effect.

Usually, the colon is normal or may be mildly enlarged and filled with meconium. A change in the colon's diameter at the splenic flexure may be seen and is indistinguishable from that observed in Hirschsprung disease, although in the latter disorder the transition zone usually is in the rectosigmoid.
Meconium plug syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion. Contrast enema usually eliminates congenital small bowel obstruction and rare colon abnormalities such as atresia or duplication. The primary differential consideration is Hirschsprung disease, which is diagnosed eventually in approximately 10-30% of patients with apparent meconium plug syndrome

Neonatal small left colon syndrome —

Colonic obstruction with a characteristic caliber reduction in the sigmoid and descending colon unrelated to meconium inspissation or aganglionosis. This condition has a frequent association with maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and seldom requires surgical intervention.
A contrast enema demonstrated a narrowed descending and sigmoid colon, with a caliber transition at the splenic flexure.",C

Least useful in Treatment of local anesthetic induced convulsions/seizures?,Phenytoin sodium,Thiopentone sodium,Midazolam,Propofol,"Ans. a (Phenytoin sodium) (Ref. Katzung pharma, 9th/Chapter 26; Anaesthesia by Ajay Yadav 3rd/pg. 111)When local anesthetic-induced seizures occur, hypoxia, hypercarbia and acidosis develop rapidly. ABC (Airway, Breathing and Circulation) is the mainstay of treatment. Administration of O2 by mask, or ventilation support by bag and mask, is often all that is necessary to treat seizures. If seizures interfere with ventilation, benzodiazepines, small dose propofol or thiopental can be used. The use of succinylcholine effectively facilitates ventilation and, by abolishing muscular activity, decreases the severity of acidosis. However neuronal seizure activity is not inhibited and therefore, cerebral metabolism and oxygen requirements remain increased.LOCALANAESTHETICSMechanism of action of local anesthetics# Diffusion of the unionized (base) form across the nerve sheath and membrane# Re-equilibration between the base and cationic forms in the axoplasm# Binding of the cation to a receptor site inside of the Na+ channel, resulting in its blockade and consequent inhibition of Na+ conductance.Order of blockade: small fibre > large fibres; myelinated fibres > unmyelinated fibres.

"A 24 year old female is with suspected appendicitis is taken up for surgery. However during surgery the appendix appears to be normal. Instead the Ileum is inflamed, enlarged with multiple adhesion. Surrouding fat is also involved. Possible diagnosis is -",Ileocaecal tuberculosis,Diverticulosis,Intussusception,Carcinoid,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ileocaecal tuberculosis o Tuberculosis of the small intestine occurs in two forms :# Primary infection is usually due to bovine strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis and results from ingesting infected milk. In India the human strain may also cause such primary tuberculosis. This produces hyperplastic tuberculosis# Secondary infection occurs due to swallowing of tubercle bacilli in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis. This leads to ulcerative tuberculosis, the more common form of intestinal tuberculosis.A) Hyperplastic tuberculosiso Caused by ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by pts with a high resistance to the organism. The infection established itself in lymphoid follicles and the resulting chronic inflammation causes thickening of the intestinal wall and narrowing of the lumen. There is early involvement of the regional lymph nodes which may caseate.o Untreated sooner or later subacute intestinal obstruction will supervene often together with the impaction of an enterolith in the narrowed lumeno It usually occurs in the ileocecal region.Clinical features# Attacks of acute abdominal pain with intermittent diarrhoea.# Sometimes the presenting picture is of a mass in the rt iliac fossa in a pt with vague ill health.# Features of blind loop syndrome may develop due to stasis, distention and chronic infection in the segment of ileum proximal to obstruction.Barium meal radiography will reveal# Persistent narrowing of the affected segment i.e. the terminal ileum and the caecum.# The caecum is pulled up * and may become subhepatic.# As the caecum is pulled up the ileo-caecal angle is widened. Normal ileo-caecal angle is 900. In ileocaecal tuberculosis this angle may increase upto 1500.*Treatment: This depends on the presence or absence of obstructive symptoms.# ATT is given in both cases.# If obstruction is present ileocaecal resection is best method of t/t (along with ATT)B) Ulcerative tuberculosiso It is usually secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis and results from swallowing tubercle bacilli in the sputum (cf. Hyperplastic tuberculosis is usually primary there is no pulmonary tuberculosis)o Usually longer parts of the terminal ileum is involved.o There are multiple ulcers in the terminal ileum lying transversely o Pt presents with diarrhoea and wt losso Barium meal shows absence of filling of the lower ileum, caecum and most of the ascending colon as a result of narrowing and hypermotility of the ulcerated segment.Treatment# A course of A TT is adequate# Operation is rarely required, in rare events of perforation or intestinal obstruction.",A

Fulminant hepatic failure can be caused by,Halothane,Isoflurane,Nitrous oxide,Phenobarbitone,"The first modern halogenated volatile anesthetic, halothane, was introduced in 1955. Clinical exposure to halothane is associated with two distinct types of hepatic injury. Subclinical hepatotoxicity occurs in 20% of adults who receive halothane. It is characterized by mild postoperative elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspaate aminotransferase, but is reversible and innocuous. Anaerobic halothane reduction by CYP2A6 to a 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethyl radical is thought to mediate this mild hepatic injury. The fulminant form of hepatotoxicity, commonly known as halothane hepatitis, is characterized by elevated alanine aminotransferase, aspaate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels, massive hepatic necrosis following the administration of halothane. Halothane hepatitis is rare (1 in 5000 to 35,000 administrations in adults), but is fatal in 50% to 75% of these cases. Because of the potential for fatal hepatitis, halothane is no longer used in adult patients in many countries. Halothane hepatitis is caused by a hypersensitivity reaction associated with the oxidative metabolism of halothane. The highly reactive trifluoroacetyl chloride metabolite of halothane oxidation can react with nearby liver proteins. In most patients who developed hepatic necrosis after halothane anesthesia, antibodies against TFA-modified proteins were detected, suggesting that the hepatic damage is linked to an immune response against the modified protein, which acts as a neoantigen. Accordingly, patients who develop halothane hepatitis often have a history of prior exposures to halothane or other volatile anesthetics, together with symptoms suggestive of immune reactivity, such as fever, rash, ahralgia, and eosinophilia. A current hypothesis is that TFA-protein adducts induce a cytotoxic T cell reaction in sensitized individuals, which leads to liver damage. However, the immune responses observed in halothane hepatitis might not mediate liver injury. Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",A

Sistrunk operation is used for treatment of -,Pharyngeal pouch,Cystic hygroma,Thyroglossal duct cyst,Sternocleidomastoid tumor,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Thyroglossal duct cyst Thyroglossal duct cysts* The thyroid gland descends early in fetal life from the base of the tongue towards its position in the lower neck with the isthmus lying over the second and third tracheal rings.* At the time of its descent, the hyoid bone has not been formed and the track of the descent of the thyroid gland is variable, passing in front, through or behind the eventual position of the hyoid body.* Thyroglossal duct cysts represent a persistence of this track and may therefore be found anywhere in or adjacent to the midline from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus.* The cysts almost always arise in the midline but, when they are adjacent to the thyroid cartilage, they may lie slightly to one side of the midline. Classically, the cyst moves upwards on swallowing and with tongue protrusion.* Treatment must include excision of the whole thyroglossal tract, which involves removal of the body of the hyoid bone and the suprahyoid tract through the tongue base to the vallecula at the site of the primitive foramen caecum, together with a core of tissue on either side. This operation is known as Sistrunk's operation and prevents recurrence, most notably from small side branches of the thyroglossal tract.",C

This minimally invasive procedure requires pneumoperitoneum for adequate visualization and operative ma-nipulation.Carbon dioxide is the most commonly used gas for creating pneumoperitoneum, because of its high diffusibility and rapid rate of absorption and excretion.Certain specific surgeries that in the past required long hospitalization and were associated with severe post- operative pain and frequent compli-cations are today performed laparoscopically. This minimally invasive technique potentially offers reduced operative time and morbidity, decreased hospital stay and earlier return to normal activities, less pain and less post-operative ileus compared with the traditional open surgical procedures.Because the postoperative benefits are superior to open surgical pro-cedures, laparoscopy is today also used in many high risk patients in ad-vanced age and pre-existent cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases.However, insufflations of carbon dioxide into the peritoneum may lead to alteration in the acid-base balance, cardiovascular and pulmonary physiology. Although these changes may be well tolerated in healthy pa-tients, in high risk patients they may increase the rate of perioperative complications.",A

"Athlete is sitting on the edge of table with knees flexed at 90 degree. When he extends his knee fully, what will happen to the tibial tuberosity in relation to patella",No change,Movement of TT towards medial border of patella,Movement of TT towards lateral border of patella,Movement of TT towards centre of patella,"C i.e. Movement of TT towards lateral border of patella Tibial tuberosity is in line with midline of patellaQ at 90deg of knee flexion. However, when the knee is extended fully the TT moves laterally towards the lateral border of patella because of screw home mechanism (i.e. lateral rotation of tibia in non weight bearing or medial rotation of femur in weight bearing individuals). The Q. (quadriceps or patello-femoral) angle provides a concomitant lateral (valgus) force on patella which tends to make the patella track laterally. These last few degree of motion lock the knee in extension & referred to as screw home mechanism. With the knee fully extended, an individual can stand for a long time with out using muscles. The knee must be unlocked by the femur rotating laterally on tibia (by popliteus) for knee flexion to occur. Law of valgus: Because the femur normally runs slightly obliquely inwards, the Q (quadriceps) angle (i.e. angle that patellar tendon makes relative to shaft of femur) is formed, with its concomitant tendency to pull the patella laterally. This predisposition for lateral motion of patella is referred to as the law of valgus. Since the patella is relatively free to move upon the femur when the knee is extended. When the quadriceps femoris muscle contracts it will try to establish a straight line between its proximal attachment onto the femur & pelvis and its distal attachment onto the tibial tuberosity. Thus the Q angle provides an indication of the lateral force (vector) applied to the patella, which tends to make the patella track laterallyQ in order to establish a straight line relationship between the proximal & distal attachment of quadriceps femoris muscle group during extension. Q (patello-femoral or quadriceps) angle is the angle between the quadriceps muscle, primarily the rectus femoris muscle & the patellar tendon. It is determined by drawing a line from ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) to the midpoint of patella and from tibial tuberosity to mid point of patella. Although the rectus femoris attaches to AIIS (anterior inferior iliac spine), the ASIS lies just above AIIS and is easier to palpate. Normally it is 13-18deg in knee extension.",C

Ultrasound is often the first imaging investigation but CT is the best imaging investigation. Serum amylase is the most widely used laboratory test because of its simplicity. It lacks the specificity to pancreas and may be raised in a multitude of condition causing high false positive reactions. Moreover there can be cases of acute pancreatitis with normal serum amylase levels. Serum amylase level usually return to normal after 48 to 72 hrs of acute episode, fuher limiting its usefulness. Serum Lipase is now the single best enzyme to measure for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Its level remains elevated for much longer duration of time (7 to 14 days) Other specific serum markers for acute pancreatitis are: - pancreatic isoamylase - trypsinogen One more fact about serum amylase is woh mentioning - There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and severity of pancreatitis, in fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase as compared with that in a more severe form of the disease. Surgical treatment is needed rarely in acute pancreatitis. The disease is self limited in -85% to 90% of patients and subsides within 3-7 days.

Reverse trendelenburg position improves endoscopic field of view and reduces intraoperative blood loss compared to other positions. It also helps to achieve an effective level of epidural or spinal anesthesia, prevent pulmonary aspiration due to vomiting. In lithotomy position, the patient lies on his back, the legs are flexed in the hip (90 degrees) and abducted (30 degrees) in the hip. The knees are bent 70 to 90 degrees, the lower legs are suppoed on padded leg shells.This position of the patient is needed for examinations or operations in urology, gynecology or proctology. The lithotomy position is also used as a common position for childbih.",C

Investigation of choice for hydatid disease is: September 2009,CT scan,Elisa,Biopsy,USG,"Ans. D: USG Laboratory Studies The results of routine laboratory blood work are nonspecific. Liver involvement may be reflected in an elevated bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase level. Leukocytosis may suggest infection of the cyst. Eosinophilia is present in 25% of all persons who are infected, while hypogammaglobinemia is present in 30%. Almost every serodiagnostic technique has been evaluated for echinococcosis, with variable results. - The indirect hemagglutination test and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have a sensitivity of 80% overall (90% in hepatic echinococcosis, 40% in pulmonary echinococcosis) and are the initial screening tests of choice. - Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis demonstrate antibodies to antigen 5 and provide specific confirmation of reactivity. - The ELISA test is useful in follow-up to detect recurrence. Imaging Studies - Plain films Findings from plain films of the chest, abdomen, or any other involved site are, at best, nonspecific and mostly nonrevealing. A thin rim of calcification delineating a cyst is suggestive of an echinococcal cyst. - Ultrasound Ultrasonography helps in the diagnosis of hydatid cysts when the daughter cysts and hydatid sand are demonstrated. The accuracy of ultrasound evaluations remains operator-dependent. CT scan CT scan has an accuracy of 98% and the sensitivity to demonstrate the daughter cysts. It is the best test for the differentiation of hydatid from amebic and pyogenic cysts in the liver. - MRI: Images show the cysts adequately, but MRI offers no real advantage over CT scan. Other Tests - Casoni test Historically, an intradermal skin test (Casoni test) was used and had a sensitivity of 70%. It is now largely abandoned because of its low sensitivity, low accuracy, and potential for severe local allergic reaction.",D

Gold standard investigation for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumor is:,MRI,MIBG,USG,PET CT,"Ans is d i.e. PET CT Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) comprise a group of smooth muscle mesenchymal alimentary tract tumours of variable malignancy. The management of malignant GISTs has been revolutionised by the development of Imatinib (ST-571) which is, uniquely, a specific, highly effective, chemotherapeutic agent that targets a specific abnormal intracellular signalling molecule. The effective management of patients with these tumours requires regular imaging assessment for which CT has conventionally been the method of choice. Whilst CT remains most valuable in the initial diagnosis and staging of GISTs, it is now clear that PET imaging, preferably combined with CT, will become the gold standard method for assessment of response by viue of its unique dynamic functional characteristic which, when combined with CT, provides a more accurate assessment and prediction of the quality of response.",D

One of the following is characterised by RIM sign ?,Hydronephrosis (Gross),Hypernephroma,Chronic pyelonephritis,Polycystic kidney,"Ans is 'a' ie Hydronephrosis (Gross) We will write down, what we have got so far about the 'rim sign'. The rim sign is seen in cases of ureteral calculi. [The 'rim sign,' originally repoed by Smith in 1995, is described as a rim, ring, or halo of soft tissue visible on CT scans that completely surrounds ureteral stones. The effect is enhanced by the local inflammation a stone produces in the ureteral wall, with subsequent edema at the site of the calculus. The rim sign is generally missing or incomplete with phleboliths. While not absolutely definitive, the rim sign is strong evidence that the calcific density it surrounds is a stone and not a phlebolith. In several studies, more than 75% of all ureteral stones demonstrated a rim sign, while only 2-8% of phleboliths demonstrated it. The rim sign is more likely to be present in small or medium stones up to 5 mm in diameter. Larger stones, bigger 6 mm, tend to lose the rim sign, presumably from stretching and thinning of the ureteral wall around a relatively large calculus. (Reff*",A
"A couple presents with infeility. On investigating, the husband is found to have azoosermia on semen analysis. Vas was not palpable on perrectal examination. Semen had low volume, high viscosity and fructose was present. What will you do next ?",CFTR gene mutation analysis,Karyotype,PSA,Trans rectal ultrasound,"Next line of management is CFTR gene mutation analysis MALE FACTOR INFEILITY For couples of unknown feility status, approximately 15% are unable to achieve a pregnancy within 1 year. The inability to conceive may be due to female factor infeility, male factor infeility or a combination of these two factors and approximately 20% of cases of infeility are caused entirely by the male factor. Aetiology The two main causes of male factor infeility are either primary testicular causes or obstruction at the level of either the vas or the epididymis. A few cases reflect endocrinological abnormalities such as hypogonadism or hyperprolactinaemia. Testicular causes include chromosomal problems (e.g. Klinefelter's syndrome), microdeletions of the Y chromosome, cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, drugs and radiation damage. In most cases however, the cause is unclear. In these cases, there may be reduced numbers of sperm in the ejaculate (oligozoospermia) or a complete absence of sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia). Obstructive causes include congenital absence of the vasa (often in association with cystic fibrosis), surgical damage to the vasa and epididymitis. Azoospermia is inevitable in these cases. Assessment and investigation Given the interplay between male and female factors, the man should not be investigated in isolation from his female paner. A careful history is the mainstay of the assessment with a careful search for aetiological factors. Physical examination is usually normal, but occasionally the testes may feel small (suggestive of a testicular cause), the vasa may be absent, there may be evidence of endocrine abnormalities(gynaecomastia or abnormal hair distribution) or there may be a varicocoele. The relation of any varicocoele to the infeility is controversial and treatment is not usually indicated. The woman should be also be assessed. It is impoant to remember that female feility declines from the age of 35 years in a way that is not true of men. The age of the woman is therefore impoant and the regularity of menstruation should be confirmed either by temperature testing or by endocrinological testing. The assessment of the man includes semen analysis, which should be tested within 2 hours of the semen being produced. Two or three samples should be tested. The volume of the ejaculate, the numbers of sperm, their motility and the percentage of abnormal or damaged sperm are all predictive of male feility. An endocrine screen should be performed including serum testosterone, prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1511",A
Most common gallbladder carcinoma is?,Squamous cell carcinoma,Small cell carcinoma,Adenosquamous carcinoma,Adenocarcinoma,"ANSWER: (D) AdenocarcinomaREF: Schwartz 9th ed chapter 32 Between 80 and 90% of the gallbladder tumors are adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell, adenosquamous, oat cell, and other anaplastic lesions occur rarely. The histologic subtypes of gallbladder adenocarcinomas include papillary, nodular, and tubular. Less than 10% are of the papillary type, but these are associated with an overall better outcome, as they are most commonly diagnosed while localized to the gallbladder. Cancer of the gallbladder spreads through the lymphatics, with venous drainage, and with direct invasion into the liver parenchyma. Lymphatic flow from the gallbladder drains first to the cystic duct node (Calot's), then the pericholedochal and hilar nodes, and finally the peripancreatic, duodenal, periportal, celiac, and superior mesenteric artery nodes. The gallbladder veins drain directly into the adjacent liver, usually segments IV and V, where tumor invasion is common",D

The following is a marker of Paget's disease of the mammary gland,S-100,HMB 45,CEA,Neuron specific enolase,"Ans is 'c' ie CEA Paget's ds is a chronic eczematous disease on the skin of the nipple and the areola , with an associated intraductal carcinoma of the underlying mammary gland. Pathophysiology: The pathogenesis of mammary PD and the origin of Paget cells were once controversial. It is now widely accepted as an underlying intraductal carcinoma of the breast with retrograde extension into the overlying epidermis through mammary duct epithelium. Malignant epithelial (Paget) cells infiltrate and proliferate in the epidermis, causing thickening of the nipple and the areolar skin. Paget cells often express cell markers that mimic those of the underlying breast carcinoma, including glandular epithelial cell markers (ie, low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, or CAM 5.2). They also express tumor markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); Ca 15-3 (milk fat globule protein); some oncogenes (TP53, c-erb B-2); and other cell markers, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and gross cystic disease fluid protein (GCDFP-15) that are found in tumor cells of ductal carcinoma of the breast.",C

What is the most characteristic of congenital hyperophic pyloric stenosis -,Affects the first born female child,The pyloric tumour is best felt during feeding,The patient is commonly marasmic,Loss of appetite occurs early,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., The pyloric tumor is best felt during feeding Option (a) - HPS classically presents in a first born male child between 3 and 6 weeks of age. However, children outside this age range also are commonly seen, and the disease is not restricted to either males or first borne children. Option (d) - After vomitting the child has voracious appetite, that leads to a cycle of feeding and vomiting. Option (c) 'Greater awareness of pyloric stenosis has led to earlier identification of patients with fewer instances of chronic malnutrition and severe dehydration' -Nelson I7/e Option (b) - The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is usually made by palpation - of the typical olive shaped hard pyloric mass located in right upper quadrant. In healthy infants when palpation is difficult, feeding can help in the diagnosis. After feeding gastric peristalsis waves may be visible. After the infant vomits, the abdominal musculature is more relaxed and the mass is easier to palpate. Sedation can also be used to facilitate examination but is usually unnecessary.

Which of the following is the best way of preventing the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the postoperative period?,Early ambulation,Physiotherapy,Prophylactic heparin,Low dose aspirin,"Patients are at increased risk for developing venous thromboembolism after:

Major abdominal surgery
Major orthopaedic surgery
Has sustained major trauma
Has prolonged immobility (>3 days)

These patients need some form of prophylaxis. The prophylaxis can be mechanical or pharmacological.
Prophylaxis for DVT 
Mechanical Prophylaxis include : 
Early ambulation 

It is the simplest method of prophylaxis
It acts by activating the calf pump mechanism

Pneumatic compression devices

It is the most common method of prophylaxis
Pneumatic compresses prevents the stasis by periodically compressing the calves.

Pharmacological Prophylaxis include

Use of unfractionated heparin - Now being replaced by fractionated low molecular weight heparin
Use of fractionated low molecular - Better efficacy than unfractionated heparin
weight heparin - No laboratory monitoring is necessary

Comparison of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) with mechanical prophylaxis demonstrates superiority of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in reduction of the development of venous thromboembolic disease.  Prospective trials evaluating LMWH in head injured and trauma patients have also proven the safety of LMWH with no increase in intracranial bleeding or major bleeding at other sites. In addition, LMWH shows significant reduction in the development of venous thromboembolism compared to other methods.
In short, LMWH should be considered the optimal method of prophylaxis in moderate and high risk patients. Even the traditional reluctance to use heparin in high risk groups such as the multiply injured trauma patient and the injured patient must be reexamined, given the efficacy and safety profile of LMWH in multiple prospective trials.",C

"In a shock patient, good clinical indicator of perfusion status among the following is",Urine output,Level of consciousness,Mixed venous oxygen saturation,Central venous pressure,"Urine output is a good measure of organ perfusion and the best monitor of the adequacy of shock therapy. However, this is an hourly measure and does not give a minute-to-minute view of the shocked state. The level of consciousness is an impoant marker of cerebral perfusion, but brain perfusion is maintained until the very late stages of shock, and hence is a poor marker of adequacy of resuscitation.Currently, the only clinical indicators of perfusion of the gastrointestinal tract and muscular beds are the global measures of lactic acidosis (lactate and base deficit) and the mixed venous oxygen saturation. There is no 'normal' central venous pressure (CVP) for a shocked patient, and reliance cannot be placed on an individual pressure measurement to assess volume status.

Which statement regarding glaucoma is true?,"If recognized early, the optic neuropathy of glaucoma is reversible",Topical B-adrenergic antagonists have few if any side effect due to their systemic absorption,The initial symptom oh optic neuropathy due to glaucoma is loss of central vision,None of the above,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. When sufficient axinal loss occurs, peripheral vision declines. Loss of central vision occurs much later in the disease process. Retinopathy due to glaucoma is irreversible. Treatment is focused on lowering intraocular pressure. Reduction in intracecular pressure has been demonstrated to protect against fuher damage to the optic nerve. Primary open-angle is by far the most common type of glaucoma in the United States. Closed-angle glaucoma is more common among Asians. The Schijltz tonometer, due to the fact that it is inexpensive, is the most frequently used device to measure intraoccular pressure in the United States. It is used in both hospitals and outpatient clinics. b-Adrenergic antagonists are one of the more commonly used drugs and are initially staed as a topical agent. Unfounately, excess drug drains through the nasolacrimal duct into the nose and is absorbed into the systemic circulation. Therefore systemic side effects can occur and may be severe.

Alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are increased. CT scan demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas. Which of the following surgical methods is used most often to treat patients with small tumors of the head of the pancreas with no evidence of metastasis?",Billroth l procedure,Billroth ll procedure,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,Whipple procedure,"Whipple procedure, also known as a pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this surgical procedure, the duodenum, proximal pancreas, gallbladder, and sometimes, the distal stomach are resected. The remaining pancreas, biliary tree, and stomach are then reattached to the small intestine. The Whipple procedure is only performed in the relatively small percentage of patients who may have resectable disease. Tumors of the tail of the pancreas might, in theory, be more easily resected, but this area tends to not produce any signs or symptoms until late in the disease, after metastasis has occurred. Pancreatic cancers that are not resectable can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Immunotherapy using a vaccine based on the patient's own cancer cells is also being tried experimentally, and shows promise. An impoant thing to remember when treating these patients (and other poor prognosis patients) is that long-term survivors have occurred, and that even if death eventually intervenes, a survival of several years may be very much wohwhile to both the patient and his family (paicularly if young children are indirectly involved). The Billroth I and II procedures are used to treat gastric carcinomas and intractable peptic ulcers of the duodenum and stomach. While you could argue that the gastric resection pa of the Whipple procedure resembles a Billroth II operation, you should pick the Whipple procedure if both answers are available, because it is much more specific for pancreatic carcinoma. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is used to treat obesity by reducing the effective stomach volume.",D

A major concept in understanding burn shock is that massive fluid shift occurs even though total body water initially remains unchanged. The volume in each fluid compament changes. Intracellular & interstitial volume increases at the expense of intravascular volume due to increased vascular permeability. Multiple resuscitation formulas, employing various solutions and rate of administration are used. These formulae are used for initial management after burn. The response is monitored tthrough urine output a justments made acc or in For burned children, formulae have to be modified as a child with a comparable burn to that of an adult requires more resucitation fluid per kilogram.

Which of the following is a reasonable indication to attempt extubation?,Negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -15 cm H2O,PO2 of 60 mm Hg while breathing 30% inspired FiO2 with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cm H2O,Spontaneous respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute,A rapid shallow breathing index of 80,"There are multiple predictors that have been used to assess readiness for extubation. No single parameter is 100% predictive; attempted extubation should be based on correction of the underlying pathology, clinical status and hemodynamic stability, and a combination of the following parameters. The rapid shallow breathing index is the ratio of the respiratory rate to tidal volume. There is evidence to suggest that an index between 60 and 105 predicts successful extubation. The negative inspiratory force should be at least greater than -20 cm H2O. The patient should be weaned to 5 cm H2O PEEP before attempting extubation. The minute ventilation, which is the product of the tidal volume and respiratory rate, should be less than 10 L/min. The spontaneous respiratory rate should also be below 20 breaths per minute",D

Which of the following is/are TRUE about hemangioma of bone? 1. Mostly asymptomatic 2. Peak incidence in 5th decade 3. Constitute 10-20% of total bone tumor 4. Overgrowth of bone occurs 5. Hematogenous spread,"1,2 true & 3,4,5 false","1,2,4,5 true & 3 false","3,5 false & 1,2,4 true","1,5 true & 2,3,4 false","Bone hemangiomas are benign, malformed vascular lesion, overall constituting less than 1% of all primary bone neoplasm. They occur most frequently in the veebral column (30-50%) and skull (20%), whereas involvement of other sites (including the long bones, sho tubular bones, and ribs) is extremely rare. Peak incidence occur in the 50s. Hemangiomas are largely asymptomatic, and thus most are never discovered, leading some to describe these lesions as 'rare'. Veebral hemangiomas can cause neurological symptoms if they extend into the epidural space. Appearance on X-ray is depend on the location. The lesions are often poorly defined,appearing as a somewhat localized area of abundant, dilated vessels, some of which may on the surface of the bone, within the coex of the bone, or extend into the medullary cavity. However, the radiographic hallmark of bone hemangiomas is a prominent trabecular pattern. Despite the added diagnostic information available with CT scanning and MRI, the angiomatous nature of many extraspinal lesions can be confirmed only by histologic analysis. On gross examination, hemangiomas look like a disorganised collection of veins or vascular spaces. Grossly there are cystic, dark red cavities. The lytic areas are sharply defined and there is trabecular thickening. Under the microscope, there are four type of hemangiomas : capillary, cavernous, aeriovenous, and venous. Capillary and cavernous lesions are most common in bone. Treatment of hemangiomas is unnecessary unless the lesion is symptomatic. Hemangiomas: Most bonafide hemangiomas in bone are solitary lesions. Comprises less than 1.5 % of the total series. Female preponderance in a ratio of 3 : 2. Hemangiomas are usually found in adults. Many of the hemangiomas are asymptomatic. Hemangiomas that expands the bone and produce new bone may cause notable swelling. Local pain is sometimes a feature. There may be fracture, including compression fracture of veebra, Rarely, spinal cord compression may occur. Hemangiomas in veebrae characteristically cause polka-dot appearance on computed tomograms. Hemangiomas usually respond well to conservative procedures. Radiation may be required for lesions that ar in inaccessible sites. Massive hemangiomas, especially with involvement of soft tissues, may require amputation.

Anaesthetic agent that predisposes to maximum arrhhmias,Isoflurance,Enflurane,Halothane,Ether,"Halothane-catecholamine sensitization also promotes abnormal automaticity of dominant and latent atrial pacemakers. These effects may produce premature ventricular contractions and arrhythmias originating from the His bundle. Intact sinoatrial node function reduces the incidence of epinephrine induced ventricular escape during halothane anesthesia and is protective against His bundle arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, other volatile anesthetics sensitize the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effects of epinephrine. Sensitization is the interaction between volatile anesthetics and catecholamines that leads to reductions in the threshold for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Halothane and, to a lesser extent, isoflurane may be arrhythmogenic in Purkinje fibers in experimental myocardial infarction by facilitating reentrant activity or increasing temporal dispersion of the refractory period recovery.

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreas?,Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Microcystic adenoma Mucinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (approx 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mutinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA ( Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference from IPMN where tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",A

"About inguinal hernia surgery all of the following are true, except:",Hernia in children is treated with herniotomy,Absorbable mesh should not be used for surgery,Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic,Surgery can be done using laparoscopy,"Surgery can be done even if the patient is asymptomatic.
Non-absorbable mesh is used for hernia surgery.
Hernia in children can be treated with herniotomy only. Inguinal floor reconstruction can be needed in children with large hernias.
Coming to option 'c' i.e. 'Surgery should not be done unless patient becomes symptomatic'
Surgery can be done even in asymptomatic patients. Let's see this in a little detail as future questions can be asked with little twists in the statement.
The decision to repair an asymptomatic hernia or go for 'watchful waiting' has been a matter of many research studies.
Surgery Vs Watchful waiting:

It's agreed that the definitive treatment of all hernias, regardless of their origin or type, is surgical repair. Outcomes are generally excellent with minimal short-term morbidity and rapid return to presurgical health. This is true even in elderly individuals, especially with the use of local anesthesia.
These surgical outcomes combined with limited outcome data in patients who do not undergo surgery have led to recommendations to offer surgery to most patients with a groin hernia, regardless of symptoms. The risks of delayed surgery are primarily related to the risk of incarceration and strangulation, which are the only true medical indications for repair of hernias. However, it is not possible to identify with any degree of reliability which hernias are likely to incarcerate or strangulate versus those that will remain uncomplicated.
The other school of thought favoring Watchful waiting say that: While surgery is clearly indicated for most patients with significant symptoms related to a hernia, it may be reasonable to delay surgery in patients with inguinal hernia who have minimal or no symptoms.
Various studies comparing 'watchful waiting' vs 'immediate surgery in asymptomatic patients' have found no difference in the rate of hernia accidents and pain scores between the surgery and watchful waiting groups, although patients who had immediate surgery responded that their general health had improved at one year, compared to a perception of health decline in the 'watchful waiting' group.
These findings suggest that a strategy of watchful waiting rather than referral for surgery can be considered in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia, as long as they are aware of the risk, albeit small, of hernia complications and understand the need for prompt medical attention should symptoms of these complications occur.
Although most authors agree that watchful waiting is a safe therapeutic option, some authors suggest elective surgery, rather than watchful waiting, for patients who are elderly, who have limited access to emergency care, or significant illness that would put them at greater risk for poor outcome after bowel strangulation.",C

In 2001, in response to the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. The standard requires that employees he provided: - Adequate protective equipment and clothing (gloves, face masks, aprons etc.); - Hepatitis B vaccine at no cost to the employee; - confidential medical evaluation and counseling after an incident (employees must be offered training, testing and post exposure prophylaxis at no cost) ; and - training on an annual basis on all aspects of bloodborne hepatitis, HIV and other bloodborne diseases (i.e., modes of transmission, effective preventive measures -- equipment, clothing and work practices, and the medical evaluation available after an exposure). Revisions to Blood Borne Pathogen standards as a result of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act: According to the revised standards the employers must keep a Sharps Injury Log for the recording of percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps.

Most common cause of ptosis ?,Myasthenia gravis,Paralysis of 3rd nerve,Idiopathic,Congenital,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Congenital Ptosis Ptosis is drooping of upper eyelid. Ptosis occurs when the muscles that raise the eyelid (levator palpebrae superiors and muller's nuscles) are not strong enough to do so properly. Etiology of Ptosis may be :? A) Congenital myogenic ptosis :- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis :- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i.e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis :- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic :- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic :- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e.g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma. Aponeurotic ptosis :- It is due to defect of the levator aponeurosis in the presence of normal functioning muscle, e.g. involutional (senile) ptosis, post-operative ptosis.",D

A man comes to emergency with stab injury to left flank. He has stable vitals. What would be the next step in management?,CECT,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage,Laprotomy,Laproscopy,"Ans. is 'a'. i.e. CECT The main decision in an abdominal injury is to decide whether an exploratory laparotomy is necessary or not. Physical examination though may help sometimes, has significant limitations and may be unreliable.The diagnostic approach to penetrating (Gunshot and Stab wounds) and blunt abdominal trauma differs substantially.Gunshot abdominal wounds: Chances of internal injury is very high in gunshot wounds thus little preoperative evaluation is required and laparotomy is mandatory.Stab wounds to abdomen:In contrast to GSWs, SWs are less likely to injure intra-abdominal organs.Patients with isolated penetrating abdominal wound if hypotensive, or in shock or showing peritoneal signs go for exploratory laparotomy.Management of stable patients is debatable and controversial. Various methods are used to determine whether laparotomy is necessary or not.* Anterior stab wound- In ant. stab wounds local wound exploration can be performed to determine if there is any penetration of the peritoneal cavity. If the tract terminates without entering the peritoneum, the injury can be managed as a deep laceration and laparotomy is not needed. Otherwise, penetration of the peritoneum is assumed, and significant injury must be excluded by further diagnostic evaluations. Options include diagnostic peritoneal lavage, laparoscopy, CT, FAST, and admission with observation.* Flank and back wounds- There is more debate over the management of stab wounds to the flank and back. These injuries are special because of the risks associated with retroperitoneal organ injury-colon, kidneys and ureter. Triple contrast CT (i.e. oral, IV, and rectal contrast) is advised to detect colon and retroperitoneal injuries and the need for laparotomy. Other methods like DPL, laparoscopy are also advised.* Blunt abdominal injury:Hemodynamically stable patients sustaining blunt trauma are adequately evaluated by abdominal ultrasound or CT (CT in selected cases to refine the diagnosis) unless other severe injuries take priority and the patient needs to go to the operating room before the objective abdominal evaluation. In such instances, DPL or focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST) is usually performed in the operating room to rule out intra-abdominal bleeding requiring immediate exploratory laparotomy. US has largely replaced DPL.Management of hemodynamically unstable pt: a hemodynamically unstable pt is evaluated by FAST and if intra-abdominal fluid detected, undergoes laparotomy.",A
Ormond's disease is -,Idiopathic lymphadenopathy,Retractile testis,Idiopathic retroperitonial fibrosis,Idiopathic mediastinitis,"• Uncommon inflammatory condition characterized by the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum
• The fibrosis is usually confined to the central and paravertebral spaces between the renal arteries and sacrum and tends to encase the aorta, IVC and ureters.
• The process usually begins at the level of the aortic bifurcation and spreads cephalad upto renal artery generally.
Etiology
• Around 70% cases are primary or idiopathic (Ormond’s disease)
Causes of Secondary (30%)Q Retroperitoneal Fibrosis
• Inflammatory conditions: CATH (Chronic pancreatitis, Actinomycosis, Tuberculosis, Histoplasmosis)
• Drugs: Methylsergide (Most important), methyldopa, hydralazine, entacapone, beta-blockers, bromocriptine, phenacetin, amphetamines (MAHE-BP)
• Malignancies: CA prostate, NHL, CA stomach, sarcoma and carcinoid tumor
• Autoimmune disorders: SLE, PAN and ankylosing spondylitis
• Radiation
Clinical Features
• More common in males of 40-60 years.
• Early symptoms are vague and non-specific (abdominal or flank pain, weight loss, malaise, and hypertension)
• Obstructive uropathy (dysuria, frequency, fever due to secondary infection of hydroneprotic kidney) is the earliest and MC specific symptom.
• Ureters are MC involved, MC site is lower third of ureter.
• Partial or complete obstruction occurs in 75% patients
Diagnosis: In absence of uremia, diagnosis is made by IVP.
• IVP or RGP:
−− Hydronephrosis with dilated tortuous upper ureter,
−− Medial pulling of ureters or pipestem ureters
−− Extrinsic ureteral compression
• CT scan is IOC for retroperitoneal fibrosis.
• MRI is IOC in cases of compromised renal function, because contrast cannot be given.
Treatment
• Primary, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis: Ureteral stenting and immunosuppression (TAPS: Tamoxifen, Azathioprine, Penicillamine, Steroids)
• Secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis: Midline transperitoneal ureterolysis with wrapping the ureter with omental flap or lateral retroperitoneal ureteral transposition.
TAPS: Tamoxifen, Azathioprine, Penicillamine, Steroids are used in primary retroperitoneal fibrosis.",C

All are true about ketamine except,Increases ICT,Decreases blood pressure,Increases intraocular pressure,Increases intragastric pressure,"Ketamine increases all the pressures. i.e intracranial pressure, intraocular pressure, blood pressure, intragastric pressure. With the rise in CBF and the generalized increase in sympathetic nervous system response, ICP increases after ketamine use. The increase in CMRO2 and CBF can be blocked by the use of thiopental or diazepam. The received dogma about ketamine is that it increases cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral blood flow, and intracranial pressure. These effects would seem to preclude its use in patients with space-occupying intracranial lesions such as occur with head trauma; however, recent publications offer convincing evidence that when combined with a benzodiazepine (or another agent acting on the same GABA receptor system) and controlled ventilation (in techniques that exclude nitrous oxide), ketamine is not associated with increased intracranial pressure. Ketamine increases aerial blood pressure, hea rate, and cardiac output, paicularly after rapid bolus injections. These indirect cardiovascular effects are due to the central stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine after release at nerve terminals. Accompanying these changes are increases in pulmonary aery pressure and myocardial work Ref: Miller's anesthesia 8th edition Ref: Morgan & Mikhail's clinical anesthesiology 6e",B

Grade I benign prostate with outflow obstruction is best treated with -,Retropubic prostatectomy,Transurethral resection,Transvesical prostatectomy,Androgen therapy,"• MC indication for surgery is symptoms interfering with quality of life (bothersome symptoms and symptoms of BOO).
• TURP (Gold standard) :
−− Cystoscopic removal of strips of prostatic tissue using diathermy loop. Two techniques; NESBIT technique (preferred maver mayer technique)
−− Best irrigant fluid is 1.5% glycine (Electrolyte solutions like NaCl are not compatible with electrocautery, so not used).
−− Glycine is composed of glycolic acid and ammonium, which can cause CNS (visual) toxicity.
TURIS: TUR in saline using bipolar cautery
• Verumontanum is the single most important anatomical landmark in TURP.
• Verumontanum lies immediately proximal to external sphincter and serve as the distal landmark for prostate resection to prevent injury to the external sphincter.
• Verumontanum: Distal landmark for prostate resection.
• Verumontanum: Landmark for proximal limit of external sphincter.
−− Risks of TURP: Retrograde ejaculation (75%)Q, impotence (5–10%) and incontinence (< 1%).
−− Complications: Bleeding, urethral stricture or bladder neck contracture, perforation of the prostate capsule with extravasation, and if severe, TUR syndrome.
TUR syndrome (Dilutional hyponatremia or water intoxication)
• TUR syndrome (Dilutional hyponatremia or water intoxication) resulting from a hypervolemic, hyponatremic state due to absorption of the hypotonic irrigating solution.
• Clinical Features: Nausea, vomiting, confusion, hypertension, bradycardia, and visual disturbances.
• The risk increases with resection times > 90 minutes or gland size > 75 gm.
• Treatment includes diuresis (furosemide) and in severe cases, hypertonic saline (3%) administration.
Late Complications of TURP
• Bladder neck stenosis (4%) > Urethral stricture (3.6%)
• Bladder neck stenosis is seen more often with small (< 30 gm) fibrotic prostates.
• Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP):
−− For posterior commissure hyperplasia (elevated bladder neck), involves two incisions using the Collins knife at the 5- and 7-o’clock positions.
−− The incisions are started just distal to the ureteral orifices and are extended outward to the verumontanum.
• TUIP lowers the incidence of bladder neck contracture when compared to TURP, so TUIP should be strongly considered in patients with smaller gland in place of TURP.
• TUIP is used for smaller (20 gm) prostate, young patients.
• Decreased incidence of retrograde ejaculation as compared to TURP.
• Open simple prostatectomy: Glands > 75 gm, concomitant bladder diverticulum or a bladder stone or if dorsal lithotomy positioning is not possible.
−− Suprapubic prostatectomy: Performed transvesically (Frayer’s) and operation of choice in dealing with concomitant bladder pathology (Bladder stones or diverticulum).
−− Retropubic prostatectomy (Millin’s): Transverse incision is made in surgical capsule of prostate and enucleation is done.
−− Perineal prostatectomy (Youngs): Abandoned now
• Carcinoma prostate originates in peripheral zone of prostate, so prostatectomy for BPH confers no protection for subsequent cancer.",B

The treatment plan should be-",Enucleation,Enucleation with radiotherapy,Whipple's operation,Administration of streptozotocin,"Ans is 'a' i.e. Enucleation 'Enucleation is usually sufficient to remove the entire tumor as these are typically benign lesions. More extensive resections are required for complete excision of malignant insulinomas, which are typically much larger (approximately 6 cm), and in patients with MEN-I or multifocal disease. These patients may require subtotal pancreatectomy, with enucleation of lesions in the head of the pancreas or pancreaticoduodenectomy with local resections of tumors in the body or tail. Tumor debulking may be useful even if all disease is not removed since some residual disease may not be functional.'-Maingot's 11/e chapter 42 Demonstration of inappropriately elevated levels of plasma insulin and fasting hypoglycaemia suggest the diagnosis of insulinoma. Since most insulinomas are benign and in this patient the insulinoma is well defined, quite small in size, an enucleation would be sufficient.

Which of the following statements is true for Nigro's regimen:,It is a regimen for anal canal neoplasm,It incorporates chemotherapy with radiation as an alternative to surgery,Has the advantage of preserving continence,All of the above,"Nigro regimen refers to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for primary treatment of malignant tumors of the anal canal.
In the 1970s, Nigro pioneered preoperative combination chemo radiation therapy to convert unrespectable cases to respective cases.
There was no surgical pathological evidence of tumor found in three out of three patients treated with this approach in an early report.
This led to the concept of definitive radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Prior to this, the standard definitive treatment for carcinoma of the anal canal was abdominal-perineal resection, which necessitated a permanent colostomy. The organ preservation concept following the discovery of a high complete response rate from combined chemoradiation saves a large number of patients from undergoing abdominal-perineal resection and colostomy.",D
Upper Lid Retractors include,Muller muscle and superior rectus,Levator palpabrae superioris and superior oblique,Superior oblique and superior rectus,Levator palpabrae superioris & muller muscle,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Levator palpabrae superioris & muller muscle The levator palpebrae superioris is the impoant upper eye lid retractor. Injury or weakness to this muscle leads to ptosis. This muscle is supplied by occulomotor (3') nerve. Deep pa of the elevator muscle is the Muller's muscle, which is sympathetically innvervated. In hypehyroidism, sensitization of the Muller muscle leads to upper eyelid retraction and pseudoproptosis. On the other hand, in Horner's syndrome loss of this muscle action leads to ptosis. The capsulopalpebral fascia assists in lower eyelid retraction and coordinates with eyeball movement. It arises as an extension of the inferior rectus and inses into the lower edge of the lower tarsus and the adjacent orbital septum.",D

Which of the following diseases is appropriately treated with combined heart-lung transplantation?,Primary pulmonary hypertension,Cystic fibrosis,End-stage emphysema,Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with long-standing secondary pulmonary hypertension,"Many causes of end-stage lung disease have been appropriately treated with lung transplantation. Whether one lung or both lungs are replaced at the time of transplantation depends on recipient factors. Patients with restrictive processes like primary pulmonary fibrosis do well with a single lung transplant. For patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, unloading of the right ventricle with single lung transplantation has been adequate and replacement of both lungs has not been necessary in most cases. Cystic fibrosis patients do well after lung transplantation but double lung transplant is frequently necessary because of chronic infections. Secondary pulmonary hypertension is due to left ventricular failure with concomitant increases in pulmonary pressures secondary to increases in left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Reactive secondary pulmonary hypertension is best treated with heart transplantation.

Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic disease characterized by ? - Dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) - Dry mouth (xerostomia) It results from immunologically mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The characteristic decrease in tears and saliva is the result of lymphocytic infiltration and .fibrosis of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The infiltrates are predominantly activated CD4+ helper T cells. There has been some association of Hepatitic C infection with .sjogren's syndrome. Sjogrens syndrome is associated with antibodies directed against two ribonucleoprotein antigens SS-A (Ro) and SS-B (La). These antibodies are seen in upto 90% of the patients. Sjogrens syndrome can occur in two forms:- Primary form (isolated disorder) also known as Sicca syndrome. Secondary form (associated with other connective tissue disease). Connective tissue disorders associated with Sjogren's syndrome - Rheumatoid ahritis - SLE - Polymyositis - Sclerodenna - Vasculitis - Mixed connective tissue disease - Thyroiditis Clinical features Sjogrens syndrome occurs most commonly in older women typically between ages 50-60.

All of the following are false for Gall Bladder carcinoma except: March 2005,Carries a good prognosis,Gallstones may be a predisposing factor,Commonly squamous cell carcinoma,Jaundice is rare,"Ans. B: Gallstones may be a predisposing factor Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder is an uncommon, aggressive malignancy that affects women more frequently than men. Older age groups are most often affected, and coexisting gallstones are present in the vast majority of cases. The symptoms at presentation are vague and are most often related to adjacent organ invasion. Imaging studies may reveal a mass replacing the normal gallbladder, diffuse or focal thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a polypoid mass within the gallbladder lumen. Adjacent organ invasion, most commonly involving the liver, is typically present at diagnosis, as is biliary obstruction. Peripoal and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, hematogenous metastases, and peritoneal metastases may also be seen. The vast majority of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Because most patients present with advanced disease, the prognosis is poor. The radiologic differential diagnosis includes the more frequently encountered inflammatory conditions of the gallbladder, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, other hepatobiliary malignancies, and metastatic disease. The prevalence of lymphatic spread is high in gallbladder carcinoma. Lymphatic metastases progress from the gallbladder fossa through the hepatoduodenal ligament to nodal stations near the head of the pancreas. Three pathways of lymphatic drainage have been suggested: the cholecystoretropancreatic pathway, the cholecystoceliac pathway, and the cholecystomesenteric pathway. The cystic and pericholedochal lymph nodes are the most commonly involved at surgery and are a critical pathway to involvement of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and para-aoic lymph nodes.",B

Which is true about Klebsiella infections?,Most clinical isolates are obtained from the respiratory tract.,"Predisposing factors for Klebsiella pneumonia include alcoholism, diabetes mellitus",Klebsiella is closely related to Pseudomonas.,Detecting Klebsiella growth from a sputum culture obtained from an intubated patient mandates treat ment with an aminoglycoside or a third-generation cephalosporin.,"Predisposing factors for Klebsiella .............. Klebsiella and the related Serratia and Enterobacter are the most impoant enteric organisms other than E. coli to infect humans. Although respiratory disease is impoant (Klebsiella accounts for 1 % or less of community-acquired pneumonia), most clinical isolates now come from the urinary tract. All three genera are impoant pulmonary nosocomial pathogens.

Which of the following is not true about Myositis ossificans?,Associated with muscle tendon rupture,Inflammation around the ruptured muscle deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals with,Common in supracondylar fracture,Ossification of musculo-periosteal haematoma,"A i.e. Associated with muscle tendon rupture Myositis Ossificans (M.O) / Hetrotropic Ossification It is hetrotropic calcification and ossification in muscle tissue. The name is misnomer as there is no myositis (inflammation of muscle) and rarely ossification in the muscle (because the mineral phase differs from that in bone and no true bone matrix is formed). Etiology Injury (trauma) is an impoant factor and m.o. associated with trauma is better k/a post traumatic ossification it is seen in - Elbow > hipQ are commonly involved joints. - Trauma around elbowQ eg. fracture supracondylar humerus, dislocation or surgery. - Surgical trauma specially total hip replacement, - Massage to the elbow and vigorous passive stretchine to restore movements is aggravating factor. - Repeated micro trauma and overuse injuries. This type usually involve soleus muscle in ballerians. It occurs in muscles which are vulnerable to tear under heavy loads, such as quadriceps, adductors, brachicilisQ, biceps, and deltoid. M. 0. not associated with traumatic injury is termed as Pseudomalignant mysitis ossificans. And it is seen in Neurological disorders eg.G.B syndrome, AIDS encephalopathy, closed head injury, hypoxic brain injury & burns. Pathogenesis - Bone formation in muscle represents metaplasia of fibroblast at the site of injury. - Paial rupture & avulsion of muscle , ligament & joint capsule from bone usually cause periosteal elevation with the formation of subperiosteal hematoma and the wide exposure of cells with osteogenic potential. It inevitably lit subperiosteal ossification. - It has four microscopic zones (Ackerman Zonation) with centre most zone of undifferentiated, highly active (mitotic) cells and the outermost zone of well oriented hone encapsulated by fibrous tissue. - It must be distinguished from extaskeletal osteosarcoma. The latter usually occur in elderly, lacks zonationQ, and the most peripheral regions of osteosarcoma are most cellular & primitive, which is reverse of m.o. - It is distinguished from calcinosis, which is a metabolic disorder, often associated with collagen diseases - scleroderma & dermatomyositis. It is distinguished from ectopic calcification, which occurs in the capsule of joints, commonly the shoulder and is caused by inflammatory reaction around deposits of hydroxy - appetite crystals. And it is seen in CRF, hypo/hyper Clinical feature - Mostly asymptoma tic but may present with tenderness, palpable swelling, pain on range of motion, stiffness, and increased warmth. Imaging - Radiographs initially are normal, but by 10 days to 4 weeks fine calcification (dotted veil/ cotton wool appearance) is seen. - There is peripheral ossification and central lucencyQ of the mass. - The mass is usually seperated from underlying bone by at least a thin lineQ & lesion are usually located in the diaphysis. If the lesion is in continuity with the bone it is not myositis ossificans and the possibility of tumor or infection arises. - Calcification may first be noted on USG (focal hypoechoic mass located with in the muscle). - CT is better than x - ray - Biopsy before 4 weeks is usually in accurate. Treatment of Myositis Ossificans - Treatment is normally by 'watchful inactivity'. It must be emphasised that it is a passive stretching and not active exercise that is responsible for stimulating new growth formation. The worst treatment is to attack an injured and stiffish elbow with vigorous mucle stretching exercises; this is liable to precipitate or aggrevate the condition. So any physical therapy should be discontinuedQ. - Relative rest of the affected extremity is helpfulQ, with motion & activity gradually resumed as the acute phase subsides. In acute phase the treatment consist of limiting motion & icing the extremity while avoiding heat or massage - Low dose irradiation & indomethacin may prevent hetrotopic ossification, but the radiation should be avoided in children. - Surgical excision in toto is not done until a year or 2 after the acute phase of disease, at a time when radiograph reveal that the bone is fully mature and bone scan show either a return to normal uptake or decreasing activity in the lesion.",A

In the case of hyperthyroidism which is the most common nerve to be damaged?,Recurrent laryngeal nerve,Inferior laryngeal nerve,External branch of Superior laryngeal nerve,Internal branch of Superior laryngeal nerve,"The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates all intrinsic muscles of the larynx with exception of Cricothyroid muscle. Mechanisms of damage include complete or partial transection, traction, contusion and compromised blood supply. The consequence is true vocal fold paralysis.
The SLN has 2 divisions: internal and external. The internal branch provides sensory innervation to the larynx. It enters the larynx through the thyro-hyoid membrane and, therefore, should not be at risk during thyroidectomy. The external branch provides a motor function to the crico-thyroid muscle and is at risk during thyroidectomy.
This muscle is involved in elongation of the vocal folds. Trauma to the nerve results in an inability to lengthen a vocal fold and thus, an inability to create a high-pitched sound.",A

Which enzymes plays an impoant role in regulating blood glucose levels after feeding ?,Glucokinase,Glucose-6-phosphatase,Phosphofructokinase,Pyruvate kinase,"Glucokinase Glucokinase promotes uptake of large amounts of glucose by the liver. At normal glucose levels, the liver produces glucose from glycogen, but as glucose levels rise after feeding, the liver stops conveing glycogen and instead takes up glucose. Insulin also plays a role in regulating blood glucose levels. Pancreatic B cells produce insulin in response to hyperglycemia Glucose uptake by the B cells and phosphorylation by glucokinase stimulates secretion of insulin, which enhances glucose transpo into adipose tissues and muscle and thus lowers blood glucose levels.",A

It is a potent anaesthetic with poor analgesic and muscle relaxant propeies. Halothane causes direct depression of myocardial contractility by reducing intracellular Ca. It causes fall in BP and CO. Hea rate decreases due to vagal stimulation. It tends to sensitize the hea to arrhythmogenic action of adrenaline - contraindicated in pheochromocytoma. It causes greater depression of respiration and ventilation perfusion mismatch. It dilates the bronchi - inhalation agent of choice in asthmatics (intravaneous anaesthetic of choice in asthmatics is ketamine). It is a hepatotoxic drug and can also cause malignant hypehermia (Succinylcholine accentuate it). Recovery is smooth and reasonably quick. It causes postanaesthetic shivering and chills.

"A 12-year-old girl fractures her right radius and ulna in a motor accident. Her arm is placed in a cast extending over the elbow, which nearly eliminates movement of her forearm muscles. Which of the following will occur in her forearm muscles after several weeks in the cast?",Decreased capillarity,Decreased intracellular pO2,Decreased myoglobin oxygen saturation,Increased metabolic rate,"The primary function of blood vessels in skeletal muscles is to supply nutrients and remove metabolic waste products from the muscle tissues. Prolonged increases in metabolic rate lead to growth of the vasculature; decreases in metabolic rate lead to vascular rarefaction, i.e., loss of capillaries as well as other types of blood vessels. In other words, blood vessels grow where they are needed and regress when they are not needed. When a limb is immobilized in a cast, the muscles are inactive and their metabolic rate decreases. This decrease in metabolic rate leads to a decrease in capillarity in the skeletal muscles by mechanisms that are poorly understood. When the metabolic rate of immobilized skeletal muscle decreases, the oxygen consumption of the muscle decreases, which is likely to cause an initial increase in both myoglobin oxygen saturation and intracellular pO2.",A

A 30 year old woman with coarctation of aorta is admitted to the labour room for elective caesarean section. Which of the following is the anaesthesia technique of choice -,Spinal anaesthesia,Epidural anaesthesia,General anaesthesia,Local anaesthesia with nerve blocks,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., General anaesthesia In coarctation of Aorta, Aorta narrows anywhere along its course.The most common site for coarctation of Aorta isJust distal to origin of left subclavian arteryNear the insertion of ligamentum arteriosusSo, the common clinical presentation in coarctation of Aorta isHypotension, ischemia, distal to the obstruction, (circulation is usually diminished in abdominal organs and pulses are absent in lower extremities)Hypertension proximal to the site of obstruction (the B.P. in upper extremities and head and neck is increased)Effect of coarctation of Aorta on Pregnancy.Coarctation of Aorta may lead to compromise of placental circulation, because the placental circulation is derived from uterine artery, which is a branch of internal iliac artery (all the vessels originating distal to coarctation will have diminished perfusion)So, the fetal circulation is in a compromised state in coarctation of Aorta.Anaesthetic considerations that should be taken into account in case of coarctation of Aorta.In coarctation of Aorta, am decrease in cardiac output or cardiac return is deleterious to the fetus because the placental circulation is already compromised on account of coarctation.So any anaesthetic procedure or drug which causes hypotension should be avoided in these patients.Regional anaesthetic procedures such as spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia should be avoided in these patients because hypotension is the most common side effect of these procedures. The consequence of decreased venous return and decreased systemic vascular resistance as a result of these procedures would be hazardous to the patientGeneral anaesthesia is the preferred technique for performing ceasarean section in a patient with coarctation of Aorta as it has the advantage ofmore rapid inductionless hypotensionbetter airway and ventilation.Here are the quoted lines from an internet site further supporting our answerUncorrected coarctation is rare in pregnancy but when present tends to be exacerbated by normal physiologic changes with fixed aortic outflow obstruction and distal hypoperfusion. These patients are at increased risk of left ventricular failure, aortic dissection and rupture, endocarditis and cerebrovascular accident. Anesthetic goals should center on maintaining normal to slightly elevated SVR and heart rate and adequate preload. Regional anesthesia is relatively contraindicated. General anesthesia is the preferred technique for cesarean section with invasive hemodynamic monitoring with post ductal intraarterial catheter, CVP or PA catheters to guide fluid administration and to assess left ventricular function and use of ephedrine and dopamine as vasopressors of choice.",C

All of the following are seen in rickets except: September 2009,Frenkels line,Widening of epiphysis- diaphysis distance,Cupping and splaying of metaphysis,Rarefaction,"Ans. A: Frenkels Line In rickets, the skeletal effects are due to lack of calcification of osteoid. The first changes of rickets appear in rapidly growing distal ends of ulna & radius (wrist & knee are commonly involved due to more use). Rarefaction of provisional zone of calcification with widening of epiphysis- diaphysis distance is first to appear. The most obvious change are at 'metaphysis'- where rapid growth is occurring. First change to appear is a 'loss of normal zone of provisional calcification' adjacent to metaphysis. This begins as an indistinctness of the metaphyseal margin, progressing to a 'frayed' appearance with widening of the growth plate, due to lack of calcification of metaphyseal bone. Weight bearing & stress on uncalcified bone gives rise to 'splaying' Sr 'cupping' of metaphysis. A similar but less marked effect occurs in subperiosteal layer, which may cause lack of distinctness of coical margin. Eventually a generalized reduction in bone density is seen. In the epiphysis - there may be some haziness of coical margin. Thus all findings in Rickets occur due to failure of calcification & abnormal demineralization i. Skull changes - Pronounced calvarial demineralization - Basilar Invagination - Indistinct sutural margin - Delayed tooth eruption Premature craniostenosis - Craniotabes - Calvarial thickening following treatment ii.

Not true about mucinous cystadenoma pancreasaEUR',Microcystic adenoma,Lined by columnar epithelium,Pre malignant,Focus of ovarian stroma in it,"Microcystic adenoma [Ref. Robbin's Pathology 8/e p899; Schwaz 9/e p1232) Mutinous cystadenoma are macrocystic adenomas. Serous cystadenomas are microcystic adenomas. Cystic neoplasm of Pancreas Cystic neoplasms are of the following types: Common types? a. Serous cystadenomas (approx. 25-30% of all cystic neoplasms) b. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas (appro. 40-50% of all cystic neoplasms) Uncommon types? c. intraductal papillary mucinous tumor (approx.10% of all cystic neoplasms) d. solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (about 5-10% of all cystic neoplasms) Serous cystadenomas Serous cystadenomas are benign tumors without malignant potential. (Serous cystadenocarcinoma has been repoed very rarely (<1%) They have a spongy appearance, composed of multiple small cysts (microcystic). May contain central stellate fibrotic scar that may calcify (sunburst calcification) and it is highly specific and considered to be viually pathognomonic of serous cystadenoma. The cyst is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. They do not produce mucin These lesions thus contain thin serous fluid that does not stain positive for mucin and is low in CEA (<200 ng/mL). Common in females (F:M ratio is 2:1), usually in 7th decade of life. Common in the head/ uncinate process region.(50% in the head/uncinate process, and 50% in the neck, body, or tail) Serous cystadenomas do not have malignant potential, hence operated only when symptomatic. Mucionous cystic neoplasms (cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma) Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) encompass a spectrum ranging from benign but potentially malignant (i.e. cystadenomas) to carcinoma with a very aggressive behavior (i.e. cystadenocarcinomas); suggesting a gradual malignant transformation. MCNs are composed of large thick-walled, septate cysts (macrocystic) with no connection to the ductal system. (difference .from 1PMN there tumor is connected to the ductal system) The cysts are lined by tall columnar epithelium that fills the cyst with viscous mucin. MCNs are characterised by the presence of ovarian-type stroma which is a key pathologic feature distinguishing these lesions. This stroma is not only morphologically similar to that of the ovarian coex, but also expresses oestrogen and progesterone receptors that are detectable by immunohistochemistry Females are much more commonly affected than males (ratio 9:1), with mean age of 50 years. MCNs predominantly involve the body and tail of the pancreas. High CEA levels in the fluid (>200 ng/mL) may suggest malignant transformation. Resection is the treatment of choice for MCNs as the best way to distinguish the entirely benign form (mucinous cystadenoma) from its malignant counterpa (mucinous cystadenocarcinoma) is pathologic assessment after complete surgical removal. Because most MCNs are located in the body and tail of the pancreas, distal pancreatectomy is the most common treatment. IPMNs IPMNs are similar to MCNs in that they are cystic tumors that secrete mucin. The epithelial lining of the cyst is by tall columnar mucin producing cells that frequently forms papillary projections. Two major differences from MCNs is: - IPMNs extensively involve the main pancreatic ducts or the major side branches (or both); whereas MCNs do not connect to the pancreatic duct system. - IPMNs lack the 'ovarian' stroma seen in MCNs. Mucin production by cells leads to intraductal mucin accumulation and subsequent cystic dilation. This mucin production may be so great that mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater. On ERCP, mucin can be seen extruding from the ampulla of Vater, a so-called fish-eye lesion, that is viually diagnostic of IPMN Like MCNs IPMNs can range from benign (IPMN adenomas) to malignant (IPMN carcinomas) In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, IPMNs arise more frequently in men than in women, and they involve the head of the pancreas more often than the tail. Age group: seventh to eighth decade of life Surgery is the treatment of choice. Solid- Pseudopapillary tumor Solid-pseudopapillary tumors are rare and typically occur in young women These are well encapsulated, typically large lesions (>10 cm), and may occur anywhere within the pancreas.",A

When the head is bent away from its normal upright position, otoliths (small calcium carbonate crystals within the utricle and saccule are pulled downward by gravity. The crystals bend the stereocilia on the hair cells, causing the hair cells to depolarize. Depolarization of the hair cells stimulates the vestibular iterse fibers. Bending the head in different directions causes different otoliths to move. Therefore, the paicular group of vestibular nerve fibers that is stimulated signals the direction in which the head bends.",B

Lower blood gas coefficient of Xenon results in rapid induction and recovery.Xenon Anesthesia* Xenon was isolated by William Ramsay (Nobel prize for chemistry ) in 1904 and 1st used as anesthetic in 1950.* It is one of the noble gases (colourless, odurless, nonirritating, non-flammable, does not support combustion and non-explosive gas)* Heavier than air (4 times) and more viscous than N2 and N2O.* Being extremely unreactive. it does not interact with soda lime, but will diffuse readily through rubber.* Except for cost, xenon would be the most ideal inhaled anesthetic agent because Xenon (MAC of 71%) is more potent than nitrous oxide, can provide anesthesia in 30% O2 is very insoluble (blood-gas partition coefficienct of 0.14) and has positive medical and environmental effects.Characteristic Features of Xenon Anaesthesia* Minimal cardiovascular and hemodynamic side effects* Not known to be metabolized in liver or kidney* Not teratogenic and does not trigger malignant hyperthermia* Neuroprotective and cardioprotective0* Emergence from xenon anesthesia is faster* Xenon is more potent than nitrous oxide with MAC 71%* It is a good analgesic* Blood-gas solubility coefficient of less than one third of N2O, there is still the potential of diffusion hypoxia during recovery.* Lower blood gas coefficient of Xenon results in rapid induction and recovery* It provides good hemodynamic stability with little change in blood pressure.* It inhibits calcium pump in plasma membrane0 and NMDA receptor in dorsal bom neuron.Advantages of Xenon AnesthesiaDisadvantages of Xenon Anesthesia* Inert, non-explosive, environment friendly* Low blood solubility* Not metabolized in the body* Rapid induction and recovery* Eliminated via lungs (can be used in renal and hepatic failure)* Does not trigger malignant hyperthermia* High cost* Less potent* No commercially available anesthesia equipment",C
Which of the following local anaesthetic causes methemoglobinemia?,Procaine,Prilocaine,Etidocaine,Ropivacaine,"Prilocaine similar to that of lidocaine. The primary differences are that it causes little vasodilation and thus can be used without a vasoconstrictor, and its increased volume of distribution reduces its CNS toxicity, making it suitable for intravenous regional blocks. The drug is unique among the local anesthetics in its propensity to cause methemoglobinemia. This effect is a consequence of the metabolism of the aromatic ring to o-toluidine. Development of methemoglobinemia is dependent on the total dose administered, usually appearing after a dose of 8 mg/kg. Ref: Catterall W.A., Mackie K. (2011). Chapter 20. Local Anesthetics. In L.L.

Local anaesthetic injected directly into the tissue -,Infiltration anaesthesia,Nerve block,Field block,Bier's block,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Infiltration anaesthesia Infiltration anaesthesiao It is the injection of local anaesthetic directly into tissue without taking into consideration the course of cutaneous nerve.o It can be so superficial as to include only the skin, it also can include deeper structureso It is used for minor surgeries, e.g. incision & drainage, suturing etc.o Adrenaline can be used along with LA to prolong its duration of action and to prevent its systemic absorptiono However adrenaline containing solution should not be used into tissues supplied by endarteries, e.g. in fingers and toes, ear, nose, and penis because vasoconstriction may lead to gangrene.Conduction blockA. Field blocko Is produced by subcutaneous injection of a solution of local anaesthetic in order to anaesthetize the region distal to the injection.o For example, subcutaneous infiltration of the proximal portion of the volar surface of the forearm results in extensive area of cutaneous anaesthesia that starts 2 to 3 cm distal to the site of injection.B. Nerve blocko LA is injected around a peripheral nerve or a plexus. Examples are -Upper limb - brachial plexus and wrist blockHead & Neck - Stellate ganglion block, trigeminal nerve block.Thorax & abdomen - Interc4ostal nerve & celiac plexuso Note - Most common complication of brachial plexus block is pneumothorax.",A

Which type of breast cancer is most likely to be bilateral,Infiltrating duct carcinoma,Paget's disease of breast,Lobular carcinoma of breast,Medullary carcinoma of braest,"Current nomenclature of Carcinoma Breast Ductal carcinoma is the most common variant with lobular carcinoma occurring in up to 15% of cases. There are subtypes of lobular cancer, including the classical type, that carry a better prognosis than the pleomorphic type. Occasionally, the picture may be mixed with both ductal and lobular features. There are different patterns of spread depending on histological type. If there is doubt whether a tumour is predominantly lobular in type, immunohistochemical analysis using the e-cadherin antibody, which reacts positively in lobular cancer, will help in diagnosis. Rarer histological variants, usually carrying a better prognosis, include colloid or mucinous carcinoma, whose cells produce abundant mucin, medullary carcinoma, with solid sheets of large cells often associated with a marked lymphocytic reaction and tubular carcinoma. Invasive lobular carcinoma is commonly multifocal and/or bilateral, hence the increasing use of MRI for assessment. Cases detected the screening programme are often smaller and better differentiated than those presenting to the symptomatic service and are of a special type.

Although the cause is unknown, alcohol, tobacco, and dietary factors have been implicated as causative agents. A high incidence is reported in patients with corrosive esophagitis. The malignant tumors arising in the esophagus are usually squamous cell carcinomas except those involving the esophagogastric junction, which are usually adenocarcinomas. Even though squamous cell carcinomas are weakly radiosensitive, surgical extirpation affords reasonable, if short-term, palliation. Some authorities recommend radiotherapy for palliation alone or in combination with surgery to treat this lesion. Adenocarcinomas are not particularly radiosensitive and surgical treatment is generally employed. Following resection for esophageal carcinoma among the highly select group of patients whose tumors are still resectable when the diagnosis is made, survival is only about 14% at 5 years.

These functions include blood pressure, hea rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. Causes Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes. Autonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the hea, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils. Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with: Alcohol abuse Diabetes (diabetic neuropathy) Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves Guillain Barre syndrome or other diseases that inflame nerves HIV/AIDS Inherited nerve disorders Multiple sclerosis Parkinson disease Spinal cord injury Surgery or injury involving the nerves Symptoms Signs and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy depend on the nerves affected. They might include: Dizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure (ohostatic hypeension). Urinary problems, such as difficulty staing urination, incontinence, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder, which can lead to urinary tract infections. Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems in men. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heaburn, all due to changes in digestive function. Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.

Gender can affect the block height theoretically. The density of CSF is lower in women compared with men. Although this may affect relative baricity of local anesthetics, the clinical variation in the spread is probably unimpoant. Hence this is the best answer to choose from the above options. Other Options : Age: Higher anesthetic levels are achieved in the elderly for a given dosage of spinal anesthetic. Age-related decreases in CSF volume and the higher sensitivity of the nerve roots to local anesthetic are the possible reasons. Pregnancy: Increased intraabdominal pressure or conditions that cause engorgement of the epidural veins, decrease CSF volume and thus increase block height. This includes conditions such as pregnancy, ascites, and large abdominal tumors. Height: Within the range of 'normal-sized' adults, patient height does not seem to affect the spread of spinal anesthesia. But extremes of height can affect the block height.",C

Emergency management for Tension pneumothorax is: September 2005,Thoracotomy,Inseion of a chest tube,Needle decompression,Tracheostomy,"Ans. C: Needle decompression Management of tension pneumothorax: Immediately place the patient on 100% oxygen. Perform emergency needle decompression without hesitation The basic principle or emergent needle decompression is to introduce a catheter into the pleural space, thus producing a pathway for the air to escape and relieving the built-up pressure. Although this procedure is not the definitive treatment for tension pneumothorax, emergent needle decompression does arrest its progression and serves to restore cardiopulmonary function slightly. Tube thoracostomy is the definitive treatment for tension pneumothorax, and needle decompression mandates an immediate follow up with a tube thoracostomy.",C
Oschner sherren regime is used in the management of-,Appendicular abscess,Chronic appendicitis,Appendicular mass,Acute appendicitis,"If an appendix mass is present and the condition of the patient is satisfactory, the standard treatment is the conservative Ochsner—Sherren regimen. This strategy is used as the inflammatory process is already localized and that inadvertent surgery is difficult and may be dangerous. It may be impossible to find the appendix and, occasionally, a faecal fistula may form. For these reasons, it is wise to observe a non-operative programme but to be prepared to operate should clinical deterioration occur.

Which of the following anesthetic is safe in hea failure,Etomidate,Propofol,Thiopentone,Ketamine,"Etomidate has proven useful in patients with valvular or ischemic hea disease who are undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures and in patients with poor cardiac function. The hemodynamic stability seen with etomidate is caused by its lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on the function of the baroreceptor. In multiple studies, etomidate has been used for induction in patients with a compromised cardiovascular system who are undergoing coronary aery bypass surgery or valve surgery, as well as in patients requiring induction of general anesthesia for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, aoic aneurysm repair, and thoracic surgery. For cardioversion, the rapid onset, quick recovery, and maintenance of aerial blood pressure in these sometimes hemodynamically tenuous patients, combined with continued spontaneous respiration, make etomidate an acceptable choice.

Most common complication of pseudocyst of pancreas,Rupture into peritoneum,Haemorrhage,Infection,Rupture into colon,"PSEUDOCYST A pseudocyst is a collection of amylase-rich fluid enclosed in a well-defined wall of fibrous or granulation tissue. Pseudocysts typically arise following an attack of mild acute pancreatitis, lie outside the pancreas, and represent an APFC that has not resolved and matured. Formation of a pseudocyst requires 4 weeks or more from the onset of acute pancreatitis. The Term 'pseudocyst' is often used more loosely, to include sterile WON that has failed to resolve, or a collection that has developed in the context of chronic pancreatitis or after pancreatic trauma. If carefully investigated, more than half of these will be found to have a communication with the main pancreatic duct. Pseudocysts are often single but, occasionally, patients will develop multiple pseudocysts. A pseudocyst is usually identified on ultrasound or a CT scan. It is impoant to differentiate a pseudocyst from an APFC; the clinical scenario and the radiological appearances should allow that distinction to be made. Occasionally, a cystic neoplasm may be confused with a chronic pseudocyst. EUS and aspiration of the cyst fluid is very useful in such a situation. The fluid should be sent for measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, amylase levels and cytology. Fluid from a pseudocyst typically has a low CEA level, and levels above 400 ng/mL are suggestive of a mucinous neoplasm. Pseudocyst fluid usually has a high amylase level, but that is not diagnostic, as a tumour that communicates with the duct system may yield similar findings. Cytology typically reveals inflammatory cells in pseudocyst fluid. If there is no access to EUS, then percutaneous FNA is acceptable (just aspiration, not percutaneous inseion of a drain). ERCP and MRCP may demonstrate communication of the cyst with the pancreatic duct system, demonstrate ductal anomalies, or diagnose chronic pancreatitis and thus help in planning treatment. Pseudocysts will resolve spontaneously in most instances, but complications can develop. Pseudocysts that are thick-walled or large (over 6 cm in diameter), have lasted for a long time (over 12 weeks), or have arisen in the context of chronic pancreatitis are less likely to resolve spontaneously,but these factors are not specific indications for intervention. Therapeutic interventions are advised only if the pseudocyst causes symptoms, if complications develop, or if a distinction has to be made between a pseudocyst and a tumour. There are three possible approaches to draining a pseudocyst: percutaneous, endoscopic and surgical. Percutaneous drainage to the exterior under radiological guidance should be avoided. It carries a very high likelihood of recurrence. More over, it is not advisable unless one is absolutely ceain that the cyst is not neoplastic and that it has no communication with the pancreatic duct (or else a pancreaticocutaneous fistula will develop). A percutaneous transgastric cystgastrostomy can be done under imaging guidance, and a double-pigtail drain placed with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. This requires specialist expeise but, in experienced hands, the recurrence rates are no more than 15%. Endoscopic drainage usually involves puncture of the cyst through the stomach or duodenal wall under EUS guidance, and placement of a tube drain with one end in the cyst cavity and the other end in the gastric lumen. The success rates depend on operator expeise. Occasionally, ERCP and placement of a pancreatic stent across the ampulla may help to drain a pseudocyst that is in communication with the duct. Surgical drainage involves internally draining the cyst into the gastric or jejunal lumen. Recurrence rates should be no more than 5%, and this still remains the standard against which the evolving radiological and endoscopic approaches are measured. The approach is conventionally through an open incision, but laparoscopic cystgastrostomy is also feasible. Pseudocysts that have developed complications are best managed surgically. There is a small group of patients who, having suffered an attack of necrotising pancreatitis with duct disruption, go on to suffer repeated complications in the form of recurrent fluid collections, pseudocysts, pleural effusions or pancreatic ascites. Very often disruption of the main pancreatic duct in the neck, body or tail is compounded by a stricture or a stone in the head that cannot be treated endoscopically. In such patients, some form of surgical resection and/or a drainage procedure even though it may be technically challenging may be the only way to achieve lasting resolution.

Perforation complicates duodenal ulcer about half as often as bleeding and most perforated ulcers are on the anterior surface of the duodenum. The patient population tends to be elderly (mean age 60-70), chronically, ill patients often (40-50%) taking ulcerogenic medication. Helicobacter pylori is implicated in 70-92% of all perforated duodenal ulcers even if those secondary to Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs are included. The second most common cause of perforated duodenal ulcer is the ingestion of Non-Steroidal Antiinflammatory drugs. The traditional management of a perforated duodenal ulcer has been a Graham Omental Patch and a thorough abdominal lavage.",C

The treatment of choice is:",I/V methylprednisolone,I/V immunoglobulin,I/V anti-thymocyte globulin,Oral cycIosporin and prednisolone,"The boy is suffering from Guillain-Barre syndrome, which is a postinfectious polyneuropathy that causes demyelination in mainly motor but sometimes also sensory nerves. The main clues for diagnosis are areflexic paralysis with alburnino-cytologic dissociation in CSF. The paralysis usually follows a nonspecific viral infection by about 10 days. Weakness begins usually in the lower extremities and progressively involves the trunk, the upper limbs, and finally the bulbar muscles, a pattern formerly known as Landry ascending paralysis. Tendon reflexes are lost, usually early in the course. Rapidly progressive ascending paralysis is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), administered for 2, 3, or 5 days.

Osteomyelitis first occurs in :-,Metaphysis,Epiphysis,Diaphysis,All of above,Ans. (a) MetaphysisRef.: Bailey & Love 26th edJ54l* The most common site is the rapidly growing and highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. The apparent slowing or sludging of blood flow as the vessels make sharp angles at the distal metaphysic predisposes the vessels to thrombosis and the bone itself to localized necrosis and bacterial seeding.* Vertebral osteomyelitis at any age is most often a secondary complication of a remote infection with hematogenous seeding.* Direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery.,A
Levo-bupivacaine is administered by which of the following route:,Nasogastric,Epidural,Intravenous,All,"B i.e. (Epidural) Bupivacaine is a potent cardiotoxic and long acting (duration of action 120-240 min) amide linked local anestheticQ. It is used for infiltration, nerve block, epidural and spinal anaesthesia of long duration. Epidural anaesthesia using bupivaine is very popular. Bupivacaine is drug of choice for labour analgesia. Bupivacaine is prone to prolong QTc interval and induce ventricular tachycardia or cardiac depression. So bupivacaine is contraindicated in IV regional anaesthesia. Maximum tolerable dose is 175 mg without epinephrine and 225mg with epinephrine. Commercial bupivacaine is a racemic mixture of 'R' & 'S' isomer. Levo bupivacine being 'S' isomer has less potential for toxicity and is as effective as racemic one. Bupivacaine is most potent & best agent for isobaric spinal anesthesia but cannot be used as surface (topical) anesthetic agent.Q Bupivacaine is contraindicated in regional IV anesthesia d/t fear of cardiac arrhythmiaQ. It can be used by following routes- IntrathecalQ - EpiduralQ - Peripheral nerve block All local anesthetics (LAs) bind & inhibit cardiac Na channels, but bupivacaine binds more avidly & longer than lignocaine. The bupivacaine R (+) isomer binds cardiac Na channels more avidly than S (-) isomer. This finding lead to development of levobupivacaine & ropivacaine. Inhibition of epinephrine - Stimulated CAMP formation by LAs could explain the refractoriness of bupivacaine cardiovascular toxicity to standard resuscitation measures. Programmed electrical stimulation elicit more arrythmias with bupivacaine & levobupivacaine then with lidocaine or ropivacaine. Bupivacaine is most cardiotoxic local anaesthetic, so it should not be used for Beir's block.Q It's cardiotoxicity is enhanced in pregnancy. Intravenous bupivacaine and etidocaine may cause severe cardiac reactions which are A.V. hea block Dysarythmias e.g. ventricular fibrillation. - Circulatory collapse & primary cardiac failure (bradycardia, pallor, sweating & hypotension) Amiodarone (drug of choice)Q and Bretylium is used to treat bupivacaine induced ventricular tachycardias.

French osteotomy is used in treatment of ?,Cubitus varus,Cubitus valgus,Coxa vara,Coxa valga,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Cubitus varus Cubitus yarns Cubitus varus, also known as a 'gunstock deformity', is the most common complication of supracondylar fracture humerus, due to malunion. It is called gunstock because the deformity resembles a rifle gunstock. The three static deformities of cubitus varus are (all with respect to distal fragment):-i) Extension, ii) Medial rotation, iii) Varus (corona! tilt). All these three components should be corrected during the initial reduction of the fracture otherwise cubitus varus deformity results. Treatment of cubitus varus Cubitus varus is only a cosmatic deformity with no functional impairment of the elbow. Treatment of choice is corrective supracondylar osteotomy.

Universal precautions to be observed by surgeons for the prevention of hospital acquired HIV infection include the following except,Wearing gloves and other barrier precaution,Washing hands on contamination,Handling sharp instruments with care,Preoperative screening of all patients for HIV,"Universal  precautions have been drawn up by the CDC in the United States and largely adopted by the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK (in summary):

Use of a full face mask ideally, or protective spectacles;
Use of fully waterproof, disposable gowns and drapes, particularly during seroconversion;
Boots to be worn, not clogs, to avoid injury from dropped sharps;
Double gloving needed (a larger size on the inside is more comfortable);
Allow only essential personnel in theatre;
Avoid unnecessary movement in theatre;
Respect is required for sharps, with passage in a kidney dish;
A slow  meticulous  operative  technique  is  needed  with minimised bleeding.

Key Concept:
Universal precautions do not include the preoperative screening of patients for HIV.

Most likely etiology is:",Renovascular disease,Thrombotic renal disease,. Multiple myeloma,SLE,"Multiple myeloma Multiple myeloma is the most likely etiology. The combination of hypercalcemia and acute renal failure raises the possibility of multiple myeloma as the bone breakdown secondary to tumor involvement releases large amounts of calcium to the extracellular fluid and hypercalcemia ensues. The renal failure in myeloma is primarily related to hypercalcemia combined with proteinaceous cast formation within the renal tubules, producing a form of intratubu- lar obstruction as well as a tubular inflammatory lesion. The major diagnostic clue is the finding of dipstick mildly positive urine with a sulfosalicylic acid strongly positive urine. Dipstick testing does not detect the negatively charged light-chain proteins, only the alburnin. Renovascular lesions and thrombotic renal disease could present with this picture, although they should not be asso- ciated with hypercalcemia and severe back pain, and findings upon examination of the urine would not include proteins.

Pneumothorax is seen most commonly with which approach of brachial block:-,Interscalene,Supraclavicular,Infraclavicular,Axillary,"In supraclavicular approach of brachial block as pleura is in close vicinity. The anterior rami of C5 to T1 form the brachial plexus, which exits the cervical spine to form the superior, middle, and inferior trunks that travel between the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Each trunk divides into an anterior and posterior branch, which subsequently rejoins to form the lateral, posterior, and medial cords as it travels distally to the clavicle. The supraclavicular approach blocks the brachial plexus from the distal trunks to the proximal cords but often is targeted at the divisions level. General complications to peripheral nerve blockade apply to supraclavicular blocks including risk for infection, bleeding, and neuropathy. With the advent of ultrasonography, constant visualization of the needle tip, first rib, and pleura can decrease the risk for pneumothorax.

Regarding pectus excavatum all are true except ?,Gross CVS dysfunction,Decrease in lung capacity,Cosmetic deformity,Depression in chest,"Answer is 'a' i.e. Gross CVS dysfunction Pectus Excavatum Also called funnel chest' is the most common chest wall deformity. Males are affected more than females (4:1). Pectus excavatum arises from imbalanced or excessive growth of the lower costal cailages. Typically the defect is diagnosed within the first yr of life and worsens over time. Depression may range from mildly depressed sternum to sternal depression abutting the veebral column with displacements of mediastinal structures. Other conditions associated with Pectus Excavatum: Scoliosis Marfan's syndrome Mitral valve prolapse Congenital hea diseases - Asthma Majority of pateints are asymptomatic. Some subjects repo a decrease in respiratory reserve and pain along the costal cailages with exercise. Pulmonary function testing may show restrictive pattern of pulmonary abnormality. CVS dysfunction is very rare and mild if ever seen. Main indication for tit is cosmetic. The surgical correction of a pectus excavatum is not done before the age of 5 years because a severe, postoperative restrictive chest wall deformity may result.

Excretory Urography (IVU or IVP) - Campbell 11th edition P1151 Historically, excretory urography was the most commonly used modality to evaluate genitourinary injuries. Largely replaced by CT, a limited role includes the intra-operative 'sigle-shot' IVP. The indications are uncommon, but when the surgeon encounters an unexpected retroperitoneal hematoma surrounding a kidney during abdominal exploration, the study can provide essential information. The main purpose of the one-shot IVP is to assess the presence of a functioning contralateral kidney and to radiologically stage the injured side. If findings are not normal or near normal , the kidney should be explored to complete the staging of the injury and reconstruct any abnormality found In the given problem, patient is having a non-pulsatile hematoma, which is not an indication for surgical exploration. On table IVU was done to see the functionn of contralateral kidney, the function of opposite kidney should be aseained before planning nephrectomy in any trauma patient.

Thickened peripheral nerves are seen in all the following conditions except,Hansen's neuropathy,Amyloid polyneuropathy,Diabetic neuropathy,Refsum's disease,"Diabetic neuropathy is due to conversion of sugar to sorbitol which causes nerve demyelination; neuropathy is distal, diffuse with a stocking distribution; it takes around 10 years to develop diabetic neuropathy. Glucose forms sorbitol by aldose reductase enzyme and galactose forms galactitol. If sorbitol level raises it gets trapped in peripheral nerves, retina and lens causing neuropathy, cataract and retinopathy. There may be formation of abnormal aeriovenous communications under the skin leads into nerve ischaemia and neuropathy. Sensory neuropathy causes loss of vibration sense, sense of position, touch, pain and temperature. Sensation may be absent in the entire sole due to medial and plantar nerve involvement. Foot feels like dead with like walking in the sand and prone for minor repeated traumas which are not noticed by the patient. Motor neuropathy causes paralysis of intrinsic muscles of foot leading into claw toes and hammer toe. Longitudinal arch of the foot becomes flat causing loss of foot curvature; loss of joint position and Loss of foot muscle strength leads into altered gait and positions of foot leading into the deep seated trophic ulcers over the heads of the metatarsals. Autonomic neuropathy causes absence of sweating and loss of skin elasticity making more prone for breakdown and infection. Autosympathectomy is common in diabetics involving foot area.

Which of the following causes orchitis without epididymitis: March 2009,Syphilis,TB,Gonorrhoea,Chlamvdia trachomatis,"Ans. A: Syphilis In most cases of acute orchitis, the testicle is inflamed due to the spread of a bacterial infection from the epididymis, and therefore 'epididymo-orchitits' is the correct term. Acute epididymo-orchitis is usually a primary bacterial or rarely a tuberculous infection of the epididymis that has spread to the testicle to involve both structures. Rarely, it can sta in the testicle and spread to the epididymis. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease causing acute epididymitis, though gonococcal is still prevalent. TB epididymitis should be considered when the vas is thickened and there is little response to the ususal antibiotics.

Milroys disease is,Edema due to filariasis,Post cellulitic lymphedema,Congenital lymphedema,Lymphedema following trauma,"PRIMARY LYMPHOEDEMA Aetiology It has been proposed that all cases of primary lymphoedema are due to an inherited abnormality of the lymphatic system, sometimes termed 'congenital lymphatic dysplasia'. Genetic susceptibility Primary lymphoedema can be familial or sporadic. In familial cases the genetic mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant, recessive or x-linked pattern. In the last few years the application of Next Generation Sequencing, which allows identification of genetic mutations, even in sporadic cases and smaller families, has increased our understanding of the genetic basis of lymphoedema. So far, mutations in more than 20 genes have been linked to the development of primary lymphoedema. In individuals with familial mutations the penetrance of lymphoedema can often be incomplete leading to a large variability in clinical presentation. Involvement of other systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, digestive) is common and can indicate a specific mutation. Presence of isolated lower limb lymphedema at bih, classically described as Milroy's disease, suggests mutation in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4)/ vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) or VEGF-C. In these patients, reduced initial uptake and presence of touous lymphatic tracts with evidence of rerouting in lymphangiography suggests mutation in the VEGF-C gene. lymphoedema can also be present as a minor sign in some well-recognised syndromes. Primary lymphoedema is present in less than 10% of cases of tuberous sclerosis (TSC1 and 2 gene mutations). Lymphoedema has been repoed in patients with Noonan syndrome in the presence of PTPN11, SOS1 or KRAS mutations, and in patients with Turner syndrome (monosomy X) and capillary malformation-aeriovenous malformation syndrome (RAS p21 protein activator 1 (RASA1) mutation).

(Bailey 25th edn Pg: 986)* Burst abdomen occurs mostly between the 7th and 10th day after operation (but may occur anytime after surgery from 1 to more than 20 days) (ref: Sabiston 18/e)* The disruption of the wound tends to occur a few days beforehand when the sutures apposing the deep layers (peritoneum, posterior rectus sheath) tear through or even become untied.Factors associated with burst abdomen (abdominal dehiscence)a) Suture material:* Chromic catgut is associated with high incidence of burst abdomen as it gets absorbed very quickly (in 8-9 days). An ideal suture material for abdominal closure should neither disappear nor lose its tensile strength until the wound has regained near-normal tensile strength.* Nonabsorbable, monofilament materials are found to be good.b) Method of closure* Single layer closure has lower incidence than multilayer closure* Interrupted suture is better than continuous suturec) Drainage* Drainage directly through the wound leads to a higher incidence of burst than employing drainage through a separate (stab) incision.d) Incision* Midline & vertical incisions are more prone to burst than transverse incisionse) Reason for initial operation* Deep wound infection is prone to cause burst abdomen* Operations on pancreas with leakage of enzymes favours dehiscencef) Wound complication* Hematoma, infectiong) Increased intraabdominal pressure* Ascites, distended bowel, coughing, vomitingh) General condition of the patient* Obesity, jaundice, malignant disease, hypoproteinemia and anemia predispose burst abdomen.",B

The best cosmetic results for large capillary (po wine) hemangiomas are achieved by -,Excision and split-thickness skin,Laser ablation,Cryosurgery,Tattooing,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Laser ablation Pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy is considered the standard of care for the treatment of capillary malformations. It is based on the concept of selective photothermolysis.. The beam is selectively absorbed by red- pigmented material such as hemoglobin in the blood vessels of the lesion. This produces selective heat destruction of capillary vessel walls with minimal damage to the overlying epidermis, which leads to lightening of the po wine stain without scarring. 'The best treatment to date for early and intermediate po wine stains is with the pulsed dye laser. The method of treatment is termed selective photothermolysis. The beam is selectively absorbed by red- pigmented material such as hemoglobin in the blood vessels of the lesion. This produces selective heat destruction of these structures, and the treated area becomes whiter.'- CSDT 13/e Capillary malformations (po wine stains or nevus flanuneus) Capillary malformations (po wine stains or nevus flammeus) are low-flow vascular malformations of dermal capillaries and postcapillary venules.
